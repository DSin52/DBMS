Non-commutative supersymmetric Yang-Mills with rational Theta is dual to anordinary supersymmetric Yang-Mills with a 't Hooft flux. It is believed thatthe simplest description is via the ordinary supersymmetric Yang-Mills. Weclaim, however, that the two descriptions form a hierarchy. The SYM descriptionis the proper description in the ultra violet while the non-commutativedescription takes over in the infra red.
