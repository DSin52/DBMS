Title: On the structure of exact effective action for N=1 supersymmetric

theoriesAuthors: K.Stepanyantz

Comments: 12 pages, LATEX, no figures

We discuss the ways of constructing the exact superpotential for N=1supersymmetric theories and propose a new approach. As a consequence, a newstructure of the superpotential is found.
