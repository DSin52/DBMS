It is shown that the vacuum of QED$_2$ in Minkowski spacetime does not favoura periodic electric mean field. The projected effective action exhibiting agenuine dependence on the non-vanishing background field has been introduced.The functional dependence of the energy density of the vacuum on the assumedperiodic vacuum expectation value of the vector potential is determined fromthe component $T^{00}$ of the energy-momentum tensor at one-loop order.Treating the background field non-perturbatively, the energy of the vacuum inthe presence of a periodic mean field is found not be equal to the negative ofthe effective action.
