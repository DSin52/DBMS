We present a manifestly Lorentz- and SO(2)-Duality-invariant local QuantumField Theory of electric charges, Dirac magnetic monopoles and dyons. Themanifest invariances are achieved by means of the PST-mechanism. The dynamicsfor classical point particles is described by an action functional living on acircle, if the Dirac-Schwinger quantization condition for electric and magneticcharges holds. The inconsistent classical field theory depends on an arbitrary,but fixed, external vector field, a generalization of the Dirac-string.Nevertheless, the Quantum Field Theory, obtained from this classical action viaa functional integral approach, turns out to be independent of the particularvector field chosen, and thus consistent, if the Dirac-Schwinger quantizationcondition holds. We provide explicit expressions for the generating functionalsof observables, proving that they are Dirac-string independent. SinceLorentz-invariance is manifest at each step, the quantum theory admits also amanifestly diffeomorphism invariant coupling to external gravity. Relationswith previous formulations, and with SO(2)--non invariant theories areclarified.
