It is shown how $W$-algebras emerge from very peculiar canonicaltransformations with respect to the canonical symplectic structure on a compactRiemann surface. The action of smooth diffeomorphisms of the cotangent bundleon suitable generating functions is written in the BRS framework while a$W$-symmetry is exhibited. Subsequently, the complex structure of the symmetryspaces is studied and the related BRS properties are discussed. The specificexample of the so-called $W_3$-algebra is treated in relation to some otherdifferent approaches.
