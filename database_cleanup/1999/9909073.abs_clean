We consider instanton contributions to chiral correlators, such as <0| Tr\lambda^2 (x) Tr \lambda^2(x') |0>, in N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theorywith either light adjoint or fundamental matter. Within the former model,extraction of the gluino condensate from a connected 1-instanton diagram,evaluated at strong coupling, can be contrasted with expectations from theSeiberg-Witten solution perturbed to an N=1 vacuum. We observe a numericaldiscrepancy, coinciding with that observed previously in N=1 SQCD. Moreover,since knowledge of the vacuum structure is complete for softly broken N=2Yang-Mills, this model serves as a counterexample to the hypothesis of Amati etal. that 1-instanton calculations at strong coupling can be interpreted asaveraging over vacua. Within N=1 SQCD, we point out that the connectedcontribution to the relevant correlators actually vanishes in the weaklycoupled Higgs phase, despite having a nonzero value through infra-red effectswhen calculated in the unbroken phase.
