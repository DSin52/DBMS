Using a superfield formulation of extended phase space, we propose a new formof the Hamiltonian action functional. A remarkable feature of this constructionis that it directly leads to the BV master action on phase space. Conversely,superspace can be used to construct nilpotent BRST charges directly fromsolutions to the classical Lagrangian Master Equation. We comment on therelation between these constructions and the specific master action proposal ofAlexandrov, Kontsevich, Schwarz and Zaboronsky.
