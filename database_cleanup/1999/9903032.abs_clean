Title: Spinning Particle as a Non-trivial Rotating Super Black Hole with Broken

N=2 SupersymmetryComments: 28 pages, LaTeX, invited talk at the Second International Symposium

on Frontiers of Fundamental Physics (Hyderabad, December 30, 1998 - January1, 1999). In this version the Introduction and Conclusion are extended, andone new section is added containing the self-consistent super-Kerr-Newmansolutions to broken N=2 supergravityJournal-ref: Class.Quant.Grav. 16 (1999) 3457-3516

Non-trivial supergeneralization of the Kerr-Newman solution is considered asrepresenting a combined model of the Kerr-Newman spinning particle andsuperparticle.We show that the old problem of obtaining non-trivial super black holesolutions can be resolved in supergravity broken by Goldstone fermion.Non-linear realization of broken N=2 supersymmetry specific for the Kerrgeometry is considered and some examples of the super-Kerr geometries generatedby Goldstone fermion are analyzed. The resulting geometries acquire torsion,Rarita-Schwinger field and extra wave contributions to metric andelectromagnetic field caused by Grassmann variables.One family of the self-consistent super-Kerr-Newman solutions to broken N=2supergravity is selected, and peculiarities of these solutions are discussed.In particular, the appearance of extra `axial' singular line and travelingwaves concentrated near `axial' and ring-like singularities.
