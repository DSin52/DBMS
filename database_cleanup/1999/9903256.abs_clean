Journal-ref: Fortsch.Phys. 48 (2000) 9-14

We outline the construction of the Atiyah-Hitchin metric on the moduli spaceof SU(2) BPS monopoles with charge 2, first as an algebraic curve in C^3following Donaldson and then as a solution of the Toda field equations in thecontinual large N limit. We adopt twistor methods to solve the underlyinguniformization problem, which by the generalized Legendre transformation yieldthe Kahler coordinates and the Kahler potential of the metric. We also commenton the connection between twistors and the Seiberg-Witten construction ofquantum moduli spaces, as they arise in three dimensional supersymmetric gaugetheories, and briefly address the uniformization of algebraic curves in C^3 inthe context of large N Toda theory. (Based on talks delivered in September 1998at the 32nd International Symposium Ahrenshoop on the Theory of ElementaryParticles, Buckow; the 21st Triangular Meeting on Quantum Field Theory, Creteand the TMR meeting on Quantum Aspects of Gauge Theories, Supersymmetry andUnification, Corfu; to be published in the proceedings in Fortschritte derPhysik.)
