A general theory of permutation orbifolds is developed for arbitrary twistgroups. Explicit expressions for the number of primaries, the partitionfunction, the genus one characters, the matrix elements of modulartransformations and for fusion rule coefficients are presented, together withthe relevant mathematical concepts, such as Lambda-matrices and twisteddimensions. The arithmetic restrictions implied by the theory for the allowedmodular representations in CFT are discussed. The simplest nonabelian examplewith twist group S_3 is described to illustrate the general theory.
