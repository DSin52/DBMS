We investigate various properties of classical configurations of theBorn-Infeld theory in a uniform electric field. This system is involved withdynamics of (F,Dp) bound states, which are bound states of fundamental stringsand Dp-branes. The uniform electric field can be treated as a constraint on theasymptotic behavior of the fields on the brane. BPS configurations in thistheory correspond to fundamental strings attached to the (F,Dp) bound state,and are found to be stable due to force balance. Fluctuations around thesestable configurations are subject to appropriate Dirichlet and Neumann boundaryconditions which are identical with the ones deduced from the ordinaryworldsheet description of the attached string. Additionally, non-BPS solutionsare studied and related physics are discussed.
