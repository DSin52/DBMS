57-74The superfield models with the partial spontaneous breaking of the globalD=3, N=2 supersymmetry are discussed. The abelian gauge model describeslow-energy interactions of the real scalar field with the 3D vector and fermionfields. We introduce the new Goldstone-Maxwell representation of the 3D gaugesuperfield and show that the partial spontaneous breaking N=2 to N=1 ispossible for the non-minimal self-interaction of this modified gauge superfieldincluding the linear Fayet-Iliopoulos term. The dual description of the partialbreaking in the model of the self- interacting Goldstone chiral superfield isalso considered. These models have the constant vacuum solutions and describe,respectively, the interactions of the N=1 Goldstone multiplets of the D2-braneor supermembrane with the additional massive multiplets.
