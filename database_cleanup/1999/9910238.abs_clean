We establish a relation, conjectured recently by E. Witten, between thehypermultiplet moduli space in compactifications of the heterotic string on anA-D-E singularities, and the moduli spaces of three dimensional pure gaugetheories with the corresponding A-D-E gauge groups. It is possible to add abounded number of heterotic fivebranes sitting in the singularity, while (inleading order in $\alpha'$) keeping the heterotic string perturbative. Thecorresponding hypermultiplet moduli space is given by the moduli space of athree dimensional gauge theory with matter.
