We discuss the microscopic states of the extremal BTZ black holes. Degeneracyof the primary states corresponding to the extremal BTZ black holes in theboundary N=(4,4) SCFT is obtained by utilizing the elliptic genus and theunitary representation theory of N=4 SCA. The degeneracy is consistent with theBekenstein-Hawking entropy.
