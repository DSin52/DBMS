In this work we examine generalized Connes-Lott models on the two-sphere. TheHilbert space of the continuum spectral triple is taken as the space ofsections of a twisted spinor bundle, allowing for nontrivial topologicalstructure (magnetic monopoles). The finitely generated projective module overthe full algebra is also taken as topologically non-trivial, which is possibleover $S^2$. We also construct a real spectral triple enlarging this Hilbertspace to include "particle" and "anti-particle" fields.
