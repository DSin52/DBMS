Type IIB string theory expanded around D3 brane backgrounds describes thedynamics of D3 branes as solitonic objects. On the other hand, there is afundamental description of them via Polchinski's open strings with Dirichletboundary conditions. Since these two descriptions describe the dynamics of thesame objects, D3 branes, it is natural to believe that they are dual. Thereforeat this level, we have a string-string duality as opposed to a string-fieldtheory duality. Once we take the same limits in both descriptions, MaldacenaConjecture in its weaker form follows. We try to make this viewpoint preciseand study the implication of it for the stronger form of Maldacena Conjecture.
