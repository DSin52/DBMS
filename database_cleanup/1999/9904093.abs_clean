We consider scalar field theories in dimensions lower than four in thecontext of the Wegner-Houghton renormalization group equations (WHRG). Therenormalized trajectory makes a non-perturbative interpolation between theultraviolet and the infrared scaling regimes. Strong indication is found thatin two dimensions and below the models with polynomial interaction are alwaysnon-perturbative in the infrared scaling regime. Finally we check that theseresults do not depend on the regularization and we develop a lattice version ofthe WHRG in two dimensions.
