Starting with the curvature 2-form a recursive construction of totallyantisymmetrised 2p-forms is introduced, to which we refer as p-Riemann tensors.Contraction of indices permits a corresponding generalisation of the Riccitensor. Static, spherically symmetric ``$p$-Ricci flat'' Schwarzschild likemetrics are constructed in this context for d>2p+1, d being the spacetimedimension. The existence of de Sitter type solutions is pointed out. Our2p-forms vanish for $d<2p$ and the limiting cases d=2p and d=2p+1 exhibitspecial features which are discussed briefly. It is shown that for d=4p ourclass of solutions correspond to double-selfdual Riemann 2p-form (or p-Riemanntensor). Topological aspects of such generalised gravitational instantons andthose of associated (through spin connections) generalised Yang-Millsinstantons are briefly mentioned. The possibility of a study of surfacedeformations at the horizons of our class of ``p-black holes'' leading toVirasoro algebras with a p-dependent hierarchy of central charges is commentedon. Remarks in conclusion indicate directions for further study and situate ourformalism in a broader context.
