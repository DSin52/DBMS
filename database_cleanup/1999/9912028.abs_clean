We present what we believe is the minimal three-family $AdS/CFT$ modelcompactified on a nonabelian orbifold $S^{5}/(Q\times Z_{3})$. Nontrivialirreps of the discrete nonabelian group $Q\times Z_{3}$ are identified with the$4$ of $SU(4)$ $R$ symmetry to break all supersymmetries, and the scalarcontent of the model is sufficient to break the gauge symmetry to the standardmodel. According to the conformality hypothesis the progenitor $SU(4)^3 \timesSU(2)^{12}$ theory becomes conformally invariant at an infra-red fixed point ofthe renormalization group.
