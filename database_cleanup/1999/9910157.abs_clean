Without a gauge fixing, canonical variables for the light-front SU(2)gluodynamics are determined. The Gauss law is written in terms of the canonicalvariables. The system is qualified as a generalized dynamical system with firstclass constraints. Abeliazation is a specific feature of the formulation (mostof the canonical variables transform nontrivially only under the action of anAbelian subgroup of the gauge transformations). At finite volume, a discretespectrum of the light-front Hamiltonian $P_+$ is obtained in the sector ofvanishing $P_-$. We obtain, therefore, a quantized form of the classicalsolutions previously known as non-Abelian plane waves. Then, considering theinfinite volume limit, we find that the presence of the mass gap depends on theway the infinite volume limit is taken, which may suggest the presence ofdifferent ``phases'' of the infinite volume theory. We also check that theformulation obtained is in accord with the standard perturbation theory if thelatter is taken in the covariant gauges.
