We extend earlier ideas about the appearance of noncommutative geometry instring theory with a nonzero B-field. We identify a limit in which the entirestring dynamics is described by a minimally coupled (supersymmetric) gaugetheory on a noncommutative space, and discuss the corrections away from thislimit. Our analysis leads us to an equivalence between ordinary gauge fieldsand noncommutative gauge fields, which is realized by a change of variablesthat can be described explicitly. This change of variables is checked bycomparing the ordinary Dirac-Born-Infeld theory with its noncommutativecounterpart. We obtain a new perspective on noncommutative gauge theory on atorus, its T-duality, and Morita equivalence. We also discuss the D0/D4 system,the relation to M-theory in DLCQ, and a possible noncommutative version of thesix-dimensional (2,0) theory.
