We present a formulation of the coupling of vector multiplets to N=2supergravity which is symplectic covariant (and thus is not based on aprepotential) and uses superconformal tensor calculus. We do not start from anaction, but from the combination of the generalised Bianchi identities of thevector multiplets in superspace, a symplectic definition of special Kahlergeometry, and the supersymmetric partners of the corresponding constraints.These involve the breaking to super-Poincare symmetry, and lead to on-shellvector multiplets. This symplectic approach gives the framework to formulatevector multiplet couplings using a weaker defining constraint for specialKahler geometry, which is an extension of older definitions of special Kahlermanifolds for some cases with only one vector multiplet.
