The leading eikonal S-matrix for three graviton scattering in d=11supergravity and Matrix Theory are shown to precisely agree. The result unifiesthe source-probe plus recoil approach of Okawa and Yoneya and relaxes therestriction imposed by those authors that all D-particle impact parameters andvelocities are mutually perpendicular. Furthermore, the unified S-matrixapproach facilitates a clean-cut study of M-theoretic R^4 curvature correctionsto the low energy supergravity effective action. In particular, the leading R^4correction to the three graviton S-matrix is computed and compared to thecorresponding next to leading order two loop U(3) amplitude in Matrix Theory.We find a clear disagreement of the two resulting tensor structures.
