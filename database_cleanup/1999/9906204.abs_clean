We examine how a d-dimensional mass hierarchy can be generated from ad+1-dimensional set up. We consider a d+1--dimensional scalar, the hierarchon,which has a potential as in gauged supergravities. We find that when it is inits minimum, there exist solutions of Horava-Witten topology R^d X S^1/Z^2 withdomain walls at the fixed points and anti-de Sitter geometry in the bulk. Weshow that while standard Poincare supergravity leads to power-law hierarchies,(e.g. a power law dependence of masses on the compactification scale), gaugedsupergravity produce an exponential hierarchy as recently proposed by Randalland Sundrum.
