A general calculational method is applied to investigate symmetry relationsamong divergent amplitudes in a free fermion model. A very traditional work onthis subject is revisited. A systematic study of one, two and three pointfunctions associated to scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and axial-vector densitiesis performed. The divergent content of the amplitudes are left in terms of fivebasic objects (external momentum independent). No specific assumptions about aregulator is adopted in the calculations. All ambiguities and symmetryviolating terms are shown to be associated with only three combinations of thebasic divergent objects. Our final results can be mapped in the correspondingDimensional Regularization calculations (in cases where this technique could beapplied) or in those of Gertsein and Jackiw which we will show in detail. Theresults emerging from our general approach allow us to extract, in a naturalway, a set of reasonable conditions (e.g. crucial for QED consistency) thatcould lead us to obtain all Ward Identities satisfied. Consequently, weconclude that the traditional approach used to justify the famous triangularanomalies in perturbative calculations could be questionable. An alternativepoint of view, dismissed of ambiguities, which lead to a correct description ofthe associated phenomenology, is pointed out.
