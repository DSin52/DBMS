We propose a new star pruduct which interpolates the Berezin and Moyalquantization. A multiple of this product is shown to reduce to a path-integralquantization in the continuous time limit. In flat space the action becomes theone of free bosonic strings. Relation to Kontsevich prescription is alsodiscussed.
