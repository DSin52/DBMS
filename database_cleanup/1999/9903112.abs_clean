It is shown that noncommutative geometry is a nonperturbative regulator whichcan manifestly preserve a space supersymmetry and a supergauge symmetry whilekeeping only a finite number of degrees of freedom in a theory. The simplestN=1 case of an U(1) supergauge theory on the sphere is worked out in detail.
