We use a recently proposed formulation of stable holomorphic vector bundles$V$ on elliptically fibered Calabi--Yau n-fold $Z_n$ in terms of toric geometry(V,Z_n)$ that identifies dual pairs of F-theory/heterotic duality we show howstability can be related to the existence of holomorphic sections of a certainline bundle that is part of the toric construction.
