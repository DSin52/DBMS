It has been proposed that gauge and Kaehler anomalies in four-dimensionaltype IIB orientifolds are cancelled by a generalized Green-Schwarz mechanisminvolving exchange of twisted RR-fields. We explain how this can be understoodusing the well-known duality between linear and chiral multiplets. We find thatall the twisted fields associated to the N=1 sectors and some of the fieldsassociated to the N=2 sectors reside in linear multiplets. But there are nolinear multiplets associated to order-two twists. Only the linear multipletscontribute to anomaly cancellation. This suffices to cancel all U(1) anomalies.In the case of Kaehler symmetries the complete SL(2,R) can be restored at thequantum level for all planes that are not fixed by an order-two twist.
