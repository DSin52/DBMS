We examine duality transformations of supersymmetric and $\kappa$-symmetricDp-brane actions in a general type II supergravity background where inparticular the dilaton and the axion are supposed to not be zero or a constantbut a general superfield. Due to non-constant dilaton and axion, we canexplicitly show that the dilaton and the axion as well as the two 2-form gaugepotentials transform as doublets under the $SL(2,R)$ transformation from thepoint of view of the world-volume field theory.
