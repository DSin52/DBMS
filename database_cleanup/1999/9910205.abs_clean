In order to study vertex operators for the Type IIB superstring on AdS space,we derive supersymmetric constraint equations for the vertex operators inAdS3xS3 backgrounds with Ramond-Ramond flux, using Berkovits-Vafa-Wittenvariables. These constraints are solved to compute the vertex operators andshow that they satisfy the linearized D=6, N=(2,0) equations of motion for asupergravity and tensor multiplet expanded around the AdS3xS3 spacetime.
