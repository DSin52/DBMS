Supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models are obtained from linear sigma modelsby imposing supersymmetric constraints. If we introduce auxiliary chiral andvector superfields, these constraints can be expressed by D-terms and F-termsdepending on the target manifolds. Auxiliary vector superfields appear as gaugefields without kinetic terms. If there are no D-term constraints, the targetmanifolds are always non-compact manifolds. When all the degrees of freedom inthese non-compact directions are eliminated by gauge symmetries, the targetmanifold becomes compact. All supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models, whosetarget manifolds are the hermitian symmetric spaces, are successfullyformulated as gauge theories.
