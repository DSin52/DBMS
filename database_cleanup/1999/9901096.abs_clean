The regularity of static axially symmetric solutions in SU(2)Yang-Mills-dilaton theory is examined. We show that the solutions obtainedpreviously within a singular Ansatz for the non-abelian gauge field can begauge transformed into a regular form. The local form of the gaugetransformation is given on the singular axis and at the origin.
