We study the SU(3)-invariant relevant deformation of D=4 N=4 SU(N) gaugetheory at large N using the AdS/CFT correspondence. At low energies, we obtaina nonsupersymmetric gauge theory with three left-handed quarks in the adjointof SU(N). In terms of the five dimensional gauged supergravity, there is anunstable critical point in the scalar potential for fluctuations of some fieldsin a nontrivial representation of the symmetry group SU(3). On the field theoryside, this corresponds to dynamical breaking of the SU(3) chiral symmetry downto SO(3). We compute the condensate of the quark bilinear and the two-pointcorrelation function of the spontaneously broken currents from supergravity andfind a nonzero `pion' decay constant, f_pi.
