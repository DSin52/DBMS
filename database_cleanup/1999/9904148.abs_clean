Using a boundary counterterm prescription motivated by the AdS/CFTconjecture, I evaluate the energy, entropy and angular momentum of the class ofKerr-NUT/bolt-AdS spacetimes. As in the non-rotating case, when the NUT chargeis nonzero the entropy is no longer equal to one-quarter of the area due to thepresence of the Misner string. When the cosmological constant is also non-zero,the entropy is bounded from above.
