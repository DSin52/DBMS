Title: Some Generalized BRS Transformations. II A Quantum Gravity Model

Authors: Paul Federbush (Univ. of Michigan)

Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX

Generalized BRS transformations such as introduced in Part I (hep-th/9906245)are applied to a model of quantum gravity. This development is technicallycomplex; but at the least should illustrate how much less rigid and moregeneral of application are the new BRS transformations.
