Dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the DLCQ method is investigated indetail using a chiral Yukawa model closely related to the Nambu-Jona-Lasiniomodel. By classically solving three constraints characteristic of thelight-front formalism, we show that the chiral transformation defined on thelight front is equivalent to the usual one when bare mass is absent. A quantumanalysis demonstrates that a nonperturbative mean-field solution to the``zero-mode constraint'' for a scalar boson (sigma) can develop a nonzerocondensate while a perturbative solution cannot. This description is due to ouridentification of the ``zero-mode constraint'' with the gap equation. Themean-field calculation clarifies unusual chiral transformation properties offermionic field, which resolves a seemingly inconsistency between triviality ofthe null-plane chiral charge Q_5|0>=0 and nonzero condensate. We also calculatemasses of scalar and pseudoscalar bosons for both symmetric and broken phases,and eventually derive the PCAC relation and nonconservation of Q_5 in thebroken phase.
