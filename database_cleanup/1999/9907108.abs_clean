We study the exchange diagrams in the computation of four-point functions ofall chiral primary operators in D=4, $\CN=4$ Super-Yang-Mills using AdS/CFTcorrespondence. We identify all supergravity fields that can be exchanged andcompute the cubic couplings. As a byproduct, we also rederive the normalizationof the quadratic action of the exchanged fields. The cubic couplings computedin this paper and the propagators studied extensively in the literature can beused to compute almost all the exchange diagrams explicitly. Some issues incomputing the complete four-point function in the massless sector is discussed.
