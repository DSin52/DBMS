The gauged WZNW model has been derived as an effective action, whose Poissonbracket algebra of the constraints is isomorphic to the commutator algebra ofoperators in quantized fermionic theory. As a consequence, the hamiltonian aswell as usual lagrangian non-abelian bosonization rules have been obtained, forthe chiral currents and for the chiral densities. The expression for theanomaly has been obtained as a function of the Schwinger term, using canonicalmethods.
