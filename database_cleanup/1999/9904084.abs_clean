edited by Valeri Dvoeglazov for Nova Science Publishers, New YorkWe look at and compare two different methods developed earlier for inducinggauge invariances in systems with second class constraints. These two methods,the Batalin-Fradkin method and the Gauge Unfixing method, are applied to anumber of systems. We find that the extra field introduced in theBatalin-Fradkin method can actually be found in the original phase spaceitself.
