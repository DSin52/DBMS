In M-theory on $S^1/Z_2$, we point out that to be consistant, we should keepthe scale, gauge couplings and soft terms at next order, and obtain the softthe standard embedding and $M_{1/2}=-A$ in the non-standard embedding with fivebranes and $K_{5,n}=0$. We construct a toy compactification model whichincludes higher order terms in 4-dimensional Lagrangian in standard embedding,and discuss its scale, gauge couplings, soft terms, and show that the higherorder terms do affect the scale, gauge couplings and especially the soft termsif the next order correction was not small. We also construct a toycompactification model in non-standard embedding with five branes and discussits phenomenology. We argue that one might not push the physical Calabi-Yaumanifold's volume to zero at any point along the eleventh dimension.
