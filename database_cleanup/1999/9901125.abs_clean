We study the higher-derivative extensions of the D=3 Abelian Chern--Simonstopological invariant that would appear in a perturbative effective action'smomentum expansion. The leading, third-derivative, extension I_ECS turns out tobe unique. It remains parity-odd but depends only on the field strength, henceno longer carries large gauge information, nor is it topological because metricdependence accompanies the additional covariant derivatives, whose positionsare seen to be fixed by gauge invariance. Viewed as an independent action,I_ECS requires the field strength to obey the wave equation. The moreinteresting model, adjoining I_ECS to the Maxwell action, describes a pair ofexcitations. One is massless, the other a massive ghost, as we exhibit both viathe propagator and by performing the Hamiltonian decomposition. We also presentthis model's total stress tensor and energy. Other actions involving I_ECS arealso noted.
