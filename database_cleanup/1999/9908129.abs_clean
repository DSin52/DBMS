We discuss the possibility that the electro-weak and strong interactionsarise as the low energy effective description of branes in M-theory. As a steptowards constructing such a model we show how one can naturally obtainSU(N_1)\times SU(N_2)\times U(1) gauge theories from branes, including matterin the bi-fundamental representation of SU(N_1)\times SU(N_2) which arefractionally charged under U(1).
