We give the Lax representations for for the elliptic, hyperbolic andhomogeneous second order Monge-Ampere equations. The connection between theseequations and the equations of hydrodynamical type give us a scalardispersionless Lax representation. A matrix dispersive Lax representationfollows from the correspondence between sigma models, a two parameter equationfor minimal surfaces and Monge-Ampere equations. Local as well nonlocalconserved densities are obtained.
