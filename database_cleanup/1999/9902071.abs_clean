Inflationary solutions are constructed in a specific five-dimensional modelwith boundaries motivated by heterotic M-theory. We concentrate on the casewhere the vacuum energy is provided by potentials on those boundaries. It ispointed out that the presence of such potentials necessarily excites bulkKaluza-Klein modes. We distinguish a linear and a non-linear regime for thosemodes. In the linear regime, inflation can be discussed in an effectivefour-dimensional theory in the conventional way. We lift a four-dimensionalinflating solution up to five dimensions where it represents an inflatingdomain wall pair. This shows explicitly the inhomogeneity in the fifthdimension. We also demonstrate the existence of inflating solutions withunconventional properties in the non-linear regime. Specifically, we findsolutions with and without an horizon between the two boundaries. Thesesolutions have certain problems associated with the stability of the additionaldimension and the persistence of initial excitations of the Kaluza-Klein modes.
