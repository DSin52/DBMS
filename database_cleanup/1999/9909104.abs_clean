The hidden E_{7} (E_{6}) structure has been conjectured for the minimal model${\cal M}_{4,5} ({\cal M}_{6,7}$) perturbed by $\Phi_{1,2}$ in the context ofconformal field theory(CFT). Motivated by this, we examine the dilute A_{4, 6}models, which are expected to be corresponding lattice models. Thermodynamicsof the equivalent one dimensional quantum systems is analyzed via the quantumtransfer matrix approach. Appropriate auxiliary functions, related to kinks inthe theory, play a role in constructing functional relations among transfermatrices. We successfully recover the universal Y- systems and therebyThermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations for E_{6,7} from the dilute A_{6,4} model,respectively.
