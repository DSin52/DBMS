Despite the nice geometrical properties of higher dimensional Chern-Simons(CS) supergravity theories these actions suffer from one major drawback,namely, their connection with the real world. After some quick remarks onthree-dimensional gravity, we consider five-dimensional CS supergravity andstudy to what extend this theory reproduces the standard low energy descriptionof gravitons and gauge fields. We point out that if one deforms the CS actionby changing the value of the cosmological constant by a small amount (thusbreaking the CS symmetry), propagation around AdS becomes non-trivial,asymptotically (AdS) Schwarzschild solutions exist, and the gauge fieldacquires its standard quadratic propagator.
