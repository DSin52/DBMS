The multidimensional N=4 supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY QM) isconstructed using the superfield approach. As a result, the component form ofthe classical and quantum Lagrangian and Hamiltonian is obtained. In theconsidered SUSY QM both classical and quantum N=4 algebras include centralcharges, and this opens various possibilities for partial supersymmetrybreaking. It is shown that quantum mechanical models with one quarter, one halfand three quarters of unbroken(broken) supersymmetries can exist in theframework of the multidimensional N=4 SUSY QM, while the one-dimensional N=4SUSY QM, constructed earlier, admits only one half or total supersymmetrybreakdown. We illustrate the constructed general formalism, as well as allpossible cases of the partial SUSY breaking taking as an example a directmultidimensional generalization of the one-dimensional N=4 superconformalquantum mechanical model. Some open questions and possible applications of theconstructed multidimensional N=4 SUSY QM to the known exactly integrablesystems and problems of quantum cosmology are briefly discussed.
