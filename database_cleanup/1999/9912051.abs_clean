We show that in the supersymmetry framework described by a Poincar\'{e}superalgebra with tensorial central charges the role of generalizedsuperconformal symmetry which contains all these central charges is played by$OSp(1|2^{k})$, where k=3 for D=4. Following [1,2] we describe the freesupertwistor model for $OSp(1|8)$. It appears that in such a scheme thetensorial central charges satisfy additional relations and the model describesthe tower of supersymmetric massless states with an arbitrary (integer andhalf--integer) helicity spectrum.
