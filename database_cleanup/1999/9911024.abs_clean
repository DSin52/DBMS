Title: Twist decomposition of nonlocal light-ray operators and harmonic tensor

functionsAuthors: B. Geyer and M. Lazar

Comments: 5 pages, LATEX; corrected misprint

For arbitrary spacetime dimension a systematic procedure is carried on touniquely decompose nonlocal light-cone operators into harmonic operators ofwell defined twist. Thereby, harmonic tensor polynomials up to rank 2 areintroduced. Symmetric tensor operators of rank 2 are considered as an example.
