We argue that orientable open string theory without GSO projection has N=2space-time supersymmetry in a spontaneously broken phase. The arguments arepresented both in Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond and Green-Schwarz formulations. Theformal but explicit supersymmetry transformation law for string field is givenin the framework of Witten's open string field theory. Our results support afundamental assumption which lies behind the topological construction of stableD-branes starting from the unstable systems of D9-branes.
