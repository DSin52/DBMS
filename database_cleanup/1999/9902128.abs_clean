We present a class of two-charged intersecting brane solutions of the D=11supergravity, which contain the M2-brane, M5-brane, Kaluza-Klein monopole orBrinkmann wave as their building blocks. These solutions share the commonfeature that one charge is smeared out or uniform over all spatial directionsoccupied by the branes or waves, while the other charge is localized in them.
