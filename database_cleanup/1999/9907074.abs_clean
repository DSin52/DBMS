We consider four-dimensional N=1 field theories realized by type IIA braneconfigurations of NS-branes and D4-branes, in the presence of orientifoldsix-planes and D6-branes. These configurations are known to present interestingeffects associated to the appearance of chiral symmetries and chiral matter inthe four-dimensional field theory. We center on models with one compactdirection (elliptic models) and show that, under T-duality, the configurationsare mapped to a set of type IIB D3-branes probing N=1 orientifolds of C^2/Z_Nsingularities. We explicitly construct these orientifolds, and show the fieldtheories on the D3-brane probes indeed reproduces the field theoriesconstructed using the IIA brane configurations. This T-duality map allows tounderstand the type IIB realization of several exotic brane dynamics effects onin crossing a NS-brane and the effect of a non-zero type IIA cosmologicalconstant turn out to have surprisingly standard type IIB counterparts.
