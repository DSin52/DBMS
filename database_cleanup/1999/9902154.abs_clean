The abelian Chern-Simons theory is perturbed by introducing localgauge-invariant interaction terms depending on the curvature. The computationof the correlation function of two Wilson lines for two smooth closednonintersecting curves is reported up to four loops and is shown to beunaffected by radiative corrections. This result ensures the stability of thelinking number of the two curves with respect to the local perturbations whichmay be added to the Chern-Simons action.
