We study some dynamical aspects of the correspondence between strings in AdSspace and external heavy quarks in N=4 SYM. Specifically, by examining wavespropagating on such strings, we make some plausible (and some surprising)inferences about the time-dependent fields produced by oscillating quarks inthe strongly-coupled gauge theory. We point out a puzzle regarding energyconservation in the SYM theory. In addition, we perform a similar analysis ofthe gauge fields produced by a baryon (represented as a D5-brane withstring-like extension in AdS space) and compare and contrast with the gaugefields produced by a quark-antiquark pair (represented as a string loopingthrough AdS space).
