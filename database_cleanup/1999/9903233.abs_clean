The large N Matrix model is studied with attention to the quantumfluctuations around a given diagonal background. Feynman rules are explicitlyderived and their relation to those in usual Yang-Mills theory is discussed.Background D-instanton configuration is naturally identified as adiscretization of momentum space of a corresponding QFT. The structure of largeN divergence is also studied on the analogy of UV divergences in QFT.
