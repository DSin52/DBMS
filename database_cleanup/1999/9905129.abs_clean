The one loop gluon - W-meson amplitude is calculated by means of thegauge-invariant generalized Pauli-Villars regularization and with the help ofdimensional regularization. It is shown that in the former case the amplitudesatisfies Generalized Ward Identities, whereas in the latter case the amplitudediffers from the first one by the constant.
