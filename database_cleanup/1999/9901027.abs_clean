We present a superspace formulation for super eightbrane theory based onmassive type IIA supergravity in ten-dimensions. Remarkably, in addition to the10-form superfield strength originally needed for super eightbrane, we alsoneed an `over-ranked' 11-form superfield strength $H_{A_1... A_{11}}$ withidentically vanishing purely bosonic component, in order to satisfy all theBianchi identities. As a natural super p-brane formulation for the 11-formsuperfield strength, we present a super ninebrane action on 10-dimensionalsuper-worldvolume invariant under a local fermionic $\k$-symmetry. We also showthat we can formulate such a superspace with an `over-ranked' superfieldstrength also in eleven-dimensions, and possibly in other lower dimensions aswell.
