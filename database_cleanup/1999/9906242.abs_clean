We study the D-brane spectrum of N=2 string orbifold theories using theboundary state formalism. The construction is carried out for orbifolds withisolated singularities, non-isolated singularities and orbifolds with discretetorsion. Our results agree with the corresponding K-theoretic predictions whenthey are available and generalize them when they are not. This suggests thatthe classification of boundary states provides a sort of "quantum K-theory"just as chiral rings in CFT provide "quantum" generalizations of cohomology. Wediscuss the identification of these states with D-branes wrapping holomorphiccycles in the large radius limit of the CFT moduli space. The example C^3/Z_3is worked out in full detail using local mirror symmetry techniques. We find aprecise correspondence between fractional branes at the orbifold point andconfigurations of D-branes described by vector bundles on the exceptional P^2cycle.
