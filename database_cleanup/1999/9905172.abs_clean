We investigate two-loop quantum corrections to non-minimally coupledMaxwell-Chern-Simons theory. The non-minimal gauge interaction represents themagnetic moment interaction between the charged scalar and the electromagneticfield. We show that the one-loop renormalizability of the theory found inprevious work does not survive to the two-loop level. However, with anappropriate choice of the non-minimal coupling constant, it is possible torenormalize the two-loop effective potential and hence render it potentiallyuseful for a detailed analysis of spontaneous symmetry breaking induced byradiative corrections.
