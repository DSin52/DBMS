Recent theoretical and numerical developments show analogies between quantumchromodynamics (QCD) and disordered systems in condensed matter physics. Westudy the spectral fluctuations of a Dirac particle propagating in a finitefour dimensional box in the presence of gauge fields. We construct a modelwhich combines Efetov's approach to disordered systems with the principles ofchiral symmetry and QCD. To this end, the gauge fields are replaced with astochastic white noise potential, the gauge field disorder. Effectivesupersymmetric non-linear sigma-models are obtained. Spontaneous breaking ofsupersymmetry is found. We rigorously derive the equivalent of the Thoulessenergy in QCD. Connections to other low-energy effective theories, inparticular the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model and chiral perturbation theory, arefound.
