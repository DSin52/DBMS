Spectral zeta functions $\zeta(s)$ for the massless scalar fields obeying theDirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on a surface of an infinite cylinderare constructed. These functions are defined explicitly in a finite domain ofthe complex plane s containing the closed interval of real axis $-1\le$ Re $s\le 0$. Proceeding from this the spectral zeta functions for the boundaryconditions given on a circle (boundary value problem on a plane) are obtainedwithout any additional calculations. The Casimir energy for the relevant fieldconfigurations is deduced.
