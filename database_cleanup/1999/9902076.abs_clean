Valeri Dvoeglazov (Nova Science Publishers)Spherically and cylindrically symmetric solutions of SU(3) Yang-Mills theoryare found, whose gauge potentials have confining properties. The sphericallysymmetric solutions give field distributions which have a spherical surface onwhich the gauge fields become infinite (which is similar to bag models ofconfinement), and the other solution has a potential which increases at largedistances. The cylindrically symmetric solution describes a classical field"string" (flux tube) of the kind which is expected to form between quarks inthe dual superconductor picture of confinement. These solutions with classicalconfining behaviour appear to be typical solutions for the classical SU(3)Yang-Mills equations. This implies that the confining properties of theclassical SU(3) Yang-Mills theory are general properties of this theory.
