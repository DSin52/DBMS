The field-theoretical description of quantum fluctuations on the backgroundof a tunneling field $\sigma$ is revisited in the case of a functionalSchrodinger approach. We apply this method in the case when quantumfluctuations are coupled to the $\sigma$ field through a mass-squared term,which is 'time-dependent' since we include the dynamics of $\sigma$ . Theresulting mode functions of the fluctuation field, which determine the quantumstate after tunneling, display a previously unseen resonance effect when theirmode number is comparable to the curvature scale of the bubble. A detailedanalysis of the relation between the excitations of the field about the truevacuum (interpreted as particle creation) and the phase shift coming fromtunneling is presented.
