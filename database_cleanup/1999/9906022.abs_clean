We provide a background-independent formulation of the holographic principle.It permits the construction of embedded hypersurfaces (screens) on which theentire bulk information can be stored at a density of no more than one bit perPlanck area. Screens are constructed explicitly for AdS, Minkowski, and deSitter spaces with and without black holes, and for cosmological solutions. Theproperties of screens provide clues about the character of a manifestlyholographic theory.
