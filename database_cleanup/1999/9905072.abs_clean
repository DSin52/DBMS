Deep Inelastic structure functions of the proton from the fundamental theory ofstrong interactions, Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD). In the Bjorken limit, themomenta of the constituents of the proton (the partons) can be assumed to be intwo space-time dimensions. Two dimensional QCD is then shown to be equivalentfor all energies and values of number of colors \m{N} to a new theory ofhadrons, Quantum HadronDynamics (QHD). The phase space of QHD is theGrassmannian (set of subspaces) of the complex Hilbert space L^2(R). Thenatural symplectic form along with a hamiltonian define a classical dynamicalsystem, which is equivalent to the large N limit of QCD. 't Hooft's planarequation for the meson spectrum but also all the interactions of the mesons.The Grassmannian is a union of connected components labelled by an integer (therenormalized dimension of the subspace) which has the physical meaning ofin the sector with baryon number one gives the structure functions of theproton. We solve the resulting integral equations numerically; the agreementwith experimental data is quite good for values of the Bjorken variable x>0.2.
