We construct twisted quantum bundles and adjoint sections on noncommutative$T^4$, and investigate relevant D-brane bound states with non-Abelianbackgrounds. We also show that the noncommutative $T^4$ with non-Abelianbackgrounds exhibits SO$(4,4|Z)$ duality and via this duality we get a Moritaequivalent $T^4$ on which only D0-branes exist. For a reducible non-Abelianbackground, the moduli space of D-brane bound states in Type II string theorytakes the form $\prod_a (T^4)^{q_a}/S_{q_a}$.
