We propose a direct correspondence between the classical evolution equationsof 5-d supergravity and the renormalization group (RG) equations of the dual4-d large $N$ gauge theory. Using standard Hamilton-Jacobi theory, we derivefirst order flow equations for the classical supergravity action $S$, that takethe usual form of the Callan-Symanzik equations, including the corrections dueto the conformal anomaly. This result gives direct support for theidentification of $S$ with the quantum effective action of the gauge theory. Inaddition we find interesting new relations between the beta-functions and thecounterterms that affect the 4-d cosmological and Newton constant.
