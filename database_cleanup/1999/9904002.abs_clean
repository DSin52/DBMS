We determine the exact quantum particle reflection amplitudes for all knownvacua of a_n^(1) affine Toda theories on the half-line with integrable boundaryconditions. (Real non-singular vacuum solutions are known for about half of allthe classically integrable boundary conditions.) To be able to do this we usethe fact that the particles can be identified with the analytically continuedbreather solutions, and that the real vacuum solutions are obtained byanalytically continuing stationary soliton solutions. We thus obtain theparticle reflection amplitudes from the corresponding breather reflectionamplitudes. These in turn we calculate by bootstrapping from soliton reflectionmatrices which we obtained as solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation(reflection equation).We study the pole structure of the particle reflection amplitudes and uncoveran unexpectedly rich spectrum of excited boundary states, created by particlesbinding to the boundary. For a_2^(1) and a_4^(1) Toda theories we calculate thereflection amplitudes for particle reflection off all these excited boundarystates. We are able to explain all physical strip poles in these reflectionfactors either in terms of boundary bound states or a generalisation of theColeman-Thun mechanism.
