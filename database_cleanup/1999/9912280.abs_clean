A coordinate-free action principle for the N=2 supersymmetric model of spin 0and spin 1/2 matter fields interacting via Chern-Simons higher spin gaugefields in AdS3 is formulated in terms of star-product algebra of twooscillators. Although describing proper relativistic dynamics the action doesnot contain space-time coordinates. It is given by a supertrace of aforth-order polynomial in the 3d higher spin superalgebra. The theory admits afree parameter characterizing the inequivalent vacua associated with theparameter of mass m of the matter fields. For the case of the massless matter,the model has a form of the noncommutative 2d Yang-Mills theory with someinfinite-dimensional gauge group. The limit m\to\infty corresponds to theSU(\infty) 2d Yang-Mills theory.
