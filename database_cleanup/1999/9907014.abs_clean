We show that there exist finite energy, non-singular instanton solutions forfive-dimensional theories with broken gauge symmetry. The soliton is supportedagainst collapse by a non-zero electric charge. The low-energy dynamics ofthese solutions is described by motion on the ADHM moduli space with potential.
