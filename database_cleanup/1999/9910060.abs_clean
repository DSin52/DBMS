some typos correctedI discuss some issues of perturbative quantum gravity, namely of a theory ofself-interacting massless spin-2 quantum gauge fields, the gravitons, on flatspace-time, in the framework of causal perturbation theory. The central aspectsof this approach lie in the construction of the scattering matrix by means ofcausality and Poincare covariance and in the analysis of the gauge structure ofinductive and causal construction of the perturbation series for the scatteringmatrix and the concept of perturbative operator quantum gauge invarianceborrowed from non-Abelian quantum gauge theories. The first method deals withthe ultraviolet problem of quantum gravity and the second one ensures gaugeinvariance at the quantum level, formulated by means of a gauge charge, in eachorder of perturbation theory. The gauge charge leads to a characterization ofthe physical subspace of the graviton Fock space. Aspects of quantum gravitycoupled to scalar matter fields are also discussed.
