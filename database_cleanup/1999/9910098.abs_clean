Marginally bound systems of two types of branes are considered, such as theprototypical case of Dp+4 branes and Dp branes. As the transverse separationbetween the two types of branes goes to zero, different behaviour occurs in thesupergravity solutions depending on p; no-hair theorems result for p<=1 only.Within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence, these supergravity no-hairresults are understood as dual manifestations of the Coleman-Mermin-Wagnertheorem. Furthermore, the rates of delocalization for p<=1 are matched in ascaling analysis. Talk given at ``Strings '99''; based on hep-th/9903213 withD. Marolf.
