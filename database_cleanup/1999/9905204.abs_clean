The vacuum energy of a scalar field in a spherically symmetric backgroundfield is considered. Based on previous work [hep-th/9608070], the numericalprocedure is refined further and applied to several examples. We providenumerical evidence that repulsive potentials lead to positive contributions tothe vacuum energy. Furthermore, the crucial role played by bound-states isclearly seen.
