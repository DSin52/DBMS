In this paper we re-examine the geometric interpretation of gluing conditionsin WZW models and the possible D-brane configurations that they give rise to.We show how the boundary conditions are encoded in the gluing conditionsimposed on the chiral currents. We analyse two special classes of gluingdescribes D-branes whose worldvolumes are given by `twisted' conjugacy classes;the second class describes configurations which include subgroups and cosets.
