We show that, in the limit of zero string coupling, $g_s \to 0$, thethermodynamic partition function of matrix string theory is identical to thatof the finite temperature, discrete light-cone quantised (DLCQ) type IIAsuperstring. We discuss how the superstring is recovered in the decompactified$R^+\to\infty$ limit.
