Various definitions of chiral observables in a given Moebius covarianttwo-dimensional theory are shown to be equivalent. Their representation theoryin the vacuum Hilbert space of the 2D theory is studied. It shares the generalcharacteristics of modular invariant partition functions, although SL(2,Z)transformation properties are not assumed. First steps towards classificationare made.
