The recently proposed physical projector approach to the quantisation ofgauge invariant systems is applied to the U(1) Chern-Simons theory in 2+1dimensions as one of the simplest examples of a topological quantum fieldtheory. The physical projector is explicitely demonstrated to be capable ofeffecting the required projection from the initially infinite number of degreesof freedom to the finite set of gauge invariant physical states whoseproperties are determined by the topology of the underlying manifold.
