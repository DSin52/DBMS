Title: Effective Supergravity from Heterotic M-Theory and its Phenomenological

ImplicationsComments: Extended version of a talk given at "Corfu Summer Institute on

Elementary Particle Physics", Kerkyra, Greece, 6-20 September 1998, 16 pageswith 7 figures, JHEP LateXIn this talk I summarize several recent results concerning thefour-dimensional effective supergravity obtained using a Calabi-Yaucompactification of the $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string from M-theory. Asimple macroscopic study is provided expanding the theory in powers of twodimensionless variables. Higher order terms in the K\"ahler potential areidentified and matched with the heterotic string corrections. In the context ofuniversality of soft scalar masses, relations between the different scales ofthe theory (eleven-dimensional Planck mass, compactification scale and orbifoldscale) in order to obtain unification at $3\times 10^{16}$ GeV or lower values,soft supersymmetry-breaking terms, and finally charge and colour breakingminima. The above analyses are also carried out in the presence of(non-perturbative) five-branes.
