The geodesics of the rotating extreme black hole in five spacetime dimensionsfound by Breckenridge, Myers, Peet and Vafa are Liouville integrable and may beintegrated by additively separating the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This allowsus to obtain the St\"ackel-Killing tensor. We use these facts to give themaximal analytic extension of the spacetime and discuss some aspects of itscausal structure. In particular, we exhibit a `repulson'-like behaviouroccuring when there are naked closed timelike curves. In this case we find thatthe spacetime is geodesically complete (with respect to causal geodesics) andfree of singularities. When a partial Cauchy surface exists, we show, bysolving the Klein-Gordon equation, that the absorption cross-section formassless waves at small frequencies is given by the area of the hole. At highfrequencies a dependence on the angular quantum numbers of the wave develops.We comment on some aspects of `inertial time travel' and argue that such timemachines cannot be constructed by spinning up a black hole with no naked closedtimelike curves.
