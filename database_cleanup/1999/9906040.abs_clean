The horizon of a static black hole in Anti-deSitter space can be spherical,planar, or hyperbolic. The microscopic dynamics of the first two classes ofblack holes have been extensively discussed recently within the context of theAdS/CFT correspondence. We argue that hyperbolic black holes introduce new andfruitful features in this respect, allowing for more detailed comparisonsbetween the weak and strong coupling regimes. In particular, by focussing onthe stress tensor and entropy of some particular states, we identify unexpectedincreases in the entropy of Super-Yang-Mills theory at strong coupling that arenot accompanied by increases in the energy. We describe a highly degeneratestate at zero temperature and zero energy density. We also find that theentanglement entropy across a Rindler horizon in exact AdS_5 is larger thanmight have been expected from the dual SYM theory. Besides, we show thathyperbolic black holes can be described as thermal Rindler states of the dualconformal field theory in flat space.
