Title: Dimensionally continued multi-loop gauge theory

Comments: 11 pages, LaTeX

A dimensionally continued background-field method makes the rationality ofthe 4-loop quenched QED beta function far more reasonable than had previouslyappeared. After 33 years of quest, dating from Rosner's discovery of 3-looprationality, one finally sees cancellation of zeta values by the tracestructure of individual diagrams. At 4-loops, diagram-by-diagram cancellationof $\zeta(5)$ does not even rely on the values of integrals at d=4. Rather, itis a property of the rational functions of $d$ that multiply elements of thewheels. We explain the previously mysterious suppression of $\pi^4$ in masslessgauge theory. The 4-loop QED result $\beta_4=-46$ is obtained by setting d=4 ina precisely defined rational polynomial of d, with degree 11. The other 5rational functions vanish at d=4.
