All quartic couplings of scalar fields $s^I$ that are dual to extended chiralprimary operators in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM$_4$ are derived by using the covariantequations of motion for type IIB supergravity on $AdS_5\times S^5$. It is shownthat despite some expectations if one keeps the structure of the cubic termsuntouched, the quartic action obtained contains terms with two and fourderivatives. It is shown that the quartic action vanishes on shell in theextremal case, e.g. k_1=k_2+k_3+k_4. Consistency of the truncation of thequartic couplings to the massless multiplet of the ${\cal N}=8$, d=5supergravity is proven and the explicit values of the couplings are found. Itis argued that the consistency of the KK reduction implies non-renormalizationof $n$-point functions of $n-1$ operators dual to the fields from the masslessmultiplet and one operator dual to a field from a massive multiplet.
