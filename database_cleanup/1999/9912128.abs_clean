Quantum gravity coupled to scalar massive matter fields is investigatedwithin the framework of causal perturbation theory. One-loop calculationsinclude matter loop graviton self-energy and matter self-energy and yieldultraviolet finite and cutoff-free expressions. Perturbative gauge invarianceto second order implies the usual Slavnov-Ward identities for the gravitonself-energy in the loop graph sector and generates the correct quarticgraviton-matter interaction in the tree graph sector. The mass zero case isalso discussed.
