Interaction of branes in presence of internal gauge fields is considered byusing the boundary state formalism. This approach enables us to consider theproblems that are not easily accessible to the canonical approach via openstrings. The effects of compactification of some of the dimensions on tori arealso discussed. Also we study the massless state contribution on thisinteraction.
