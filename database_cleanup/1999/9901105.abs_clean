Membrane source-probe dynamics is investigated in the framework of the finiteN-sector DLCQ M theory compactified on a transverse two-torus for an arbitrarysize of the longitudinal dimension. The non-perturbative two fermion terms inthe effective action of the matrix theory, the (2+1)-dimensional supersymmetricYang-Mills theory, that are related to the four derivative F^4 terms by thesupersymmetry transformation are obtained, including the one-loop term and fullinstanton corrections. On the supergravity side, we compute the classical probeaction up to two fermion terms based on the classical supermembrane formulationin an arbitrary curved background geometry produced by source membranessatisfying the BPS condition; two fermion terms correspond to the spin-orbitcouplings for membranes. We find precise agreement between two approaches whenthe background space-time is chosen to be that of the DLCQ M theory, which isasymptotically locally Anti-de Sitter.
