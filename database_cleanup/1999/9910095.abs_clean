An exact solution of domain wall junction is obtained in a four-dimensionalN=1 supersymmetric U(1) X U(1)' gauge theory with three pairs of chiralsuperfields which is motivated by the N=2 SU(2) gauge theory with one flavorperturbed by an adjoint scalar mass. The solution allows us to evaluate variousquantities including a new central charge Y_k associated with the junctionbesides Z_k which appears already in domain walls. We find that the new centralcharge Y_k gives a negative contribution to the mass of the domain walljunction whereas the central charge Z_k gives a dominant positive contribution.One has to be cautious to identify the central charge Y_k alone as the mass ofthe junction.
