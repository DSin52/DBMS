typos corrected, references addedWe present an Sp(2n,R) duality invariant Born-Infeld U(1)^2n gauge theorywith scalar fields. To implement this duality we had to introduce complex gaugefields and as a result the rank of the duality group is only half as large asthat of the corresponding Maxwell gauge theory with the same number of gaugefields. The latter is self-dual under Sp(4n,R), the largest allowed dualitygroup. A special case appears for n=1 when one can also write an SL(2,R)duality invariant Born-Infeld theory with a real gauge field. We also describethe supersymmetric version of the above construction.
