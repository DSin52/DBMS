Title: General Relativity + Quantum mechanics --> Discretized Momentum

Authors: H. Gopalkrishna Gadiyar

Comments: 3 pages

The analogy between General Relativity and monopole physics is pointed outand the presence of a 3-cocycle which corresponds to a source leads todiscretization of field momentum. This is analogous to the same phenomena inmonopole physics.
