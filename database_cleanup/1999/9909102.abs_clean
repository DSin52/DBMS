All regular four-dimensional black holes are constructed in the theoryobtained by Kaluza-Klein reduction of five-dimensional Einstein gravity. Theyare interpreted in string theory as rotating bound states of D0- and D6-branes.Conservation of angular momentum is important for the stability of the boundstates. The thermodynamics, the duality symmetries, and the near-horizon limitare explored.
