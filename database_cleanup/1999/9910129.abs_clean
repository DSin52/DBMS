In continuum physics, there are important topological aspects likeinstantons, theta-terms and the axial anomaly. Conventional latticediscretizations often have difficulties in treating one or the other of theseaspects. In this paper, we develop discrete quantum field theories on fuzzymanifolds using noncommutative geometry. Basing ourselves on previoustreatments of instantons and chiral fermions (without fermion doubling) onfuzzy spaces and especially fuzzy spheres, we present discrete representationsof theta-terms and topological susceptibility for gauge theories and deriveaxial anomaly on the fuzzy sphere. Our gauge field action for four dimensionsis bounded by the modulus of the instanton number as in the continuum.
