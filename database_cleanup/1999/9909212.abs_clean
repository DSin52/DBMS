Title: Mass scales in string and M-theory

Comments: 32 pages, LaTeX, 2 eps-figures, uses sprocl.sty Lectures given at the

Trieste Spring Workshop, ICTP, Italy, 22-30 March 1999, and at the AdvancedSchool on "Supersymmetry in the Theories of Fields, Strings and Branes",Sandiago de Compostela, Spain, 26-31 July 1999. A short version was given asan invited talk at Strings 99, Potsdam, Germany, 19-24 July 1999 and at theEuropean Program meeting on "Quantum Aspects of Gauge Theories, Supersymmetryand Unification", Paris, France, 1-7 September 1999I review the relations between mass scales in various string theories and inM-theory. I discuss physical motivations and possible consistent realizationsof large volume compactifications and low string scale. Large longitudinaldimensions, seen by Standard Model particles, imply in general that stringtheory is strongly coupled unless its tension is close to the compactificationscale. Weakly coupled, low-scale strings can in turn be realized only in thepresence of extra large transverse dimensions, seen through gravitationalinteractions, or in the presence of infinitesimal string coupling. In theformer case, quantum gravity scale is also low, while in the latter,gravitational and string interactions remain suppressed by the four-dimensionalPlanck mass. There is one exception in this general rule, allowing for largelongitudinal dimensions without low string scale, when Standard Model isembedded in a six-dimensional fixed-point theory described by a tensionlessstring. Extra dimensions of size as large as TeV$^{-1}\simeq 10^{-16}$ cm aremotivated from the problem of supersymmetry breaking in string theory, whileTeV scale strings offer a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem, as analternative to softly broken supersymmetry or technicolor. I discuss theseproblems in the context of the above mentioned string realizations, as well asthe main physical implications both in particle accelerators and in experimentsthat measure gravity at sub-millimeter distances.
