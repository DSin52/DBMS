In the type 0B string theory, we discuss the role of tachyon($T$) and fixedscalars($\nu,\lambda$). The issue is to explain the difference between tachyonand fixed scalars in the D$5_{\pm}$-D$1_{\pm}$ black hole background. For thispurpose, we perform the semiclassical calculation. Here one finds a mixingbetween ($\nu, \lambda, T$) and the other fields. Using the decouplingprocedure, one finds the linearized equation for the tachyon. From thepotential analysis, it turns out that $\nu$ plays a role of test field well,while the tachyon induces an instability of Minkowski space vacuum. But theroles of $\nu$ and $T$ are the same in the near-horizon geometry. Finally wediscuss the stability problem.
