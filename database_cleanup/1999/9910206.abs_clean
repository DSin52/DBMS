symposium "Quantum Theory and Symmetries"' 18-22 July 1999, Goslar, GermanyThe left and right zero modes of the level k SU(n) WZNW model give rise to apair of isomorphic (left and right) mutually commuting quantum matrix algebras.For a deformation parameter q being an even (2h-th, h = k + n) root of unityeach of these matrix algebras admits an ideal such that the correspondingfactor algebra is finite dimensional. The structure of superselection sectorsof the (diagonal) 2D WZNW model is then reduced to a finite dimensional problemof a gauge theory type. For n=2 this problem is solved using a generalized BRSformalism.
