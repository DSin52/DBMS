Title: Black Holes and Quantum Mechanics

Comments: 7 pages, Latex. To be published in proceedings of the 22nd Johns

Hopkins Workshop, Gothenburg, 1998The motion of a particle near the RN black hole horizon is described byconformal mechanics. Models of this type have no ground state with vanishingenergy. This problem was resolved in past by a redefinition of the Hamiltonianwhich breaks translational time invariance but gives a normalizable groundstate. We show that this change of the Hamiltonian is a quantum mechanicalequivalent of the change of coordinates near the black hole horizon removingthe singularity. The new Hamiltonian of quantum mechanics is identified as anoperator of a rotation between 2 time-like coordinates of the adS hypersurfacewhich translates global time. Therefore conformal quantum mechanics mayeventually help to resolve the puzzles of the classical black hole physics.
