We discuss general multidimensional axion-dilatonic AdS gravity which maycorrespond to bosonic sector of Gibbons-Green-Perry (compactified) IIBsupergravity with RR-scalar (axion). Using AdS/CFT correspondence the 4dconformal anomaly on axion-dilaton-gravitational background is found from SGside. It is shown that for IIB SG with axion such conformal anomaly coincideswith the one obtained from QFT calculation in ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Millstheory conformally coupled with ${\cal N}=4$ conformal SG. Brief discussion onpossibility to apply these results for gauged SGs is also presented.
