Title: TASI Lectures on Non-BPS D-Brane Systems

Comments: 39 pages; Presented at TASI-99 and Cargese-99; v2

In this set of lectures various properties of D-branes are discussed. Afterreviewing the basics, we discuss unstable D-brane/anti-D-brane systems, asubject pioneered by Sen. Following him, we discuss the construction of thenon-BPS D0-brane in type I theory. This state is stable since it carries aconserved Z_2 charge. The general classification of D-brane charges usingK-theory is discussed. The results for the type I theory, and the T-dual typeI' theory, are emphasized. Compactification of type I on a circle or torusgives a theory with 16 supersymmetries in 9d or 8d. In each case the modulispace has three branches. The spectrum of non-BPS D-branes are different foreach of these branches. We conclude by pointing out some problems with the typeI D7-brane and D8-brane predicted by K-theory.
