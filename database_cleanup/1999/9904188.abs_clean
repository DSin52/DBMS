We construct a new class of two-dimensional field theories with target spacesthat are finite multiparameter deformations of the usual coset G/H-spaces. Theyarise naturally, when certain models, related by Poisson-Lie T-duality, developa local gauge invariance at specific points of their classical moduli space. Weshow that canonical equivalences in this context can be formulated in loopspace in terms of parafermionic-type algebras with a central extension. We findthat the corresponding generating functionals are non-polynomial in thederivatives of the fields with respect to the space-like variable. Afterconstructing models with three- and two-dimensional targets, we studyrenormalization group flows in this context. In the ultraviolet, in some cases,the target space of the theory reduces to a coset space or there is a fixedpoint where the theory becomes free.
