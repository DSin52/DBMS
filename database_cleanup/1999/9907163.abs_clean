The thermodynamic properties of Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter black holesconfined within finite isothermal cavities are examined. In contrast to theSchwarzschild case, the infinite cavity limit may be taken which, if suitablystated, remains double valued. This allows the correspondence betweennon-existence of negative modes for classical solutions and local thermodynamicstability of the equilibrium configuration of such solutions to be shown in awell defined manner. This is not possible in the asymptotically flat case.Furthermore, the non-existence of negative modes for the larger black holesolution in Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter provides strong evidence in favour ofthe recent positive energy conjecture by Horowitz and Myers.
