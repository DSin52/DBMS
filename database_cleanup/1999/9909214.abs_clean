By integrating the Seiberg-Witten differential equation in a special path, wewrite ordinary gauge fields in terms of their non-commutative counterparts upto three non-commutative gauge fields. We then use this change of variables towrite ordinary abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action in terms of non-commutativefields. The resulting action is then compared with various low energy contactterms of world-sheet perturbative string scattering amplitudes fromnon-commutative D$p$-brane. We find completely agreement between the fieldtheory and string theory results. Hence, it shows that perturbative stringtheory knows the solution of the Seiberg-Witten differential equation.
