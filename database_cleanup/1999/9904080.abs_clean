Title: A Generalized Higgs Model

Authors: Mark D. Roberts

Comments: 6 pages, third version

Noether current of the theory givenThe Higgs model is generalized so that in addition to the radial Higgs fieldthere are fields which correspond to the themasy and entropy. The model isfurther generalized to include state and sign parameters. A reduction to thestandard Higgs model is given and how to break symmetry using a non-zero VEV(vacuum expectation value) is shown. A 'fluid rotation' can be performed on thestandard Higgs model to give a model dependant on the entropy and themasy andwith a constant mass.
