It is well-known that the chiral WZNW Bloch waves satisfy a quadraticclassical exchange algebra which implies the affine Kac-Moody algebra for thecorresponding currents. We here obtain a direct derivation of the exchangealgebra by inverting the symplectic form on the space of Bloch waves, and givea completely algorithmic construction of its generalized free fieldrealizations that extend the classical Wakimoto realizations of the currentalgebra.
