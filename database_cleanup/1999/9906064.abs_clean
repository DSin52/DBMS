Conventional wisdom states that Newton's force law implies only fournon-compact dimensions. We demonstrate that this is not necessarily true in thepresence of a non-factorizable background geometry. The specific example westudy is a single 3-brane embedded in five dimensions. We show that evenwithout a gap in the Kaluza-Klein spectrum, four-dimensional Newtonian andgeneral relativistic gravity is reproduced to more than adequate precision.
