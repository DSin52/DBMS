Title: Superstrings, Unifications and dualities

Authors: Joseph Kouneiher

Comments: 31 pages, 9 figures. This conference is the first part of two

lectures treating the geometric principle lying behind superstring theory. Itis an introductory oneI describe our understanding of physics near the planck length, in particularthe great progress of the last four years in string theory. Superstring theory,and a recent extension called M theory, are leading candidates for a quantumtheory that unifies gravity with the other forces. As such, they are certainlynot ordinary quantum field theories. However, recent duality conjecturessuggest that a more complete definition of these theories can be provided bythe large N limits of suitably chosen U(N) gauge theories associated to theasymptotic boundary of spacetime.
