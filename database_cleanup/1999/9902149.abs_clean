Title: Supermembranes in curved superspace and near-horizon geometries

Comments: Lecture presented at the 22-nd Johns Hopkins Workshop, Novelties in

String Theory, G\"oteborg, August 20-22, 1998. LateX 18 ppWe give a description of supermembranes in nontrivial target-spacegeometries. A special class are the $AdS_4\times S^7$ and $AdS_7\times S^4$spaces that have the maximal number of 32 supersymmetries.
