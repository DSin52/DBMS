We introduce a spectral approach to non-perturbative field theory within theperiodic field formalism. As an example we calculate the real and imaginaryparts of the propagator in 1+1 dimensional phi^4 theory, identifying bothone-particle and multi-particle contributions. We discuss the computationallimits of existing diagonalization algorithms and suggest new quasi-sparseeigenvector methods to handle very large Fock spaces and higher dimensionalfield theories.
