Title: Why General Theory of Relativity Allows the Existence of Only Extremal

Black HolesComments: 5 pages, Revtex

Supersymmetric String theories find occurrences of extremal Black Holes withgravitational mass M=Q where Q is the charge (G=c=1). Thus, for the chargelesscases, they predict M=0. We show that General Theory of Relativity, too,demands a unique BH mass M=0. And we do this by considering the problem fromvarious angles, both mathematically and physically. Our analysis may beunderstandable even to the readers not having sufficient background in GTR.Physically, this M=0 result means that, continued gravitational collapse indeedcontinues for infinite proper time as the system hopelessly tries to radiateits entire original mass energy to attain the lowest energy state M=0. Since noevent horizon is formed, the problem of loss of information associated withcreation of finite mass BHs or their evaporation ceases to exist.
