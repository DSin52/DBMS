The goal of this paper is to analyse the method of angular quantization forthe Sine-Gordon model at the free fermion point, which is one of the mostinvestigated models of the two-dimensional integrable field theories. Theangular quantization method (see hep-th/9707091) is a continuous analog of theBaxter's corner transfer matrix method. Investigating the canonicalquantization of the free massive Dirac fermions in one Rindler wedge weidentify this quantization with a representation of the infinite-dimensionalalgebra introduced in the paper q-alg/9702002 and specialized to the freefermion point. We construct further the main ingredients of the SG theory interms of the representation theory of this algebra following the approach byM.Jimbo, T.Miwa et al.
