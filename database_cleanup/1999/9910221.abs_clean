We introduce a model designed to describe charged particles as stabletopological solitons of a field with values on the internal space S^3. Thesesolitons behave like particles with relativistic properties like Lorentzcontraction and velocity dependence of mass. This mass is defined by the energyof the soliton. In this sense this model is a generalisation of the sine-Gordonmodel from 1+1 dimensions to 3+1 dimensions, from S^1 to S^3. (We do not chasethe aim to give a four-dimensional generalisation of Coleman's isomorphismbetween the Sine-Gordon model and the Thirring model which was shown in2-dimensional space-time.) For large distances from the center of solitons thismodel tends to a dual U(1)-theory with freely propagating electromagneticwaves. Already at the classical level it describes important effects, whichusually have to be explained by quantum field theory, likeparticle-antiparticle annihilation and the running of the coupling.
