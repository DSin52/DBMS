In this paper we study various aspects of classical solutions to the affineToda equations on a half-line with integrable boundary conditions. We begin byfinding conditions that the theory has a stable vacuum by finding a Bogomolnybound on the energy, and analysing the possible singularities of the field atthe boundary. Using these constraints and extensive numerical investigations weclassify the vacuum configurations and reflection factors for A_r^(1) Todatheories up to r=5.
