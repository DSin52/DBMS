Title: Stress-Energy Tensors for Higher Dimensional Gravity

Authors: A. DeBenedictis, K. S. Viswanathan

Comments: 12 pages. Uses AMS package. No figures

We calculate, in the context of higher dimensional gravity, the stress-energytensor and Weyl anomaly associated with anti-de Sitter and anti-de Sitter blackhole solutions. The boundary counter-term method is used to regularize theaction and the resulting stress-energy tensor yields both the correct blackhole energies as well as a vacuum energy contribution which is interpreted as aCasimir energy. This calculation is done up to d = 8 (d being the boundarydimension). We confirm some results for d < 8 as well as comment on some newresults (some of which are relevant to (2,0) theory). All results for d=8 arenew.
