Authors: P.K. Townsend

Comments: 9 pp. Latex. Revised to include corrections, improvements and

additional references. To appear in Proceedings of the 3'rd Puri workshop onQuantum Field Theory, Quantum Gravity and Strings, Puri, Orissa, India,December 9-19, 1998The M(atrix) model has a dual realization as IIA superstring theory in thenear-horizon geometry of the supergravity D0-brane. The role of $adS_2$ in thiscorrespondence is reviewed, and some aspects of holography that it suggests arediscussed.
