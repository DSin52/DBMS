Dynamical mass generation of a two-component fermion in $QED_3$ with aChern-Simons term is investigated by solving the Schwinger-Dyson equationformulated in the lowest ladder approximation. Dependence of the dynamicalfermion mass on a gauge-fixing parameter, a gauge coupling constant, and atopological mass is examined by approximated analytical and also numericalmethods. The inclusion of the Chern-Simons term makes impossible to choose apeculiar gauge in which a wave function renormalization is absent. Thenumerical evaluation shows that the wave function renormalization is fairlyclose to 1 in the Landau gauge. It means that this gauge is still a specificgauge where the Ward-Takahashi identity is satisfied approximately. We alsofind that the dynamical mass is almost constant if the topological mass islarger than the coupling constant, while it decreases when the topological massis comparable to or smaller than the coupling constant and tends to the valuein $QED_3$ without the Chern-Simons term.
