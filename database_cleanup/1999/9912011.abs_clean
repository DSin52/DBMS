Using the ADHM instanton calculus, we evaluate the one-instanton contributionto the low-energy effective prepotential of N=2 supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Millstheory with N_F flavors of hypermultiplets in the fundamental representationand a hypermultiplet in the symmetric rank two tensor representation. ForN_F<N-2, when the theory is asymptotically free, our result is compared withthe exact solution that was obtained using M-theory and we find completeagreement.
