We construct string target spacetimes with AdS_3 x X geometry, which have anN=2 spacetime superconformal algebra. X is found to be a U(1) fibration over amanifold which is a target for an N=2 worldsheet conformal field theory. Weemphasize theories with free field realizations where in principle it ispossible to compute the full one-particle string spectrum.
