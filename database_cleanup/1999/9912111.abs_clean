Cylindrical gravitational waves of Einstein gravity are described by anintegrable system (Ernst system) whose quantization is a long standing problem.quantum theory is described in terms of matrix elements e.g. of the metricoperator between spectral-transformed multi-vielbein configurations. Thesematrix elements are computed exactly as solutions of a recursive system offunctional equations, which in turn is derived from an underlying quadraticalgebra. The Poisson algebra emerging in its classical limit links thespectral-transformed vielbein and the non-local conserved charges and can bederived from first principles within the Ernst system. Among the noteworthysidestepped and (ii) there is an apparently unavoidable ``spontaneous''breakdown of the SL(2,R) symmetry that is a remnant of the 4D diffeomorphisminvariance in the compactified dimensions.
