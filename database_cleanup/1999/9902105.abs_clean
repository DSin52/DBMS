We show that the tachyonic kink solution on a pair of D-p-branes in thebosonic string theory can be identified with the D-(p-1)-brane of the sametheory. We also speculate on the possibility of obtaining the D-(p-1)-brane asa tachyonic lump on a single D-p-brane. We suggest a possible reinterpretationof the first result which unifies these two apparently different descriptionsof the D-(p-1) brane.
