Authors: Tomomi Muto

Comments: 22 pages, 12 figures, T-duality interpretation of the McKay

correspondence addedWe study brane configurations corresponding to D-branes on complexthree-dimensional orbifolds ${\bf C}^3/\Gamma$ with $\Gamma=\Delta(3n^2)$ and$\Delta(6n^2)$, nonabelian finite subgroups of SU(3). We first construct abrane configuration for ${\bf C}^3/{\bf Z}_n \times {\bf Z}_n$ by usingD3-branes and a web of (p,q) 5-branes of type IIB string theory. Braneconfigurations for the nonabelian orbifolds are obtained by performing certainquotients on the configuration for ${\bf C}^3/{\bf Z}_n \times {\bf Z}_n$.Structure of the quiver diagrams of the groups $\Delta(3n^2)$ and$\Delta(6n^2)$ can be reproduced from the brane configurations. We point outthat the brane configuration for ${\bf C}^3/\Gamma$ can be regarded as aphysical realization of the quiver diagram of $\Gamma$. Based on thisobservation, we discuss that three-dimensional McKay correspondence may beinterpreted as T-duality.
