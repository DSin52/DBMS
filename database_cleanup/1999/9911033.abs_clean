Title: An approach to approximate calculations of Green functions

Comments: 7 pages, Plain LaTeX, no figures, talk given at conference QFTHEP'99

(Moscow)A new approach proposed recently by author for the calculation of Greenfunctions in quantum field theory and quantum mechanics is briefly reviewed.The method is applied to nonperturbative calculations for anharmonicoscillator, $\phi^4$-theory, quantum electrodynamics and other models.
