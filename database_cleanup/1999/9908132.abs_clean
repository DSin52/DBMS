New solution to the six-dimensional vacuum Einstein's equations isconstructed as a non-linear superposition of two five-dimensional solutionsrepresenting the Melvin-Gibbons-Maeda Universe and its S-dual. Then usingduality between D=8 vacuum and a certain class of D=11 supergravityconfigurations we generate M2 and M5 fluxbranes as well as some of theirintersections also including waves and KK-monopoles.
