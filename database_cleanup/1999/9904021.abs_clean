We discuss theories in which the standard-model particles are localized on abrane embedded in space-time with large compact extra dimensions, whereasgravity propagates in the bulk. In addition to the ground state correspondingto a straight infinite brane, such theories admit a (one parameter) family ofstable configurations corresponding to branes wrapping with certain periodicityaround the extra dimension(s) when one moves along a noncompact coordinate(tilted walls). In the effective four-dimensional field-theory picture, suchwalls are interpreted as one of the (stable) solutions with the constantgradient energy, discussed earlier. In the cosmological context their energy"redshifts" by the Hubble expansion and dissipates slower then the one inmatter or radiation. The tilted wall eventually starts to dominate theUniverse. The upper bound on the energy density coincides with the presentcritical energy density. Thus, this mechanism can become significant any timein the future. The solutions we discuss are characterized by a tiny spontaneousbreaking of both the Lorentz and rotational invariances. Small calculableLorentz noninvariant terms in the standard-model Lagrangian are induced. Thus,the tilted walls provide a framework for the spontaneous breaking of theLorentz invariance.
