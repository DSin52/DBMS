We consider the pair of degenerate compatible antibrackets satisfying ageneralization of the axioms imposed in the triplectic quantization of gaugetheories. We show that this actually encodes a Lie group structure, with theantibrackets being related to the left- and right- invariant vector fields onthe group. The standard triplectic quantization axioms then correspond toAbelian groups.
