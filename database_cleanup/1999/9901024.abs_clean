Title: Light-front Quantized Field Theory

Gravitation, Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas F\'{\i}sicas, Rio de Janeiro,July 1998. Plain Latex, 28 pagesA review is made on some recent studies which support the point of view thatthe relativistic field theory quantized on the light-front (LF) is moretransparent compared to the conventional equal-time one. The discussion may beof relevance in the context of the quantization of gravitation theory. The LFquantization is argued to be equally appropriate as the conventional equal-timeone. The description on the LF of the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the(tree level) Higgs mechanism, the emergence of the $\theta$-vacua in theSchwinger model, the absence of such vacua in the Chiral SM, the BRS-BFTquantization of the latter on the LF are among the topics discussed. Commentson the irrelevance, in the quantized theory, of the fact that the hyperplanes$x^{\pm}=0$ constitute characteristic surfaces of the hyperbolic partialdifferential equation are also made. The LF theory quantized on, say, the$x^{+}=const.$ hyperplanes seems to already contain in it the information onthe equal-$x^{-}$ commutators as well. A theoretical reaffirmation of that theexperimental data is to be confronted with the predictions of a classicaltheory model only after it has been upgraded through its quantization seems toemerge.
