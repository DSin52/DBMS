Authors: Paul Federbush (Univ. of Michigan)

Comments: 6 pages. LaTeX

Some generalized BRS transformations are developed for the pure Yang-Millsthese are nonlocal; may be infinite formal power series in the gauge fields;and do not leave the action invariant, but only the product exp(-S) with theJacobian. Similar constructions should exist for many other field theorysituations.
