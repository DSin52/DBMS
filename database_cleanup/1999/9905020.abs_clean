The superconformal group of N=4 super-Yang-Mills has two types of operatorfor which at least two of the three operators are short exactly respect a bonusU(1)_Y R-symmetry, which acts as an automorphism of the superconformal group.This conjecture is for arbitrary gauge group G and gauge coupling g_{YM}. Aconsequence is that n\leq 4-point functions involving only short operatorsexactly respect the U(1)_Y symmetry, as has been previously conjectured basedon AdS duality. This, in turn, would imply that all n\leq 3 -point functionsinvolving only short operators are not renormalized, as has also beenpreviously conjectured and subjected to perturbative checks. It is argued thatinstantons are compatible with our conjecture. Some perturbative checks of theconjecture are presented and SL(2,Z) modular transformation properties arediscussed.
