We consider non-perturbative six dimensional N=1 space-time supersymmetricorientifolds of Type IIB on K3 with non-trivial NS-NS B-flux. All of thesemodels are non-perturbative in both orientifold and heterotic pictures. Thus,some states in such compactifications arise in ``twisted'' open string sectorswhich lack world-sheet description in terms of D-branes. We also discuss theirdual F-theory compactifications on certain Voisin-Borcea orbifolds. Inparticular, the explicit construction of non-perturbative K3 orientifolds withNS-NS B-flux gives additional evidence for the conjectured extension ofNikulin's classification in the context of Voisin-Borcea orbifolds.
