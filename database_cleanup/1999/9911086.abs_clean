A complete qualitative study of the dynamics of string cosmologies ispresented for the class of isotopic curvature universes. These models are ofBianchi types I, V and IX and reduce to the general class ofFriedmann-Robertson-Walker universes in the limit of vanishing shear isotropy.A non-trivial two-form potential and cosmological constant terms are includedin the system. In general, the two-form potential and spatial curvature termsare only dynamically important at intermediate stages of the evolution. In manyof the models, the cosmological constant is important asymptotically andanisotropy becomes dynamically negligible. There also exist bouncingcosmologies.
