We introduce the spherical field formalism for free gauge fields. We discussthe structure of the spherical Hamiltonian for both general covariant gauge andradial gauge and point out several new features not present in the scalar fieldcase. We then use the evolution equations to compute gauge-field andfield-strength correlators.
