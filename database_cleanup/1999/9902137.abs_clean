Title: Boundary terms in the AdS/CFT correspondence for spinor fields

Authors: Marc Henneaux

Comments: 11 pages, Latex, to appear in Proceedings of the International

Workshop ISMP (Tbilissi, September 1998)The requirement that the action be stationary for solutions of the Diracequations in anti-de Sitter space with a definite asymptotic behaviour is shownto fix the boundary term (with its coefficient) that must be added to thestandard Dirac action in the AdS/CFT correspondence for spinor fields.
