Here we examine the noncommutative counterpart of QED, which is called asnoncommutative QED. The theory is obtained by examining the consistent minimalcoupling to noncommutative U(1) gauge field. The *-product admits the couplingof the matter with only three varieties of charges, i.e., 0, +1 and -1.Ultraviolet divergence can be absorbed into the rescaling of the fields and theparameters at least at one loop level. To examine the infrared aspect of thetheory the anomalous magnetic dipole moment is calculated. The dependence onthe direction of photon momentum reflects the Lorentz symmetry violation of thesystem. The explicit calculation of the finite part of the photon vacuumpolarization shows the singularity ln({q C^TC q}) (C^{\mu\nu} is anoncommutative parameter.) in the infrared side which also exists innoncommutative Yang-Mills theory. It is associated with the ultravioletbehavior of the theory. We also consider the extension to chiral gauge theoryin the present context, but the requirement of anomaly cancellation allows onlynoncommutative QED.
