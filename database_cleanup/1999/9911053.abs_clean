Quantization of a system constrained to move on a sphere is considered bytaking a square root of the ``on sphere condition''. We arrive at the fibrebundle structure of the Hopf map in the cases of $S^{2} $and $S^{4}$. Thisleads to more geometrical understanding of monopole and instanton gaugestructures that emerge in the course of quantization.
