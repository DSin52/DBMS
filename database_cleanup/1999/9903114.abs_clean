The Hilbert spaces of supersymmetric systems admit symmetries which are oftenrelated to the topology and geometry of the (target) field-space. Here, westudy certain (2,2)-supersymmetric systems in 2-dimensional spacetime which areclosely related to superstring models. They all turn out to posess somehitherto unexploited and geometrically and topologically unobstructedsymmetries, providing new tools for studying the topology and geometry ofsuperstring target spacetimes, and so the dynamics of the effective fieldtheory in these.
