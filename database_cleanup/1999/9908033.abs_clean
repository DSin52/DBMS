Grand canonical ensemble of small vortex loops emerging in the London limitof the effective Abelian-projected theory of the SU(3)-gluodynamics isinvestigated in the dilute gas approximation. An essential difference of thissystem from the SU(2)-case is the presence of two interacting gases of vortexloops. Two alternative representations for the partition function of such agrand canonical ensemble are derived, and one of them, which is arepresentation in terms of the integrals over vortex loops, is employed for theevaluation of the correlators of both kinds of loops in the low-energy limit.
