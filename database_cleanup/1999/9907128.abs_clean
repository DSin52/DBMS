We study a configuration in matrix theory carying longitudinal fivebranecharge, i.e. a D0-D4 bound state. We calculate the one-loop effective potentialbetween a D0-D4 bound state and a D0-anti-D4 bound state and compare ourresults to a supergravity calculation. Next, we identify the tachyonicfluctuations in the D0-D4 and D0-anti-D4 system. We analyse classically theaction for these tachyons and find solutions to the equations of motioncorresponding to tachyon condensation.
