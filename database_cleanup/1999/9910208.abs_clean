Title: Domain walls in supersymmetric QCD

Authors: B. de Carlos, J.M. Moreno

Comments: 4 pages, 1 figure, uses latex with hep99 class files. Presented at

the International Europhysics Conference in High Energy Physics, Tampere(Finland) 15-21 July 1999We consider domain walls that appear in supersymmetric SU(N) with one massiveflavour. In particular, for N > 3 we explicitly construct the elementary domainwall that interpolates between two contiguous vacua. We show that thesesolutions are BPS saturated for any value of the mass of the matter fields. Wealso comment on their large N limit and their relevance for supersymmetricgluodynamics.
