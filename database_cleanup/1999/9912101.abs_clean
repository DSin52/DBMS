Title: Discrete Torsion and Symmetric Products

Comments: latex, 18 pages

In this note we point out that a symmetric product orbifold CFT can betwisted by a unique nontrivial two-cocycle of the permutation group. Thisdiscrete torsion changes the spins and statistics of correspondingsecond-quantized string theory making it essentially ``supersymmetric.'' Thelong strings of even length become fermionic (or ghosts), those of odd lengthbosonic. The partition function and elliptic genus can be described by a sumover stringy spin structures. The usual cubic interaction vertex is odd andnilpotent, so this construction gives rise to a DLCQ string theory with aleading quartic interaction.
