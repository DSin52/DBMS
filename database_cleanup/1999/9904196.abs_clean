We use N=2 harmonic and projective superspaces to formulate the most general`Ansatz' for the SU(2)_R invariant hypermultiplet low-energy effective action(LEEA) in four dimensions, which describes the two-parametric family of thehyper-K"ahler metrics generalizing the Atiyah-Hitchin metric. We thendemonstrate in the very explicit and manifestly N=2 supersymmetric way that the(magnetically charged, massive) single hypermultiplet LEEA in the underlyingnon-abelian N=2 supersymmetric quantum field theory can receive bothperturbative (e.g., in the Coulomb branch) and non-perturbative (e.g., in theHiggs branch) quantum corrections. The manifestly N=2 supersymmetric Feynmanrules in harmonic superspace can be used to calculate the perturbativecorrections described by the Taub-NUT metric. The non-perturbative corrections(due to instantons and anti-instantons) can be encoded in terms of an ellipticcurve, which is very reminiscent to the Seiberg-Witten theory. Ourfour-dimensional results agree with the three-dimensional Seiberg-Witten theoryand instanton calculations.
