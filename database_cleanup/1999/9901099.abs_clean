627-670The recently discovered formalism underlying renormalization theory, the Hopfalgebra of rooted trees, allows to generalize Chen's lemma. In its generalizedform it describes the change of a scale in Green functions, and hence relatesto the operator product expansion. Hand in hand with this generalization goesthe generalization of the ordinary factorial $n!$ to the tree factorial $t^!$.Various identities on tree-factorials are derived which clarify the relationbetween Connes-Moscovici weights and Quantum Field Theory.
