In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we perform a direct computationin AdS_5 supergravity of the trace anomaly of a d=4, N=2 SCFT. We findagreement with the field theory result up to next to leading order in the 1/Nexpansion. In particular, the order N gravitational contribution to the anomalyis obtained from a Riemann tensor squared term in the 7-brane effective actiondeduced from heterotic - type I duality. We also discuss, in the AdS/CFTcontext, the order N corrections to the trace anomaly in d=4, N=4 SCFTsinvolving SO or Sp gauge groups.
