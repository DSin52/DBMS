Title: Killing spinors, supersymmetries and rotating intersecting branes

Authors: P.K. Townsend

Comments: To appear in proceedings of the 22nd Johns Hopkins Workshop,

Gothenburg, 1998. Latex 6ppI review a recently proposed method for determining the symmetry superalgebraof a supergravity configuration from its Killing spinors, and its applicationto the `near-horizon' limits of various rotating and intersecting branes.
