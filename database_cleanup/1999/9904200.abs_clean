Title: The Abelian projection versus the Hitchin fibration of K(D) pairs in

four-dimensional QCDComments: 11 pages, latex, no figures, a misprint corrected

We point out that the concept of Abelian projection gives us a physicalinterpretation of the role that the Hitchin fibration of parabolic K(D) pairsplays in the large-N limit of four-dimensional QCD. This physicalinterpretation furnishes also a simple criterium for the confinement ofelectric fluxes in the large-N limit of QCD. There is also an alternative,compatible interpretation, based on the QCD string.
