We note that S-matrix/conserved charge identities in affine Toda fieldtheories of the type recently noted by Khastgir can be put on a more systematicfooting. This makes use of a result first found by Ravanini, Tateo andValleriani for theories based on the simply-laced Lie algebras (A,D and E)which we extend to the nonsimply-laced case. We also present the generalisationto nonsimply-laced cases of the observation - for simply-laced situations -that the conserved charges form components of the eigenvectors of the Cartanmatrix.
