Given a symmetry group acting on a principal fibre bundle, symmetric statesof the quantum theory of a diffeomorphism invariant theory of connections onthis fibre bundle are defined. These symmetric states, equipped with a scalarproduct derived from the Ashtekar-Lewandowski measure for loop quantum gravity,form a Hilbert space of their own. Restriction to this Hilbert space yields aquantum symmetry reduction procedure in the framework of spin network statesthe structure of which is analyzed in detail. Three illustrating examples aresymmetric electromagnetism and spherically symmetric gravity.
