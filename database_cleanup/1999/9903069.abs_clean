Title: New Gauge Invariant Formulation of the Chern-Simons Gauge Theory

Classical and Quantal AnalysisComments: No figures, 44 pages

Recently proposed new gauge invariant formulation of the Chern-Simons gaugetheory is considered in detail. This formulation is consistent with the gaugefixed formulation. Furthermore it is found that the canonical (Noether)Poincar\'e generators are not gauge invariant even on the constraints surfaceand do not satisfy the Poincar\'e algebra contrast to usual case. It is theimproved generators, constructed from the symmetric energy-momentum tensor,which are (manifestly) gauge invariant and obey the quantum as well asclassical Poincar\'e algebra. The physical states are constructed and it isfound in the Schr\"odinger picture that unusual gauge invariant longitudinalmode of the gauge field is crucial for constructing the physical wavefunctionalwhich is genuine to (pure) Chern-Simons theory. In matching to the gauge fixedformulation, we consider three typical gauges, Coulomb, axial and Weyl gaugesas explicit examples. Furthermore, recent several confusions about the effectof Dirac's dressing function and the gauge fixings are clarified. The analysisaccording to old gauge independent formulation a' la Dirac is summarized in anappendix.
