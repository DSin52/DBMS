We study brane configurations for four dimensional N=1 supersymmetric gaugetheories with quartic superpotentials which flow in the infrared to manifoldsof interacting superconformal fixed points. We enumerate finite N=2 theories,from which a large class of marginal N=1 theories descend. We give the branedescriptions of these theories in Type IIA and Type IIB string theory. The TypeIIB descriptions are in terms of D3 branes in orientifold and generalizedconifold backgrounds. We calculate the Weyl and Euler anomalies in thesetheories, and find that they are equal in elliptic models and unequal in alarge class of finite N=2 and marginal N=1 non-elliptic theories.
