The leading long-distance 1-loop quantum corrections to the Coulomb potentialare derived for scalar QED and their gauge-independence is explicitly checked.The potential is obtained from the direct calculation of the 2-particlescattering amplitude, taking into account all relevant 1-loop diagrams. Ourinvestigation should be regarded as a first step towards the same programme foreffective Quantum Gravity. In particular, with our calculation in the frameworkof scalar QED, we are able to demonstrate the incompleteness of some previousstudies concerning the Quantum Gravity counterpart.
