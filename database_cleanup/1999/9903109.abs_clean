We present a new type-IIB supergravity vacuum that describes the strongcoupling regime of a non-supersymmetric gauge theory. The latter has a runningcoupling such that the theory becomes asymptotically free in the ultraviolet.It also has a running theta angle due to a non-vanishing axion field in thesupergravity solution. We also present a worm-hole solution, which has finiteaction per unit four-dimensional volume and two asymptotic regions, a flatspace and an AdS^5\times S^5. The corresponding N=2 gauge theory, instead ofbeing finite, has a running coupling. We compute the quark-antiquark potentialin this case and find that it exhibits, under certain assumptions, an area-lawbehaviour for large separations.
