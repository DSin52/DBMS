A gauge formulation for the Proca model quantum theory in an open pathfunctional space representation is revisited. The path dependent vacuum stateis obtained. Starting from this one, other excited states can be obtained too.Additionally, the functional integration measure needed to define an internalproduct in the state space is constructed.
