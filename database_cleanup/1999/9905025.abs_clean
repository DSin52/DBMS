The effect of fermionic string conductivity by purely right (or purely left)moving ``zero modes'' is shown to be governed by a simple Lagrangiancharacterising a certain ``chiral'' (null current carrying) string model whosedynamical equations of motion turn out to be explicitly integrable in a flatspacetime background.
