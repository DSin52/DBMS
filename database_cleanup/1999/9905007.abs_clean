A recent study shows that Hawking radiation of the massless scalar field doesnot appear on the two-dimensional AdS$_2$ black hole background. We study thisissue by investigating absorption and reflection coefficients under dilatoncoupling with the matter field. If the scalar field does not couple to thedilaton, then it is fully absorbed into the black hole without any outgoingmode. On the other hand, once it couples to the dilaton field, the outgoingmode of the massless scalar field exists and the nontrivial Hawking radiationis obtained. Finally, we comment on this dilaton dependence of Hawkingradiation in connection with a three-dimensional black hole.
