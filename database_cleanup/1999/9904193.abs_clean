We present an approach to studying the Casimir effects by means of theeffective theory. An essential point of our approach is replacing the mirrorseparation into the size of space S^1 in the adiabatic approximation. It isnatural to identify the size of space S^1 with the scale factor of theRobertson-Walker-type metric. This replacement simplifies the construction of aclass of effective models to study the Casimir effects. To check the validityof this replacement we construct a model for a scalar field coupling to thetwo-dimensional gravity and calculate the Casimir effects by the effectiveaction for the variable scale factor. Our effective action consists of theclassical kinetic term of the mirror separation and the quantum correctionderived by the path-integral method. The quantum correction naturally containsboth the Casimir energy term and the back-reaction term of the dynamicalCasimir effect, the latter of which is expressed by the conformal anomaly. Theresultant effective action describes the dynamical vacuum pressure, i.e., thedynamical Casimir force. We confirm that the force depends on the relativevelocity of the mirrors, and that it is always attractive and stronger than thestatic Casimir force within the adiabatic approximation.
