Title: T-duality and Gauge Theories from Near Horizon Dp-branes

Authors: Pedro J. Silva

Comments: 19 pages, 2 figures

We study the significance of T-duality in the context of the gravitationaldescription of gauge theories. We found that T-duality relates the deferentspoints of the moduli of a given gauge theory always far from the conformalfixed point. Also the described gauge theories seems to flow naturally to theable conformal points, those that naturally saturate all the possible knownexamples of near horizon geometries. Supersymmetry properties and T-dualitybreaking of it are discuss.
