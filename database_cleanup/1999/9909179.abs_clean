We present a calculation of three point functions for a class of chiraloperators, including the primary ones, in d = 3, N = 8; d = 6, N = (2,0) and d= 4, N = 4 superconformal field theories at large N. These theories are relatedto the infrared world-volume descriptions of N coincident M2, M5 and D3 branes,respectively. The calculation is done in the framework of the AdS/CFTcorrespondence and can be given a unified treatment employing a gravitationalaction in arbitrary dimensions D, coupled to a p+1 form and suitablycompactified on AdS(D-2-p) x S(2+p). The interesting cases are obtained setting(D,p) to the values (11,5), (11,2) and (10,3).
