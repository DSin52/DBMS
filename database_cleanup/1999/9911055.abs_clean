We discuss the weak gravitational field created by isolated matter sources inthe Randall-Sundrum brane-world. In the case of two branes of opposite tension,linearized Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity is recovered on either wall, with differentBD parameters. On the wall with positive tension the BD parameter is largerthan 3000 provided that the separation between walls is larger than 4 times theAdS radius. For the wall of negative tension, the BD parameter is alwaysnegative but greater than -3/2. In either case, shadow matter from the otherwall gravitates upon us. For equal Newtonian mass, light deflection from shadowmatter is 25 % weaker than from ordinary matter. Hence, the effective mass of aclustered object containing shadow dark matter would be underestimated ifnaively measured through its lensing effect. For the case of a single wall ofpositive tension, Einstein gravity is recovered on the wall to leading order,and if the source is stationary the field stays localized near the wall. Wecalculate the leading Kaluza-Klein corrections to the linearized gravitationalfield of a non-relativistic spherical object and find that the metric isdifferent from the Schwarzschild solution at large distances. We believe thatour linearized solution corresponds to the field far from the horizon aftergravitational collapse of matter on the brane.
