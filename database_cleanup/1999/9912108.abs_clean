The cancellation of U(1)-gauge and U(1)-gravitational anomalies in certainD=4 N=1 Type IIB orientifolds is analyzed in detail, from a string theory pointof view. We verify the proposal that these anomalies are cancelled by aGreen-Schwarz mechanism involving only twisted Ramond-Ramond fields. Byfactorizing one-loop partition functions, we also get the anomalous couplingsof D-branes, O-planes and orbifold fixed-points to these twisted fields.Twisted sectors with fixed-planes participate to the inflow mechanism in apeculiar way.
