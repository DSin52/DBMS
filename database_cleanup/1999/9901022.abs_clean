Some time ago, conformal data with affine fusion rules were found. Ourpurpose here is to realize some of these conformal data, using systems of freebosons and parafermions. The so constructed theories have an extended $W$algebras which are close analogues of affine algebras. Exact character formulaeis given, and the realizations are shown to be full fledged unitary conformalfield theories.
