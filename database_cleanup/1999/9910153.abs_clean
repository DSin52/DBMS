We investigate the superconformal transformation properties of thesupercurrent as well as of the superconformal anomalies themselves in d=4, N=1supersymmetric quantum field theory. Matter supercurrent and anomalies arecoupled to a classical background of minimal supergravity fields. On flatsuperspace, there exist two different types of the superconformal Ward identity(called S and B) which correspond to the flat space limits of old resp. newminimal background supergravity fields. In the present publication we giveparticular importance to the new minimal case. A general formalism is set upwhich is then applied to the massless Wess-Zumino model.
