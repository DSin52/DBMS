We determine the spectrum of graviton excitations in the background geometryof the AdS soliton in p+2 dimensions. Via the AdS/CFT correspondence thiscorresponds to determining the spectrum of spin two excitations in the dualeffective p-dimensional field theories For the cases of D3- and M5-branes theseare the spin two glueballs of QCD_3 and QCD_4 respectively. For all values of pwe find an exact degeneracy of the spectra of these tensor states and certainscalar excitations. Our results also extend the perturbative proof of apositive energy conjecture for asymptotically locally AdS spacetimes(originally proposed for p=3) to an arbritrary number of dimensions.
