We study a new class of N=1 supersymmetric orientifolds in six space-timedimensions. The world-sheet parity transformation is combined with apermutation of the internal complex coordinates. In contrast to ordinaryorientifolds the twisted sectors contribute to the Klein bottle amplitudeleading to new tadpoles to be cancelled by twisted open string sectors. Theyarise from open strings stretched between D7-branes intersecting at non-trivialangles. We study in detail the Z_3, Z_4 and Z_6 permutational orientifoldsobtaining in all cases anomaly free massless spectra.
