The general method of the reduction in the number of coupling parameters isdiscussed. Using renormalization group invariance, theories with severalindependent couplings are related to a set of theories with a single couplingparameter. The reduced theories may have particular symmetries, or they may notbe related to any known symmetry. The method is more general than theimposition of invariance properties. Usually, there are only a few reducedtheories with an asymptotic power series expansion corresponding to arenormalizable Lagrangian. There also exist `general' solutions containingnon-integer powers and sometimes logarithmic factors. As an example for the useof the reduction method, the dual magnetic theories associated with certainsupersymmetric gauge theories are discussed. They have a superpotential with aYukawa coupling parameter. This parameter is expressed as a function of thegauge coupling. Given some standard conditions, a unique, isolated power seriessolution of the reduction equations is obtained. After reparametrization, theYukawa coupling is proportional to the square of the gauge coupling parameter.The coefficient is given explicitly in terms of the numbers of colors andflavors. `General' solutions with non-integer powers are also discussed. Abrief list is given of other applications of the reduction method.
