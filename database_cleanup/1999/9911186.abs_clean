We explore quantum states of instanton solitons in five dimensionalnoncommutative Yang-Mills theories. We start with maximally supersymmetric U(N)theory compactified on a circle S^1, and derive the low energy dynamics ofinstanton solitons, or calorons, which is no longer singular. Quantizing thelow energy dynamics, we find N physically distinct ground states with a unitPontryagin number and no electric charge. These states have a natural D-stringinterpretation. The conclusion remains unchanged as we decompactify S^1, aslong as we stay in the Coulomb phase by turning on adjoint Higgs expectationvalues.
