Recently, Dorey and Tateo have investigated functional relations among Stokesmultipliers for a Schr{\"o}dinger equation (second order differential equation)with a polynomial potential term in view of solvable models. Here we extendtheir studies to a restricted case of n+1-th order linear differentialequations.
