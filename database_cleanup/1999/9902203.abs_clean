Title: The structure of the exact effective action and the quark confinement in

MSSM QCDAuthors: K.Stepanyantz

Comments: Final version to appear in Sov.J.Nucl.Phys. Some insignificant errors

and misprints are correctedAn expression for the exact (nonperturbative) effective action of $N$=1supersymmetric gauge theories is proposed, supposing, that all particles exceptfor the gauge bosons are massive. Analysis of its form shows, that instantoneffects in the supersymmetric theories can lead to the quark confinement. Thetypical scale of confinement in MSSM QCD, calculated from the first principles,is in agreement with the experimental data. The proposed explanation is quitedifferent from the dual Higgs mechanism.
