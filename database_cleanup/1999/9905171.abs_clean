We study the behavior of bound energy levels for the case of two classicalinteracting fields $\phi$ and $\chi$ in a finite domain (box) in (1 + 1)dimension on which we impose Dirichlet boundary conditions (DBC). The totalLagrangian contain a $\frac{\lambda}{4}\phi^4$ self-interaction and aninteraction term given by $g \phi^2 \chi^2$. We calculate the energyeigenfunctions and its correspondent eigenvalues and study their dependence onratio $\beta = \frac{M^{2}_{\chi}}{M^{2}_{\phi}}$, and interaction couplingconstants $\lambda$ and $g$. We show that for some configurations of the aboveparameters, there exists critical sizes of the box for which instability pointsof the field $\chi$ appear.
