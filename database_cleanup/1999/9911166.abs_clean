We consider the modified superfield constraints with constant terms for theD=3, N=2 Goldstone-Maxwell gauge multiplet which contains Goldstone fermions,real scalar and vector fields. The partial spontaneous breaking N=2 to N=1 ispossible for the non-minimal self-interaction of this modified gauge superfieldincluding the linear Fayet-Iliopoulos term. The dual description of the partialbreaking in the model of the self-interacting Goldstone chiral superfield isalso discussed.
