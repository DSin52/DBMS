Title: Canonical structure and boundary conditions in Yang-Mills theory

Authors: Christofer Cronstrom

The canonical structure of pure Yang-Mills theory is analysed in the casewhen Gauss' law is satisfied identically by construction. It is shown that thetheory has a canonical structure in this case, provided one uses a specialgauge condition, which is a natural generalisation of the Coulomb gaugecondition of electrodynamics. The emergence of a canonical structure dependscritically also on the boundary conditions used for the relevant fieldvariables. Possible boundary conditions are analysed in detail. A comparison ofthe present formulation in the generalised Coulomb gauge with the well knownWeyl gauge ($A_{0} = 0$) formulation is made. It appears that the Hamiltoniansin these two formulations differ from one another in a non-trivial way. It isstill an open question whether these differences give rise to truly differentstructures upon quantisation. An extension of the formalism to include couplingto fermionic fields is briefly discussed.
