The compactification of five dimensional N=2 SUSY Yang-Mills (YM) theory ontoa circle provides a four dimensional YM model with N=4 SUSY. This supersymmetrycan be broken down to N=2 if non-trivial boundary conditions in the compactdimension, \phi(x_5 +R) = e^{2\pi i\epsilon}\phi(x_5), are imposed on half ofthe fields. This two-parameter (R,\epsilon) family of compactificationsincludes as particular limits most of the previously studied four dimensionalN=2 SUSY YM models with supermultiplets in the adjoint representation of thegauge group. The finite-dimensional integrable system associated to thesetheories via the Seiberg-Witten construction is the generic ellipticRuijsenaars-Schneider model. In particular the perturbative (weak coupling)limit is described by the trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider model.
