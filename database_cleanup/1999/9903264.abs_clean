The slow motion of a self-gravitating CP^1 lump is investigated in theapproximation of geodesic flow on the moduli space of unit degree staticsolutions M_1. It is found that moduli which are frozen in the absence ofgravity, parametrizing the lump's width and internal orientation, may vary oncegravitational effects are included. If gravitational coupling is sufficientlystrong, the presence of the lump shrinks physical space to finite volume, andthe moduli determining the boundary value of the CP^1 field thaw also. Explicitformulae for the metric on M_1 are found in both the weak and strong couplingregimes. The geodesic problem for weak coupling is studied in detail, and it isshown that M_1 is geodesically incomplete. This leads to the prediction thatself-gravitating lumps are unstable.
