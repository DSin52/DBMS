We provide a classification of the IIB D$p$- and NS$p$-branes in which thebrane action exists due to a non-trivial class of the Chevalley-Eilenbergcohomology of free differential algebras. We then present a new geometricformulation of the IIB D$p$- and NS$p$-branes ($p\leq 5$) in which themanifestly superinvariant Wess-Zumino terms are constructed in terms of thesupersymmetric currents. The supercurrents are obtained by using supergroupmanifolds corresponding to the IIB-brane superalgebra, which is characterizedby the generators of D3-, D5-, NS5- and KK5-branes in addition to thepreviously introduced generators of supertranslations, F- and D-strings. Thecharges of D1-, F1- and D3-branes are related to those of the M-algebra, butsome charges of D5- and NS5-branes are not. The S-duality of the type-IIBtheory is realized as transformations of the supercurrents generalizing theSO(2) R-symmetry of the superalgebra. We thus find that the superalgebra islifted into twelve-dimensions with signature (11,1).
