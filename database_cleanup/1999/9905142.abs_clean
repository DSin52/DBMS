After recalling how theERG can be introduced in a general theory (i.e. containing both bosons andfermions, scalars and vectors) and having applied it to the massless scalartheory as an example of how the method works, we discuss the formulation of theQuantum Action Principle (QAP) in the ERG and show that the Slavnov-Tayloridentities can be directly derived for the cutoff effective action at anymomentum scale. Firstly the QAP is exploited to analyse the breaking ofdilatation invariance occurring in the scalar theory in this approach. Then weaddress SU(N) Yang-Mills theory and extensively treat the key issue of theboundary conditions of the flow equation which, in this case, have also toensure restoration of symmetry for the physical theory. In case of a chiralgauge theory, we show how the chiral anomaly can be obtained in the ERG.Finally, we extend the ERG formulation to supersymmetric (gauge) theories. Itis emphasized regularization is implemented in such a way that supersymmetry ispreserved.
