It is known that if we compactify D0-branes on a torus with constant B-field,the resulting theory becomes SYM theory on a noncommutative dual torus. Wediscuss the extension to the case of a H-field background. In the case ofconstant H-field on a three-torus, we derive the constraints to realize thiscompactification by considering the correspondence to string theory. We carryout this work as a first step to examine the possibility to describe transverseM5-branes in Matrix theory.
