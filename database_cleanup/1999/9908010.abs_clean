According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, the strong coupling limit of largen, N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory at finite temperature is described byasymptotically anti de Sitter black holes. These black holes exist with planar,spherical and hyperbolic horizon geometries. We concentrate on the hyperbolicand spherical cases and probe the associated gauge theories with D3-branes andWilson loops. The D3-brane probe reproduces the coupling of the scalars in thegauge theory to the background geometry and we find thermal stabilization inthe hyperbolic case. We investigate the vacuum expectation value of Wilsonloops with particular emphasis on the screening length at finite temperature.We find that the thermal phase transition of the theory on the sphere is notrelated to screening phenomena.
