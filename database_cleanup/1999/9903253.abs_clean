A singular configuration of external static magnetic field in the form of apointlike vortex polarizes the vacuum of quantized massless spinor field in2+1-dimensional space-time. This results in an analogue of the Bohm-Aharonovemerge in the vacuum even in the case when the spatial region of nonvanishingexternal field strength is excluded. The dependence of the vacuumcharacteristics both on the value of the vortex flux and on the choice of theboundary condition at the location of the vortex is determined.
