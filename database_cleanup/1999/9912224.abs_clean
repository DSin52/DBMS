I review some recent work (done in collaboration with G. Veneziano) whichclarifies the existence of a correspondence between self-gravitatingfundamental string states and Schwarzschild black holes. The main result is adetailed calculation showing that self-gravity causes a typical string state ofmass M to shrink, as the string coupling g^2 increases, down to a compactstring state whose mass, size, entropy and luminosity match (for the criticalvalue g_c^2 = (M sqrt{alpha'})^{-1}) those of a Schwarzschild black hole. Thisconfirms the idea that the entropy of black holes can be accounted for bycounting string states, and suggests that the level spacing of the quantumstates of Schwarzschild black holes is exponentially small, and very muchblurred by radiative effects.
