Title: A Note on Holographic Principle in models of Extended Inflation type

Comments: 4 pages. Latex file

We present a simple derivation of an upper bound on the average size of thetrue vacuum bubbles at the end of inflation, in models of extended inflationtype. The derivation uses the inequality that the total energy inside a givenvolume must be less than its linear dimensions. The above bound is the same asthat obtained earlier, by applying the holographic principle according toFischler-Susskind prescription. Such a bound leads to a lower bound on thedenisty fluctuations.
