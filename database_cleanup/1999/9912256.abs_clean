The zero-hamiltonian problem, present in reparametrization invariant systems,is solved for the 2-D induced gravity model. Working with methods developed byHenneaux et al. we find systematically the reduced phase-space physics,generated by an {\it effective} hamiltonian obtained after complete gaugefixing.
