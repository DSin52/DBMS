Title: Finite-temperature supersymmetry as a constrained supergravity

Authors: C. Lucchesi

Comments: 5 pages, LaTeX. Talk presented at ``Strong and Electroweak Matter

98", Copenhagen, December 2-5 1998We introduce thermal superspace and show how it can be used to reconcile thesuperfield formulation of supersymmetry with finite temperature environments
