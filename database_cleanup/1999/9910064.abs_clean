Title: Large Extra Dimensions and Noncommutative Geometry in String Theory

Authors: Farhad Ardalan

Comments: 8 pages, no figures, LaTeX format

The consequences of noncommutativity of space coordinates of string theory inthe proposed large extra dimension solution to the hierarchy problem areexplored; in particular the large dimension stabilization and the gravitonreabsorption in the brane are considered.
