We show that the decay spectrum of massive excitations in perturbative stringtheories is thermal when averaged over the (many) initial degenerate states. Wefirst compute the inclusive photon spectrum for open strings at the tree levelshowing that a black body spectrum with the Hagedorn temperature emerges in theaveraging. A similar calculation for a massive closed string state with windingand Kaluza-Klein charges shows that the emitted graviton spectrum is thermalwith a "grey-body" factor, which approaches one near extremality. These resultsuncover a simple physical meaning of the Hagedorn temperature and provide anexplicit microscopic derivation of the black body spectrum from a unitary $S$matrix.
