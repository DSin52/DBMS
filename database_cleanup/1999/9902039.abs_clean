This paper discusses in a systematical way exact retarded solutions to theclassical SU(N) Yang-Mills equations with the source composed of severalcolored point particles. A new method of finding such solutions is reviewed.Relying on features of the solutions, a toy model of quark binding issuggested. According to this model, quarks forming a hadron are influenced byno confining force in spite of the presence of a linearly rising term of thepotential. The large-N dynamics of quarks conforms well with Witten'sphenomenology. On the semiclassical level, hadrons are color neutral in theGauss law sense. Nevertheless, a specific multiplet structure is observable inthe form of the Regge sequences related to infinite-dimensional unitaryrepresentations of SL(4,R) which is shown to be the color gauge group of thebackground field generated by any hadron. The simultaneous consideration ofSU(N), SO(N), and Sp(N) as gauge groups offers a plausible explanation of thefact that clusters containing two or three quarks are more stable thanmultiquark clusters.
