There is a close relation between classical supergravity and quantum SYMdescriptions of interactions between separated branes. In the case of D3branes, the equivalence of leading-order potentials is due tonon-renormalization of the F^4 term in N=4 SYM theory. Here we point out theexistence of another special non-renormalized term in quantum SYM effectiveaction. This term reproduces the interaction potential between electric chargeof a D3-brane probe and magnetic charge of a D3-brane source, represented bythe Chern-Simons part of the D-brane action. This unique Wess-Zumino termdepends on all six scalar fields and originates from a phase of the euclideanfermion determinant in SYM theory. It is manifestly scale invariant (i.e. isthe same for large and small separations between branes) and can not receivehigher loop corrections in gauge theory. Maximally supersymmetric SYM theoriesin D=p+1>4 contain mixed WZ terms which depend on both scalar and gauge fieldbackgrounds, and which reproduce the corresponding CS terms in the supergravityinteraction potentials between separated Dp-branes for p>3. Purely scalar WZterms appear in other cases, e.g., in N=2 gauge theories in various dimensionsdescribing magnetic interactions between Dp and D(6-p) branes.
