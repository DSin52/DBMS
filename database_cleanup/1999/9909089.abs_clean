We study global worldsheet anomalies for open strings ending on severalcoincident D-branes in the presence of a B-field. We show that cancellation ofanomalies is made possible by a correlation between the t'Hooft magnetic fluxon the D-branes and the topological class of the B-field. One application ofour results is a proper understanding of the geometric nature of the gaugeis a connection on a module over a certain noncommutative algebra. Our argumentworks for a general closed string background. We also explain why in thepresence of a topologically nontrivial B-field whose curvature is pure torsionD-branes represent classes in a twisted K-theory, as conjectured by E. Witten.
