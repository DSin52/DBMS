We study the divergence of large-order perturbation theory in the worldlineexpression for the two-loop Euler-Heisenberg QED effective Lagrangian in aconstant magnetic field. The leading rate of divergence is identical, up to anoverall factor, to that of the one-loop case. From this we deduce, using Borelsummation techniques, that the leading behaviour of the imaginary part of thetwo-loop effective Lagrangian for a constant E field, giving thepair-production rate, is proportional to the one-loop result. This also servesas a test of the mass renormalization, and confirms the earlier analysis byRitus.
