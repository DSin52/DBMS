We define a special matrix multiplication among a special subset of $2N\x 2N$matrices, and study the resulting (non-associative) algebras and theirsubalgebras. We derive the conditions under which these algebras becomealternative non-associative and when they become associative. In particular,these algebras yield special matrix representations of octonions and complexnumbers; they naturally lead to the Cayley-Dickson doubling process. Our matrixrepresentation of octonions also yields elegant insights into Dirac's equationfor a free particle. A few other results and remarks arise as byproducts.
