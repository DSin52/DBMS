Via supersymmetry argument, we determine the effective action of the SU(2)supersymmetric Yang-Mills quantum mechanics up to two constants, which resultsfrom the full supersymmetric completion of the F^4 term. The effective action,consisting of zero, two, four, six and eight fermion terms, agrees with theknown perturbative one-loop calculations from the type II string theory and thematrix theory. Our derivation thus demonstrates its non-renormalizationproperties, namely, the one-loop exactness of the aforementioned action and theabsence of the non-perturbative corrections. We briefly discuss generalizationsto other branes and the comparison to the DLCQ supergravity analysis. Inparticular, our results show that the stringent constraints from thesupersymmetry are responsible for the agreement between the matrix theory andsupergravity with sixteen supercharges.
