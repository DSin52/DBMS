The spectrum of massless bosonic and fermionic fluids satisfying the equationof state $p=(\gamma-1)\rho$ is derived using elementary statistical methods. Asa limiting case, the Lorentz invariant spectrum of the vacuum ($\gamma=0,p=-\rho$) is deduced. These results are in agreement with our earlierderivation for bosons using thermodynamics and semiclassical considerations.
