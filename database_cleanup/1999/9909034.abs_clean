We present unique solutions of the Seiberg-Witten Monopole Equations in whichthe U(1) curvature is covariantly constant, the monopole Weyl spinor consistsof a single constant component, and the 4-manifold is a product of two Riemannsurfaces of genuses p_1 and p_2. There are p_1 -1 magnetic vortices on onesurface and p_2 - 1 electric ones on the other, with p_1 + p_2 \geq 2 p_1 =p_2= 1 being excluded). When p_1 = p_2, the electromagnetic fields areself-dual and one also has a solution of the coupled euclideanEinstein-Maxwell-Dirac equations, with the monopole condensate serving ascosmological constant. The metric is decomposable and the electromagneticfields are covariantly constant as in the Bertotti-Robinson solution. TheEinstein metric can also be derived from a K\"{a}hler potential satisfying theMonge-Amp\`{e}re equations.
