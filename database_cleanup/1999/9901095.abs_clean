Title: Black Holes, Branes and Superconformal Symmetry

Comments: 34 pages, Latex. To be published in the Proceedings of a conference

held in Corfu, Greece in September 1998. Improvement in Sec. 3.3The main focus of this lecture is on extended objects in adS*S bosonicbackgrounds with unbroken supersymmetry. The backgrounds are argued to beexact, special consideration are given to the non-maximal supersymmetry case.The near horizon superspace construction is explained. The superconformalsymmetry appears in the worldvolume actions as the superisometry of the nearhorizon superspace, like the superPoincare symmetry of GS superstring and BSTsupermembrane in the flat superspace. The issues in gauge fixing of localkappa-symmetry are reviewed. We describe the features of the gauge-fixed IIBsuperstring in adS(5)*S(5) background with RR 5-form. From a truncated boundaryversion of it we derive an analytic N=2 off shell harmonic superspace ofYang-Mills theory. The reality condition of the analytic subspace, whichincludes the antipodal map on the sphere, has a simple meaning of the symmetryof the string action in the curved space. The relevant issues of black holesand superconformal mechanics are addressed.
