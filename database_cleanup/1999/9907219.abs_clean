In this paper we discuss candidate superconformal N=2 gauge theories thatrealize the AdS/CFT correspondence with M--theory compactified on thehomogeneous Sasakian 7-manifolds M^7 that were classified long ago. Inparticular we focus on the two cases M^7=Q^{1,1,1} and M^7=M^{1,1,1}, for thelatter the Kaluza Klein spectrum being completely known. We show how the toricdescription of M^7 suggests the gauge group and the supersingleton fields. Theconformal dimensions of the latter can be independently calculated bycomparison with the mass of baryonic operators that correspond to 5-braneswrapped on supersymmetric 5-cycles and are charged with respect to the Bettimultiplets. The entire Kaluza Klein spectrum of short multiplets agrees withthese dimensions. Furthermore, the metric cone over the Sasakian manifold is aconifold algebraically embedded in some C^p. The ring of chiral primary fieldsis defined as the coordinate ring of C^p modded by the ideal generated by theembedding equations; this ideal has a nice characterization by means ofrepresentation theory. The entire Kaluza Klein spectrum is explained in termsof these vanishing relations. We give the superfield interpretation of allshort multiplets and we point out the existence of many long multiplets withrational protected dimensions, whose presence and pattern seem to be universalin all compactifications.
