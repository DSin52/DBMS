We discuss absorption of scalars by a distribution of spinning D3-branes. TheD3-branes are multi-center solutions of supergravity theory. We solve the waveequation in various cases of supergravity backgrounds in which the equationbecomes separable. We show that the absorption coefficients exhibit a universalbehavior as functions of the angular momentum quantum number and the Hawkingtemperature. This behavior is similar to the form of the gray-body factors oneencounters in scattering by black-holes. Our discussion includes theproblematic case of spherically symmetric distributions of D-branes, whereresonances arise. We obtain the same universal form for the absorptioncoefficients, if the region enclosed by the D-branes is excluded from physicalconsiderations. Non-extremal D-branes are also discussed. The results aresimilar to the extremal cases, albeit at half the Hawking temperature. Wespeculate that new degrees of freedom enter as one moves away from extremality.
