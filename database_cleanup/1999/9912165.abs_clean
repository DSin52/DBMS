We consider systems of non-threshold bound states (D(p$-$2), Dp), for $2\le p\le 6$, in type II string theories. Each of them can be viewed as Dp braneswith a nonzero (rank two) Neveu-Schwarz $B$ field. We study the noncommutativeeffects in the gravity dual descriptions of noncommutative gauge theories forthese systems in the limit where the brane worldvolume theories decouple fromgravity. We find that the noncommutative effects are actually due to thepresence of infinitely many D(p$-$2) branes in the (D(p$-$2), Dp) system whichplay the dominant role over the Dp branes in the large $B$-field limit. Ourstudy indicates that Dp branes with a constant $B$-field represents dynamicallythe system of infinitely many D(p$-$2) branes without $B$-field in thedecoupling limit. This implies an equivalence between the noncommutativeYang-Mills in $(p + 1)$-dimensions and an ordinary Yang-Mills with gauge group$U (\infty)$ in $(p - 1)$-dimensions. We provide a physical explanation for thenew scale which measures the noncommutativity.
