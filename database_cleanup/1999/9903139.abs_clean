D-branes in curved backgrounds can be treated with techniques of boundaryconformal field theory. We discuss the influence of scalar condensates on suchbranes, i.e. perturbations of boundary conditions by marginal boundaryoperators. A general criterion is presented that guarantees a boundaryperturbation to be truly marginal in all orders of perturbation theory. Ourresults on boundary deformations have several interesting applications whichare sketched at the end of this note.
