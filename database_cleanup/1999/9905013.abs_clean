The production of electron-positron pairs in a time-dependent magnetic fieldis estimated in the hypotheses that the magnetic field is uniform over largedistances with respect to the pair localization and it is so strong that thespacing of the Landau levels is larger than the rest mass of the particles.This calculation is presented since it has been suggested that extremelyintense and varying magnetic fields may be found around some astrophysicalobjects.
