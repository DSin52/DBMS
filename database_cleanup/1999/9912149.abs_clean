Title: Calculation of the phi^4 6-loop non-zeta transcendental

Authors: Oliver Schnetz

Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX, no figures

We present an analytic calculation of the first transcendental inphi^4-Theory that is not of the form zeta(2n+1). It is encountered at 6 loopsand known to be a weight 8 double sum. Here it is obtained by reducing multiplezeta values of depth <= 4. We give a closed expression in terms of azeta-related sum for a family of diagrams that entails a class of physicalgraphs. We confirm that this class produces multiple zeta values of weightsequal to the crossing numbers of the related knots.
