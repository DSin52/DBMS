We discuss the quantum mechanics of a particle in a magnetic field when itsposition x^{\mu} is restricted to a periodic lattice, while its momentump^{\mu} is restricted to a periodic dual lattice. Through these considerationswe define non-commutative geometry on the lattice. This leads to a deformationof the algebra of functions on the lattice, such that their product involves a``diamond'' product, which becomes the star product in the continuum limit. Weapply these results to construct non-commutative U(1) and U(M) gauge theories,and show that they are equivalent to a pure U(NM) matrix theory, where N^{2} isthe number of lattice points.
