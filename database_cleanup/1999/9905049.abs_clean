A new method is discussed which vastly simplifies one of the two integralsover AdS(d+1) required to compute exchange graphs for 4-point functions ofscalars in the AdS/CFT correspondence. The explicit form of the bulk-to-bulkpropagator is not required. Previous results for scalar, gauge boson andgraviton exchange are reproduced, and new results are given for massivevectors. It is found that precisely for the cases that occur in the AdS(5) XS(5) compactification of Type IIB supergravity, the exchange diagrams reduce toa finite sum of graphs with quartic scalar vertices. The analogous integrals inn-point scalar diagrams for n>4 are also evaluated.
