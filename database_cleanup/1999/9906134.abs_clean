The thermal dynamics of D-branes and of open superstrings in background gaugefields is studied. It is shown that D-brane dynamics forbids constant velocitymotion at finite temperature. T-duality is used to interpret this feature as aconsequence of the absence of an equilibrium state of charged strings at finitetemperature in a constant background electric field, as a result of Debyescreening of electric fields. The effective action for the Polyakov loopoperator is computed and the corresponding screening solutions are described.The finite temperature theory is also used to illustrate the importance ofcarefully incorporating Wu-Yang terms into the string path integral for compacttarget spaces.
