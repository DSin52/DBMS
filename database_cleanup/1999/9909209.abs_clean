Recent progress achieved in the solution of the problem of confinement invarious (non-)Abelian gauge theories by virtue of a derivation of their stringrepresentation is reviewed. The theories under study include QCD within theso-called Method of Field Correlators, QCD-inspired Abelian-projected theories,and compact QED in three and four space-time dimensions. Variousnonperturbative properties of the vacua of the above mentioned theories arediscussed. The relevance of the Method of Field Correlators to the study ofconfinement in Abelian models, allowing for an analytical description of thisphenomenon, is illustrated by an evaluation of field correlators in thesemodels.
