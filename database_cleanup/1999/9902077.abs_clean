We propose a method to construct quantum theory of matter fields in atopology changing universe. Analytic continuation of the semiclassical gravityof a Lorentzian geometry leads to a non-unitary Schr\"{o}dinger equation in aEuclidean region of spacetime, which does not have a direct interpretation ofquantum theory of the Minkowski spacetime. In this Euclidean region we quantizethe Euclidean geometry, derive the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation andfind the quantum states using the Liouville-Neumann method. The Wick rotationof these quantum states provides the correct Hilbert space of matter field inthe Euclidean region of the Lorentzian geometry. It is found that the directquantization of a scalar field in the Lorentzian geometry involves an unusualcommutation rule in the Euclidean region. Finally we discuss the interpretationof the periodic solution of the semiclassical gravity equation in the Euclideangeometry as a finite temperature solution for the gravity-matter system in theLorentzian geometry.
