We show that extremal correlators of chiral primary operators in N=4supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with SU(N) gauge group are neitherrenormalised at first order in perturbation theory nor receive contributionfrom any instanton sector at leading order in the semiclassical expansion. Thislends support to the strongest version of a new prediction recently put forwardon the basis of the AdS/SCFT correspondence.
