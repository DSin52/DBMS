We provide a gauge covariant formalism of the canonically quantized theory ofspin-3/2 Rarita-Schwinger gauge field. The theory admits a quantum gaugetransformation by which we can shift the gauge fixing parameter. The quantumgauge transformation does not change the BRST charge. Thus, the physicalHilbert space is trivially independent of the gauge fixing parameter.
