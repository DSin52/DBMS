We review the construction and theoretical implications of the USp(2k) matrixmodel in zero dimension introduced in ref. \cite{IT1,IT2}. It is argued thatthe model provides a constructive approach to Type I superstrings and is at thesemiclassical pictures and series of degenerate perturbative vacua associatedwith the worldvolume representation of the model, the formation of extended(D-)objects from the fermionic integrations via the (non-)abelian Berry phase,and the Schwinger-Dyson/loop equations which exhibit the joining-splittinginteractions required. Lectures presented at the 13th Nishinomiya-YukawaMemorial Symposium ``Dynamics of Fields and Strings'' (November 12-13,1998) andat the YITP workshop (November 16-18, 1998).
