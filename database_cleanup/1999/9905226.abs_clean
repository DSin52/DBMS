We derive the full Kaluza-Klein spectrum of type IIB supergravitycompactified on AdS_5 x T^{11} with T^{11} = (SU(2) x SU(2))/U(1). From theknowledge of the spectrum and general multiplet shortening conditions, we makea refined test of the AdS/CFT correspondence, by comparison between variousshortenings of SU(2,2|1) supermultiplets on AdS_5 and different families ofboundary operators with protected dimensions. Additional towers of longmultiplets with rational dimensions, that are not protected by supersymmetry,are also predicted from the supergravity analysis.
