Comments: Based on the lecture given at 13th Nishinomiya-Yukawa Memorial

I review a recent progress towards solution of the Almost Mathieu equation(A.G. Abanov, J.C. Talstra, P.B. Wiegmann, Nucl. Phys. B 525, 571, 1998), knownalso as Harper's equation or Azbel-Hofstadter problem. The spectrum of thisequation is known to be a pure singular continuum with a rich hierarchicalstructure. Few years ago it has been found that the almost Mathieu operator isintegrable. An asymptotic solution of this operator became possible dueanalysis the Bethe Ansatz equations.
