Title: Relativistic Partial Wave Analysis Using the Velocity Basis of the

Poincare GroupAuthors: A. Bohm, H. Kaldass

Comments: 14 pages; revtex

The velocity basis of the Poincare group is used in the direct product spaceof two irreducible unitary representations of the Poincare group. The velocitybasis with total angular momentum j will be used for the definition ofrelativistic Gamow vectors.
