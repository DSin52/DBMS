We show that there are two different dualities of two dimensional gaugetheories with N=(2,2) supersymmetry. One is basically a consequence of 3dmirror symmetry. The non-linear sigma model with Calabi-Yau target space on theHiggs branch of the gauge theory is mapped into an equivalent non-linear sigmamodel on the Coulomb branch of the dual theory, realizing a T-dual target spacewith torsion. The second duality is genuine to two dimensions. In addition toswapping Higgs and Coulomb branch it trades twisted for untwisted multiplets,implying a sign flip of the left moving U(1)_R charge. Succesive application ofboth dualities leads to geometric mirror symmetry for the target spaceCalabi-Yau.
