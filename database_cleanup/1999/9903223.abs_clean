By comparision with numerical results in the maximal Abelian projection oflattice Yang-Mills theory, it is argued that the nonperturbative dynamics ofYang Mills theory can be described by a set of fields that take their values inthe coset space SU(2)/U(1). The Yang-Mills connection is parameterized in aspecial way to separate the dependence on the coset field. The coset field isthen regarded as a collective variable, and a method to obtain its effectiveaction is developed. It is argued that the physical excitations of theeffective action may be knot solitons. A procedure to calculate the mass scaleof knot solitons is discussed for lattice gauge theories in the maximal Abelianprojection. The approach is extended to the SU(N) Yang-Mills theory. A relationbetween the large N limit and the monopole dominance is pointed out.
