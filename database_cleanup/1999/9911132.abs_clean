We give a general decomposition of SU(N) connection and derive a generalizedSkyrme-Faddeev action as the effective action of SU(N) QCD in the low energylimit. The result is obtained by separating the topological degrees whichdescribes the non-Abelian monopoles from the dynamical degree of gaugepotential, and integrating all the dynamical degrees of SU(N) QCD.
