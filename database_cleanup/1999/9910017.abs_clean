We consider the AdS space formulation of the classical dynamics deriving fromthe Stueckelberg Lagrangian. The on-shell action is shown to be free ofinfrared singularities as the vector boson mass tends to zero. In this limitthe model becomes Maxwell theory formulated in an arbitrary covariant gauge.Then we use the AdS/CFT correspondence to compute the two-point correlationfunctions on the boundary. It is shown that the gauge dependence concentrateson the contact terms.
