We aim to establish the holographic principle as a universal law, rather thana property only of static systems and special space-times. Our covariantformalism yields an upper bound on entropy which applies to both open andclosed surfaces, independently of shape or location. It reduces to theBekenstein bound whenever the latter is expected to hold, but complements itwith novel bounds when gravity dominates. In particular, it remains valid inclosed FRW cosmologies and in the interior of black holes. We give an explicitconstruction for obtaining holographic screens in arbitrary space-times (whichneed not have a boundary). This may aid the search for non-perturbativedefinitions of quantum gravity in space-times other than AdS.
