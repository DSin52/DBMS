We construct an explicit solution of type-IIB supergravity describing thestrong coupling regime of a non-supersymmetric gauge theory. The latter has arunning coupling with an ultraviolet stable fixed point corresponding to theN=4 SU(N) super-Yang-Mills theory at large N. The running coupling has a powerlaw behaviour, argued to be universal, that is consistent with holography.Around the critical point, our solution defines an asymptotic expansion for thegauge coupling beta-function. We also calculate the first correction to theCoulombic quark-antiquark potential.
