An action for supersymmetric D0-branes in curved backgrounds is obtained bydimensional reduction of N=1 ten-dimensional supergravity coupled to superYang-Mills system to 0+1 dimensions. The resultant action exhibits thecoset-space symmetry $\frac{SO(9,9+n)}{SO(9)\times SO(9+n)}\times U(1)$ where$n=N^{2}-1$ is the dimension of the SU(N) gauge group.
