Title: Two-dimensional Chiral Anomaly in Differential Regularization

Comments: 9 pages, RevTex, no figures, a mistake in the massive case pointed

out by the referee is correctedThe two-dimensional chiral anomaly is calculated using differentialregularization. It is shown that the anomaly emerges naturally in the vectorand axial Ward identities on the same footing as the four-dimensional case. Thevector gauge symmetry can be achieved by an appropriate choice of the massscales without introducing the seagull term. We have analyzed the reason whysuch a universal result can be obtained in differential regularization.
