We discuss a possible relation between singletons in $AdS$ space andlogarithmic conformal field theories at the boundary of $AdS$. It is shown thatthe bulk Lagrangian for singleton field (singleton dipole) induces on theboundary the two-point correlation function for logarithmic pair. Bulkinterpretation of mixing between logarithmic operator $D$ and zero modeoperator $C$ under the scale transformation is discussed as well as some otherissues.
