Starting with the ordinary ten-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theoryfor the gauge group U(N), we obtain a twelve-dimensional supersymmetric gaugetheory as the large N limit. The two symplectic canonical coordinatesparametrizing the unitary N X N matrices for U(N) are identified with the extracoordinates in twelve dimensions in the $N\to\infty$ limit. Applying further astrong/weak duality, we get the `decompactified' twelve-dimensional theory. Theresulting twelve-dimensional theory has peculiar gauge symmetry which iscompatible also with supersymmetry. We also establish a corresponding newsuperspace formulation with the extra coordinates. By performing a dimensionalreduction from twelve dimensions directly into three dimensions, we see thatthe Poisson bracket terms which are needed for identification withsupermembrane action arises naturally. This result indicates an universalduality mechanism that the 't Hooft limit of an arbitrary supersymmetric theorypromotes the original supersymmetric theory in (D-1,1) dimensions into a theoryin (D,2) dimensions with an additional pair of space-time coordinates. Thisalso indicates interesting dualities between supermembrane theory, type IIAsuperstring with D0-branes, and the recently-discovered twelve-dimensionalsupersymmetric theories.
