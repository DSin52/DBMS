The usual T-duality that relates the type IIA and IIB theories compactifiedon circles of inversely-related radii does not operate if the dimensionalreduction is performed on the time direction rather than a spatial one. Thisobservation led to the recent proposal that there might exist two furtherten-dimensional theories, namely type IIA^* and type IIB^*, related to type IIBand type IIA respectively by a timelike dimensional reduction. In this paper weexplore such dimensional reductions in cases where time is the coordinate of anon-trivial U(1) fibre bundle. We focus in particular on situations where thereis an odd-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime AdS_{2n+1}, which can bedescribed as a U(1) bundle over \widetilde{CP}^n, a non-compact version of CP^ncorresponding to the coset manifold SU(n,1)/U(n). In particular, we study theAdS_5\times S^5 and AdS_7\times S^4 solutions of type IIB supergravity andeleven-dimensional supergravity. Applying a timelike Hopf T-dualitytransformation to the former provides a new solution of the type IIA^* theory,of the form \widetilde{CP}^2\times S^1\times S^5. We show how the Hopf-reducedsolutions provide further examples of ``supersymmetry without supersymmetry.''We also present a detailed discussion of the geometrical structure of theHopf-fibred metric on AdS_{2n+1}, and its relation to the horospherical metricthat arises in the AdS/CFT correspondence.
