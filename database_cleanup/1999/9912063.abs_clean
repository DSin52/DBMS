The field-to-particle transition formalizm based on the effective zero-braneaction approach is generalized for arbitrary multiscalar fields. As a fruitfulexample, by virtue of this method we derive the non-minimal particle action forthe Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity at fixed gauge in the vicinity of the black holesolution as an instanton-dilaton doublet. When quantizing it as the theory withhigher derivatives, it is shown that the appearing quantum equation has SU(2)dynamical symmetry group realizing the exact spin-coordinate correspondence.Finally, we calculate the quantum corrections to the mass of the JT black hole.
