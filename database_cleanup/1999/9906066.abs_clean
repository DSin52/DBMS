The character of the exceptional series of representations of SU(1,1) isdetermined by using Bargmann's realization of the representation in the Hilbertspace $H_\sigma$ of functions defined on the unit circle. The construction ofthe integral kernel of the group ring turns out to be especially involvedbecause of the non-local metric appearing in the scalar product with respect towhich the representations are unitary. Since the non-local metric disappears inthe `momentum space' $i.e.$ in the space of the Fourier coefficients theintegral kernel is constructed in the momentum space, which is transformed backto yield the integral kernel of the group ring in $H_\sigma$. The rest of theprocedure is parallel to that for the principal series treated in a previouspaper. The main advantage of this method is that the entire analysis can becarried out within the canonical framework of Bargmann.
