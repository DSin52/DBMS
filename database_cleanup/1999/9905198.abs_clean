We conjecture that a T-dual form of pure QCD describes dynamics of point-likemonopoles. T-duality transforms the QCD Lagrangian into a matrix quantummechanics of zerobranes which we identify with monopoles. At generic points ofthe monopole moduli space the SU(N) gauge group is broken down to $U(1)^{N-1}$reproducing the key feature of 't Hooft's Abelian projection. There are certainpoints in the moduli space where monopole positions coincide, gauge symmetry isenhanced and gluons emerge as massless excitations. We show that there is alinearly rising potential between zerobranes. This indicates the presence of astretched flux tube between monopoles. The lowest energy state is achieved whenmonopoles are sitting on top of each other and gauge symmetry is enhanced. Inthis case they behave as free massive particles and can condense. In fact, wefind a constant eigenfunction of the corresponding Hamiltonian which describescondensation of monopoles. Using the monopole quantum mechanics, we argue thatlarge $N$ QCD in this T-dual picture is a theory of a closed bosonic membranepropagating in {\em five} dimensional space-time. QCD point-like monopoles canbe regarded in this approach as constituents of the membrane.
