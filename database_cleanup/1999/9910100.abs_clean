When the gauge groups of the two heterotic string theories are broken, overtori, to their "SO(16)x SO(16)" subgroups, the winding modes correspond torepresentations which are spinorial with respect to those subgroups. Globally,the two subgroups are isomorphic neither to SO(16)x SO(16) nor to each other.Any attempt to formulate the T-duality of the two theories on any manifold morecomplicated than the product of a circle with a Euclidean space must thereforetake into account the possible non-existence of the relevant "generalised spinstructure". We give here a global formulation of T-duality in this case, anddiscuss examples where the duality seems to be obstructed.
