Noncommutative geometry(NCG) on the discrete space successfully reproducesthe Higgs mechanism of the spontaneously broken gauge theory, in which theHiggs boson field is regarded as a kind of gauge field on the discrete space.We could construct the generalized differential geometry(GDG) on the discretespace $M_4\times Z_N$ which is very close to NCG in case of $M_4\times Z_2$.GDG is a direct generalization of the differential geometry on the ordinarymanifold into the discrete one. In this paper, we attempt to construct the BRSTinvariant formulation of spontaneously broken gauge theory based on GDG andobtain the BRST invariant Lagrangian with the t'Hooft-Feynman gauge fixingterm.
