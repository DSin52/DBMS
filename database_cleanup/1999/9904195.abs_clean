The well-known $D$-dimensional Feynman integrals were shown, by Halliday andRicotta, to be capable of undergoing analytic continuation into the domain ofnegative values for the dimension of space-time. Furthermore, this could beidentified with Grassmannian integration in positive dimensions. From thispossibility follows the concept of negative dimensional integration for loopintegrals in field theories. Using this technique, we evaluate three two-loopthree-point scalar integrals, with five and six massless propagators, withspecific external kinematic configurations (two legs on-shell), and fourthree-loop two-point scalar integrals. These results are given for arbitraryexponents of propagators and dimension, in Euclidean space, and the particularcases compared to results published in the literature.
