the relation to the transformation of R-R potentials as SO(d,d) spinorsJournal-ref: Nucl.Phys. B583 (2000) 431-453

We explicitly construct the SO(d,d) transformations of Ramond-Ramond fieldstrengths and potentials, along with those of the space-time supersymmetryparameters, the gravitinos and the dilatinos in type-II theories. The resultsinclude the case when the SO(d,d) transformation involves the time direction.The derivation is based on the compatibility of SO(d,d) transformations withspace-time supersymmetry, which automatically guarantees compatibility with theequations of motion. It involves constructing the spinor representation of atwist that an SO(d,d) action induces between the local Lorentz framesassociated with the left- and right-moving sectors of the worldsheet theory.The relation to the transformation of R-R potentials as SO(d,d) spinors is alsoclarified.
