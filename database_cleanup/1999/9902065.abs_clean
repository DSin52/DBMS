We study some dynamical properties of a Dirac field in 2+1 dimensions withspacetime dependent domain wall defects. We show that the Callan and Harveymechanism applies even to the case of defects of arbitrary shape, and in ageneral state of motion. The resulting chiral zero modes are localized on theworldsheet of the defect, an embedded curved two dimensional manifold. Thedynamics of these zero modes is governed by the corresponding induced metricand spin connection. Using known results about determinants and anomalies forfermions on surfaces embedded in higher dimensional spacetimes, we show thatthe chiral anomaly for this two dimensional theory is responsible for thegeneration of a current along the defect. We derive the general expression forsuch a current in terms of the geometry of the defect, and show that it may beinterpreted as due to an "inertial" electric field, which can be expressedentirely in terms of the spacetime curvature of the defects. We discuss theapplication of this framework to fermionic systems with defects in condensedmatter.
