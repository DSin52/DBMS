The condensation of a dual-vector field is investigated in the dual MonopoleNambu-Jona-Lasinio model with dual Dirac strings. The condensate of adual-vector field is calculated as a functional of a shape of a dual Diracstring. The obtained result is compared with the gluon condensate calculated ina QCD sum rules approach and on lattice.
