We renormalize to three loops a version of the Thirring model where thefermion fields not only lie in the fundamental representation of a non-abeliancolour group SU(N_c) but also depend on the number of flavours, N_f. The modelis not multiplicatively renormalizable in dimensional regularization due to thegeneration of evanescent operators which emerge at each loop order. Theireffect in the construction of the true wave function, mass and couplingconstant renormalization constants is handled by considering the projectiontechnique to a new order. Having constructed the MSbar renormalization groupfunctions we consider other massless independent renormalization schemes toensure that the renormalization is consistent with the equivalence of thenon-abelian Thirring model with other models with a four-fermi interaction. Onefeature to emerge from the computation is the establishment of the fact thatthe SU(N_f) Gross Neveu model is not multiplicatively renormalizable indimensional regularization. An evanescent operator arises first at three loopsand we determine its associated renormalization constant explicitly.
