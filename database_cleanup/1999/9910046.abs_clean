The chiral WZNW symplectic form $\Omega^{\rho}_{chir}$ is inverted in thegeneral case. Thereby a precise relationship between the arbitrary monodromydependent 2-form appearing in $\Omega^{\rho}_{chir}$ and the exchange r-matrixthat governs the Poisson brackets of the group valued chiral fields isestablished. The exchange r-matrices are shown to satisfy a new dynamicalgeneralization of the classical modified Yang-Baxter (YB) equation andPoisson-Lie (PL) groupoids are constructed that encode this equationanalogously as PL groups encode the classical YB equation. For an arbitrarysimple Lie group G, exchange r-matrices are found that are in one-to-onecorrespondence with the possible PL structures on G and admit them as PLsymmetries.
