We consider chiral gauge theories defined over a four-dimensional spacetimemanifold with a Cartesian product structure for at least one compact spatialdimension. For a simple setup, we calculate the effective gauge field action byintegrating out the chiral fermions, while maintaining gauge invariance. Due toa combination of infrared and ultraviolet effects, there appears a CPT-odd termin the effective gauge field action. This CPT anomaly could occur in chiralgauge theories relevant to elementary particle physics, provided the spacetimemanifold has the appropriate topology. Two possible applications for cosmologyare discussed.
