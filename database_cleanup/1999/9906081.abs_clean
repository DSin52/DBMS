We use dyonic brane configurations of type 0 string theory to study large Nnon-supersymmetric 4d gauge theories. The brane configurations define theoriessimilar to the supersymmetric ones which arise in type II. We find the non-SUSYanalogues of N=2 and N=1. In particular we suggest new non-SUSY CFT's and abrane realization of a non-SUSY Seiberg duality.
