configurations of parallel branes has been modified and some other referenceshave been includedIn this paper we investigate about several configurations of two intersectingbranes at arbitrary angles. We choose the viewpoint of a brane source and abrane probe and use the low-energy dynamics of p-branes. For each p-brane thisdynamics is governed by a generic DBI action including a WZ term, which couplesto the SUGRA background of the other brane. The analysis naturally reveals twospecify possible configurations for a pair of similar or non-similar branes ineither of these two categories. In particular, for two similar branes atangles, this analysis reveals that all the marginal configurations arespecified by SU(2) angles while the non-marginal configurations are specifiedby $Sp(2)$ angles. On the other hand, we find that no other configuration oftwo intersecting branes at non-trivial angles can be constructed out of flatp-branes. So in particular, two non-similar branes can only be found in anorthogonal configuration. In this case the intersection rules for either of themarginal or non-marginal configurations are derived, which thereby provideinterpretations for the known results from supergravity.
