Three different methods to quantize the spherically symmetric sector ofequivalent to Abelian BF-theory in four spacetime dimensions with suitableboundary conditions. This theory, in turn, is quantized by both a reduced phasespace quantization and a spin network quantization. Finally, the outcome iscompared with the results obtained in the recently proposed general quantumsymmetry reduction scheme. In the magnetically uncharged sector, where allthree approaches apply, they all lead to the same quantum theory.
