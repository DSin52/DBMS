We study the central extensions of the N=1 superalgebras relevant to thesoliton solutions with the axial geometry - strings, wall junctions, etc. Ageneral expression valid in any four-dimensional gauge theory is obtained. Weprove that the only gauge theory admitting BPS strings at weak coupling issupersymmetric electrodynamics with the Fayet-Iliopoulos term. The problem ofambiguity of the (1/2,1/2) central charge in the generalized Wess-Zumino modelsand gauge theories with matter is addressed and solved. A possibility ofexistence of the BPS strings at strong coupling in N=2 theories is discussed. Arepresentation of different strings within the brane picture is presented.
