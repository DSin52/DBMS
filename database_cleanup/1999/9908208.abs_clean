Volume, M. Shifman ed., World ScientificAfter a brief historical survey that emphasizes the role of the algebraobeyed by the Dirac operator, we examine an algebraic Dirac operator associatedwith Lie algebras and Lie algebra cosets. For symmetric cosets, its``massless'' solutions display non-relativistic supersymmetry, and can beidentified with the massless degrees of freedom of some supersymmetrictheory in ten and four dimensions, and in four dimensions, N=8 supergravity,N=4 super-Yang-Mills, and the N=1 Wess-Zumino multiplet. By generalizing thisDirac operator to the affine case, we generate superconformal algebrasassociated with cosets ${\bf g}/\bf h$, where $\bf h$ contains the {\it space}little group. Only for eleven dimensional supergravity is $\bf h$ simple. Thissuggests, albeit in a non-relativistic setting, that these may be the limit oftheories with underlying two-dimensional superconformal structure.
