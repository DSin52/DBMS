We study the properties of the topologically nontrivial doublet solutionarisen in the biscalar theory with a fourth-power potential introducing anexample of the spontaneous breaking of symmetry. We rule out the zero-brane(non-minimal point particle) action for this doublet as a particle withcurvature. When quantizing it as the theory with higher derivatives, wecalculate the quantum corrections to the mass of the doublet which could not beobtained by means of the perturbation theory.
