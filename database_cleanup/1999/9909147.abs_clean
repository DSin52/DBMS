We show that conformal maps of simply connected domains with an analyticboundary to a unit disk have an intimate relation to the dispersionless 2D Todaintegrable hierarchy. The maps are determined by a particular solution to thehierarchy singled out by the conditions known as "string equations". The samehierarchy locally solves the 2D inverse potential problem, i.e. reconstructionof the domain out of a set of its harmonic moments. This is the same solutionwhich is known to describe 2D gravity coupled to c=1 matter. We also introducea concept of the $\tau$-function for analytic curves.
