The one-loop four-graviton amplitude in either of the type II superstringtheories is expanded in powers of the external momenta up to and includingterms of order s^4 log s R^4, where R^4 denotes a specific contraction of fourlinearized Weyl tensors and s is a Mandelstam invariant. Terms in this seriesare obtained by integrating powers of the two-dimensional scalar field theorypropagator over the toroidal world-sheet as well as the moduli of the torus.The values of these coefficients match expectations based on duality relationsbetween string theory and eleven-dimensional supergravity.
