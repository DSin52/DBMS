The correlations of the QCD Dirac eigenvalues are studied with use of anextended chiral random matrix model. The inclusion of spatial dependence whichthe original model lacks enables us to investigate the effects of diffusionmodes. We get analytical expressions of level correlation functions withnon-universal behavior caused by diffusion modes which is characterized byThouless energy. Pion mode is shown to be responsible for these diffusioneffects when QCD vacuum is considered a disordered medium.
