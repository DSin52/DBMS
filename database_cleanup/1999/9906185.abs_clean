Title: A new approach to the correlation functions of W-algebras

Comments: 22 pages, LaTeX, Extended version of the talk presented at CFT and

Integrable models, Budapest, 1996We propose a new approach to the study of the correlation functions ofW-algebras. The conformal blocks (chiral correlation functions), for fixedarguments, are defined to be those linear functionals on the product of thehighest weight (h.w.) representation spaces which satisfy the Ward identities.First we investigate the dimension of the chiral correlation functions in thecase when there is no singular vector in any of the representations. Then wepass to the analysis of the completely degenerate representations. A specialsubspace of the h.w. representation spaces, introduced by Nahm, plays animportant role in the considerations. The structure of these subspaces shows adeep connection with the quantum and classical Toda models and relates certaincompletely degenerate representations of the \wg algebra to representations of$G$. This is confirmed by an analysis for the Virasoro, \wa2 and \wbc2 algebra.We also relate our work to Nahms, Feigen-Fuchs' and Watts' results.
