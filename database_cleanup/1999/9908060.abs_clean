The spectrum of open strings on various non-BPS D-brane configurations intype II string theory on a K3 orbifold is analysed. At a generic point in thecorresponding moduli space the spectrum of open strings does not have anydegeneracy between bosonic and fermionic states. However, there exist specialvalues for these moduli for which many non-BPS D-brane configurations have anexactly bose-fermi degenerate open string spectrum at all mass levels. In thiscase the closed string exchange interaction between a pair of such D-braneconfigurations vanishes at all distances.
