In this ``experimental'' research, we use known topological recursionrelations in genera-zero, -one, and -two to compute the n-point descendantGromov-Witten invariants of P^1 for arbitrary degrees and low values of n. Theresults are consistent with the Virasoro conjecture and also lead to explicitcomputations of all Hodge integrals in these genera. We also derive newrecursion relations for simple Hurwitz numbers similar to those of Graber andPandharipande.
