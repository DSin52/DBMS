It is shown that certain extremal correlators in four-dimensional N=2superconformal field theories (including N=4 super-Yang-Mills as a specialcase) have a free-field functional form. It is further argued that the couplingconstant dependence receives no correction beyond the lowest order. Theseresults hold for any finite value of N_c.
