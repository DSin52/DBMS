Motivated by the form of the noncommutative *-product in a system of openstrings and Dp-branes with constant nonzero Neveu-Schwarz 2-form, we define adeformed multiplication operation on a quasitriangular Hopf algebra in terms ofits R-matrix, and comment on some of its properties. We show that thenoncommutative string theory *-product is a particular example of thismultiplication, and comment on other possible Hopf algebraic properties whichmay underlie the theory.
