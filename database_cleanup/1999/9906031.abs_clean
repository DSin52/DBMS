An example of a non-Abelian Brane Box Model, namely one corresponding to a$Z_k \times D_{k'}$ orbifold singularity of $\C^3$, is constructed. Itsself-consistency and hence equivalence to geometrical methods are subsequentlyshown. It is demonstrated how a group-theoretic twist of the non-Abelian groupcircumvents the problem of inconsistency that arise from na\"{\i}ve attempts atthe construction.
