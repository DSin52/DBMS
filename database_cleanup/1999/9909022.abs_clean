Title: M-theory and Deformation Quantization

Comments: 24 pages, LaTeX

We discuss deformation quantization of the covariant, light-cone andconformal gauge-fixed p-brane actions (p>1) which are closely related to thestructure of the classical and quantum Nambu brackets. It is known thatdeformation quantization of the Nambu bracket is not of the usual Moyal type.Yet the Nambu bracket can be quantized using the Zariski deformationquantization (discovered by Dito, Flato, Sternheimer and Takhtajan) which isbased on factorization of polynomials in several real variables. We discuss aparticular application of the Zariski deformed quantization in M-theory byconsidering the problem of a covariant formulation of Matrix theory. We proposethat the problem of a covariant formulation of Matrix theory can be solvedusing the formalism of Zariski deformed quantization of the triple Nambubracket.
