The SU(2) collective coordinates quantization of the Born-Infeld SkyrmionsLagrangean is performed. The obtainment of the classical Hamiltonian from thisexpansion of this non-polynomial Lagrangean up to second-order variable in thecollective coordinates, using for this some causality arguments. Because thissystem presents constraints, we use the Dirac Hamiltonian method and theFaddeev-Jackiw Lagrangean approach to quantize this model.
