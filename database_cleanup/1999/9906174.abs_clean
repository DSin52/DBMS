It is well-known that is spite of sharing some properties with conventionalparticles, topological geons in general violate the spin-statistics theorem. Onthe other hand, it is generally believed that in quantum gravity theoriesallowing for topology change, using pair creation and annihilation of geons,one should be able to recover this theorem. In this paper, we take analternative route, and use an algebraic formalism developed in previous work.We give a description of topological geons where an algebra of "observables" isidentified and quantized. Different irreducible representations of this algebracorrespond to different kinds of geons, and are labeled by a non-abelian"charge" and "magnetic flux". We then find that the usual spin-statisticstheorem is indeed violated, but a new spin-statistics relation arises, when weassume that the fluxes are superselected. This assumption can be proved if allobservables are local, as is generally the case in physical theories. Finally,we also show how our approach fits into conventional formulations of quantumgravity.
