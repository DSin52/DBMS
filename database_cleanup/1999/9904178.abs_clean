We analyse symmetry breaking in the Weinberg-Salam model paying particularattention to the underlying geometry of the theory. In this context we find twothe scalar sector, and a squashed metric associated with the gauge sector.Physically, the interplay between these metrics gives rise to many of thenon-perturbative features of Weinberg-Salam theory.
