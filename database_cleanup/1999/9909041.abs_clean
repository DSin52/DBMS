We consider the sector of N=8 five-dimensional gauged supergravity withnon-trivial scalar fields in the coset space SL(6,R)/SO(6), plus the metric. Wefind that the most general supersymmetric solution is parametrized by six realmoduli and analyze its properties using the theory of algebraic curves. In thegeneric case, where no continuous subgroup of the original SO(6) symmetryremains unbroken, the algebraic curve of the corresponding solution is aRiemann surface of genus seven. When some cycles shrink to zero size thesymmetry group is enhanced, whereas the genus of the Riemann surface is loweredaccordingly. The uniformization of the curves is carried out explicitly andyields various supersymmetric configurations in terms of elliptic functions. Wealso analyze the ten-dimensional type-IIB supergravity origin of our solutionsand show that they represent the gravitational field of a large number ofD3-branes continuously distributed on hyper-surfaces embedded in thesix-dimensional space transverse to the branes. The spectra of massless scalarand graviton excitations are also studied on these backgrounds by casting theassociated differential equations into Schrodinger equations with non-trivialpotentials. The potentials are found to be of Calogero type, rational orelliptic, depending on the background configuration that is used.
