Derivatives in ${\cal N}=4$ Yang Mills TheoryComments: 14 pages, latex

Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B481 (2000) 427-435

We generalize the proof of the non-renormalization of the four derivativeoperators in ${\cal N}=4$ Yang Mills theory with gauge group SU(2) to show thatcertain terms with 2N derivatives are not renormalized in the theory withgauge group SU(N). These terms may be determined exactly by a simpleperturbative computation. Similar results hold for finite ${\cal N}=2$theories. We comment on the implications of these results.
