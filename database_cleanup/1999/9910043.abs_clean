In this article we present a general description of two moving branes inpresence of the $B_{\mu \nu}$ field and gauge fields $A^{(1)}_{\alpha_1}$ and$A^{(2)}_{\alpha_2}$ on them, in spacetime in which some of its directions arecompact on tori. Some examples are considered to elucidate this generaldescription. Also contribution of the massless states to the interaction isextracted. Boundary state formalism is a useful tool for these considerations.
