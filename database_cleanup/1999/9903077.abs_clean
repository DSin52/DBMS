Title: The One-loop UV Divergent Structure of U(1) Yang-Mills Theory on

Noncommutative R^4Authors: C.P. Martin and D. Sanchez-Ruiz (Departamento de Fisica Teorica I,

Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain)Comments: 8 pages. A missing complex "i" is included in the field strength and

the divergent contributions corrected accordingly. As a result the modelturns out to be asymptotically freeJournal-ref: Phys.Rev.Lett. 83 (1999) 476-479

We show that U(1) Yang-Mills theory on noncommutative R^4 can be renormalizedat the one-loop level by multiplicative dimensional renormalization of thecoupling constant and fields of the theory. We compute the beta function of thetheory and conclude that the theory is asymptotically free. We also show thatthe Weyl-Moyal matrix defining the deformed product over the space of functionson R^4 is not renormalized at the one-loop level.
