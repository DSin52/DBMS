We study some aspects of dilatonic domain walls in relation to the idea onthe noncompact internal space. We find that the warp factor in the spacetimemetric increases as one moves away from the domain wall for all thesupersymmetric dilatonic domain wall solutions obtained from the (intersecting)BPS branes in string theories through toroidal compactifications, unlike thecase of the Randall-Sundrum model. On the other hand, when the dilaton couplingparameter a for the D-dimensional extreme dilatonic domain wall takes thevalues |a|<2/(D-2), the Kaluza-Klein spectrum of graviton has the samestructure as that of the Randall-Sundrum model (and the warp factor decreasesin the finite interval around the dilatonic domain wall), thereby implying thepossibility of extending the Randall-Sundrum model to the |a|<2/(D-2) case. Weconstruct fully localized solutions describing extreme dilatonic branes withinextreme dilatonic domain walls and the supersymmetric branes within thesupersymmetric domain walls of string theories. These solutions are valid inany region of spacetime, not just in the region close to the domain walls.
