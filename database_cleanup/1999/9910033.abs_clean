It is shown that the Calogero-Moser models based on all root systems of thefinite reflection groups (both the crystallographic and non-crystallographiccases) with the rational (with/without a harmonic confining potential),trigonometric and hyperbolic potentials can be simply supersymmetrised in termsof superpotentials. There is a universal formula for the supersymmetric groundstate wavefunction. Since the bosonic part of each supersymmetric model is theusual quantum Calogero-Moser model, this gives a universal formula for itsground state wavefunction and energy, which is determined purely algebraically.Quantum Lax pair operators and conserved quantities for all the aboveCalogero-Moser models are established.
