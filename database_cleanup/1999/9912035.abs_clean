Title: Instantons versus Monopoles

Authors: Pierre van Baal

Comments: 11p, 5 figs in 7 parts, presented at the workshop "Lattice fermions

and structure of the vacuum", 5-9 Oct. 199, Dubna, RussiaWe review results of the last two years concerning caloron solutions of unitcharge with non-trivial holonomy, revealing the constituent monopole nature ofthese instantons. For SU(n) there are n such BPS constituents. New is thepresentation of the exact values for the Polyakov loop at the three constituentlocations for the SU(3) caloron with arbitrary holonomy. At these points twoeigenvalues coincide, extending earlier results for SU(2) to a situation moregeneric for general SU(n).
