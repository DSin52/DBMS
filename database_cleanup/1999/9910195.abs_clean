We describe a simple lattice model of higher-curvature quantum gravity in twodimensions and study the phase structure of the theory as a function of thecurvature coupling. It is shown that the ensemble of flat graphs isentropically unstable to the formation of baby universes. In these simplifiedmodels the growth in graphs exhibits a branched polymer behaviour in the phasedirectly before the flattening transition.
