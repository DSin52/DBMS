The BPS states of N=2 super Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(2) areconstructed as non-trivial finite-energy solutions of the worldvolume theory ofa threebrane probe in F theory. The solutions preserve 1/2 of N=2 supersymmetryand provide a worldvolume realization of strings stretching from the probe to asevenbrane. The positions of the sevenbranes correspond to singularities in thefield theory moduli space and to curvature singularities in the supergravitybackground. We explicitly show how the UV cut off of the effective field theoryis mapped into an IR cut off in the supergravity. Finally, we discuss somefeatures of the moduli spaces of these solutions.
