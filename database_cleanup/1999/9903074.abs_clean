We study the evolution, the transverse spreading and the subsequentthermalization of string states in the Weyl static axisymmetric spacetime. Thispossesses a singular event horizon on the symmetry axis and a naked singularityalong the other directions. The branching diffusion process of string bitsapproaching the singular event horizon provides the notion of temperature thatis calculated for this process. We find that the solution of the Fokker-Planckequation in the phase space of the transverse variables of the string, can befactored as a product of two thermal distributions, provided that the classicalconjugate variables satisfy the uncertainty principle. We comment on thepossible physical significance of this result.
