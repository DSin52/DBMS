We give a detailed Operator Product Expansion interpretation of the resultsfor conformal 4-point functions computed from supergravity through the AdS/CFTduality. We show that for an arbitrary scalar exchange in AdS(d+1) all thepower-singular terms in the direct channel limit (and only these terms) exactlymatch the corresponding contributions to the OPE of the operator dual to theexchanged bulk field and of its conformal descendents. The leading logarithmicsingularities in the 4-point functions of protected N=4 super-Yang Millsoperators (computed from IIB supergravity on AdS(5) X S(5) are interpreted asO(1/N^2) renormalization effects of the double-trace products appearing in theOPE. Applied to the 4-point functions of the operators Ophi ~ tr F^2 + ... andOc ~ tr FF~ + ..., this analysis leads to the prediction that the double-tracecomposites [Ophi Oc] and [Ophi Ophi - Oc Oc] have anomalous dimension -16/N^2in the large N, large g_{YM}^2 N limit. We describe a geometric picture of theOPE in the dual gravitational theory, for both the power-singular terms and theleading logarithms. We comment on several possible extensions of our results.
