We study some consequences of dimensionally reducing systems with masslessfermions and Abelian gauge fields from 3+1 to 2+1 dimensions. We first considerfermions in the presence of an external Abelian gauge field. In the reducedtheory, obtained by compactifying one of the coordinates `a la Kaluza-Klein,magnetic flux strings are mapped into domain wall defects. Fermionic zeromodes, localized around the flux strings of the 3+1 dimensional theory, becomealso zero modes in the reduced theory, via the Callan and Harvey mechanism, andare concentrated around the domain wall defects. We also study a dynamicaleffective action that describes the `planar' system.
