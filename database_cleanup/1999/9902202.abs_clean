We study ${\cal F}^4$-threshold corrections in an eight dimensional S-dualpair of string theories, as a prototype of dual string vacua with sixteensupercharges. We show that the orbifold CFT description of D-string instantonsgives rise to a perturbative expansion similar to the one appearing on thefundamental string side. By an explicit calculation, using the Nambu-Gotoaction in the static gauge, we show that the first subleading term agreesprecisely on the two sides. We then give a general argument to show that theagreement extends to all orders.
