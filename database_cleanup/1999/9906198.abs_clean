We present a strong evidence for the magnetic confinement in QCD bydemonstrating that the one loop effective action of SU(2) QCD induces adynamical symmetry breaking thorugh the monopole condensation, which couldinduce the dual Meissner effect and guarantee the confinement of color in thenon-Abelian gauge theory. The result is obtained by separating the topologicaldegrees which describes the non-Abelian monopoles from the dynamical degrees ofthe potential, and integrating out all the dynamical degrees of QCD.
