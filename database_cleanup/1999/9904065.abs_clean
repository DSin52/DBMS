We study static spherically symmetric dyonic black holes inEinstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. As for the magnetic non-abelian black holes,the domain of existence of the dyonic non-abelian black holes is limited withrespect to the horizon radius and the dimensionless coupling constant $\alpha$,which is proportional to the ratio of vector meson mass and Planck mass. At acertain critical value of this coupling constant, $\hat \alpha$, the maximalhorizon radius is attained. We derive analytically a relation between $\hat\alpha$ and the charge of the black hole solutions and confirm this relationnumerically. Besides the fundamental dyonic non-abelian black holes, we studyradially excited dyonic non-abelian black holes and globally regulargravitating dyons.
