In this paper we construct non-Abelian gauge theories with fermions andscalars that nevertheless possess asymptotic freedom.The scalars are taken tobe in a chiral multiplet transforming as $(2,2)$ under $SU(2)_L\otimes SU(2)_R$and transforming as singlets under the colour SU(3) group. We consider twodistinct scenarios, one in which the additional scalars are light and anotherin which they are heavier than half the Z-boson mass. It is shown thatasymptotic freedom is obtained without requiring that all additional couplingskeep fixed ratios with each other. It is also shown that both scenarios can notbe ruled out by what are considered standard tests of QCD like R- parameter,g-2 for muons or deep inelastic phenomena. The light mass scenario is howeverruled out by high precision Z-width data (and only by that one data).The heavymass scenario is still viable and is shown to naturally pass the test offlavour changing neutral currents. It also is not ruled out by precisionelectroweak oblique parameters. Many distinctive experimental signatures ofthese models are also discussed.
