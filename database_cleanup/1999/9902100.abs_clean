We begin by presenting the superparticle action in the background of N=2, D=4supergravity coupled to n vector multiplets interacting via an arbitraryspecial Kahler geometry. Our construction is based on implementingkappa-supersymmetry. In particular, our result can be interpreted as the sourceterm for N=2 BPS black holes with a finite horizon area. When the vectormultiplets can be associated to the complex structure moduli of a Calabi-Yaumanifold, then our 0-brane action can be derived by wrapping 3-branes around3-cycles of the 3-fold. Our result can be extended to the case of highersupersymmetry; we explicitly construct the kappa supersymmetric action for asuperparticle moving in an arbitrary N=8 supergravity background with 1/2, 1/4or 1/8 residual supersymmetry.
