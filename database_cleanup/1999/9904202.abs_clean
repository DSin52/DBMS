The canonical decomposition of a real Klein-Gordon field in collective andrelative variables proposed by Longhi and Materassi is reformulated onspacelike hypersurfaces. This allows to obtain the complete canonical reductionof the system on Wigner hyperplanes, namely in the rest-frame Wigner-covariantinstant form of dynamics. From the study of Dixon's multipoles for theenergy-momentum tensor on the Wigner hyperplanes we derive the definition ofit turns out that the Longhi-Materassi global variable should be interpreted asa center of phase of the field configuration. A detailed study of thekinematical "external" and "internal" properties of the field configuration onthe Wigner hyperplanes is done. The construction is then extended to chargedcombined to define a global center of phase and a collective relative variabledescribing the action-reaction between the two Feshbach-Villars components ofthe field with definite sign of energy and charge. The Dixon multipoles forboth the energy-momentum and the electromagnetic current are given. Also thecoupling of the Klein-Gordon field to scalar relativistic particles is studiedand it is shown that in the reduced phase space, besides the particle and fieldrelative variables, there is also a collective relative variable describing therelative motion of the particle subsytem with respect to the field one.
