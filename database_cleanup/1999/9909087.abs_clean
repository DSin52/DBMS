We rewrite the SL(2,Z) covariant worldsheet action for the IIB stringproposed by Townsend in a Polyakov form. In a flat background the formalismyields separate (p,q) sectors. In each one the action is that of the IIB stringaction with the string slope parameter \alp\pr replaced by its SL(2,Z) analogue\alp_{pq}\pr. SL(2,Z) invariant graviton scattering amplitudes are obtainedfrom those of the fundamental (1,0) string by summing over the differentsectors. The tree-level four-graviton amplitude in this formalism differs froma previously conjectured non-perturbative form; both yield the same expansionin order \alpha\pr^3.
