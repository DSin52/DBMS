Complete constraint analysis and choice of gauge conditions consistent withequations of motion is done for non-abelian Chern-Simons field interacting withN-component complex scalar field. Dirac-Schwinger condition is satisfied by thereduced phase-space Hamiltonian density with respect to the Dirac bracket.
