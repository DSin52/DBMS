It is shown that the effective theory of D-particles has conformal symmetrywith field-dependent parameters. This is a consequence of the supersymmetry.The string coupling constant is not transformed in contrast with the recentproposal of generalized conformal symmtery by Jevicki et al. This conformalsymmetry can also be generalized to other Dp-brane systems.
