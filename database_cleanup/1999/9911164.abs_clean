There appears to be no natural explanation for the cosmological constant'ssmall size within the framework of local relativistic field theories. We arguethat the recently-discussed framework for which the observable universe isidentified with a p-brane embedded within a higher-dimensional `bulk'spacetime, has special properties that may help circumvent the obstacles tothis understanding. This possibility arises partly due to several uniqueintroduce for partially breaking supersymmetry, (2) the possibility of havinglow-energy degrees of freedom which are not observable to us because they arephysically located on a different brane, (3) the fundamental scale may be muchsmaller than the Planck scale. Furthermore, although the resulting cosmologicalconstant in the scenarios we outline is naturally suppressed by weak couplingconstants of gravitational strength, it need not be exactly zero, raising thepossibility it could be in the range favoured by recent cosmologicalobservations.
