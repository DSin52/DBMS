We discuss the entropy for the extremal BTZ black hole and the extremal EBTZblack hole. The EBTZ black hole means the BTZ black hole embedded in afive-dimensional(5D) black hole. The six-dimensional(6D) black string withtraveling waves is introduced as a concrete model for realizing the AdS/CFTcorrespondence. The traveling waves carry the momentum distribution $p(u)$which plays an important role in counting the entropy and establishing thecorrespondence. It turns out that the EBTZ black hole is consistent with theAdS/CFT correspondence.
