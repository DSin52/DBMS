A new family of S-matrix theories with resonance poles is constructed andconjectured to correspond to the Homogeneous sine-Gordon theories associatedwith simply laced compact Lie groups, where some of the resonance poles can betraced to the presence of unstable particles in the spectrum. These theoriesare unitary in the usual S S^\dagger =1 sense, they are not parity invariant,and they exhibit continuous coupling constants that determine both the massspectrum of stable particles and the masses and the position of the resonancepoles.
