Title: Chiral Poincare transformations and their anomalies

Authors: Jan B. Thomassen

Comments: 10 pages, LaTeX, revised version

I consider global transformations of a Dirac fermion field, that aregenerated by the generators of Poincar'e transformations, but with a \gamma_5appended. Such chiral translations and chiral Lorentz transformations areusually not symmetries of the Lagrangian, but naively they are symmetries ofthe fermionic measure. However, by using proper time regularization inMinkowski space, I find that they in general give rise to a nontrivialJacobian. In this sense they have "anomalies". I calculate these anomalies in atheory of a massive fermion coupled to an external Abelian vector field. Mymotivation for considering chiral Poincar'e transformations is the possibilitythat they are relevant to bosonization in four dimensions.
