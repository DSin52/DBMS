In the present work we consider a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation forsystems invariant under the reparametrization of time. We develop the two-stageprocedure of construction such systems from a given initial ones, which is notinvariant under the time reparametrization. One of the first-class constraintsof the systems in such description becomes the time-dependent Schr\"odingerequation. The procedure is applicable in the supersymmetric theories as well.The $n=2$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics is coupled to world-linesupergravity, and the local supersymmetric action is constructed leading to thesquare root representation of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation.
