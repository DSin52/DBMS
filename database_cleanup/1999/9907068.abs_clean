We study the Lund-Regge equation that governs the motion of strings in aconstant background antisymmetric tensor field by using the duality between theLund-Regge equation and the complex sine-Gordon equation. Similar to the casesof vortex filament configurations in fluid dynamics, we find various exactsolitonic string configurations which are the analogue of the Kelvin wave, theHasimoto soliton and the smoke ring. In particular, using the duality relation,we obtain a completely new type of configuration which corresponds to thebreather of the complex sine-Gordon equation.
