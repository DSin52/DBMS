Using the relation between diffeomorphisms in the bulk and Weyltransformations on the boundary we study the Weyl transformation properties ofthe bulk metric on shell and of the boundary action. We obtain a universalformula for one of the classes of trace anomalies in any even dimension interms of the parameters of the gravity action.
