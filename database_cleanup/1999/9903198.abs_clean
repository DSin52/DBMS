The general method of the supersymmetrization of the soliton equations withthe odd (bi) hamiltonian structure is established. New version of thesupersymmetric N=2,4 (Modified) Korteweg de Vries equation is given, as anexample. The second odd Hamiltonian operator of the SUSY KdV equation generatesthe odd N=2,4 SUSY Virasoro - like algebra.
