It is shown using both conventional and algebraic approach to quantum fieldtheory that it is impossible to perform quantization on Unruh modes inMinkowski spacetime. Such quantization implies setting boundary condition forthe quantum field operator which changes topological properties and symmetrygroup of spacetime and leads to field theory in two disconnected left and rightRindler spacetimes. It means that "Unruh effect" does not exist.
