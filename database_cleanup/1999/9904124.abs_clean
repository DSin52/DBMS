We present a systematic attempt at classification of supersymmetric M-theoryvacua with zero flux; that is, eleven-dimensional lorentzian manifolds withvanishing Ricci curvature and admitting covariantly constant spinors. We showgeneralising the Kaluza-Klein monopole, and non-static spacetimes generalisingthe supersymmetric wave. The classification can be further refined by theholonomy group of the spacetime. The static solutions are organised accordingto the holonomy group of the spacelike hypersurface, whereas the non-staticsolutions are similarly organised by the (lorentzian) holonomy group of thespacetime. These are subgroups of the Lorentz group which act reducibly yetindecomposably on Minkowski spacetime. We present novel constructions ofnon-static vacua consisting of warped products of d-dimensional pp-waves with(11-d)-dimensional manifolds admitting covariantly constant spinors. Ourconstruction yields local metrics with a variety of exotic lorentzian holonomygroups. In the process, we write down the most general local metric in d<6dimensions describing a pp-wave admitting a covariantly constant spinor.Finally, we also discuss a particular class of supersymmetric vacua withnonzero four-form obtained from the previous ones without modifying theholonomy of the metric. This is possible because in a lorentzian spacetime ametric which admits parallel spinors is not necessarily Ricci-flat, hencesupersymmetric backgrounds need not satisfy the equations of motion.
