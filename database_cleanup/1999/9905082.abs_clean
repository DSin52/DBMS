We compute the spin of both the topological and nontopological solitons ofthe Chern - Simons - Higgs model by using our approach based on constrainedanalysis. We also propose an extension of our method to the non - relativisticChern - Simons models. The spin formula for both the relativistic andnonrelativistic theories turn out to be structurally identical. This forminvariance manifests the topological origin of the Chern - Simons termresponsible for inducing fractional spin. Also, some comparisons with theexisting results are done.
