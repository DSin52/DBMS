We discuss the ultraviolet finiteness of the two-dimensional BF model coupledto topological matter quantized in the axial gauge. This noncovariant gaugefixing avoids the infrared problem in the two-dimensional space-time. The BFmodel together with the matter coupling is obtained by dimensional reduction ofthe ordinary three-dimensional BF model. This procedure furnishes the usuallinear vector supersymmetry and an additional scalar supersymmetry. The wholesymmetry content of the model allows to apply the standard algebraicrenormalization procedure which we use to prove that this model is ultravioletfinite and anomaly free to all orders of perturbation theory.
