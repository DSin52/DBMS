We analyze p-brane black hole solutions with `block-orthogonal' intersectionrules. The post-Newtonian parameters beta and gamma corresponding to4-dimensional section of the metric are calculated. A family of solutions withgamma=1 is singled out. Some examples of solutions (e.g. in D=11 supergravity)are considered.
