A deformation of the wave equation on a two-dimensional black hole isconsidered as a toy-model for possible gravitational or stringy nonlocaleffects. The deformed wave-equation allows for an initial-value problem despitebeing nonlocal. The classical singularity present in the classical geometry isresolved by the deformation, so that propagation of a wave-packet can becontinued through the classically singular region, ultimately reaching anotherasymptotically ``flat'' region.
