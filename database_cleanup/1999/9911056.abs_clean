of Erice Summer School 1999This is one of the `New Talents' seminars at `Erice International School ofSubnuclear Physics 1999' and looks at numerical studies of (2+1)D topologicalSkyrme-like solitons; the baby skyrmions. We explain the concept of integrableand topological solitons. Then we introduce the non-linear sigma model in 2D inorder to discuss the 3D nuclear Skyrme model. We explain that the baby Skyrmemodels can be viewed as a (2+1)D version of the Skyrme model. We describe thenumerical methods needed to study the baby skyrmions. Finally, we present someresults on skyrmion-skyrmion scattering and our work on skyrmions with highertopological charge.
