We study, using ADHM construction, instanton effects in an ${\CN}=2$superconformal $Sp(N)$ gauge theory, arising as effective field theory on asystem of $N$ D-3-branes near an orientifold 7-plane and 8 D-7-branes in typeI' string theory. We work out the measure for the collective coordinates ofmulti-instantons in the gauge theory and compare with the measure for thecollective coordinates of $(-1)$-branes in the presence of 3- and 7-branes intype I' theory. We analyse the large-N limit of the measure and find that itcoordinates has the geometry of $AdS_5\times S^3$ which on the string theoryside has the interpretation of the D-instantons being stuck on the 7-branes andtherefore the resulting moduli space being $AdS_5\times S^3$, In the secondclass the geometry is $AdS_5\times S^5/Z_2$ and on the string theory side itmeans that the D-instantons are free to move in the 10-dimensional bulk. Wediscuss in detail a correlator of four O(8) flavour currents on the Yang-Millsside, which receives contributions from the first type of saddle points only,and show that it matches with the correlator obtained from $F^4$ coupling onthe string theory side, which receives contribution from D-instantons, inperfect accord with the AdS/CFT correspondence. In particular we observe thatthe sectors with odd number of instantons give contribution to an O(8)-oddinvariant coupling, thereby breaking O(8) down to SO(8) in type I' stringtheory. We finally discuss correlators related to $R^4$, which receivecontributions from both saddle points.
