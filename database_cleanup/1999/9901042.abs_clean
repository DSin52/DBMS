We use equivariant K-theory to classify charges of new (possiblynon-supersymmetric) states localized on various orientifolds in Type II stringtheory. We also comment on the stringy construction of new D-branes anddemonstrate the discrete electric-magnetic duality in Type I brane systems withp+q=7, as proposed by Witten.
