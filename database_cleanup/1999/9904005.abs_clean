We review modifications of the Bekenstein-Hawking area law for black holeentropy in the presence of higher-derivative interactions. In four-dimensionalN=2 compactifications of string theory or M-theory these modifications arecrucial for finding agreement between the macroscopic entropy obtained fromsupergravity and the microscopic entropy obtained by counting states in stringor M-theory. Our discussion is based on the effective Wilsonian action, whichin the context of N=2 supersymmetric theories is defined in terms ofholomorphic quantities. At the end we briefly indicate how to incorporatenon-holomorphic corrections.
