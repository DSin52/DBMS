The heterotic $E_8\times E_8$ string compactified on an orbifold $T^4/\IZ_N$has gauge group $G\times G'$ with (massless) states in its twisted sectorswhich are charged under both gauge group factors. In the dual M-theory on$(T^4/\IZ_N)\otimes(S^1/\IZ_2)$ the two group factors are separated in theeleventh direction and the G and G' gauge fields are confined to the twoboundary planes, respectively. We present a scenario which allows for aresolution of this apparent paradox and assigns all massless matter multipletslocally to the different six-dimensional boundary fixed planes. The resolutionconsists of diagonal mixing between the gauge groups which live on theconnecting seven-planes (6d and the eleventh dimension) and one of the gaugegroup factors. We present evidence supporting this mixing by considering gaugecouplings and verify local anomaly cancellation. We also discuss open problemswhich arise in the presence of U_1 factors.
