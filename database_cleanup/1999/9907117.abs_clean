We investigate the effective dynamics of an arbitrary Dirichlet p-brane, in apath-integral formalism, by incorporating the massless excitations of closedstring modes in open bosonic string theory. It is shown that the closed stringbackground fields in the bosonic sector of type II theories induce invariantextrinsic curvature on the world-volume. In addition, the curvature can be seento be associated with a divergence at the boundary of string world-sheet. There-normalization of the collective coordinates, next to leading order in itsderivative expansion, is performed to handle the divergence and the effectivedynamics is encoded in Dirac-Born-Infeld action. Furthermore, the collectivedynamics is generalized to include appropriate fermionic partners in type Isuper-string theory. The role of string modes is reviewed in terms of thecollective coordinates and the gauge theory on the world-volume is argued to benon-local in presence of the U(1) invariant field strength.
