Title: Classification of Two Dimensional N=4 Superconformal Symmetries

Comments: 20 pages, LaTeX, no figures, one table

Classification of N=4 superconformal symmetries in two dimensions isre-examined. It is proposed that apart from SU(2) and $SU(2)\times SU(2)\timesU(1)$ their Kac-Moody symmetry can also be $SU(2)\times(U(1))^4$. Thesesuperconformal symmetries and corresponding algebras are named small, large andmiddle ones respectively. Operator product expansions for the middle algebraare derived. Complete free field realizations of large and middlesuperconformal symmetries are obtained.
