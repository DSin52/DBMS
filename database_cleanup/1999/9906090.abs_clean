We derive relations between type 0 and type II D-brane configurations underthe T-duality suggested by Bergman and Gaberdiel and confirm that the masslessfields on D-branes are identical to those on the dual D-brane configurations.Furthermore, we discuss dualities of type 0 and type II NS5-branes and findthat the dual of an unwrapped type 0 NS5-brane is a Kaluza-Klein monopole withnon-supersymmetric blow up modes.
