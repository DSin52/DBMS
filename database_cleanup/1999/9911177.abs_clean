We study the thermodynamics of the 2+1 dimensional Gross-Neveu model in thepresence of a chemical potential by introducing a representation for thecanonical partition function which encodes both real and imaginary chemicalpotential cases. It is pointed out that the latter case probes thethermodynamics of the possible anyon-like excitations in the spectrum. It isalso intimately connected to the breaking of the discrete Z-symmetry of a U(1)gauge theory coupled to the Gross-Neveu model at finite temperature, which weinterpret as signaling anyon deconfinement. Finally, the chiral properties ofthe model in the presence of an imaginary chemical potential are discussed andanalytical results for the free-energy density at the transition points arepresented.
