We investigate the connections between four-dimensional, N=2 M-theory vacuaconstructed as orbifolds of type II, heterotic, and type I strings. All thesemodels have the same massless spectrum, which contains an equal number ofvector multiplets and hypermultiplets, with a gauge group of the maximal rankallowed in a perturbative heterotic string construction. We find evidence forduality between two type I compactifications recently proposed and a newheterotic construction that we present here. This duality allows us to gaininsight into the non-perturbative properties of these models. In particular weconsider gravitational corrections to the effective action.
