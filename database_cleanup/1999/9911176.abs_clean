Authors: B. Geyer, D.M. Gitman and P.M. Lavrov

Comments: (LaTex) 10 pages, Talk given by P.M.L. at the International workshop

"Physical Variables in Gauge Theories", Dubna (Russia), 21-25 September 1999(to appear in the proceedings)A short rewiev of covariant quantization methods based on BRST-antiBRSTsymmetry is given. In particular problems of correct definition of Sp(2)symmetric quantization scheme known as triplectic quantization are considered.
