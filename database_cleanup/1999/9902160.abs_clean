Using the relation between D-brane charges and K-theory, we study non-BPSD-branes and their behavior under T-duality. We point out that in generalcompactifications, D-brane charges are classified by relative K-theory groups.T-duality is found to act as a symmetry between the relative K-theory groups inType II and Type I/IA theories. We also study Type \tilde\IA theory (whichcontains an O8^- plane and an O8^+ plane), using K-theory and T-duality toidentify its stable D-branes. Comparison with string theory constructionsreveals two interesting effects. One of them involves the transfer of branesbetween O-planes, while in the other, a D-brane charge which seems conservednear one O-plane in fact decays due to the presence of another type of O-plane.
