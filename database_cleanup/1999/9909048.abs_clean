We construct a model consisting of many D3-branes with only positive tensionin a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space-time geometry. It is shown that thistype of model naturally realizes not only exponential mass hierarchy betweenthe Planck scale and the electroweak scale but also trapping of the graviton onthe D3-branes. It is pointed out that our model may have a flexibility toexplain the existence of more than one disparate mass scales, such as theelectroweak scale and the GUT scale, on the same D3-brane.
