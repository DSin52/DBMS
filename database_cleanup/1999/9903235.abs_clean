Title: Comment on ``Singularities in axially symmetric solutions of

Einstein-Yang Mills and related theories, by Ludger Hannibal,[hep-th/9903063]''Authors: B. Kleihaus (1) and J. Kunz (2) ((1) Nat. U. of Ireland Maynooth,

We point out that the statements in [hep-th/9903063] concerning theregularity of static axially symmetric solutions in Yang-Mills-dilaton (YMD)[1] and Einstein-Yang-Mills(-dilaton) (EYMD) theory [2,3] are incorrect, andthat the non-singular local gauge potential of the YMD solutions [4] is twicedifferentiable.
