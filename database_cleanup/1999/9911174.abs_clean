Using a nonlinear electrodynamics coupled to General Relativity a new regularexact black hole solution is found. The nonlinear theory reduces to the Maxwellone in the weak limit, and the solution corresponds to a charged black hole for|q| \leq 2s_c m \approx 1.05 m, with metric, curvature invariants, and electricfield regular everywhere.
