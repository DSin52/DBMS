We develope the analogue of S-duality for linearized gravity in(3+1)-dimensions. Our basic idea is to consider the self-dual (anti-self-dual)curvature tensor for linearized gravity in the context of theMacdowell-Mansouri formalism. We find that the strong-weak coupling duality forlinearized gravity is an exact symmetry and implies small-large duality for thecosmological constant.
