Authors: Michael Haack and Jan Louis

Comments: 5 pages, no figures, uses cargese.cls; changed some references and

the discussion of the moduli space on the M-Theory sideWe study the duality between M-theory compactified on Calabi-Yau fourfoldsand the heterotic string compactified on Calabi-Yau threefolds times a circle.Our analysis is based on a comparison of the low energy effective actions inthree dimensions.
