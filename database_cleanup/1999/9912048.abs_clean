We describe a general method for calculating the infra-red limit of physicalquantities in unitary quantum field theories. Using analyticity of Greenfunctions in a complex scale parameter, the infra-red limit is expressed as acontour integral entirely in the ultra-violet region. The infra-red limit isshown to be the limit of the Borel transform of the physical quantity. Themethod is illustrated by calculating the central charge of the perturbedunitary minimal models and the critical exponents of phi^4 theory in threedimensions. We obtain approximate values for the central charge which are veryclose to the exact values using only a one loop perturbative calculation. Forphi^4 theory we obtain estimates which are within the errors of other moreelaborate approaches.
