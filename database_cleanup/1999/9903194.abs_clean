We consider the non-interacting massive Wess-Zumino model in four-dimensionalanti-de Sitter space and show that the conformal dimensions of thecorresponding boundary fields satisfy the relations expected fromsuperconformal invariance. In some cases the irregular mode must be used forone of the scalar fields.
