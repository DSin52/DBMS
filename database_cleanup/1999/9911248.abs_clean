The Casimir energy of a non-uniform string built up from two pieces withdifferent speed of sound is calculated. A standard procedure of subtracting theenergy of an infinite uniform string is applied, the subtraction beinginterpreted as the renormalization of the string tension. It is shown that inthe case of a homogeneous string this method is completely equivalent to thezeta renormalization.
