We consider a 1+1 dimensional field theory constrained to a finite box oflength L. Traditionally, calculations in a box are done by replacing theintegrals over the spatial momenta by discrete sums and then evaluating sumsand doing analytic continuations. We show that it is also possible to do suchcalculations using an analogy to finite temperature field theory. We develop aformalism that is similar to the closed time path formulation of finitetemperature field theory. Our technique can be used to calculate spatiallyretarded green functions, without evaluating sums or doing analyticcontinuations. We calculate the self energy in a simple scalar theory as anexample.
