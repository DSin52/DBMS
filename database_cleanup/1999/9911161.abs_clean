We study brane configurations that give rise to large-N gauge theories witheight supersymmetries and no hypermultiplets. These configurations include avariety of wrapped, fractional, and stretched branes or strings. Thecorresponding spacetime geometries which we study have a distinct kind ofsingularity known as a repulson. We find that this singularity is removed by adistinctive mechanism, leaving a smooth geometry with a core having an enhancedgauge symmetry. The spacetime geometry can be related to large-N Seiberg-Wittentheory.
