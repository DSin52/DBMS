In a nonrelativistic contact four-fermion model we show that simpleregularisation prescriptions together with a definite fine-tuning of thecut-off-parameter dependence of ``bare'' quantities give the exact solutionsfor the two-particle sector and Goldstone modes. Their correspondence with theself-adjoint extension into Pontryagin space is established leading toself-adjoint semi-bounded Hamiltonians in three-particle sectors as well.Renormalized Faddeev equations for the bound states with Fredholm propertiesare obtained and analysed.
