We construct three-dimensional N=1 QED with N_f flavors using branes of typeIIB string theory. This theory has a mirror, which can be realized using theS-dual brane configuration. As in examples with more supersymmetry, the Higgsbranch of the original theory gets mapped into the Coulomb branch of themirror. We use parity invariance to argue that these branches cannot be liftedby quantum corrections.
