Supersymmetric CPN models based on underlying bosonic Kahler manifolds havenot been thought to arise directly from constrained linear ones. Acounterexample for N=4 is presented using improved understanding of membranesin superstring theories leading to crucial central terms modifying the algebraof supercharge densities. The example has an immediate extension to all higher
