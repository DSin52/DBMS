Title: Knot Invariants from Classical Field Theories

Comments: 7 pages, LaTeX. Talk delivered at the Spanish Relativity Meeting,

Bilbao, Spain, 1999We consider the Non-Abelian Chern-Simons term coupled to external particles,in a gauge and diffeomorphism invariant form. The classical equations of motionare perturbativelly studied, and the on-shell action is shown to produceknot-invariants associated with the sources. The first contributions areexplicitly calculated, and the corresponding knot-invariants are recognized.We conclude that the interplay between Knot Theory and Topological FieldTheories is manifested not only at the quantum level, but in a classicalcontext as well.
