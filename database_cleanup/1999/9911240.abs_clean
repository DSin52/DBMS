The use of gauged ${\cal N} = 8$ supergravity as a tool in studying theAdS/CFT correspondence for ${\cal N} = 4$ Yang-Mills theory is reviewed. Thesupergravity potential implies a non-trivial, supersymmetric IR fixed point,and the flow to this fixed point is described in terms of a supergravity kink.The results agree perfectly with earlier, independent field theory results. Asupergravity inspired $c$-function, and corresponding $c$-theorem is discussedfor general flows, and the simplified form for supersymmetric flows is alsogiven. Flows along the Coulomb branch of the Yang-Mills theory are alsodescribed from the five-dimensional perspective.
