We study the D8-branes of the Romans massive IIA supergravity theory usingthe coupled supergravity and worldvolume actions. D8 branes can be regarded asdomain walls with the jump in the extrinsic curvature at the brane given by theIsrael matching conditions. We examine the restrictions that these conditionsplace on extreme and non-extreme solutions and find that they rule out some ofthe supersymmetric solutions given by Bergshoeff {\em et al}. We consider whathappens when the dilaton varies on the worldvolume of the brane, which impliesthat the brane is no longer static. We obtain a family of D8-brane solutionsparametrized by a non-extremality term on each side of the brane and theasymptotic values of the 10-form field. The non-extremality parameters can berelated to the velocity of the brane. We also study 8-brane solutions of amassive IIA supergravity theory introduced by Howe, Lambert and West. Thistheory also admits a 10-form formulation, but the 10-form is not a R-R sectorfield and so these 8-branes are not D-branes.
