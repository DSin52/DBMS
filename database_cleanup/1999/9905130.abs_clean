We explicitly calculate a Witten diagram with general spinor field exchangeon $(d+1)$-dimensional Euclidean Anti-de Sitter space, which is necessary toevaluate four-point correlation functions with spinor fields when we make useof the AdS/CFT correspondence, especially in supersymmetric cases. We also showthat the amplitude can be reduced to a scalar exchange amplitude. We discussthe operator product expansion of the dual conformal field theory byinterpreting the short distance expansion of the amplitude according to theAdS/CFT correspondence.
