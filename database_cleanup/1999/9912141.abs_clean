By considering the gradient expansion for the wilsonian effective action S_kof a single component scalar field theory truncated to the first two terms, thepotential U_k and the kinetic term Z_k, I show that the recent claim thatdifferent expansion of the fluctuation determinant give rise to differentrenormalization group equations for Z_k is incorrect. The correct procedure toderive this equation is presented and the set of coupled differential equationsfor U_k and Z_k is definitely established.
