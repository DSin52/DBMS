Title: The Physics of Instantons in the pseudoscalar and vector meson mixing

Comments: 17 pages plain TeX, 1 figure PostScript. Revised paper. A numerical

error in previous version needed to be correctedWhen the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics was introduced, it was to explainthe observed phenomena of quark confinement and scaling. It was then discoveredthat the emergence of instantons is an essential consequence of this theory.This led to unanticipated explanations not only for the anomalously high massesof the $\eta$ and the $\eta'$ particles, but also for the remarkabledifferences that had been observed in the mixing angles for the pseudoscalarmesons and the vector mesons.
