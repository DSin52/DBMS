Previously we have shown that open groups whose generators are in arbitraryinvolutions may be quantized within a ghost extended framework in terms of thenilpotent BFV-BRST charge operator. Here we show that they may also bequantized within an Sp(2)-frame in which there are two odd anticommutingoperators called Sp(2)-charges. Previous results for finite open grouptransformations are generalized to the Sp(2)-formalism. We show that in orderto define open group transformations on the whole ghost extended space we needSp(2)-charges in the nonminimal sector which contains dynamical Lagrangemultipliers. We give an Sp(2)-version of the quantum master equation withextended Sp(2)-charges and a master charge of a more involved form, which isproposed to represent the integrability conditions of defining operators ofconnection operators and which therefore should encode the generalized quantumMaurer-Cartan equations for arbitrary open groups. General solutions of thismaster equation are given in explicit form. A further extended Sp(2)-formalismis proposed in which the group parameters are quadrupled to a supersymmetricset and from which all results may be derived.
