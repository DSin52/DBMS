The quantum field theory describing electric and magnetic charges andrevealing a dual symmetry was developed in the Zwanziger formalism. Therenormalization group (RG) equations for both fine structure constants -electric $\alpha$ and magnetic $\tilde \alpha$ - were obtained. It was shownthat the Dirac relation is valid for the renormalized $\alpha $ and $\tilde\alpha$ at the arbitrary scale, but these RG equations can be considered\tilde \alpha \stackrel{<}{\sim} 1$ with $\tilde \alpha$ given by the Dirac
