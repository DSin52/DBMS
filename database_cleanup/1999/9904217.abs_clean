When an M-theory fivebrane wraps a holomorphic surface $\CP$ in a Calabi-Yau3-fold $X$ the low energy dynamics is that of a black string in 5 dimensional$\CN=1$ supergravity. The infrared dynamics on the string worldsheet is an $\CN= (0,4)$ 2D conformal field theory. Assuming the 2D CFT can be described as anonlinear sigma model, we describe the target space geometry of this model interms of the data of $X$ and $\CP$. Variations of weight two Hodge structuresenter the construction of the model in an interesting way.
