We construct a deformation of the quantum algebra Fun(T^*G) associated withLie group G to the case where G is replaced by a quantum group G_q which has abicovariant calculus. The deformation easily allows for the inclusion of thecurrent algebra of left and right invariant one forms. We use it to examine apossible generalization of the Gauss law commutation relations for gaugetheories based on G_q.
