We calculate the chiral anomaly in the neighbourhood of the fixed point spaceM_h which is constructed by the group action of a discrete symmetry h on acompact manifold M. The Feynman diagrams approach for the correspondingsupersymmetric quantum mechanical system with twisted boundary conditions isused. The result we derive in this way agrees with the generalization of theordinary index theorem (the G-index theorem) on the spin complex.
