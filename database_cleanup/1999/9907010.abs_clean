A constant homogeneous magnetic field is applied to a composite system madeof two scalar particles with opposite charges. Motion is described by a pair ofcoupled Klein-Gordon equations that are written in closed form with help of asuitable representation. The relativistic symmetry associated with the magneticfield is carefully respected. Considering eigenstates of the pseudo momentumfour-vector, we separate out collective variables and obtain a 3- dimensionalreduced equation, posing a nonconventional eigenvalue problem. The velocity ofthe system as a whole generates "motional" terms in the formulas these termsare taken into account within a manifestly covariant framework.
