Title: Confining N=1 SUSY gauge theories from Seiberg duality

Authors: Matthias Klein

Comments: 8 pages, Latex, to appear in the proceedings of the Trieste Meeting

of the TMR Network on Physics beyond the SM (Feb 24-27, 1999)In this talk I review and generalize an idea of Seiberg that an N=1supersymmetric gauge theory shows confinement without breaking of chiralsymmetry when the gauge symmetry of its magnetic dual is completely broken bythe Higgs effect. It is shown how the confining spectrum of a supersymmetricgauge theory can easily be derived when a magnetic dual is known and thismethod is applied to many models containing fields in second rank tensorrepresentations and an appropriate tree-level superpotential.
