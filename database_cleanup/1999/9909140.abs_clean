We present a general construction of all correlation functions of atwo-dimensional rational conformal field theory, for an arbitrary number ofbulk and boundary fields and arbitrary topologies. The correlators areexpressed in terms of Wilson graphs in a certain three-manifold, the connectingmanifold. The amplitudes constructed this way can be shown to be modularinvariant and to obey the correct factorization rules.
