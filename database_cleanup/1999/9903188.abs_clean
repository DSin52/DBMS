We apply the DMRG method to the 2 dimensional delta function potential whichis a simple quantum mechanical model with asymptotic freedom and formation ofbound states. The system block and the environment block of the DMRG containthe low energy and high energy degrees of freedom, respectively. The groundstate energy and the lowest excited states are obtained with very highaccuracy. We compare the DMRG method with the Similarity RG method and proposeits generalization to field theoretical models in high energy physics.
