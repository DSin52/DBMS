We describe the generalization of spherical field theory to other modalexpansion methods. The main approach remains the same, to reduce ad-dimensional field theory into a set of coupled one-dimensional systems. Themethod we discuss here uses an expansion with respect to periodic-box modes. Weapply the method to phi^4 theory in two dimensions and compute the criticalcoupling and critical exponents. We compare with lattice results andpredictions via universality and the two-dimensional Ising model.
