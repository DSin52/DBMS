Title: A toy model of Polyakov duality

Authors: Vipul Periwal

Comments: 6 pages, RevTeX; comment, reference added

Polyakov has conjectured that Yang-Mills theory should be equivalent to anoncritical string theory. I pointed out, based on the work of Marchesini,Ishibashi, Kawai and collaborators, and Jevicki and Rodrigues, that the loopoperator of the Yang-Mills theory is the temporal gauge string field theoryHamiltonian of a noncritical string theory. In the present note I explicitlyshow how this works for the one--plaquette model, providing a consistent directstring interpretation of the unitary matrix model for the first time.
