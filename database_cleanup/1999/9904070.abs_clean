We consider one-loop quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of a blackhole in generic 2-dimensional dilaton gravity. The classical action is the mostgeneral diffeomorphism invariant action in 1+1 space-time dimensions thatcontains a metric, dilaton, and Abelian gauge field, and having at most secondderivatives of the fields. Quantum corrections are introduced by consideringthe effect of matter fields conformally coupled to the metric and non-minimallycoupled to the dilaton. Back reaction of the matter fields (via non-vanishingtrace conformal anomaly) leads to quantum corrections to the black holegeometry. Quantum corrections also lead to modifications in the gravitationalaction and hence in expressions for thermodynamic quantities. One-loopcorrections to both geometry and thermodynamics (energy, entropy) arecalculated for the generic dilaton theory. This formalism is applied to acharged black hole in spherically symmetric gravity and to a rotating BTZ blackhole.
