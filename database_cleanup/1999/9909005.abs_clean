Comments: 4 pages, latex, uses cargese.cls, contribution to proceedings of

NATO-ASI and TMR Summer School ``Progress in String Theory and M-Theory'',Cargese, May 24 - June 5 1999The general criteria for finding bosonic supersymmetric worldvolume solitonsis reviewed. We concentrate on D-branes, discussing in particular, bion/dyonsolutions and D3 branes on NS5 backgrounds.
