The large N behavior of Matrix theory is discussed on the basis of thepreviously proposed generalized conformal symmetry. The concept of `oblique'AdS/CFT correspondence, in which the conformal symmetry involves both thespace-time coordinates and the string coupling constant, is proposed. Based onthe explicit predictions for two-point correlators, possible implications forthe Matrix-theory conjecture are discussed.
