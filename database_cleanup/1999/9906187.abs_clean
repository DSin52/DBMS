We analyse an integrable model of two-dimensional gravity which can bereduced to a pair of Liouville fields in conformal gauge. Its general solutionrepresents a pair of ``mirror'' black holes with the same temperature. Theground state is a degenerate constant dilaton configuration similar to theNariai solution of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter case. The existence of$\phi=const.$ solutions and their relation with the solution given by the 2DBirkhoff's theorem is then investigated in a more general context. We alsopoint out some interesting features of the semiclassical theory of our modeland the similarity with the behaviour of AdS$_2$ black holes.
