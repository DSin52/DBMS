We study the question of the Ward identity for "large" gauge invariance in0+1 dimensional theories. We derive the relevant Ward identities for a singleflavor fermion and a single flavor complex scalar field interacting with anAbelian gauge field. These identities are nonlinear. The Ward identity for anyother complicated theory can be derived from these basic sets of identities.However, the structure of the Ward identity changes since these are nonlinearidentities. In particular, we work out the "large" gauge Ward identity for asupersymmetric theory involving a single flavor of fermion as well as a complexscalar field. Contrary to the effective action for the individual theories, thesolution of the Ward identity in the supersymmetric theory involves an infinityof Fourier component modes. We comment on which features of this analysis arelikely/unlikely to generalize to the 2+1 dimensional theory.
