In general relativity and electrodynamics fields are always generated fromstatic monopoles (like mass or electric charge) or their corresponding currentsby surrounding them in a spherical configuration. We investigate a generationof fields from primary fields by a scalar coupling. The generated secondaryfields fulfill the condition of source-freedom and therefore cannot occur in aspherical configuration. The coupling strength depends on the energies of theprimary fields. In most cases these fields can be approximately considered asdipole fields. We discuss two applications of couplings for electromagnetic andgravitational spin-1 fields and for electric and magnetic fields. We calculatefor both applications the threshold values of field energy for the maximumcoupling strength. The proposed approach yields to a further step towards anunification of electromagnetism and gravitation and has important consequencesfor the discrete symmetries.
