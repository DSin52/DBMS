Title: Topological gauge invariant variables in QCD

Comments: 17 pages, RevTeX, no figures

We suggest that proper variables for the description of non-Abelian theoriesare those gauge invariant ones which keep the invariance of the winding numberfunctional with respect to topologically nontrivial (large) gaugetransformations. We present a model for these variables using the zero mode ofthe Gauss law constraint and investigate their physical consequences for hadronspectrum and confinement on the level of the generating functional fortwo-color QCD.
