According to conventional theory, the annihilation reaction p-bar p --> pi_0pi_0 cannot occur from a p-bar p atomic S state. However, this reaction occursso readily for antiprotons stopping in liquid hydrogen, that it would require30% P-wave annihilations. Experimental results from other capture and p-bar pannihilation channels show that the fraction of P-wave annihilations is lessthan 6% in agreement with theoretical expectations. An experimental test todetermine whether this reaction can occur from an atomic S state is suggested.If indeed this reaction is occurring from an atomic S state, then certainneutral vector mesons should exhibit a pi_0 pi_0 decay mode, and this can alsobe tested experimentally.
