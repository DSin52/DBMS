We study properties of a scalar quantum field theory on the two-dimensionalnoncommutative plane with $E_q(2)$ quantum symmetry. We start from theconsideration of a firstly quantized quantum particle on the noncommutativeplane. Then we define quantum fields depending on noncommutative coordinatesand construct a field theoretical action using the $E_q(2)$-invariant measureon the noncommutative plane. With the help of the partial wave decomposition weshow that this quantum field theory can be considered as a second quantizationof the particle theory on the noncommutative plane and that this field theoryhas (contrary to the common belief) even more severe ultraviolet divergencesthan its counterpart on the usual commutative plane. Finally, we introduce thesymmetry transformations of physical states on noncommutative spaces anddiscuss them in detail for the case of the $E_q(2)$ quantum group.
