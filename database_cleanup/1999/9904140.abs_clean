Authors: F.Antonuccio and J.O.Andersen

Comments: 7 pages, 1 Figure. Revised Introduction and references added

We perform a two-loop calculation in light-front phi^4 theory to determinethe effective mass renormalization of the light-front Hamiltonian. Therenormalization scheme adopted here is manifestly boost invariant, and yieldsresults that are in perfect agreement with the explicitly covariant Feynmandiagram approach.
