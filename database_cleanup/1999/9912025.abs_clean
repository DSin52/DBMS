We consider the heterotic string on an elliptic Calabi-Yau three-fold withfive-branes wrapping curves in the base ('horizontal' curves) of the Calabi-Yauas well as some elliptic fibers ('vertical' curves). We show that in thisgeneralized set-up, where the association of the heterotic side with the$F$-theory side is changed relative to the purely vertical situation, thenumber of five-branes wrapping the elliptic fibers still matches thecorresponding number of $F$-theory three-branes.
