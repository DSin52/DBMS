In this letter we shall discuss a description of non-supersymmetricfour-dimensional Yang-Mills theory based on Type 0 strings recently proposed byKlebanov and Tseytlin. The three brane near-horizon geometry allows one tostudy the UV behaviour of the gauge theory. Following Minahan and Klebanov andTseytlin we shall discuss how the gravity solution reproduces logarithmicrenormalization of coupling constant $g_e$ extracted from quark-antiquarkpotential and then show that effective coupling constant $g_m$ describingmonopole-antimonopole interactions is of zero-charge type and Dirac condition$g_e g_m = 1$ is scale invariant in logarithmic approximation.
