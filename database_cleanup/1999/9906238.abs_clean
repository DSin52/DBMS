We confirm the intuition that a string theory which is perturbativelyinfrared finite is automatically perturbatively ultraviolet finite. Ourderivation based on the asymptotics of the Selberg trace formula for the Greensfunction on a Riemann surface holds for both open and closed string amplitudesand is independent of modular invariance and supersymmetry. The masses of theopen strings stretched between Dbranes give a natural world-sheet ultravioletregulator for the string path integral preserving both T-duality andopen-closed string world-sheet duality.
