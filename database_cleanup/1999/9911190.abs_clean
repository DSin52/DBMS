We study supersymmetric orientifolds where the world-sheet paritytransformation is combined with a conjugation of some compact complexcoordinates. We investigate their T-duality relation to standard orientifoldsand discuss the origin of continuous and discrete moduli. In contrast tostandard orientifolds, the antisymmetric tensor describes a continuousdeformation, while the off-diagonal part of the metric is frozen to quantizedvalues and is responsible for the rank reduction of the gauge group. We alsogive a geometrical interpretation of some recently constructed six-dimensionalpermutational orientifolds.
