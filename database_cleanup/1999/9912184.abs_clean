We study a family of BPS solutions of type IIA supergravity that can beinterpreted as describing the `transmutation' of a Neveu-Schwarz five-braneinto a D4-brane in the presence of a D6-brane. The D4-brane, which terminateson the D6-brane, can be equally well interpreted as a `pure multipole'configuration of NS5-brane wrapped tightly around the D6-brane. Such atransmutation is a "near-core" version (i.e., near the D6-brane) of thebrane-creation that can occur when two branes pass through each other, as inthe Hanany-Witten construction. The work below highlights certain chargenon-conservation features of type IIA supergravity.
