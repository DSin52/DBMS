A formula describing finite renormalizations is derived in the Epstein-Glaserformalism and an explicit calculation of finite counterterms in $\Phi^4$-theory is performed. The Zimmermann identities and the action principle forchanges of parameters in the interaction are presented independent of theadiabatic limit.
