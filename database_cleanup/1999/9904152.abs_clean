The classification of the regularization ambiguity of 2D fermionicdeterminant in three different classes according to the number of second-classconstraints, including the new faddeevian regularization, is examined andextended. We found a new and important result that the faddeevian class, withthree second-class constraints, possess a free continuous one parameter familyof elements. The criterion of unitarity restricts the parameter to the samerange found earlier by Jackiw and Rajaraman for the two-constraints class. Westudied the restriction imposed by the interference of right-left modes of thechiral Schwinger model ($\chi QED_{2}$) using Stone's soldering formalism. Theinterference effects between right and left movers, producing the massivevectorial photon, are shown to constrain the regularization parameter to belongto the four-constraints class which is the only non-ambiguous class with aunique regularization parameter.
