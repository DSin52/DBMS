We examine the structure of the potential energy of 2+1-dimensionalYang-Mills theory on a torus with gauge group SU(2). We use a standarddefinition of distance on the space of gauge orbits. A curve of extremalpotential energy in orbit space defines connections satisfying a certainpartial differential equation. We argue that the energy spectrum is gappedbecause the extremal curves are of finite length. Though classical gluon wavessatisfy our differential equation, they are not extremal curves. We constructexamples of extremal curves and find how the length of these curves depends onthe dimensions of the torus. The intersections with the Gribov horizon aredetermined explicitly. The results are discussed in the context of Feynman'sideas about the origin of the mass gap.
