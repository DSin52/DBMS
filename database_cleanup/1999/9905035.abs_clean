Non-equilibrium quantum field theory studies time dependence of processeswhich are not available for the S-matrix description. One of the new methods ofinvestigation in non-equilibrium quantum theory is the stochastic limit method.This method is an extension of the works by Bogoliubov, van Hove and Prigogineand it permits to study not only the system but also the reservoir degrees offreedom. We consider the stochastic limit of translation invariant Hamiltoniansin quantum field theory and show that the master field satisfies a new type ofcommutation relations, the so called entangled (or interacting) commutationrelations. These relations extend the interacting Fock relations establishedearlier in non-relativistic QED and the free (or Boltzmann) commutationrelations which have been found in the large N limit of QCD. As an applicationof the stochastic limit method we consider the photon splitting cascades inmagnetic field and show that photons in cascades form entangled states("triphons") and they obey not Bose but a new type of statistics correspondingto the entangled commutation relations.
