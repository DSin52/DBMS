New S-dualities in a scale invariant N=2 gauge theory with SU(2) x SU(2)gauge group are derived from embeddings of the theory in two different largerasymptotically free theories. The true coupling space of the scale invarianttheory is a 20-fold identification of the coupling space found in the M- andstring-theory derivations of the low energy effective action, implying a largerS-duality group. Also, this coupling space is different from the naivelyexpected direct product of two SL(2,Z) fundamental domains, as it contains adifferent topology of fixed points.
