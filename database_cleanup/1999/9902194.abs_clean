Title: Superconformal Deformations and Space-Time Symmetries

Comments: 7 pages, plain Tex, to appear in

Press (1999))In this paper we present a method of deforming to first order thestress-tensor and the supercurrent of the superstring corresponding to turningon NS-NS bosonic fields. Furthermore we discuss the difficulties associatedwith turning on spacetime fermions and R-R bosons. We also derive the gaugesymmetries of the massless spacetime fields.
