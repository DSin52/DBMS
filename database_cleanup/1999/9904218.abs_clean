We discuss how to obtain an N=(2,2) supersymmetric SU(3) gauge theory in twodimensions via geometric engineering from a Calabi-Yau 4-fold and compute itsnon-perturbative twisted chiral potential. The relevant compact part of the4-fold geometry consists of two intersecting P^1's fibered over P^2. The rigidlimit of the local mirror of this geometry is a complex surface thatgeneralizes the Seiberg-Witten curve and on which there exist two holomorphic2-forms. These stem from the same meromorphic 2-form as derivatives w.r.t. thetwo moduli, respectively. The middle periods of this meromorphic form givedirectly the twisted chiral potential. The explicit computation of these and ofthe four-point Yukawa couplings allows for a non-trivial test of the analogueof rigid special geometry for a 4-fold with several moduli.
