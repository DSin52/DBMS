Duality transformations involving compactifications on timelike as well asspacelike circles link M-theory, the 10+1-dimensional strong coupling limit ofIIA string theory, to other 11-dimensional theories in signatures 9+2 and 6+5and to type II string theories in all 10-dimensional signatures. These theorieshave BPS branes of various world-volume signatures, and here we construct theworld-volume theories for these branes, which in each case have 16supersymmetries. For the generalised D-branes of the various type II stringtheories, these are always supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with 16supersymmetries, and we show that these all arise from compactifications of thesupersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in 9+1 or 5+5 dimensions. We discuss thegeometry of the brane solutions and, for the cases in which the world-volumetheories are superconformally invariant, we propose holographically dual stringor M theories in constant curvature backgrounds. For product space solutions$X\times Y$, there is in general a conformal field theory associated with theboundary of $X$ and another with the boundary of $Y$.
