In discussions of the T-duality between the two heterotic string theories,the duality is actually implemented through the "common" SO(16) x SO(16)subgroup of "SO(32)" and E_8 x E_8. In fact, however, a global investigationshows that no such "common" subgroup exists. This paper is a survey of therelevant global properties of Spin(32)/Z_2 and its subgroups.
