We study N=1 SUSY theories in four dimensions with multiple discrete vacua,which admit solitonic solutions describing segments of domain walls meeting atone-dimensional junctions. We show that there exist solutions preserving onequarter of the underlying supersymmetry -- a single Hermitian supercharge. Wederive a BPS bound for the masses of these solutions and construct a solutionexplicitly in a special case. The relevance to the confining phase of N=1 SUSYYang-Mills and the M-theory/SYM relationship is discussed.
