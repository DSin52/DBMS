This article gives a review of the topic of regularising chiral gaugetheories and is aimed at a general audience. It begins by clarifying themeaning of chirality and goes on to discussing chiral projections in fieldtheory, parity violation and the distinction between vector and chiral fieldtheories. It then discusses the standard model of electroweak interactions fromthe perspective of chirality.  It also reviews at length the phenomenon ofanomalies in quantum field theories including the intuitive understanding ofanomalies based on the Dirac sea picture as given by Nielsen and Ninomiya. Itthen raises the issue of a non-perturbative and constructive definition of thestandard model as well as the importance of such formulations. The secondNielsen-Ninomiya theorem about the impossibility of regularising chiral gaugetheories under some general assumptions is also discussed. After a brief reviewof lattice regularisation of field theories, it discusses the issue of fermionson the lattice with special emphasis on the problem of species doubling. Theimplications of these problems to introducing chiral fermions on the lattice aswell as the interpretations of anomalies within the lattice formulations andthe lattice Dirac sea picture are then discussed. Finally the difficulties offormulating the standard model on the lattice are illustrated through detaileddiscussions of the Wilson-Yukawa method, the domain wall fermions method andthe recently popular Ginsparg-Wilson method.
