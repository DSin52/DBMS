We present a detailed discussion of the asymptotic symmetries of Anti-deSitter space in two dimensions and their relationship with the conformal groupin one dimension. We use this relationship to give a microscopical derivationof the entropy of 2d black holes that have asymptotically Anti-de Sitterbehaviour. The implications of our results for the conjectured AdS_2/CFT_1duality are also discussed.
