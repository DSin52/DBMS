The correspondence between the ground states of the BFSS matrix model and thetype IIA string is investigated through the 11th direction. We derive the typeIIA string from 11 dimensional supermembrane wrapped around the 11th directionof periodicity without a procedure of the double dimensional reduction, but bytaking the large limit of radius R in the 11th direction. It is shown that thecenter of mass of this string as a function on the 11th coordinate has the samematrix description as the BFSS matrix model in the flat direction. The factshows that the matrix model at the strong string coupling in the flat directionis directly connected with the 11 dimensional supermembrane theory in thetransverse light-cone frame.
