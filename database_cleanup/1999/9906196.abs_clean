We find the absorption probability of dilaton field in type 0B string theory.Since the background solutions are of the form $AdS_5 \times S^5$ on bothregions, we use the semiclassical formalism adopted in type IIB theory to findthe absorption cross section. The background tachyon field solution was used asa reference to relate the solutions of the two regions. We also consider thepossible corrections to absorption probability and the $\ln(\ln z)$ form of thecorrection is expected as in the calculation of the confinement solution.
