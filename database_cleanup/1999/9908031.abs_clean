We argue that the quantized non-Abelian gauge theory can be obtained as theinfrared limit of the corresponding classical gauge theory in a higherdimension. We show how the transformation from classical to quantum dynamicsemerges and calculate Planck's constant from quantities defined in theunderlying classical field theory.
