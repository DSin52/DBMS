Title: Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking of q-Gauge Field Theory

Authors: R. J. Finkelstein (U. of California, Los Angeles)

Comments: 14 pages, Tex file

In non-Abelian field theories with q-symmetry groups the massive particleshave a non-local interpretation with a stringlike spectrum. It is shown that amassless vector similarly acquires a tower of masses by spontaneous symmetrybreaking.
