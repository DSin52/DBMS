We generalize the background gauge in the Matrix model to propose a new gaugewhich is useful for discussing the conformal symmetry. In this gauge, thespecial conformal transformation (SCT) as the isometry of the near-horizongeometry of the D-particle solution is directly reproduced with the correctcoefficient as the quantum correction to the SCT in the Matrix model. We alsopresent a general argument for the relation between the gauge choice and thefield redefinition in the Matrix model.
