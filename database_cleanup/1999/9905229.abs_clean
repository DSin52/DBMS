Fractons are anyons classified into equivalence classes and they obey aspecific fractal statistics. The equivalence classes are labeled by a fractalparameter or Hausdorff dimension $h$. We consider this approach in the contextof the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE) and the concept of duality betweensuch classes, defined by $\tilde{h}=3-h$ shows us that the filling factors forwhich the FQHE were observed just appear into these classes. A connectionbetween equivalence classes $h$ and the modular group for the quantum phasetransitions of the FQHE is also obtained. A $\beta-$function is defined for acomplex conductivity which embodies the classes $h$. The thermodynamics is alsoconsidered for a gas of fractons $(h,\nu)$ with a constant density of statesand an exact equation of state is obtained at low-temperature and low-densitylimits. We also prove that the Farey sequences for rational numbers can beexpressed in terms of the equivalence classes $h$.
