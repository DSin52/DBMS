We study nonperturbative aspects of asymmetric orbifolds of type IIA,focussing on models that allow a dual perturbative heterotic description. Inparticular we derive the boundary states that describe the nonsupersymmetricD-branes of the untwisted sector and their zero mode spectra. These we use todemonstrate, how some special non BPS multiplets are identified under theduality map, and give some indications, how the mismatch of bosons and fermionsin the perturbative heterotic spectrum is to be interpreted in terms of thenonperturbative degrees of freedom on the type IIA side.
