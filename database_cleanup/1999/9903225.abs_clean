Motivated by the ``universe as a brane'' idea, we investigate the motion of a$(D-2)$-brane (or domain wall) that couples to bulk matter. Usually one wouldexpect the spacetime outside such a wall to be time dependent however we showthat in certain cases it can be static, with consistency of the Israelequations yielding relationships between the bulk metric and matter that can beused as ans\"atze to solve the Einstein equations. As a concrete model we studya domain wall coupled to a bulk dilaton with Liouville potentials for thedilaton both in the bulk and on the wall. The bulk solutions we find are allsingular but some have black hole or cosmological horizons, beyond which oursolutions describe domain walls moving in time dependent bulks. A significantperiod of world volume inflation occurs if the potential on the wall is not toosteep; in some cases the bulk also inflates (with the wall comoving) while inothers the wall moves relative to a non-inflating bulk. We apply our method toobtain cosmological solutions of Ho\v{r}ava-Witten theory compactified on aCalabi-Yau space. tive to a non-inflating bulk.
