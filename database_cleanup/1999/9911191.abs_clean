In this paper we first give arguments supporting the idea that a B.T.Z blackhole can face a transplankian problem even when its mass is small. K.M.Mquantum theory is applied to the Hawking evaporation of the Schwarzchild andB.T.Z black holes. Working in the physically safe quasi positionrepresentation, we argue that the oscillating term present in a previousanalysis is removed so that actually one doesn't need an average procedure. Weexpand the s wave function as the exponential of a series in the minimal lengthof the new quantum theory. This reduces an infinite order differential equationto a numerable set of finite order ones. We obtain the striking result that theinfinity of arbitrary constants induced by the order of the wave equation hasno physical meaning due to normalization. We finally construct gaussian wavepacqets and study their trajectories. We suggest a quantitative description ofthe non locality zone and its dependance on the K.M.M energy scale. Potentialincidences on unitarity are briefly evoqued.
