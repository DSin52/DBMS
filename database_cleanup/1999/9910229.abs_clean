It is argued that there are states (quasiparticles) with masses ranging overthe scales $\Lambda N_{c}^{1/3} \div \Lambda N_{c}$ in N=1 supersymmetricmulticolor gluodynamics. These states exist in the form of quantum bubbles madeout of the BPS domain walls. Analogous states are likely to exist innon-supersymmetric case as well.
