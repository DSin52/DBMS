model changedWe show that it is possible to construct supersymmetric three-generationmodels of Standard Model gauge group in the framework of non-simply-connectedelliptically fibered Calabi-Yau, without section but with a bi-section. Thefibrations on a cover Calabi-Yau, where the model has 6 generations of SU(5)and the bundle is given via the spectral cover description, use a differentdescription of the elliptic fibre which leads to more than one global section.one is a fibre product of rational elliptic surfaces $dP_9$; another example isan elliptic fibration over a Hirzebruch surface. There we give the necessaryamount of chiral matter by turning on in the bundles a further parameter,related to singularities of the fibration and the branching of the spectralcover.
