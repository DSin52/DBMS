One-dimensional sigma-models with N supersymmetries are considered. Forconventional supersymmetries there must be N-1 complex structures satisfying aClifford algebra and the constraints on the target space geometry can beformulated in terms of these. In the cases in which the complex structures aresimultaneously integrable, a conventional extended superspace formulation isgiven, with the geometry determined by a 2-form potential for N=2, by a 1-formpotential for N=3 and a scalar potential for N=4; for N>4 it is given by ascalar potential satisfying differential constraints. This gives explicitconstructions of models with N=3 but not N=4 supersymmetry and of N=4 models inwhich the complex structures do not satisfy a quaternionic algebra.Generalisations with central terms in the superalgebra are also considered.
