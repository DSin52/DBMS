p-form gauge theories with Stueckelberg coupling are quantized in anirreducible antifield-BRST way. As a consequence, neither the ghosts of ghostsnor their antifields appear. Some irreducible gauge conditions are inferrednaturally within our formalism. In the end we briefly discuss the interactingcase.
