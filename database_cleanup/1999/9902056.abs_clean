A particularly simple class of nonselfdual solutions are obtained for gaugefields in Schwarzschild and deSitter backgrounds. For Lorentz signature thesehave finite energy and finite action for Euclidean signature. In each case oneobtains either real or a pair of complex conjugate solutions. The actions areeasily computed for any dimension d. Numerical values are given for d=4,6,7,8,9,10. It is explained why d=5 is a very special case. Possiblecontinuations and generalizations of the results obtained are indicated. Aparticular solution for AdS_4 background is presented in the Appendix.
