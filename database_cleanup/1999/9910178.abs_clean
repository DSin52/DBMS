We apply the antifield quantization method of Batalin and Vilkovisky to thecalculation of the path integral for the Poisson-Sigma model in a generalgauge. For a linear Poisson structure the model reduces to a nonabelian gaugetheory, and we obtain the formula for the partition function of two-dimensionalYang-Mills theory for closed two-dimensional manifolds.
