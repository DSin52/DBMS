FieldAuthors: M. B. Hott and J. L. Tomazelli

In this work we derive the Lorentz-PCT-violating effective action for afermion in a constant and uniform electromagnetic field using theFock-Schwinger proper time method and extract the exact value of thecoefficient of the nonperturbatively induced Chern-Simons term.
