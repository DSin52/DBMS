Non-singular two and three dimensional string cosmologies are constructedusing the exact conformal field theories corresponding to SO(2,1)/SO(1,1) andSO(2,2)/SO(2,1). All semi-classical curvature singularities are canceled in theexact theories for both of these cosets, but some new quantum curvaturesingularities emerge. However, considering different patches of the globalmanifolds, allows the construction of non-singular spacetimes with cosmologicalinterpretation. In both two and three dimensions, we construct non-singularoscillating cosmologies, non-singular expanding and inflationary cosmologiesincluding a de Sitter (exponential) stage with positive scalar curvature aswell as non-singular contracting and deflationary cosmologies. We analyse thesecosmologies in detail with respect to the behaviour of the scale factors, thescalar curvature and the string-coupling. The sign of the scalar curvature ischanged by the quantum corrections in oscillating cosmologies and evolves withtime in the non-oscillating cases. Similarities between the two and threedimensional cases suggest a general picture for higher dimensional cosetsingularities are generically avoided and it is possible to constructnon-singular cosmologies where some spatial dimensions are experiencinginflation while the others experience deflation.
