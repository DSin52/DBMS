the X Jorge Andre Swieca Summer School on Particles and Fields, Sao Paulo,7-12 February 1999We examine some recent developments in noncommutative geometry, includingspin geometries on noncommutative tori and their quantization by theShale-Stinespring procedure, as well as the emergence of Hopf algebras as atool linking index theory and renormalization calculations
