Chiral superfields have been used, and extensively, almost ever sincesupersymmetry has been discovered. Complex linear superfields afford analternate representation of matter, but are widely misbelieved to be'physically equivalent' to chiral ones. We prove the opposite is true.Curiously, this re-enables a previously thwarted interpretation of thelow-energy (super)field limit of superstrings.
