We study supersymmetry breaking by hidden-sector gaugino condensation in N=1D=4 supergravity models with multiple dilaton-like moduli fields. Our work ismotivated by Type I string theory, in which the low-energy effective Lagrangiancan have different dilaton-like fields coupling to different sectors of thetheory. We construct the effective Lagrangian for gaugino condensation and useit to compute the visible-sector gaugino masses. We find that the gauginomasses can be of order the gravitino mass, in stark contrast to heteroticstring models with a single dilaton field.
