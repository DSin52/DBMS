A consistent definition of high dimensional compactified quantum field theorywithout breaking the Kaluza-Klein tower is proposed. It is possible in thelimit when the size of compact dimensions is of the order of the cut off. Thislimit is nontrivial and depends on the geometry of compact dimensions. Possibleconsequences are discussed for the scalar model.
