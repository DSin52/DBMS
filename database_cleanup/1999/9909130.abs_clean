We show that smooth domain wall spacetimes supported by a scalar fieldseparating two anti-de-Sitter like regions admit a single graviton bound state.Our analysis yields a fully non-linear supergravity treatment of theRandall-Sundrum model. Our solutions describe a pp-wave propagating in thedomain wall background spacetime. If the latter is BPS, our solutions retainsome supersymmetry. Nevertheless, the Kaluza-Klein modes generate ``ppcurvature'' singularities in the bulk located where the horizon of AdS wouldordinarily be.
