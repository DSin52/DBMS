We examine how to construct explicit heterotic string models dual to F-theoryin eight dimensions. In doing so we learn about where the moduli spaces of thetwo theories overlap, and how non-perturbative features leave traces on apurely perturbative level. We also propose a modified T-duality linking M andF-theories based on non-perturbative structures of string theories in eightdimensions.
