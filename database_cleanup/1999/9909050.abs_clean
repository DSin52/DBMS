A non-abelian topological quantum field theory describing the scattering ofself-dual field configurations over topologically non-trivial Riemann surfaces,arising from the reduction of 4-dim self-dual Yang-Mills fields, is introduced.It is shown that the phase space of the theory can be exactly quantized interms of the space of holomorphic structures over stable vector bundles ofdegree zero over Riemann surfaces. The Dirac monopoles are particular staticsolutions of the field equations. Its relation to topological gravity isdiscussed.
