We discuss the quantum corrections to thermodynamics (and geometry) of S(A)dSBHs using large $N$ one-loop anomaly induced effective action for dilatoncoupled matter (scalars and spinors). It is found the temperature, mass andentropy with account of quantum effects for multiply horizon SdS BH and SAdS BHand de Sitter spaces. In the last case one can talk about quantum correction toentropy of expanding Universe.The anomaly induced action under discussion corresponds to 4d formulation(s-wave approximation, 4d quantum matter is minimal one) as well as 2dformulation (complete effective action, 2d quantum matter is dilaton coupledone). Hence, most of results are given for the same gravitational backgroundwith interpretation as 4d quantum corrected BH or 2d quantum correcteddilatonic BH. Quantum aspects of thermodynamics of 4d 't Hooft BH model arealso considered.
