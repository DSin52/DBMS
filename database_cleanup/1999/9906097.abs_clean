PhysicsIn this work we derive certain topological theories of transverse vectorfields whose amplitudes reproduce topological invariants involving theinteractions among the trajectories of three and four random walks. This resultis applied to the construction of a field theoretical model which describes thestatistical mechanics of an arbitrary number of topologically linked polymersin the context of the analytical approach of Edwards. With respect to previousattempts, our approach is very general, as it can treat a system involving anarbitrary number of polymers and the topological states are not only specifiedby the Gauss linking number, but also by higher order topological invariants.
