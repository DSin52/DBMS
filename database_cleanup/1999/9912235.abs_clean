This paper is concerned with a structural analysis of euclidean fieldtheories on the euclidean sphere. In the first section we give proposal foraxioms for a euclidean field theory on a sphere in terms of C*-algebras.Then, in the second section, we investigate the short-distance behavior ofeuclidean field theory models on the sphere by making use of the concept of{\em scaling algebras}, which has first been introduced by D. Buchholz, and R.Verch and which has also be applied to euclidean field theories on flateuclidean space in a previous paper. We establish the expected statement thatthat scaling limit theories of euclidean field theories on a sphere areeuclidean field theories on flat euclidean space.Keeping in mind that the minkowskian analogue of the euclidean sphere is thede Sitter space, we develop a Osterwalder-Schrader type construction schemewhich assigns to a given euclidean field theory on the sphere a quantum fieldtheory on de Sitter space. We show that the constructed quantum fieldtheoretical data fulfills the so called geodesic KMS condition in the sense ofH. J. Borchers and D. Buchholz, i.e. for any geodesic observer the system lookslike a system within a thermal equilibrium state.
