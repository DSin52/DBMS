D-branes on one-parameter Calabi-Yau spaces and two-parameter K3-fiberedCalabi-Yau manifolds are analyzed from both the Gepner model point of view andthe geometric perspective. We compute part of the spectrum of the boundarystates and comment on the appearance of the D0-brane as well as onnonsupersymmetric large volume configurations becoming supersymmetric at theGepner point.
