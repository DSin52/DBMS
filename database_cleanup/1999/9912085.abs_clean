We address problems associated with compactification near and on the lightfront. In perturbative scalar field theory we illustrate and clarify theclose to a light front; (2) infinite momentum frame calculations; and (3)quantization on the light front. Our examples emphasize the difference betweenzero modes in space-like quantization and those in light front quantization. Inparticular, in perturbative calculations of scalar field theory usingdiscretized light cone quantization there are well-known ``zero-mode induced''interaction terms. However, we show that they decouple in the continuum limitand covariant answers are reproduced. Thus compactification of a light-likesurface is feasible and defines a consistent field theory.
