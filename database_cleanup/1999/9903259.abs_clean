A quantization of (2+1)-dimensional gravity with negative cosmologicalconstant is presented and quantum aspects of the (2+1)-dimensional black holesare studied thereby. The quantization consists of two procedures. One isrelated with quantization of the asymptotic Virasoro symmetry. A notion of theVirasoro deformation of 3-geometry is introduced. For a given black hole, thedeformation of the exterior of the outer horizon is identified with a productof appropriate coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro groups $\hat{diff S^1}_{\pm}$.Its quantization provides unitary irreducible representations of the Virasoroalgebra, in which state of the black hole becomes primary. To make thequantization complete, holonomies, the global degrees of freedom, are takeninto account. By an identification of these topological operators with zeromodes of the Liouville field, the aforementioned unitary representationsreveal, as far as $c \gg 1$, as the Hilbert space of this two-dimensionalconformal field theory. This conformal field theory, living on the cylinder atinfinity of the black hole and having continuous spectrums, can recognize theouter horizon only as a it one-dimensional object in $SL_2({\bf R})$ andrealize it as insertions of the corresponding vertex operator. Therefore it cannot be a conformal field theory on the horizon. Two possible descriptions ofthe horizon conformal field theory are proposed.
