We study 2+1 Chern-Simons gravity at the classical action level. Inparticular we rederive the linear combinations of the ``standard'' and``exotic'' Einstein actions, from the (anti) self-duality of the ``internal''Lorentzian indices. The relation to a genuine four-dimensional (anti)self-dualtopological theory greatly facilitates the analysis and its relation tohyperbolic three-dimensional geometry. Finally a non-abelian vector field``dual'' action is also obtained.
