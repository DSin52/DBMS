We consider a (2+1)-dimensional mechanical system with the Lagrangian linearin the torsion of a light-like curve. We give Hamiltonian formulation of thissystem and show that its mass and spin spectra are defined by one-dimensionalnonrelativistic mechanics with a cubic potential. Consequently, this systempossesses the properties typical of resonance-like particles.
