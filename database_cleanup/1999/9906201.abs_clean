Within the AdS/CFT correspondence we use multicentre D3-brane metrics toinvestigate Wilson loops and compute the associated heavy quark-antiquarkpotentials for the strongly coupled SU(N) super-Yang-Mills gauge theory, whenthe gauge symmetry is broken by the expectation values of the scalar fields.For the case of a uniform distribution of D3-branes over a disc, we find thatthere exists a maximum separation beyond which there is no force between thequark and the antiquark, i.e. the screening is complete. We associate thisphenomenon with the possible existence of a mass gap in the strongly coupledgauge theory. In the finite-temperature case, when the correspondingsupergravity solution is a rotating D3-brane solution, there is a class ofpotentials interpolating between a Coulombic and a confining behaviour.However, above a certain critical value of the mass parameter, the potentialsexhibit a behaviour characteristic of statistical systems undergoing phasetransitions. The physical path preserves the concavity property of thepotential and minimizes the energy. Using the same rotating-brane solutions, wealso compute spatial Wilson loops, associated with the quark-antiquarkpotential in models of three-dimensional gauge theories at zero temperature,with similar results.
