Kaluza-Klein sphere reductions of supergravities that admit AdS x Spherevacuum solutions are believed to be consistent. The examples include the S^4and S^7 reductions of eleven-dimensional supergravity, and the S^5 reduction often-dimensional type IIB supergravity. In this paper we provide evidence thatsphere reductions of supergravities that admit instead Domain-wall x Spherevacuum solutions are also consistent, where the background can be viewed as thenear-horizon structure of a dilatonic p-brane of the theory. The resultinglower-dimensional theory is a gauged supergravity that admits a domain wall,rather than AdS, as a vacuum solution. We illustrate this consistency by takingthe singular limits of certain modulus parameters, for which the original S^ncompactifying spheres (n=4,5 or 7) become S^p x R^q, with p=n-q<n. Theconsistency of the S^4, S^7 and S^5 reductions then implies the consistency ofthe S^p reductions of the lower-dimensional supergravities. In particular, weobtain explicit non-linear ansatze for the S^3 reduction of type IIA andheterotic supergravities, restricting to the U(1)^2 subgroup of the SO(4) gaugegroup of S^3. We also study the black hole solutions in the lower-dimensionalgauged supergravities with domain-wall backgrounds. We find new domain-wallblack holes which are not the singular-modulus limits of the AdS black holes ofthe original theories, and we obtain their Killing spinors.
