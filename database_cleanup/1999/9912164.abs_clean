In the light of the duality between physics in the bulk of anti-de Sitterspace and a conformal field theory on the boundary, we review the M2, D3 and M5branes and how their near-horizon geometry yields the compactification of D=11supergravity on S^{7}, Type IIB supergravity on S^{5} and D=11 supergravity onS^{4}, respectively. We discuss the ``Membrane at the End of the Universe''idea and its relation to the corresponding superconformal singleton theoriesthat live on the boundary of the AdS_{4}, AdS_{5} and AdS_{7} vacua. Themassless sectors of these compactifications are described by the maximallysupersymmetric D=4, D=5 and D=7 gauged supergravities. We construct thenon-linear Kaluza-Klein ans\"atze describing the embeddings of the U(1)^4,U(1)^3 and U(1)^2 truncations of these supergravities, which admit 4-chargeAdS_{4}, 3-charge AdS_{5} and 2-charge AdS_{7} black hole solutions. Theseenable us to embed the black hole solutions back in ten and eleven dimensionsand reinterpret them as M2, D3 and M5 branes spinning in the transversedimensions with the black hole charges given by the angular momenta of thebranes. A comprehensive Appendix lists the field equations, symmetries andtransformation rules of D=11 supergravity, Type IIB supergravity, and the M2,D3 and M5 branes.
