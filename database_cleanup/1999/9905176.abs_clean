We construct the three point function involving an axial vector current andtwo energy-momentum tensors for four dimensional conformal field theories.Conformal symmetry determines the form of this three point function uniquely upto a constant factor if the necessary conservation conditions are imposed. Thegravitational axial anomaly present on a curved space background leads to anon-zero contribution for the divergence of the axial current in this threepoint function even on flat space. Using techniques related to differentialregularisation which guarantee that the energy-momentum tensor is conserved andtraceless, we calculate the anomaly in the three point function directly. Inthis way we relate the overall coefficient of the three point function to thescale of the gravitational axial anomaly. We check our results by applying themto the examples of the fermion and photon axial currents.
