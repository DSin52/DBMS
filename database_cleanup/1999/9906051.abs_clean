The superconformal Ward identities combined with N=2 harmonic analyticity areused to evaluate two-loop four-point correlation functions of gauge-invariantoperators in D=4, N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in terms of thewell-known one-loop box integral. The result is confirmed by a direct numericalcomputation.
