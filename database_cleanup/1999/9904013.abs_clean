In this paper we continue the study of the non-critical type 0 string and itsfield theory duals. We begin by reviewing some facts and conjectures aboutthese theories. We move on to our proposal for the type 0 effective action inany dimension, its RR fields and their Chern--Simons couplings. We then focuson the case without compact dimensions and study its field theory duals. Weshow that one can parameterize all dual physical quantities in terms of afinite number of unknown parameters. By making some further assumptions on thetachyon couplings, one can still make some ``model independent'' statements.
