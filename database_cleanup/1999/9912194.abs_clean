In this paper we apply a variant of Heisenberg's quantization method forstrongly interacting, non-linear fields, to solutions of the classicalYang-Mills field equations which have bad asymptotic behavior. Afterquantization we find that the bad features (i.e. divergent fields andenergy densities) of these solutions are moderated. From these results we arguethat in general the n-point Green's functions for Yang-Mills theories can havenon-perturbative pieces which can not be represented as the sum of Feynmandiagrams. A formalism for dealing with these non-Feynman pieces vianonassociative field operators is suggested. These methods may also find someapplication in dealing with high-$T_c$ superconductors.
