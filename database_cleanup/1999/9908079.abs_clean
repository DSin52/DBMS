Comments: 11 pages, Plain LaTex, no figures

A mechanism for the dynamical mass generation of a non-Abelian gauge fieldwhich is based on taking into account the contributions of the gauge fieldvacuum configurations into the formation of the physical vacuum is considered.For a model of the physical vacuum as a superposition of Abelian configurationsthe gauge field propagator is calculated in the leading order of$1/d$-expansion ($d$ is a space-time dimension). One-particle spectrum of themodel corresponds to the gauge sector of SU(2) Georgi-Glashow model.
