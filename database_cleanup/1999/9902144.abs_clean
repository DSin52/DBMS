Title: Renormalization group for the internal space

Authors: Jean Alexandre, Janos Polonyi

Comments: Updated, corrected, 19 pages, no figures

The renormalization group method is a successive integration over thefluctuations which are ordered according to their length scale, a parameter inthe external space. A different procedure is described, where the fluctuationsare treated in a successive manner, as well, but their order is given by aninternal space parameter, their amplitude. The differential version of therenormalization group equation is given which is the functional generalizationof the Callan-Symanzik equation in one special case and resums the loopexpansion in another one.
