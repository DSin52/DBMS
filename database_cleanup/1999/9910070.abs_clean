We present a technique to construct, for $D_{m}$ unitary minimal models, thenon-chiral fusion rules which determines the operator content of the operatorproduct algebra. Using these rules we solve the bootstrap equations andtherefore determine the structure constants of these models. Through thisapproach we emphasize the role played by some discrete symmetries in theclassification of minimal models.
