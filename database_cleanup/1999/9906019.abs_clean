The embedding procedure of Batalin, Fradkin, and Tyutin, which allows toconvert a second-class system into first-class, is pushed beyond the formallevel. We explicitly construct, in all cases, the variables of the convertedfirst-class theory in terms of those of the corresponding second-class one.Moreover, we only conclude about the equivalence between these two differentkind of theories after compairing their respective spectra of excitations.
