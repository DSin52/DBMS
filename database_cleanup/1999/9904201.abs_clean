Title: The confining branch of QCD

Comments: 8 pages, latex, no figures, a misprint corrected

We show that, as a consequence of a physical interpretation based on theAbelian projection and on the QCD string, four-dimensional QCD confines theelectric flux if and only if the functional integral in the fiberwise-dualvariables admits a hyper-Kahler reduction under the action of the gauge group.
