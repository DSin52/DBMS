Title: Monopole-like Excitations as a Source of Confinement in the

SU(2)-GluodynamicsAuthors: Dmitri Antonov (INFN, Pisa) and Dietmar Ebert (Humboldt University,

By making use of the Abelian projection method, a dual version of theSU(2)-gluodynamics with manifest monopole-like excitations, arising from theintegration over singular gauge transformations, is formulated in the continuumlimit. The resulting effective theory emerges due to the summation over thegrand canonical ensemble of these excitations in the dilute gas approximation.As a result, the dual Abelian gauge boson acquires a nonvanishing (magnetic)mass due to the Debye screening effects in such a gas. The obtained theory isthen used for the construction of the corresponding effective potential ofmonopole loop currents and the string representation. Finally, by virtue ofthis representation, confining properties of the SU(2)-gluodynamics areemphasized.
