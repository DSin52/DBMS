We give arguments in the support of a relation between M-atrix theory andMaldacena's conjecture. M-atrix theory conjecture implies the equivalence of11-D light-cone supergravity and strongly-coupled (0+1)-D SYM. Maldacena'sSUGRA/SYM duality conjecture implies, in the one dimensional SYM case, theequivalence between strongly-coupled (0+1)-D SYM and 11-D supergravitycompactified on a spatial circle in the formal Seiberg-Sen limit. Using theclassical equivalence between 11-D supergravity on a light-like circle and on aspatial circle in the formal Seiberg-Sen limit, we argue that in the (0+1)-DSYM case, the large-N M-atrix theory in the supergravity regime is equivalentto SUGRA/SYM duality.
