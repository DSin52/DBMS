Authors: K. Bresser, G. Pinter and D. Prange

Comments: 9 pages, no figures

In the framework of causal perturbation theory renormalization consists ofthe extension of distributions. We give the explicit form of a Lorentzinvariant extension of a scalar distribution, depending on one difference ofspace time coordinates.
