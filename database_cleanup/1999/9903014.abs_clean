We study discrete fluxes in four dimensional SU(N) gauge theories with a massgap by using brane compactifications which give ${\cal{N}} = 1$ or ${\cal{N}} =0$ supersymmetry. We show that when such theories are compactified further on atorus, the t'Hooft magnetic flux $m$ is related to the NS two-form modulus $B$by $B = 2\pi {m\over N}$. These values of $B$ label degenerate brane vacua,giving a simple demonstration of magnetic screening. Furthermore, for thesevalues of $B$ one has a conventional gauge theory on a commutative torus,without having to perform any T-dualities. Because of the mass gap, a generic$B$ does not give a four dimensional gauge theory on a non-commutative torus.The Kaluza-Klein modes which must be integrated out to give a four dimensionaltheory decouple only when $B=2\pi {m\over N}$. Finally we show that $2\pi{m\over N}$ behaves like a two form modulus of the QCD string. This confirms aprevious conjecture based on properties of large $N$ QCD suggesting a T-dualityinvariance.
