We study the implications of target-space duality symmetries for low-energyeffective actions of various four-dimensional string theories. In the heteroticcase such symmetries can be incorporated in simple orbifold examples. Atpresent a similar statement cannot be made about the simplest type IIBorientifolds due to an obstruction at the level of gravitational anomalies.This fact confirms previous doubts concerning a conjectured heterotic-type IIBorientifold duality and shows that target-space symmetries can be a powerfultool in studying relations between various string theories at the level of theeffective low-energy action. Contraints on effective Lagrangians from thesesymmetries are discussed in detail. In particular, we consider ways ofextending T-duality to include additional corrections to the Kaehler potentialin heterotic string models with N=2 subsectors.
