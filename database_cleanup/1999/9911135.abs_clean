We consider free superconformal theories of n=8 scalar multiplet in d=3 and(2,0) tensor multiplet in d=6 and compute 2-point and 3-point correlators oftheir stress tensors. The results for the 2-point and 3-point correlators for asingle d=3 and d=6 multiplet differ from the "strong-coupling" AdS_4 and AdS_7supergravity predictions by the factors $4\sqrt2 \over 3\pi}N^{3/2}$ and $4N^3$respectively. These are the same factors as found earlier in hep-th/9703040 inthe comparison of the brane free field theory and the 11-d supergravitypredictions for the absorption cross-sections of longitudinally polarizedgravitons by multiple M2 and M5 branes. While the correspondence of the resultsfor the cross-sections and 2-point functions was expected on the basis ofunitarity, the fact that the same coefficients appear in the ratio of thefree-theory and supergravity 3-point functions is non-trivial. Thus, like inthe d=4 SYM case, in both d=3 and d=6 theories the ratio of the 3-point and2-point correlators <TTT>/<TT> is exactly the same in the free field theory andin the interacting CFT as described (to leading order in large $N$) by the 11-dsupergravity on AdS_{d+1} x S^{10-d}.
