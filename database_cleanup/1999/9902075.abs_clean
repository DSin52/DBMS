Finite temperature correlation functions in integrable quantum field theoriesare formulated only in terms of the usual, temperature-independent formfactors, and certain thermodynamic filling fractions which are determined fromthe thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. Explicit expressions are given for the one andtwo-point functions.
