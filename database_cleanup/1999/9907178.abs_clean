We argue that a class of ``non-critical superstring'' vacua isholographically related to the (non-gravitational) theory obtained by studyingstring theory on a singular Calabi-Yau manifold in the decoupling limit $g_s\to0$. In two dimensions, adding fundamental strings at the singularity of the CYmanifold leads to conformal field theories dual to a recently constructed classof $AdS_3$ vacua. In four dimensions, special cases of the constructioncorrespond to the theory on an NS5-brane wrapped around a Riemann surface.
