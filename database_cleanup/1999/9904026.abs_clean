We demonstrate that QCD gluon amplitudes can be used to construct aLagrangian for gravity. This procedure makes use of perturbative `squaring'relations between gravity and gauge theory that follow from string theory. Weexplicitly carry out the construction for up to five-point interactions anddiscuss a set of field variables in the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian forinterpreting the Lagrangian obtained from QCD. A spin-off from our analysis isthat it can be used to provide simpler tree-level gravity Feynman rules thanfor conventional gauges.
