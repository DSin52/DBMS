We initiate a study of cosmology within the framework of Maldacena's AdS/CFTcorrespondence. We present a comprehensive analysis of the classical motion ofa charged domain wall that separates an external Reissner-Nordstrom region ofspacetime (with small or vanishing cosmological constant) from an internalde-Sitter region. The possible associated spacetime diagrams are drawn,although in the classical case, an unambiguous prediction of what occurs atlate times in the interior region is not possible, since singularities andCauchy horizons form. We argue that, when the asymptotic region is anti-deSitter, the AdS/CFT correspondence gives a prescription for resolving thecurvature singularities and evolving solutions across the expected Cauchyhorizon. Some of our solutions contain inflating interiors, and we provideevidence these can be patched onto solutions with smooth initial data,circumventing an obstacle found by Farhi and Guth to creating an inflatinguniverse in the laboratory.
