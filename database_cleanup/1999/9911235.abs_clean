Various fluid mechanical systems, governed by nonlinear differentialequations, enjoy a hidden, higher-dimensional dynamical Poincar\'e symmetry,which arises owing to their descent from a Nambu-Goto action. Also, for thesame reason, there are equivalence transformations between different models.These interconnections are discussed in this lecture, and are summarized inFig. 3.
