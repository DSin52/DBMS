We consider the dynamics of a relativistic Dirac particle constrained to movein the interior of a twisted tube by confining boundary conditions, in theapproximation that the curvature of the tube is small and slowly varying. Incontrast with the nonrelativistic theory, which predicts that a particle's spindoes not change as the particle propagates along the tube, we find that theangular momentum eigenstates of a relativistic spin-1/2 particle may behavenontrivially. For example, a particle with its angular momentum initiallypolarized in the direction of propagation may acquire a nonzero component ofangular momentum in the opposite direction on turning through 2 \pi radians.Also, the usual nonrelativistic effective potential acquires an additionalfactor in the relativistic theory.
