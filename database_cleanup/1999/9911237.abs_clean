We consider the Newton's force law for brane world consisting of periodicconfiguration of branes. We show that it supports a massless graviton.Furthermore, this massless mode is well separated from the Kaluza-Kleinspectrum by a mass gap. Thus most of the problems in phenomenology coming fromcontinuum of Kaluza-Klein modes without mass gap are potentially cured in sucha model.
