We extend the theory of cosmological perturbations to the case when the``matter'' Lagrangian is an arbitrary function of the scalar field and itsfirst derivatives. In particular, this extension provides a unified descriptionof known cases such as the usual scalar field and the hydrodynamical perfectfluid. In addition, it applies to the recently proposed k-inflation, which isdriven by non-minimal kinetic terms in the Lagrangian. The spectrum of quantumfluctuations for slow-roll and power law k-inflation is calculated. We find,for instance, that the usual ``consistency relation'' between the tensorspectral index and the relative amplitude of scalar and tensor perturbations ismodified. Thus, at least in principle, k-inflation is phenomenologicallydistinguishable from standard inflation.
