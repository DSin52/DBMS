Recently, Randall and Sundrum proposed a static solution to Einstein'sequations in five spacetime dimensions with two 3-branes located at the fixedpoints of $S^1/Z_2$ to solve the hierarchy problem. We extend the solution andconstruct static and also inflationary solutions to Einstein's equations infive spacetime dimensions, one of which is compactified on $S^1$, with anynumber of 3-branes whose locations are taken to be arbitrary. We discuss howthe hierarchy problem can be explained in our model.
