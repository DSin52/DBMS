We give an explicit formulation of the three-dimensional $SL(4,R)/SO(2,2)\sigma$-model representing the five-dimensional Einstein gravity coupled to thedilaton and the three-form field for spacetimes with two commuting Killingvector fields. New matrix representation is obtained which is similar to onefound earlier in the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA)theory. The SL(4,R) symmetry joins a variety of 5D solutions of differentphysical types including strings, 0-branes, KK monopoles etc. interpreting themas duals to the four-dimensional Kerr metric translated along the fifthcoordinate. The symmetry transformations are used to construct new rotatingstrings and composite 0-1-branes endowed with a NUT parameter.
