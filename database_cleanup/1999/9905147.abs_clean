We employ a heat kernel expansion to derive an effective action thatdescribes four dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in the infrared limit. Ourresult supports the proposal that at large distances the theory is approximatedby the dynamics of knotted string-like fluxtubes which appear as solitons inthe effective theory.
