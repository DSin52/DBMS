According to the positive energy conjecture of Horowitz and Myers, there is aspecific supergravity solution, AdS soliton, which has minimum energy among allasymptotically locally AdS solutions with the same boundary conditions. Relatedto the issue of semiclassical stability of AdS soliton in the context of puregravity with a negative cosmological constant, physical boundary conditions aredetermined for an instanton solution which would be responsible for vacuumdecay by barrier penetration. Certain geometric properties of instantons arestudied, using Hermitian differential operators. On a $d$-dimensionalinstanton, it is shown that there are $d-2$ harmonic functions. A class ofinstanton solutions, obeying more restrictive boundary conditions, is proved tohave $d-1$ Killing vectors which also commute. All but one of the Killingvectors are duals of harmonic one-forms, which are gradients of harmonicfunctions, and do not have any fixed points.
