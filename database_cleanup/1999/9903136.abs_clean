In this paper we continue the study of the path-integral formulation ofclassical mechanics and in particular we better clarify, with respect toprevious papers, the geometrical meaning of the variables entering thisformulation. With respect to the first paper with the same title, we {\itcorrect} here the set of transformations for the auxiliary variables$\lambda_{a}$. We prove that under this new set of transformations theHamiltonian ${\widetilde{\cal H}}$, appearing in our path-integral, is an exactscalar and the same for the Lagrangian. Despite this different transformation,the variables $\lambda_{a}$ maintain the same operatorial meaning as before buton a different functional space. Cleared up this point we then show that thespace spanned by the whole set of variables ($\phi, c, \lambda,\bar c$) of ourpath-integral is the cotangent bundle to the {\it reversed-parity} tangentbundle of the phase space ${\cal M}$ of our system and it is indicated as$T^{\star}(\Pi T{\cal M})$. In case the reader feel uneasy with this strange{\it Grassmannian} double bundle, we show in this paper that it is possible tobuild a different path-integral made only of {\it bosonic} variables. Theseturn out to be the coordinates of $T^{\star}(T^{\star}{\cal M})$ which is thedouble cotangent bundle of phase-space.
