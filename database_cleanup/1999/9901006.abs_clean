We study the Seiberg-Witten-Whitham equations in the strong coupling regimeof the N=2 super Yang-Mills theory in the vicinity of the maximalsingularities. In the case of SU(2) the Seiberg-Witten-Whitham equations fixcompletely the strong coupling expansion. For higher rank SU(N) they provide aset of non-trivial constraints on the form of this expansion. As an example, westudy the off-diagonal couplings at the maximal point for which we propose anansatz that fulfills all the equations.
