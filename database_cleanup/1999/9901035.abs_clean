In a one-generation fermion condensate scheme of electroweak symmetrybreaking, it is proven based on Schwinger-Dyson equation in the real-timethermal field theory in the fermion bubble diagram approximation that, atfinite temperature $T$ below the symmetry restoration temperature $T_c$, amassive Higgs boson and three massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons could emerge fromthe spontaneous breaking of electroweak group $SU_L(2)\times U_Y(1) \to U_Q(1)$if the two fermion flavors in the one generation are mass-degenerate, thusGoldstone Theorem is rigorously valid in this case. However, if the two fermionflavors have unequal masses, owing to "thermal flactuation", the GoldstoneTheorem will be true only approximately for a very large momentum cut-off$\Lambda$ in zero temperature fermion loop or for low energy scales. Allpossible pinch singularities are proven to cancel each other, as is expectedin a real-time thermal field theory.
