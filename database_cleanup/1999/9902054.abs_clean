In this paper we investigate a generation mechanism of the non-Abelian gaugefields in the SU(N) gauge theory. It is shown that the SU(N) gauge fieldsensuring the local invariance of the theory are generated at the quantum levelonly due to nonsmoothness of the scalar phases of the fundamental spinorfields. The expression for the gauge fields are obtained in terms of thenonsmooth scalar phases.
