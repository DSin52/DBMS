We analyse symmetry breaking in general gauge theories paying particularattention to the underlying geometry of the theory. In this context we find twothe scalar sector, and another generally inequivalent metric associated withthe gauge sector. Physically, the interplay between these metrics gives rise tomany of the non-perturbative features of symmetry breaking.
