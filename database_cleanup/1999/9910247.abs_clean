This is a reply to a recent comment (hep-th/9910158) by Park and Ho on apaper (hep-th/9812013) that describes a derivation of black hole entropy fromhorizon conformal field theory. The criticism of Park and Ho is partiallycorrect - the original paper did not give the complete surface term in theHamiltonian - but it does not affect the conclusions, which have been checkedusing a somewhat different, manifestly covariant formalism (gr-qc/9906126).
