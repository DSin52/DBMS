The nature of the transition from the quantum tunneling regime at lowtemperatures to the thermal hopping regime at high temperatures is investigatedanalytically in scalar field theory. An analytical bounce solution ispresented, which reproduces the action in the thin-wall as well as thick-walllimits. The transition is first order for the case of a thin wall while for thethick wall case it is second order.
