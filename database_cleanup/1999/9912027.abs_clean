We study the general gaugings of N=2 Maxwell-Einstein supergravity theories(MESGT) in five dimensions, extending and generalizing previous work. Theglobal symmetries of these theories are of the form SU(2)_R X G, where SU(2)_Ris the R-symmetry group of the N=2 Poincare superalgebra and G is the group ofisometries of the scalar manifold that extend to symmetries of the full action.We first gauge a subgroup K of G by turning some of the vector fields intogauge fields of K while dualizing the remaining vector fields into tensorfields transforming in a non-trivial representation of K. Surprisingly, we findthat the presence of tensor fields transforming non-trivially under theYang-Mills gauge group leads to the introduction of a potential which does notadmit an AdS ground state. Next we give the simultaneous gauging of the U(1)_Rsubgroup of SU(2)_R and a subgroup K of G in the presence of K-charged tensormultiplets. The potential introduced by the simultaneous gauging is the sum ofthe potentials introduced by gauging K and U(1)_R separately. We present a listof possible gauge groups K and the corresponding representations of tensorfields. For the exceptional supergravity we find that one can gauge the SO^*(6)subgroup of the isometry group E_{6(-26)} of the scalar manifold if onedualizes 12 of the vector fields to tensor fields just as in the gauged N=8supergravity.
