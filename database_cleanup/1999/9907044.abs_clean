We present a method for a recursive graphical construction of Feynmandiagrams with their correct multiplicities in quantum electrodynamics. Themethod is first applied to find all diagrams contributing to the vacuum energyfrom which all n-point functions are derived by functional differentiation withrespect to electron and photon propagators, and to the interaction. Basis forour construction is a functional differential equation obeyed by the vacuumenergy when considered as a functional of the free propagators and theinteraction. Our method does not employ external sources in contrast totraditional approaches.
