We re-examine the problem of determining the possible D-branes in theNappi-Witten background. In addition to the known branes, we find that thereare also D-instantons, flat euclidean D-strings and curved D-membranesadmitting parallel spinors, all of which can be interpreted as (twisted)conjugacy classes in the Nappi-Witten group.
