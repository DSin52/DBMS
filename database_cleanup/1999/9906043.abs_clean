Dec 1998We conjecture that the neutral black hole pair production is related to thevacuum fluctuation of pure gravity via the Casimir-like energy. Ageneralization of this process to a multi-black hole pair is considered.Implications on the foam-like structure of spacetime and on the cosmologicalconstant are discussed.
