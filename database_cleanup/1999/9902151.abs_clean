We discuss the determination of the lowest Form Factors relative to the traceoperators of N=1 Super Sinh-Gordon Model. Analytic continuations of these FormFactors as functions of the coupling constant allows us to study a series ofmodels in a uniform way, among these the latest model of the Roaming Series anda class of minimal supersymmetric models.
