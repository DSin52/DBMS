Based on the generating functional method with an external source function, auseful constraint on the source function is proposed for analyzing the one- andtwo-loop world-line Green functions. The constraint plays the same role as themomentum conservation law of a certain nontrivial form, and transformsambiguous Green functions into the uniquely defined Green functions. We alsoargue reparametrizations of the Green functions defined on differentlyparameterized world-line diagrams.
