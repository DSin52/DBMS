Meeting on Trends in Theoretical Physics, Buenos Aires, November 30-December4, 1998The dynamical content of local AdS supergravity in five dimensions isdiscussed. The bosonic sector of the theory contains the vielbein ($e^{a}$),the spin connection ($\omega ^{ab}$) and internal SU(N) and U(1) gauge fields.The fermionic fields are complex Dirac spinors ($\psi ^{i}$) in a vectorrepresentation of SU(N). All fields together form a connection 1-form in thesuperalgebra SU(2,2|N). For N=4, the symplectic matrix has maximal rank in alocally AdS background in which the dynamical degrees of freedom can beidentified. The resulting efective theory have different numbers of bosonic andfermionic degrees of freedom.
