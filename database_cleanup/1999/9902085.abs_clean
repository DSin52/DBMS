Title: The Complex of Solutions of the Nested Bethe Ansatz. The A_2 Spin Chain

Authors: G.P. Pronko (Institute for High Energy Physics, Protvino, Russia and

International Solvay Institute, Brussels, Belgium), Yu.G. Stroganov(Institute for High Energy Physics, Protvino, Russia)The full set of polynomial solutions of the nested Bethe Ansatz isconstructed for the case of A_2 rational spin chain. The structure andproperties of these associated solutions are more various then in the case ofusual XXX (A_1) spin chain but their role is similar.
