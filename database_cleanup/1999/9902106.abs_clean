Title: On the Holographic S-matrix

Comments: Latex, 9 pages

The recent proposal by Polchinski and Susskind for the holographic flat spaceS-matrix is discussed. By using Feynman diagrams we argue that in principle allthe information about the S-matrix in the interacting field theory in the bulkof the anti-de Sitter space is encoded into the data on the timelike boundary.The problem of locality of interpolating field is discussed and it is suggestedthat the interpolating field lives in a quantum Boltzmannian Hilbert space.
