Title: Microscopic and Bulk Spectra of Dirac Operators from Finite-Volume

Partition FunctionsComments: 4 pages, 1 figure, World Scientific style. Talk presented at

``Understanding Deconfinement in QCD'', March 1999, ECT* Trento, ItalyThe microscopic spectrum of the QCD Dirac operator is shown to obey randommatrix model statistics in the bulk region of the spectrum close to the originusing finite-volume partition functions.
