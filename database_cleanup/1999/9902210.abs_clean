We write supersymmetry preserving conditions for infinite M5-branesintersecting on a (3+1)-dimensional space. In contrast to previously knownsolutions, these intersections are completely localized. We solve the equationsfor a particular class of configurations which in the near-horizon decouplinglimit are dual to N_f = 2N_c Seiberg-Witten superconformal field theories withgauge group SU(N) and generalisations to SU(N)^n. We also discuss therelationship to D3-branes in the presence of an A_k singularity.
