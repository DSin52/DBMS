It is well known that the toroidal dimensional reduction of supergravitiesgives rise in three dimensions to theories whose bosonic sectors are describedpurely in terms of scalar degrees of freedom, which parameterise sigma-modelcoset spaces. For example, the reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravitygives rise to an E_8/SO(16) coset Lagrangian. In this paper, we dispense withthe restrictions of supersymmetry, and study all the three-dimensional scalarsigma models G/H where G is a maximally-non-compact simple group, with H itsmaximal compact subgroup, and find the highest dimensions from which they canbe obtained by Kaluza-Klein reduction. A magic triangle emerges with a dualitybetween rank and dimension. Interesting also are the cases of Hermiteansymmetric spaces and quaternionic spaces.
