We consider the construction of a general tree level amplitude for theinteractions between dynamical D-branes where the configurations have non-zeroodd spin structure. Using Riemann Theta Identities we map the conditions forthe preservation of some supersymmetry to a set of integer matrices satisfyinga simple but non-trivial equation. We also show how the regularization of theRR zero modes plays an important role in determining which configurations arepermitted.
