Title: Mass Generation in Continuum SU(2) Gauge Theory in Covariant Abelian

GaugesAuthors: Martin Schaden

Comments: 4 pages. Much improved argumentation based on a certain

(spontaneously broken) SL(2,R) symmetryThe local action of an SU(2) gauge theory in general covariant Abelian gaugesand the associated equivariant BRST symmetry that guarantees the perturbativerenormalizability of the model are given. I show that a global SL(2,R) symmetryof the model is spontaneously broken by ghost-antighost condensation atarbitrarily small coupling and leads to propagators that are finite atEuclidean momenta for all elementary fields except the Abelian ``photon''. TheGoldstone states form a BRST-quartet. The mechanism eliminates the non-abelianinfrared divergences in the perturbative high-temperature expansion of the freeenergy.
