The complete two-loop correction to the quark propagator, consisting of thespider, rainbow, gluon bubble and quark bubble diagrams, is evaluated in thenoncovariant light-cone gauge (lcg). (The overlapping self-energy diagram hadalready been computed.) The chief technical tools include the powerful matrixintegration technique, the n^*-prescription for the spurious poles of 1/qn, andthe detailed analysis of the boundary singularities in five- andsix-dimensional parameter space. It is shown that the total divergentcontribution to the two-loop correction Sigma_2 contains both covariant andnoncovariant components, and is a local function of the external momentum p,even off the mass-shell, as all nonlocal divergent terms cancel exactly.Consequently, both the quark mass and field renormalizations are local. Thestructure of Sigma_2 implies a quark mass counterterm of the form $\delta m(lcg) = m\tilde\alpha_s C_F(3+\tilde\alpha_sW) + {\rm O} (\tilde\alpha_s^3)$,$\tilde\alpha_s = g^2\Gamma(\eps)(4\pi)^{\eps -2}$, with W depending only onthe dimensional regulator epsilon, and on the numbers of colors and flavors. Itturns out that \delta m(lcg) is identical to the mass counterterm in thegeneral linear covariant gauge. Our results are in agreement with theBassetto-Dalbosco-Soldati renormalization scheme.
