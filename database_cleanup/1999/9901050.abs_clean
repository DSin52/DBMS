This is a set of introductory lecture notes on black holes in string theory.After reviewing some aspects of string theory such as dualities, branesolutions, supersymmetric and non-extremal intersection rules, we analyze indetail extremal and non-extremal 5d black holes. We first present the D-branecounting for extremal black holes. Then we show that 4d and 5d non-extremalblack holes can be mapped to the BTZ black hole (times a compact manifold) bymeans of dualities. The validity of these dualities is analyzed in detail. Wepresent an analysis of the same system in the spirit of the adS/CFTcorrespondence. In the ``near-horizon'' limit (which is actually a nearinner-horizon limit for non-extremal black holes) the black hole reduces againto the BTZ black hole. A state counting is presented in terms of the BTZ blackhole.
