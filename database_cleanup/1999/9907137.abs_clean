We introduce a general method in order to construct the non chiral fusionrules which determine the operator content of the operator product algebra forrational conformal field theories. We are particularly interested in the modelsof the complementary D-like solutions of modular invariant partition functionswith cyclic center Zn. We find that the non chiral fusion rules have aZn-grading structure.
