We study a system of nonabelian anyons in the lowest Landau level of a strongmagnetic field. Using diagrammatic techniques, we prove that the virialcoefficients do not depend on the statistics parameter. This is true for allrepresentations of all nonabelian groups for the statistics of the particlesand relies solely on the fact that the effective statistical interaction is atraceless operator.
