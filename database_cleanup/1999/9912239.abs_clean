Title: Correlation functions and boundary conditions in RCFT and

three-dimensional topologyAuthors: Giovanni Felder, J\"urg Fr\"ohlich, J\"urgen Fuchs and Christoph

SchweigertComments: latex, 45 pages. The new version has a new introduction and various

minor correctionsWe give a general construction of correlation functions in rational conformalfield theory on a possibly non-orientable surface with boundary in terms of3-dimensional topological quantum field theory. The construction applies to anymodular category. It is proved that these correlation functions obey modularand factorization rules. Structure constants are calculated and expressed interms of the data of the modular category.
