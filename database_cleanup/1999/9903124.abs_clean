supersymmetric Yang--MillsAuthors: Michael B. Green

These lecture notes begin with a review of the first nonleading contributionsto the derivative expansion of the M theory effective action compactified on atwo-torus. The form of these higher-derivative interactions is shown to followfrom ten-dimensional type IIB supersymmetry as well as from one-loop quantumcorrections to classical eleven-dimensional supergravity. The detailedinformation concerning D-instanton effects encoded in these terms is related tothe problem of evaluating the Witten index for $N$ D-particles in the type IIAtheory. Using the AdS/CFT conjecture, it also leads to very specificpredictions of multi-instanton contributions in $\cal N=4$ supersymmetric SU(N)Yang--Mills theory in the limit of strong 't Hooft coupling.
