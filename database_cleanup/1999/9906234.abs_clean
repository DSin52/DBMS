We generalize the construction of four dimensional non-tachyonic orientifoldsof type 0B string theory to non-supersymmetric backgrounds. We construct a fourdimensional model containing self-dual D3 and D9-branes and leading to a chiralanomaly-free massless spectrum. Moreover, we discuss a further tachyon-free sixdimensional model with only D5 branes. Eventually, we speculate about strongcoupling dual models of the ten-dimensional orientifolds of type 0B.
