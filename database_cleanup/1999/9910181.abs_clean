We consider M-theory compactification on Calabi-Yau threefolds. The recentlydiscovered connection between the BPS states of wrapped M2 branes and thetopological string amplitudes on the threefold is used both as a tool tocompute topological string amplitudes at higher genera as well as to unravelthe degeneracies and quantum numbers of BPS states. Moduli spaces of $k$-foldsymmetric products of the wrapped M2 brane play a crucial role. We also showthat the topological string partition function is the Calabi-Yau version of theelliptic genus of the symmetric product of $K3$'s and use the macroscopicentropy of spinning black holes in 5 dimensions to obtain new predictions forthe asymptotic growth of the topological string amplitudes at high genera.
