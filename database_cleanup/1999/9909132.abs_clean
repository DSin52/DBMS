We consider the constraints on the effective Lagrangian of the rank-one gaugefield on D-branes imposed by the equivalence between the description byordinary gauge theory and that by non-commutative gauge theory in the presenceof a constant B field. It is shown that we can consistently construct thetwo-derivative corrections to the Dirac-Born-Infeld Lagrangian up to thequartic order of field strength and the most general form which satisfies theconstraints up to this order is derived.
