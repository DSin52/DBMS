1131-1147It is shown how one can define vector topological charges for topologicalexitations of non-linear sigma-models on compact homogeneous spaces T_G andG/T_G (where G is a simple compact Lie group and T_G is its maximal commutativesubgroup). Explicit solutions for some cases, their energies and interaction ofdifferent topological charges are found. A possibility of the topologicalinterpretation of the quantum numbers of groups and particles is discussed.
