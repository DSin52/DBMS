We study the constraints on five-dimensional N=1 heterotic M-theory imposedby a consistent anomaly-free coupling of bulk and boundary theory. Thisrequires analyzing the cancellation of triangle gauge anomalies on thefour-dimensional orbifold planes due to anomaly inflow from the bulk. We findthat the semi-simple part of the orbifold gauge groups and certain U(1)symmetries have to be free of quantum anomalies. In addition there can beseveral anomalous U(1) symmetries on each orbifold plane whose anomalies arecancelled by a non-trivial variation of the bulk vector fields. The mixed U(1)non-abelian anomaly is universal and there is at most one U(1) symmetry withsuch an anomaly on each plane. In an alternative approach, we also analyze thecoupling of five-dimensional gauged supergravity to orbifold gauge theories. Wefind a somewhat generalized structure of anomaly cancellation in this casewhich allows, for example, non-universal mixed U(1) gauge anomalies. Anomalycancellation from the perspective of four-dimensional N=1 effective actionsobtained from E_8xE_8 heterotic string- or M-theory by reduction on aCalabi-Yau three-fold is studied as well. The results are consistent with theones found for five-dimensional heterotic M-theory. Finally, we consider somerelated issues of phenomenological interest such as model building withanomalous U(1) symmetries, Fayet-Illiopoulos terms and threshold corrections togauge kinetic functions.
