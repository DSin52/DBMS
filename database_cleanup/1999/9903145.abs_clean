We derive the general form of the anomaly for chiral spinors and self-dualantisymmetric tensors living on D-brane and O-plane interesections, using bothpath-integral and index theorem methods. We then show that the anomalouscouplings to RR forms of D-branes and O-planes in a general background areprecisely those required to cancel these anomalies through the inflowmechanism. This allows, for instance, for local anomaly cancellation in genericorientifold models, the relevant Green-Schwarz term being given by the sum ofthe anomalous couplings of all the D-branes and O-planes in the model.
