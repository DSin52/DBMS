We study conserved currents of any integer or half integer spin built frommassless scalar and spinor fields in $AdS_3$. 2-forms dual to the conservedcurrents in $AdS_3$ are shown to be exact in the class of infinite expansionsin higher derivatives of the matter fields with the coefficients containinginverse powers of the cosmological constant. This property has no analog in theflat space and may be related to the holography of the AdS spaces.
