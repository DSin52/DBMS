A general calculation of Casimir energies --in an arbitrary number ofdimensions-- for massless quantized fields in spherically symmetric cavities iscarried out. All the most common situations, including scalar and spinorfields, the electromagnetic field, and various boundary conditions are treatedwith care. The final results are given as analytical (closed) expressions interms of Barnes zeta functions. A direct, straightforward numerical evaluationof the formulas is then performed, which yields highly accurate numbers of, inprinciple, arbitrarily good precision.
