We present a pedagogical review of the stable non-BPS states in string theorywhich have recently attracted some attention in the literature. In particular,following the analysis of A. Sen, we discuss in detail the case of the stablenon-BPS D-particle of Type I theory whose existence is predicted (and required)by the heterotic/Type I duality. We show that this D-particle originates froman unstable bound state formed by a D1/anti-D1 pair of Type IIB in which thetachyon field acquires a solitonic kink configuration. The mechanism of tachyoncondensation is discussed first at a qualitative level and then with an exactconformal field theory analysis.
