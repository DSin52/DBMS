Title: Superconformal Field Theories, Multiplet Shortening, and the

AdS$_5$/SCFT$_4$ CorrespondenceAuthors: S. Ferrara, A. Zaffaroni

Comments: minor changes, references added

We review the unitarity bounds and the multiplet shortening of UIR's of 4dimensional superconformal algebras $SU(2,2|N)$, ($N=1,2,4$) in view of theirdual role in the AdS/SCFT correspondence. Some applications to KK spectra,non-perturbative states and stringy states are given.
