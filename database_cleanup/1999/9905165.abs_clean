We consider domain walls that appear in supersymmetric QCD with Nf < Ncmassive flavours. In particular, for 2 Nf < Nc we explicitly construct thedomain walls that interpolate between vacua labeled by i and (i+ N_f). We showthat these solutions are Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) saturated for anyvalue of the mass of the matter fields. This fact allows us to evaluate thelarge mass limit of these domain walls. We comment on the relevance of thesesolutions for supersymmetric gluodynamics.
