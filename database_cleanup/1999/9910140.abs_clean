Title: On possibility of Decoherence due to Relativistic Effect

Comments: 16 pages, Latex, no figures

This note looks at the possibility of a system of free particles presentingdecoherence in the total momentum when tracing upon their relative momenta ifwe take into account a relativistic correction to the expression of the kineticenergy.
