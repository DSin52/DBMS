189-197In a recent paper (hep-th/9811108), Saveliev and the author showed that thereexits an on-shell light cone gauge where the non-linear part of the fieldequations reduces to a (super) version of Yang's equations which may be solvedby methods inspired by the ones previously developed for self-dual Yang-Millsequations in four dimensions. Here, the analogy between these latter theoriesand the present ones is pushed further by writing down a set of super partiallinear differential equations whose consistency conditions may be derived fromthe SUSY Y-M equations in ten dimensions, and which are the analogues of theLax pair of Belavin and Zakharov. On the simplest example of the two poleansatz, it is shown that the same solution-generating techniques are at work,as for the derivation of the celebrated multi-instanton solutions carried outin the late seventies. The present Lax representation, however, is only aconsequence of (instead of being equivalent to) the field equations, incontrast with the Belavin Zakharov Lax pair.
