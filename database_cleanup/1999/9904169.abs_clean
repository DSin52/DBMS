Using a sigma model formulation of the field equations as on atwo-dimensional manifold we provide the proof of a black hole uniquenesssolution in N=4, d=4 supergravity subject to certain boundary conditions. Weconsidered the black hole solutions both in SU(4) and SO(4) versions of theunderlying theory.
