We newly apply the improved Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin(BFT) Hamiltonian method tothe O(3) nonlinear sigma model, and directly obtain the compact form ofnontrivial first class Hamiltonian by introducing the BFT physical fields.Furthermore, following the BFV formalism, we derive the BRST invariant gaugefixed Lagrangian through the standard path-integral procedure. Finally, byintroducing collective coordinates, we also study a semi-classical quantizationof soliton background to conclude that the spectrum of zero modes are unchangedthrough the BFT procedure.
