We show that the requirements of renormalizability and physical consistencyimposed on perturbative interactions of massive vector mesons fix the theoryessentially uniquely. In particular physical consistency demands the presenceof at least one additional physical degree of freedom which was not part of theoriginally required physical particle content. In its simplest realization(probably the only one) these are scalar fields as envisaged by Higgs but inthe present formulation without the ``symmetry-breaking Higgs condensate''. Thefinal result agrees precisely with the usual quantization of a classical gaugetheory by means of the Higgs mechanism. Our method proves an old conjecture ofCornwall, Levin and Tiktopoulos stating that the renormalization andconsistency requirements of spin=1 particles lead to the gauge theory structure(i.e. a kind of inverse of 't Hooft's famous renormalizability proof inquantized gauge theories) which was based on the on-shell unitarity of the$S$-matrix. We also speculate on a possible future ghostfree formulation whichavoids ''field coordinates'' altogether and is expected to reconcile theon-shell S-matrix point of view with the off-shell field theory structure.
