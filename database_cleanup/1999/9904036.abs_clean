The running gauge coupling and quark-antiquark potential in d-dimensions arecalculated from the explicit solution of d+1-dimensional dilatonic gravity.This background interpolates between usual AdS in UV and flat space withsingular dilaton in IR and it realizes two-boundaries AdS/CFT correspondence.The behaviour of running coupling and potential is consistent with resultsfollowing from IIB supergravity.
