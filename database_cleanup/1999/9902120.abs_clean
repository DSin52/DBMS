In this paper D-brane boundary states constructed in Gepner models are usedto analyze some aspects of the dynamics of D0-branes in Calabi-Yaucompactifications of type II theories to four dimensions. It is shown that theboundary states correspond to BPS objects carrying dyonic charges. By analyzingthe couplings to closed string fields a correspondence between the D0-branesand extremal charged black holes in N=2 supergravity is found.
