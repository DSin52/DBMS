Title: Can the Red Shift be a consequence of the Dilaton field?

Authors: Alejandro Cabo and Alexis Amezaga

Comments: 9 pages, talk at the "II Caribbean Workshop on Quantum Mechanics,

Particles and Fields, Havana,Cuba, 22-26 March 1999The possibility that the expansion rate of the Universe, as reflected by theRed Shift, could be produced by the existence of the dilaton field is explored.The analysis starts from previously studied solutions of the Einstein equationsfor gravity interacting with a massive scalar field. It is firstly underlinedthat such solutions can produce the observed values of the Hubble constant.Since the Einstein-Klein-Gordon lagrangian could be expected to appear as aneffective one for the dilaton in some approximation, the mentioned solutionsare applied to study this field. Therefore, the vacuum expectation value forthe dilaton is selected to be of the order of the Planck mass, as it isfrequently fixed in string phenomenology. Then, it follows that the value ofits effective mass should be as low as m=3.9 10^(-29) cm^(-1) in order producethe observed expansion rate. The discussion can also predict a radius of theUniverse of the order of 10^(29) cm. Finally, after adopting the view advancedina previous work, in which these mentioned solutions are associated tointerior configurations of collapsed scalar fields, a picture of our Universeas a black hole interior is suggested.
