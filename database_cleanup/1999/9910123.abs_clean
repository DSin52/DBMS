final versionSolvable and Integrable SystemsThe algebraic structure and the relationships between the eigenspaces of theCalogero-Sutherland model (CSM) and the Sutherland model (SM) on a circle areinvestigated through the Cherednik operators. We find an exact connectionbetween the simultaneous non-symmetric eigenfunctions of the $A_{N-1}$Cherednik operators, from which the eigenfunctions of the CSM and SM areconstructed, and the monomials. This construction, not only, allows one towrite down a harmonic oscillator algebra involving the Cherednik operators,which yields the raising and lowering operators for both of these models, butalso shows the connection of the CSM with free oscillators and the SM with freeparticles on a circle. We also point out the subtle differences between theexcitations of the CSM and the SM.
