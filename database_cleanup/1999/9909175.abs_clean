We have done a study of the zero-dimensional $\lambda\phi^{4}$ model.Firstly, we exhibit the partition function as a simple exact expression interms of the Macdonald's function for $Re(\lambda)>0$. Secondly, an analyticcontinuation of the partition function for $Re(\lambda)<0$ is performed, and weobtain an expression defined in the complex coupling constant plane $\lambda$,for $|arg \lambda|<\pi$. Consequently, the partition function understood as ananalytic continuation is defined for all values of $\lambda$, except for abranch cut along the real negative $\lambda$ axis. We also evaluate thepartition function on perturbative grounds, using the Borel summation techniqueand we found that in the common domain of validity for $Re(\lambda)>0$, itcoincides precisely with the exact expression.
