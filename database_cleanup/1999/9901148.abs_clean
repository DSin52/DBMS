sign of the Chern-Simons level erased. Extended (and in some cases modified)discussions in most sections. References addedWe review some aspects of three-dimensional quantum gravity with emphasis inthe `CFT -> Geometry' map that follows from the Brown-Henneaux conformalalgebra. The general solution to the classical equations of motion with anti-deSitter boundary conditions is displayed. This solution is parametrized by twofunctions which become Virasoro operators after quantisation. A map from thespace of states to the space of classical solutions is exhibited. Some recentproposals to understand the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy are reviewed in thiscontext. The origin of the boundary degrees of freedom arising in 2+1 gravityis analysed in detail using a Hamiltonian Chern-Simons formalism.
