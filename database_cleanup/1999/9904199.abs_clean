We study the spectrum of the QCD Dirac operator for two colors with fermionsin the fundamental representation and for two or more colors with adjointfermions. For $N_f$ flavors, the chiral flavor symmetry of these theories isspontaneously broken according to $SU(2N_f)\to Sp(2N_f)$ and $SU(N_f)\toO(N_f)$, respectively, rather than the symmetry breaking pattern $SU(N_f)\times SU(N_f) \to SU(N_f)$ for QCD with three or more colors and fundamentalfermions. In this paper we study the Dirac spectrum for the first two symmetrybreaking patterns. Following previous work for the third case we find the Diracspectrum in the domain $\lambda \ll \Lambda_{\rm QCD}$ by means of partiallyquenched chiral perturbation theory. In particular, this result allows us tocalculate the slope of the Dirac spectrum at $\lambda = 0$. We also show thatfor $\lambda \ll 1/L^2 \Lambda_{QCD}$ (with $L$ the linear size of the system)the Dirac spectrum is given by a chiral Random Matrix Theory with thesymmetries of the Dirac operator.
