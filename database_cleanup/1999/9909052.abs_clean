We briefly review the nonlinear sigma model approach for the subject ofmodified Nambu-Jona-Lasinio models at low $N$ and condensation from pseudogapphase in strong-coupling superconductors. Recent success in describing"Bose-type" superconductors that possess two characterstic temperatures and apseudogap above $T_c$ is the development approximately comparable with the BCStheory. One can expect that it should have influence on high-energy physics,similar to impact of the BCS theory on this subject. Although firstgeneralizations of this concept to particle physics were made recently, theseresults were not systematized. In this review we summarize this development anddiscuss similarities and differences of the appearence of the pseudogap phasein superconductors and the Gross-Neveu and Nambu-Jona-Lasinio - like models. Wediscuss its possible relevance for chiral phase transition in QCD and colorwe briefly review the separation of temperatures of pair formation and paircondensation in strong - coupling and low carrier density superconductors (i.e.the formation of the {\it pseudogap phase}).Second part is a review of nonlinear sigma model approach to an analogousphenomenon in the Chiral Gross-Neveu model at small N. In the third section wediscuss the modified Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model where the chiral phase transitionis accompanied by a formation of a phase analogous to the pseudogap phase.
