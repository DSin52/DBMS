Title: 3D van der Waals sigma-model and topological excitations with

logarithmic energyAuthors: S.A.Bulgadaev (Landau Institute, Moscow)

Comments: 14 pages, a talk given at seminar "Properties and Dynamics of Liquid

Crystals", 23 August, MPIPKS, Dresden, GermanyThe 3D vector van der Waals (or conformal) nonlinear sigma-model is proposed.It is shown that it has the "hedgehog"-like topological excitations withlogarithmic energy. Their "neutral" configurations have nontrivial topologicalstructures described by Hopf invariant. A possible influence of theseexcitations on the properties of the model are discussed.
