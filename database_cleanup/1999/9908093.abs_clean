We consider a recent generalisation by Bousso of an earlier holographyproposal by Fischler and Susskind. We demonstrate that in general inhomogeneousuniverses such a proposal would involve extremely complicated - possiblyfractal - light sheets. Furthermore, in general such a light sheet cannot beknown a priori on the basis of theory and moreover, the evolution of theuniverse makes it clear that in general such bounds cannot remain invariantunder time reversal and will change with epoch.We propose a modified version of this proposal in which the light sheets endon the boundary of the past, and hence avoid contact with the caustics. In thisway the resulting light sheets and projections can be made much simpler. Wediscuss the question of operational definability of these sheets within thecontext of both proposals and conclude that in both cases the theoreticalexistence of such sheets must be clearly distinguished from their complexityand the difficulty of their construction in practice. This puts intoperspective the likely practical difficulties one would face in applying theholographic principle to the real cosmos. These issues may also be of relevancein debates regarding the applications of the holographic principle to othersettings such as string theory.
