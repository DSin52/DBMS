Title: BKT phase transitions in two-dimensional systems with internal

symmetriesComments: 18 pages, 1 figure, modernized version

The Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type phase transitions intwo-dimensional systems with internal abelian continuous symmetries areconformal invariance of the kinetic part of the model action, 2) vacuummanifold must be degenerated with abelian discrete homotopy group pi_1. Thentopological excitations have a logarithmically divergent energy and they can bedescribed by effective field theories generalizing the two-dimensionaleuclidean sine-Gordon theory, which is an effective theory of the initialXY-model. In particular, the effective actions for the two-dimensional chiralmodels on maximal abelian tori T_G of simple compact groups G are found.Critical properties of possible effective theories are determined and it isshown that they are characterized by the Coxeter number h_G of lattices fromthe series A,D,E,Z and can be interpreted as those of conformal field theorieswith integer central charge C=n, where n is a rank of the groups pi_1 and G. Apossibility of restoration of full symmetry group G in massive phase is alsodicussed.
