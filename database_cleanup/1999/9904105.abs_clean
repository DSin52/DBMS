We obtain the orbifold Virasoro master equation (OVME) at integer orderlambda, which summarizes the general Virasoro construction on orbifold affinealgebra. The OVME includes the Virasoro master equation when lambda=1 andcontains large classes of stress tensors of twisted sectors of conventionalorbifolds at higher lambda. The generic construction is like a twisted sectorof an orbifold (with non-zero ground state conformal weight) but newconstructions are obtained for which we have so far found no conventionalorbifold interpretation.
