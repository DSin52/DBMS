Recently much work has been done in lowering the Planck threshold of quantumgravitational effects (sub-millimeter dimension(s), Horava-Witten fifthdimension, strings or branes low energy effects, etc.). Working in theframework of 4-dim gravity, with semi-classical considerations based on Hawkingevaporation of planckian micro-black holes, I shall show here as quantumgravity effects could occur also near GUT energies.
