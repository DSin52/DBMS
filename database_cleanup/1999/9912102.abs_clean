Title: Generalized Casimir Energies for systems with arbitrary ($\epsilon(z)$)

planar geometryAuthors: O. Kenneth

Comments: 9 pages, latex

The Casimir force between parallel plates of arbitrary kind is shown to besimply related to the plates transmission and reflection coefficient. A trivialapplication of this general relation leads to the known Lifshitz force betweendielectrics as well as its generalizations.
