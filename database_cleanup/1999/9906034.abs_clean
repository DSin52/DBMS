LaTeX (BibTeX)The mechanism of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking is studied in the Abelianversion of the gauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in four dimensions. The mostinteresting feature of the gauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model is the appearance ofrelevant (renormalizable) four-fermion interactions near a critical curveseparating a chiral symmetric and a dynamically chiral symmetry broken phase.The first three chapters of the thesis are introductory. Chapter 4 is based onhep-th/9712123. In an attempt to go beyond standard mean field approximationsfor four-fermion interactions, the 1/N expansion is utilized in chapter 5.Within the 1/N expansion, where N is the number of fermion flavors, it is shownthat the renormalization group beta function of the U(1) gauge coupling hasultra-violet stable fixed points for sufficiently large N. This implies thatthe gauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model is a rare example of a nontrivialnonasymptotically free gauge field theory in four dimensions.
