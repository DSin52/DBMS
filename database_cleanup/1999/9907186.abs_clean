We investigate field theories on the worldvolume of a D3-brane transverse topartial resolutions of a $\Z_3\times\Z_3$ Calabi-Yau threefold quotientsingularity. We deduce the field content and lagrangian of such theories andpresent a systematic method for mapping the moment map levels characterizingthe partial resolutions of the singularity to the Fayet-Iliopoulos parametersof the D-brane worldvolume theory. As opposed to the simpler cases studiedbefore, we find a complex web of partial resolutions and associatedfield-theoretic Fayet-Iliopoulos deformations. The analysis is performed bytoric methods, leading to a structure which can be efficiently described in thelanguage of convex geometry. For the worldvolume theory, the analysis of themoduli space has an elegant description in terms of quivers. As a by-product,we present a systematic way of extracting the birational geometry of theclassical moduli spaces, thus generalizing previous work on resolution ofsingularities by D-branes.
