We study the emission rates of scalar, spinor and vector particles from a 5dimensional black hole for arbitrary partial waves. The solution is lifted to 6dimensions, and the near horizon $ BTZ \times S^3$ geometry of the black holesolution is probed to determine the greybody factors. We show that the exactdecay rates can be reproduced from a $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theorywhich lies on the boundary of the near horizon geometry. The AdS/CFTcorrespondence is used to determine the dimension of the CFT operatorscorresponding to the bulk fields. These operators couple to plane wavesincident on the CFT from infinity to produce emission in the bulk.
