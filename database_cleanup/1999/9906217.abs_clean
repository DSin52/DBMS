Light-cone form of field dynamics in anti-de Sitter space-time is developed.Using field theoretic and group theoretic approaches the light-conerepresentation for generators of anti-de Sitter algebra acting as differentialoperators on bulk fields is found. We also present light-cone reformulation ofthe boundary conformal field theory representations. Making use of theseexplicit representations of AdS algebra as isometry algebra in the bulk and thealgebra of conformal transformations at the boundary a precise correspondencebetween the bulk fields and the boundary operators is established.
