Title: Topological Born-Infeld Actions and D-Branes

Authors: B. Spence (QMW London)

Comments: 14 pages, LaTeX

We propose that the effective field theories of certain wrapped D-branes aregiven by topological actions based on Born-Infeld theory. In particular, wepresent a Born-Infeld version of the Abelian Donaldson-Witten theory. We thenconsider wrapping D3 branes on calibrated submanifolds and for the Calabi-Yaufour-fold case, discuss how the resulting theory could give rise to aBorn-Infeld version of the ampicheiral twisted N=4 super Yang-Mills topologicalfield theory.
