We consider general properties of central charges of zero branes andassociated duality invariants, in view of their double role, on the bulk and onthe world volume (quantum-mechanical) theory. A detailed study of the BPScondition for the mass spectrum arising from toroidal compactifications isgiven for 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 BPS states in any dimensions. As a byproduct, weretreive the U-duality invariant conditions on the charge (zero mode) spectrumand the orbit classification of BPS states preserving different fractions ofsupersymmetry. The BPS condition for 0-branes in theories with 16supersymmetries in any dimension is also discussed.
