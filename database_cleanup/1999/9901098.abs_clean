In the context of the free-fermionic formulation of the heteroticsuperstring, we construct a three generation N=1 supersymmetricSU(4)xSU(2)LxSU(2)R model supplemented by an SU(8) hidden gauge symmetry andfive Abelian factors. The symmetry breaking to the standard model is achievedusing vacuum expectation values of a Higgs pair in (4bar,2R)+(4,2R) at a highscale. One linear combination of the Abelian symmetries is anomalous and isbroken by vacuum expectation values of singlet fields along the flat directionsof the superpotential. All consistent string vacua of the model are completelyclassified by solving the corresponding system of F- and D-flatness equationsincluding non-renormalizable terms up to sixth order. The requirement ofexistence of electroweak massless doublets further restricts thephenomenologically viable vacua. The third generation fermions receive massesfrom the tree-level superpotential. Further, a complete calculation of allnon-renormalizable fermion mass terms up to fifth order shows that in certainstring vacua the hierarchy of the fermion families is naturally obtained in themodel as the second and third generation fermions earn their mass from fourthand fifth order terms. Along certain flat directions it is shown that the ratioof the SU(4) breaking scale and the reduced Planck mass is equal to the upquark ratio m_c/m_t at the string scale. An additional prediction of the model,is the existence of a U(1) symmetry carried by the fields of the hidden sector,ensuring thus the stability of the lightest hidden state. It is proposed thatthe hidden states may account for the invisible matter of the universe.
