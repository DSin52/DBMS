The scalars of an N = 1 supersymmetric sigma-model in 4 dimensionsparameterize a Kaehler manifold. The transformations of their fermionicsuperpartners under the isometries are often anomalous. These anomalies can becanceled by introducing additional chiral multiplets with appropriate charges.To obtain the right charges a non-trivial singlet compensating multiplet can beused. However when the topology of the underlying Kaehler manifold isnon-trivial, the consistency of this multiplet requires that its charge isquantized. This singlet can be interpreted as a section of a line bundle. Wedetermine the Kaehler potentials corresponding to the minimal non-trivialsinglet chiral superfields for any compact Kaehlerian coset space G/H. Thequantization condition may be in conflict with the requirement of anomalycancelation. To illustrate this, we discuss the consistency of anomaly freemodels based on the coset spaces E_6/SO(10)xU(1) and SU(5)/SU(2)xU(1)xSU(3).
