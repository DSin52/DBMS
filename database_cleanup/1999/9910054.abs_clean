A map between string junctions in the affine 7-brane backgrounds and vectorbundles on del Pezzo surfaces is constructed using mirror symmetry. It is shownthat the lattice of string junctions with support on an affine 7-braneconfiguration is isomorphic to the K-theory group of the corresponding delPezzo surface. This isomorphism allows us to construct a map between the statesof the N=2, D=4 theories with E_N global symmetry realized in two differentways in Type IIB and Type IIA string theory. A subgroup of the SL(2,Z) symmetryof the \hat{E}_9 7-brane background appears as the Fourier-Mukai transformacting on the D-brane configurations realizing vector bundles on ellipticallyfibered B_9.
