We study BPS saturated objects with axial geometry (wall junctions, vortices)in generalized Wess-Zumino models. It is observed that the tension of suchobjects is negative in general (although ``exceptional'' models are possible).We show how an ambiguity in the definition of central charges does not affectphysical quantities, and we comment on the stability of the junctions andvortices. We illustrate these issues in two classes of models with Z_Nsymmetry. On the basis of analytical large N calculations and numericalcalculations at finite N, we argue that the domain wall junctions in thesemodels are indeed BPS saturated, and we calculate the junction tensionsexplicitly.
