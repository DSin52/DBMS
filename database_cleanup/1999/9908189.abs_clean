Title: String Theory on AdS3

Comments: 18 pages, latex. To appear in the proceedings of the TMR European

program meeting "Quantum aspects of gauge theories, supersymmetry andreferences addedString theory on curved backgrounds has received much attention on account ofboth its own interest, and of its relation with gauge theories. Despite theprogress made in various directions, several quite elementary questions remainunanswered, in particular in the very simple case of three-dimensional anti-deSitter space. I will very briefly review these problems, discuss in some detailthe important issue of constructing a consistent spectrum for a stringpropagating on ADS3 plus torsion background, and comment on potentialsolutions.
