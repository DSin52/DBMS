We show how spin networks can be described and evaluated as Feynman integralsover an internal space. This description can, in particular, be applied to theso-called simple SO(D) spin networks that are of importance forhigher-dimensional generalizations of loop quantum gravity. As an illustrationof the power of the new formalism, we use it to obtain the asymptotics of anamplitude for the D-simplex and show that its oscillatory part is given by theRegge action.
