The connection between IIA superstring theory compactified on a circle ofradius R and IIB theory compactified on a circle of radius 1/R is reexaminedfrom the perspective of N=2, D=9 space-time supersymmetry. We argue that theconsistency of IIA/B duality requires the BPS states corresponding to momentumand winding of either of the type-II superstrings to transform as inequivalentsupermultiplets. We show that this is indeed the case for any finitecompactification radius, thus providing a nontrivial confirmation of IIA/Bduality. From the point of view of N=2, D=9 supergravity, one is naturally ledto an SL(2,Z) invariant field theory that encompasses both the M-theory torusand the Kaluza-Klein states of the IIB theory.
