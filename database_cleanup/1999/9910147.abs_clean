The on-shell regularization of the one-loop divergences of supergravitytheories is generalized to include a dilaton of the type occurring in effectivefield theories derived from superstring theory, and the superfield structure ofthe one-loop corrections is given. Field theory anomalies and quantumcontributions to soft supersymmetry breaking are discussed. The latter aresensitive to the precise choice of couplings that generate Pauli-Villarsmasses, which in turn reflect the details of the underlying theory above thescale of the effective cut-off. With a view to the implementation theGreen-Schwarz and other mechanisms for canceling field theory anomalies under aU(1) gauge transformation and under the T-duality group of modulartransformations, we show that the K\"ahler potential renormalization for theuntwisted sector of orbifold compactification can be made invariant under thesegroups.
