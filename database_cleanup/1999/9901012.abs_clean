We find the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor in the CFTcorresponding to a moving black hole in AdS. Boosting the black hole to thespeed of light, keeping the total energy fixed, yields a gravitational shockwave in AdS. The analogous procedure on the field theory side leads to ``lightcone'' states, i.e., states with energy-momentum tensor localized on the lightcone. The correspondence between the gravitational shock wave and these lightcone states provides a useful tool for testing causality. We show, in severalexamples, how the CFT reproduces the causal relations in AdS.
