Title: Ultraviolet and Infrared Finiteness in Two Dimensional Curved Space-Time

Authors: H. Zerrouki

Comments: 17 pages, no figures

Different models of field theories in two dimensions can be described by theaction $Tr\int \vf F$. In the presence of a curved background, we construct alocal supersymmetry-like transformations under which the action is invariant.Furthermore, by analysing the cohomology of the theory we show the absence ofanomalies. Also the ultraviolet as well as the infrared finiteness of thetheory are proven to all orders of perturbation theory.
