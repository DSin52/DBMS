We study the absorption probability of minimally-coupled massive scalars byextremal p-branes. In particular, we find that the massive scalar wave equationunder the self-dual string background has the same form as the massless scalarwave equation under the dyonic string background. Thus it can be cast into theform of a modified Mathieu equation and solved exactly. Another example that wecan solve exactly is that of the D=4 two-charge black hole with equal charges,for which we obtain the closed-form absorption probability. We also obtain theleading-order absorption probabilities for D3-, M2- and M5-branes.
