For linear bose field theories, I show that if a classical Hamiltonianfunction is strictly positive, then there is a canonical transformation makingthe evolution orthogonal. This structure theorem is used to analyze thecorresponding quantum theories. It is shown that there is an intimateconnection between boundedness-below and self-adjoint implementability.any timelike component of the four-momentum density operator, averaged over acompact region in curved space-time, must be bounded below.
