In supersymmetric models with the run-away vacua or with the stable butnon-supersymmetric ground state there exist stable field configurations (vacua)which restore one half of supersymmetry and are characterized by constantpositive energy density. The formal foundation for such vacua is provided bythe central extension of the N =1 superalgebra with the infinite centralcharge.
