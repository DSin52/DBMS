Title: A Down to Earth Attempt at Determining the Low Energy Effective Action

of N=2 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills TheoryComments: 20 pages, epsf file, to be contributed to LP99, SLAC

We review a detailed investigation of the perturbative part of the low-energyeffective action of N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in a conventionaleffective field theory approach. With the restriction that the effective actionshould contain at most two derivatives and not more than four-fermioncouplings, the features of the low-energy effective action obtained by Seibergbased on $U(1)_R$ anomaly and non-perturbative $\beta$-function arguments areshown to emerge.
