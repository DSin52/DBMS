We study massless and massive Hawking radiations on a two-dimensional AdSspacetime. For the massless case, the quantum stress-energy tensor of amassless scalar field on the AdS background is calculated, and the expectednull radiation is obtained. However, for the massive case, the scatteringanalysis is performed in order to calculate the absorption and reflectioncoefficients which are related to statistical Hawking temperature. On thecontrary to the massless case, we obtain a nonvanishing massive radiation.
