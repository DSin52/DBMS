Title: Topological quantum mechanics and the first Chern class

Comments: 12 pages, Revtex

Topological properties of quantum system is directly associated with the wavefunction. Based on the decomposition theory of gauge potential, a newcomprehension of topological quantum mechanics is discussed. One shows that atopological invariant, the first Chern class, is inherent in the Schr\"odingersystem, which is only associated with the Hopf index and Brouwer degree of thewave function. This relationship between the first Chern class and the wavefunction is the topological source of many topological effects in quantumsystem.
