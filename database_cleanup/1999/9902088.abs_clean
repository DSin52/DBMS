We propose that in time dependent backgrounds the holographic principleshould be replaced by the generalized second law of thermodynamics. Forisotropic open and flat universes with a fixed equation of state, thegeneralized second law agrees with the cosmological holographic principleproposed by Fischler and Susskind. However, in more complicated spacetimes thetwo proposals disagree. A modified form of the holographic bound that appliesto a post-inflationary universe follows from the generalized second law.However, in a spatially closed universe, or inside a black hole event horizon,there is no simple relationship that connects the area of a region to themaximum entropy it can contain.
