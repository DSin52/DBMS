Majumder and Sen have given an explicit construction of a first order phasetransition in a non-supersymmetric system of Dbranes that occurs when the Bfield is varied. We show that the description of this transition in terms ofK-theory involves a bundle of K groups of non-commutative algebras over theKahler cone with nontrivial monodromy. Thus the study of monodromy in K groupsassociated with quantized algebras can be used to predict the phase structureof systems of (non-supersymmetric) Dbranes.
