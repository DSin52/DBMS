We compute the Kaluza-Klein mass spectrum of the D=11 supergravitycompactified on AdS2 x S2 x T7 and arrange it into representations of theSU(1,1|2) superconformal algebra. This geometry arises in M theory as the nearhorizon limit of a D=4 extremal black-hole constructed by wrapping four groupsof M-branes along the T7. Via AdS/CFT correspondence, our result gives aprediction for the spectrum of the chiral primary operators in the dualconformal quantum mechanics yet to be formulated.
