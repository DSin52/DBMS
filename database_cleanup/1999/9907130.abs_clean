Correlated Electrons; Exactly Solvable and Integrable SystemsQuantum matrix models in the large-N limit arise in many physical systemslike Yang-Mills theory with or without supersymmetry, quantum gravity,string-bit models, various low energy effective models of string theory,M(atrix) theory, quantum spin chain models, and strongly correlated electronsystems like the Hubbard model. We introduce, in a unifying fashion, a hierachyof infinite-dimensional Lie superalgebras of quantum matrix models. One ofthese superalgebras pertains to the open string sector and another one theclosed string sector. Physical observables of quantum matrix models like theHamiltonian can be expressed as elements of these Lie superalgebras. Thisindicates the Lie superalgebras describe the symmetry of quantum matrix models.We present the structure of these Lie superalgebras like their Cartansubalgebras, root vectors, ideals and subalgebras. They are generalizations ofwell-known algebras like the Cuntz algebra, the Virasoro algebra, the Toeplitzalgebra, the Witt algebra and the Onsager algebra. Just like we learnt a lotabout critical phenomena and string theory through their conformal symmetrydescribed by the Virasoro algebra, we may learn a lot about quantumchromodynamics, quantum gravity and condensed matter physics through thissymmetry of quantum matrix models described by these Lie superalgebras.
