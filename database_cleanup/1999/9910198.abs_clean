We revise the calculation of the one-loop effective action for scalar andspinor fields coupled to the dilaton in two dimensions. Applying the method ofcovariant perturbation theory for the heat kernel we derive the effectiveaction in an explicitly covariant form that produces both the conformallyinvariant and the conformally anomalous terms.For scalar fields the conformallyinvariant part of the action is nonlocal. The obtained effective action isproved to be infrared finite. We also compute the one-loop effective action forscalar fields at finite temperature.
