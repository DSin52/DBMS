corrected and one more addedWe illustrate the Dirichlet prescription of the AdS/CFT correspondence usingthe example of a massive scalar field and argue that it is the only entirelyconsistent regularization procedure known so far. Using the Dirichletprescription, we then calculate the divergent terms for gravity in the cases$d=2,4,6$, which give rise to the Weyl anomaly in the boundary conformal fieldtheory.
