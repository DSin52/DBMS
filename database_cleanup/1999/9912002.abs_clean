Authors: Martijn Wijnholt and Slava Zhukov

Comments: 18 pages, 2 figures, harvmac big mode

We examine the attractor mechanism for extremal black holes in the context offive dimensional N = 2 supergravity and show that attractor points are uniquein the extended vector multiplet moduli space. Implications for black holeentropy are discussed.
