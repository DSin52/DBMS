We analyse the equivalence between topologically massive gauge theory (TMGT)and different formulations of non-topologically massive gauge theories (NTMGTs)in the canonical approach. The different NTMGTs studied are St\"uckelbergformulation of (A) a first order formulation involving one and two form fields,(B) Proca theory, and (C) massive Kalb-Ramond theory. We first quantise thesereducible gauge systems by using the phase space extension procedure and usingit, identify the phase space variables of NTMGTs which are equivalent to thecanonical variables of TMGT and show that under this the Hamiltonian also getmapped. Interestingly it is found that the different NTMGTs are equivalent todifferent formulations of TMGTs which differ only by a total divergence term.We also provide covariant mappings between the fields in TMGT to NTMGTs at thelevel of correlation function.
