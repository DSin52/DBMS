A field theoretic description of monopole condensation in strongly coupledgauge theories is given by actions involving antisymmetric tensors B_{\mu\nu}of rank 2. We rederive the corresponding action for 4d compact QED, summingexplicitly over all possible monopole configurations. Its gauge symmetries andWard identities are discussed. Then we consider the Wilsonian RGs forYang-Mills theories in the presence of collective fields (again tensorsB_{\mu\nu}) for the field strengths F_{\mu \nu} associated to the U(1)subgroups. We show that a ``vector-like'' Ward identity for the Wilsonianaction involving B_{\mu\nu}, whose validity corresponds to monopolecondensation, constitutes a fixed point of the Wilsonian RG flow.
