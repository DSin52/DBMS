Title: Lorentz Covariance in Epstein-Glaser Renormalization

Authors: Dirk Prange

Comments: 16 pages, amslatex, mathptm

We give explicit and inductive formulas for the construction of a Lorentzcovariant renormalization in the EG approach. This automatically provides for acovariant BPHZ subtraction at totally spacelike momentum useful for masslesstheories.
