Quantum corrections to Legendre transformations are shown to cancel to allorders in supersymmetric theories in path integral formalism. Using thisresult, lagrangians for auxiliary fields are generalized to non-quadraticforms. In supersymmetric effective nonlinear lagrangians, the arbitrariness dueto the existence of quasi Nambu-Goldstone bosons is shown to disappear whenlocal auxiliary gauge fields are introduced.
