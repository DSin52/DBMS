A 3d topological sigma model describing maps from a 3-manifold Y to aCalabi-Yau 3-fold M is introduced. As the model is topological, we can choosean arbitrary metric on M. Upon scaling up the metric, the path integral byconstruction localizes on the moduli space of special Lagrangian submanifoldsof M. We couple the theory to dynamical gauge fields and discuss the case whereM has a mirror and the gauge group is U(1).
