We discuss the open descendants of diagonal irrational $Z_3$ orbifolds,starting from the $c=2$ case and analyzing six-dimensional and four-dimensionalmodels. As recently argued, their consistency is linked to the presence ofgeometric discrete moduli. The different classes of open descendants, relatedto different resolutions of the fixed-point ambiguities, are distinguished bythe number of geometric fixed points surviving the unoriented projection.
