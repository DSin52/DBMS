Comments: 19 pages, Latex, no figurers

In this paper, we use only the equation of motion for an interacting systemof gravity, dilaton and antisymmetric tensor to study the black branesolutions. By making use of the property of Schwarzian derivative, we obtainthe complete solution of this system of equations. For some special values weobtain the well-known BPS brane and black brane solutions.
