A particular initial state for the construction of the perturbative expansionof QCD is investigated. It is formed as a coherent superposition of zeromomentum gluon pairs and shows Lorentz as well as global SU(3) symmetries. Itfollows that the gluon and ghost propagators determined by it, coincides withthe ones used in an alternative of the usual perturbation theory proposed in aprevious work. Therefore, the ability of such a procedure of producing a finitegluon condensation parameter already in the first orders of perturbation theoryis naturally explained. It also follows that this state satisfies thephysicality condition of the BRST procedure in its Kugo and Ojima formulation.The BRST quantization is done for the value alpha=1 of the gauge parameterwhere the procedure is greatly simplified. Therefore, after assuming that theadiabatic connection of the interaction does not take out the state from theinteracting physical space, the predictions of the perturbation expansion, atthe value alpha=1, for the physical quantities should have meaning. Thevalidity of this conclusion solves the gauge dependence indeterminacy remainedin the proposed perturbation expansion.
