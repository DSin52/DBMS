We investigate the stability of the hidden sector gaugino condensate in aSL(2,Z)-invariant supergravity model inspired by the E8*E8 heterotic string,using the chiral superfield formalism. We calculate the Planck-suppressedcorrections to the ``truncated approximation'' for the condensate value and thescalar potential. A transition to a phase with zero condensate occurs nearspecial points in moduli space and at large compactification radius. We discussthe implications for the T-modulus dependence of supersymmetry-breaking.
