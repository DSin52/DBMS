We propose a type IIB super-Poincare algebra with SO(2,1) covariant centralextension. Together with SO(2,1) and SO(9,1) generators, a SO(2,1) triplet(momenta), a Majorana-spinor doublet (supercharges) and a Rarita-Schwingercentral charge generate a group, G. We consider a coset G/H where H=(SO(2) xLorentz), and the SL(2,R) 2-form doublet is obtained by the coset construction.It is shown that U(1) connections, whose strengths are associated with 2-forms,are recognized as coordinates of the enlarged space. We suggest that this isthe fundamental algebra governing the superstring theories which explains theIIB SL(2,R) duality and geometrical origin of U(1) fields.
