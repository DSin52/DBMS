Based on a generalization of the stochastic quantization scheme we recentlyproposed a generalized, globally defined Faddeev-Popov path integral densityfor the quantization of Yang-Mills theory. In this talk first our approach onthe whole space of gauge potentials is shortly reviewed; in the following wediscuss the corresponding global path integral on the gauge orbit spacerelating it to the original Parisi-Wu stochastic quantization scheme.
