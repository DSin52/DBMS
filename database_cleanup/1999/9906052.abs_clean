important references, possible relation to work of Dorey et alMarchesini showed that the Fokker-Planck Hamiltonian for Yang-Mills theoriesis the loop operator. Jevicki and Rodrigues showed that the Fokker-PlanckHamiltonian of some matrix models co\"\i ncides with temporal gaugenon-critical string field theory Hamiltonians constructed by Ishibashi andKawai (and their collaborators). Thus the loop operator for Yang-Mills theoryis the temporal gauge Hamiltonian for a noncritical string field theory, inaccord with Polyakov's conjecture. The consistency condition of the stringinterpretation is the zigzag symmetry emphasized by Polyakov. Several aspectsof the noncritical string theory are considered, relating the string fieldtheory Hamiltonian to the worldsheet description.
