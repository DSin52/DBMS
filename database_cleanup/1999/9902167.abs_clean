In this paper,based on the available mathematical works on geometry andtopology of hyperbolic manifolds and discrete groups, some results of Freedmanet al (hep-th/9804058) are reproduced and broadly generalized. Among many newresults the possibility of extension of work of Belavin, Polyakov andZamolodchikov to higher dimensions is investigated. Known in physicalliterature objections against such extension are removed and the possibility ofan extension is convincingly demonstrated.
