Title: Topological Quantum Field Theories -- A Meeting Ground for Physicists

and MathematiciansComments: Latex, 27 eps figures

Topological quantum field theories can be used as a powerful tool to probegeometry and topology in low dimensions. Chern-Simons theories, which areexamples of such field theories, provide a field theoretic framework for thestudy of knots and links in three dimensions. These are rare examples ofquantum field theories which can be exactly (non-perturbatively) and explicitlysolved. Abelian Chern-Simons theory provides a field theoretic interpretationof the linking and self-linking numbers of a link. In non-Abelian theories,vacuum expectation values of Wilson link operators yield a class of polynomiallink invariants; the simplest of them is the famous Jones polynomial. Otherinvariants obtained are more powerful than that of Jones. Powerful methods forcompletely analytical and non-perturbative computation of these knot and linkinvariants have been developed. In the process answers to some of the openproblems in knot theory are obtained. From these invariants for unoriented andframed links in $S^3$, an invariant for any three-manifold can be easilyconstructed by exploiting the Lickorish-Wallace surgery presentation ofthree-manifolds. This invariant up to a normalization is the partition functionof the Chern-Simons field theory. Even perturbative analysis of theChern-Simons theories are rich in their mathematical structure; these provide afield theoretic interpretation of Vassiliev knot invariants. Not only inmathematics, Chern-Simons theories find important applications in three andfour dimensional quantum gravity also.
