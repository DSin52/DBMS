A new type of non-Abelian generalization of the Born-Infeld action isproposed, in which the spacetime indices and group indices are combined. Theaction is manifestly Lorentz and gauge invariant. In its power expansion, thelowest order term is the Yang-Mills action and the second term corresponds tothe bosonic stringy correction to this action. Solutions of the Euler-Lagrangeequation for the SU(2) case are considered and we show that there exists aninstanton-like solution which has winding number one and finite action.
