We study the solutions of the Einstein equations in (d+2)-dimensions,describing parallel p-branes (p=d-1) in a space with two transverse dimensionsof positive gaussian curvature. These solutions generalize the solutions ofDeser and Jackiw of point particle sources in (2+1)-dimensional gravity withcosmological constant. Determination of the metric is reduced to finding theroots of a simple algebraic equation. These roots also determine the nontrivial"warp factors" of the metric at the positions of the branes. We discuss thepossible role of these solutions and the importance of "warp factors" in thecontext of the large extra dimensions scenario.
