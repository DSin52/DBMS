We formulate an effective Schroedinger wave equation describing the quantumdynamics of a system of D0-branes by applying the Wilson renormalization groupequation to the worldsheet partition function of a deformed sigma-modeldescribing the system, which includes the quantum recoil due to the exchange ofstring states between the individual D-particles. We arrive at an effectiveFokker-Planck equation for the probability density with diffusion coefficientdetermined by the total kinetic energy of the recoiling system. We use Galileaninvariance of the system to show that there are three possible solutions of theassociated non-linear Schroedinger equation depending on the strength of theopen string interactions among the D-particles. When the open string energiesare small compared to the total kinetic energy of the system, the solutions aregoverned by freely-propagating solitary waves. When the string couplingconstant reaches a dynamically determined critical value, the system isdescribed by minimal uncertainty wavepackets which describe the smearing of theD-particle coordinates due to the distortion of the surrounding spacetime fromthe string interactions. For strong string interactions, bound state solutionsexist with effective mass determined by an energy-dependent shift of the staticBPS mass of the D0-branes.
