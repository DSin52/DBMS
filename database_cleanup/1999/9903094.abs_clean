Certain two and three point functions of gauge invariant primary operators of${\cal N}=4$ SYM are computed in ${\cal N}=1$ superspace keeping all the$\th$-components. This allows one to read off many component descendentcorrelators. Our results show the only possible $g^2_{YM}$ corrections to thefree field correlators are contact terms. Therefore they vanish for operatorsat separate points, verifying the known non-renormalization theorems. This alsoimplies the results are consistent with ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetry even thoughthe Lagrangian we use has only ${\cal N}=1$ manifest supersymmetry. We repeatsome of the calculations using supersymmetric Landau gauge and obtain, asexpected, the same results as those of supersymmetric Feynman gauge.
