The correspondence between Matrix String Theory in the strong coupling limitand IIA superstring theory can be shown by means of the instanton solutions ofthe former. We construct the general instanton solutions of Matrix StringTheory which interpolate between given initial and final string configurations.Each instanton is characterized by a Riemann surface of genus h with npunctures, which is realized as a plane curve. We study the moduli space ofsuch plane curves and find out that, at finite N, it is a discretized versiondimensions are 2h-3+n, the remaining h dimensions being discrete. It turns outthat as $N$ tends to infinity, these discrete dimensions become continuous, andone recovers the full moduli space of string interaction theory.
