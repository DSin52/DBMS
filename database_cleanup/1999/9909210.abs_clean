Title: Casimir-Polder energy and dilute dielectric ball

Authors: Valery N. Marachevsky

Comments: 9 pages, no figures, Latex 2e, different approaches are reviewed and

analysed in the Conclusions section ; explanations are addedWe apply general formalism of quantum field theory and addition theorem forBessel functions to derive formula for the Casimir-Polder energy of interactionbetween a polarizable particle and a dilute dielectric ball and Casimir energyof a dilute dielectric ball. The correspondence between the Casimir-Polderformula and Casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball is shown. Differentapproaches to the problem of Casimir energy of a dielectric ball are reviewedand analysed by use of addition theorem for Bessel functions.
