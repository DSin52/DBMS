proceedings of NATO-ASI and TMR Summer School "Progress in String Theory andM-theory", Cargese, May 24 - June 5 1999 (talk by author)We discuss the moduli space of flat connections of Yang-Mills theoriesformulated on T^3 x R, with periodic boundary conditions. When the gauge groupis SO(N>=7), G_2, F_4, E_6, E_7 or E_8, the moduli space consists of more thanone component.
