An operator formalism for bosonization at finite temperature and density isdeveloped. We treat the general case of anyon statistics. The exact $n$-pointcorrelation functions, satisfying the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition, areexplicitly constructed. The invariance under both vector and chiraltransformations allows to introduce two chemical potentials. Investigating theexact momentum distribution, we discover anyon condensation in certain range ofthe statistical parameter. Another interesting feature is the occurrence of anon-vanishing persistent current. As an application of the general formalism,we solve the massless Thirring model at finite temperature, deriving the chargedensity and the persistent current.
