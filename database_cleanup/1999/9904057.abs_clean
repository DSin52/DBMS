In the conformal-gauge two-dimensional quantum gravity, the solution obtainedby the perturbative or path-integral approach is compared with the one obtainedby the operator-formalism approach. Treatments of the anomaly problem in bothapproaches are different. This difference is found to be essentially caused bythe fact that the perturbative or path-integral approach is based on theT*-product (covariantized T-product), which generally violates field equations.Indeed, this fact induces some extra one-loop Feynman diagrams, which would notexist unless a nonzero contribution arose from a zero field. Some demerits ofthe path-integral approach are explicitly demonstrated.
