We consider a version of the $AdS_{d+1}/CFT_{d}$ correspondence, in which thebulk space is taken to be the quotient manifold $AdS_{d+1} /\Gamma$ with afairly generic discrete group $\Gamma$ acting isometrically on $AdS_{d+1}$. Weaddress some geometrical issues concerning the holographic principle and theUV/IR relations. It is shown that certain singular structures on the quotientboundary ${\bf S}^{d}/\Gamma$ can affect the underlying physical spectrum. Inparticular, the conformal dimension of the most relevant operators in theboundary CFT can increase as $\Gamma$ becomes ``large''. This phenomenon alsohas a natural explanation in terms of the bulk supergravity theory. The scalartwo-point function is computed using this quotient version of the AdS/CFTcorrespondence, which agrees with the expected result derived from conformalinvariance of the boundary theory.
