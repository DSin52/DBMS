A special class of solutions to the generalised WDVV equations related to afinite set of covectors is investigated. Some geometric conditions on such aset which guarantee that the corresponding function satisfies WDVV equationsare found (check-conditions). These conditions are satisfied for all rootsystems and their special deformations discovered in the theory of theCalogero-Moser systems by O.Chalykh, M.Feigin and the author. This leads to thenew solutions for the generalized WDVV equations.
