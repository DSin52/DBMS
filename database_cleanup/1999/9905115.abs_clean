Winter School on "Duality in Fields and Strings", February, 1999, ChejuIsland, KoreaIn the first lecture, we derive the five-dimensional effective action ofstrongly coupled heterotic string theory for the complete (1,1) sector of thetheory by performing a reduction, on a Calabi-Yau three-fold, of M-theory onS1/Z2. The supersymmetric ground state of the theory is a multi-charged BPSthree-brane domain wall, which we construct in general. In this first lecture,we assume the ``standard'' embedding of the spin connection into the E8 gaugeconnection on one orbifiold fixed plane. In the second lecture, we generalizethese results to ``non-standard'' embeddings. That is, we allow for general E8X E8 gauge bundles and for the presence of five-branes. Properties of these``non-perturbative''vacua, as well as of the resulting low-energy theories, arediscussed. In the last lecture, we review the spectral cover formalism forconstructing both U(n) and SU(n) holomorphic vector bundles on ellipticallyfibered Calabi-Yau three-folds which admit a section. Restricting the structuregroup to SU(n), we derive, in detail, a set of rules for the construction ofthree-family particle physics theories with phenomenologically relevant gaugegroups. We illustrate these ideas by constructing several explicit three-familynon-perturbative vacua.
