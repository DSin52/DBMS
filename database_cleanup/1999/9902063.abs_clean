The N=1 self-dual supergravity has SL(2.C) symmetry. This symmetry results inSU(2) charges as the angular-momentum. As in the non-supersymmetric self-dualgravity, the currents are also of their potentials and are thereforeidentically conserved. The charges are generally invariant and gauge covariantunder local SU(2) transforms approaching to be rigid at spatial infinity. ThePoisson brackets constitute su(2) algebra and hence can be interpreted as thegenerally covariant conservative angular-momentum.
