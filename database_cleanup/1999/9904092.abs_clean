We study open descendants of non-supersymmetric type IIB asymmetric (freelyacting) orbifolds with zero cosmological constant. A generic feature of thesemodels is that supersymmetry remains unbroken on the brane at all mass levels,while it is broken in the bulk in a way that preserves Fermi-Bose degeneracy inboth the massless and massive (closed string) spectrum. This property remainsvalid in the heterotic dual of the type II model but only for the masslessexcitations. A possible application of these constructions concerns scenariosof low-energy supersymmetry breaking with large dimensions.
