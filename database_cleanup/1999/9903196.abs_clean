The graviton exchange diagram for the correlation function of arbitraryscalar operators is evaluated in anti-de Sitter space, AdS(d+1). This enablesus to complete the computation of the 4-point amplitudes of dilaton and axionfields in IIB supergravity on AdS5 X S5. By the AdS/CFT correspondence, weobtain the 4-point functions of the marginal operators Tr (F^2+...) and Tr(F F~+...) in N=4, d=4 SU(N) SYM at large N, large g^2 N. The short distanceasymptotics of the amplitudes are studied. We find that in the direct channelthe leading power singularity agrees with the expected contribution of thestress-energy tensor in a double OPE expansion. Logarithmic singularities occurin the complete 4-point functions at subleading orders.
