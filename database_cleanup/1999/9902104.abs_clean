By using the approach of non-commutative geometry, we study spinors andscalars on the two layers AdS$_{d+1}$ space. We have found that in the boundaryof two layers AdS$_{d+1}$ space, by using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we have alogarithmic conformal field theory. This observation propose a way to get thequantum field theory in the context of non-commutative geometry.
