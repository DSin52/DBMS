We use the boundary state formalism to study, from the closed string point ofview, superpositions of branes and anti-branes which are relevant in somenon-perturbative string dualities. Treating the tachyon instability of thesesystems as proposed by A. Sen, we show how to incorporate the effects of thetachyon condensation directly in the boundary state. In this way we manage toshow explicitly that the D1 -- anti-D1 pair of Type I is a stable non-BPSD-particle, and compute its mass. We also generalize this construction todescribe other non-BPS D-branes of Type I. By requiring the absence of tachyonsin the open string spectrum, we find which configurations are stable andcompute their tensions. Our classification is in complete agreement with theresults recently obtained using the K-theory of space-time.
