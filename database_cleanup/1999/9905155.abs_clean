We construct partially localized supergravity counterpart solutions to the1/2 supersymmetric non-threshold and the 1/4 supersymmetric threshold boundstate BI dyons in the D3-brane Dirac-Born-Infeld theory. Such supergravitysolutions have all the parameters of the BI dyons. By applying the IIA/IIBT-duality transformations to these supergravity solutions, we obtain thesupergravity counterpart solutions to 1/2 and 1/4 supersymmetric BIons carryingelectric and magnetic charges of the worldvolume U(1) gauge field in theDirac-Born-Infeld theory in other dimensions.
