We consider the entropy of a black hole which has zero area horizon. Themicrostates appear as monopole solutions of the effective theory on thecorresponding brane configurations.The resulting entropy formula coincides withthe one expected from stringy calculation and agrees with U-duality invarianceof entropy.
