I carefully study noncommutative version of ADHM construction of instantons,which was proposed by Nekrasov and Schwarz. Noncommutative ${\bf R}^4$ isdescribed as algebra of operators acting in Fock space. In ADHM construction ofinstantons, one looks for zero-modes of Dirac-like operator. The featurepeculiar to noncommutative case is that these zero-modes project out somestates in Fock space. The mechanism of these projections is clarified when thegauge group is U(1). I also construct some zero-modes when the gauge group isU(N) and demonstrate that the projections also occur, and the mechanism issimilar to the U(1) case. A physical interpretation of the projections in IIBmatrix model is briefly discussed.
