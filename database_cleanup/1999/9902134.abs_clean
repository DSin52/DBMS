We study N=(2,2) supersymmetric abelian gauge theories in two dimensions. Theexact BPS spectrum of these models is shown to coincide with the spectrum ofmassive hypermultiplets of certain N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories in fourdimensions. A special case of these results involves a surprising connectionbetween four-dimensional N=2 SQCD with N colours and N_{f}>N flavours at theroot of the baryonic Higgs branch and the supersymmetric CP^{2N-N_{f}-1}sigma-model in two dimensions. This correspondence implies a new prediction forthe strong-coupling spectrum of the four-dimensional theory.
