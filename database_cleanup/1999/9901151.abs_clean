We consider the generating function (prepotential) for Gromov-Witteninvariants of rational elliptic surface. We apply the local mirror principle tocalculate the prepotential and prove a certain recursion relation, holomorphicanomaly equation, for genus 0 and 1. We propose the holomorphic anomalyequation for all genera and apply it to determine higher genus Gromov-Witteninvariants and also the BPS states on the surface. Generalizing G\"ottsche'sformula for the Hilbert scheme of $g$ points on a surface, we find preciseagreement of our results with the proposal recently made by Gopakumar andVafa(hep-th/9812127).
