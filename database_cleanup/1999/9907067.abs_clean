in Proc. of the Second SIGRAV School on ``Gravitational Waves inAstrophysics, Comology and String Theory" (Villa Olmo, Como, 19-24 April1999), edited by V. Gorini et alThis is a contracted version of a series of lectures for graduate andundergraduate students given at the {\sl ``VI Seminario Nazionale di FisicaTeorica"} (Parma, September 1997), at the Second Int. Conference {\sl ``AroundVIRGO"} (Pisa, September 1998), and at the Second {\sl SIGRAV} School on {\sl"Gravitational Waves in Astrophysics, Cosmology and String Theory"} (Center "A.Volta", Como, April 1999). The aim is to provide an elementary, self-containedintroduction to string cosmology and, in particular, to the background of reliccosmic gravitons predicted in the context of the so-called "pre-big bang"scenario. No special preparation is required besides a basic knowledge ofgeneral relativity and of standard (inflationary) cosmology. All the essentialcomputations are reported in full details either in the main text or in theAppendices. For a deeper and more complete approach to the pre-big bangscenario the interested reader is referred to the updated collection of papers
