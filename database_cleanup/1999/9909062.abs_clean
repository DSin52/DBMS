Journal-ref: JHEP 9910 (1999) 008

We construct the world-volume action for non-BPS D-branes in type II stringtheories. This action is invariant under all the unbroken supersymmetries inthe bulk, but these symmetries are realised as spontaneously broken symmetriesin the world-volume theory. Coupling of this action to background supergravityfields is straightforward. We also discuss the fate of the U(1) gauge field onthe D-brane world-volume after tachyon condensation.
