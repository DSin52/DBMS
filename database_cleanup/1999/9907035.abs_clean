A systematic numerical study of the classical solutions to the combinedsystem consisting of the Georgi-Glashow model and the SO(3) gauged Skyrme modelis presented. The gauging of the Skyrme system permits a lower bound on theenergy, so that the solutions of the composite system can be topologicallystable. The solutions feature some very interesting bifurcation patterns, andit is found that some branches of these solutions are unstable.
