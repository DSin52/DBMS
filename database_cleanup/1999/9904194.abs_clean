In angular quantization approach a perturbation theory for the MassiveThirring Model (MTM) is developed, which allows us to calculate VacuumExpectation Values of exponential fields in sin-Gordon theory near the freefermion point in first order of MTM coupling constant $g$. TheHankel-transforms play an important role when carrying out this calculations.The expression we have found coincides with that of the direct expansion over$g$ of the exact formula conjectured by S.Lukyanov and A.Zamolodchikov.
