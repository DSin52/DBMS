Light cone gauge manifestly supersymmetric formulations of type IIB10-dimensional supergravity in $AdS_5 \times S^5$ background and relatedboundary conformal field theory representations are developed. A precisecorrespondence between the bulk fields of IIB supergravity and the boundaryoperators is established. The formulations are given entirely in terms of lightcone scalar superfields, allowing us to treat all component fields on an equalfooting.
