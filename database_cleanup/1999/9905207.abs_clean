Exact relations between the QCD thermal pressure and the trace anomaly arederived. These are used, first, to prove the equivalence of the thermodynamicand the hydrodynamic pressure in equilibrium in the presence of the traceanomaly, closing a gap in previous arguments. Second, in the temporal axialgauge a formula is derived which expresses the thermal pressure in terms of aDyson-resummed two-point function. This overcomes the infrared problemsencountered in the conventional perturbation-theory approach.
