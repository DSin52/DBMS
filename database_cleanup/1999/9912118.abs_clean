An inflating brane-world can be created from ``nothing'' together with itsAnti-de Sitter (AdS) bulk. The resulting space-time has compact spatialsections bounded by the brane. During inflation, the continuum of KK modes isseparated from the massless zero mode by the gap $m=(3/2) H$, where $H$ is theHubble rate. We consider the analog of the Nariai solution and argue that itdescribes pair production of ``Black cigars'' attached to the inflating brane.In the case when the size of the instantons is much larger than the AdS radius,the 5-dimensional action agrees with the 4-dimensional one. Hence, the 5D and4D gravitational entropies are the same in this limit. We also consider thermalinstantons with an AdS black hole in the bulk. These may be interpreted asdescribing the creation of a hot universe from nothing, or the production ofAdS black holes in the vicinity of a pre-existing inflating brane-world. TheLorentzian evolution of the brane-world after creation is briefly discussed. Anadditional "integration constant" in the Friedmann equation -accompanying aterm which dilutes like radiation- describes the tidal force in the fifthdirection and arises from the mass of a spherical object inside the bulk. Thiscould be a 5-dimensional black hole or a "parallel" brane-world of negativetension concentrical with our brane-world. In the case of thermal solutions,and in the spirit of the $AdS/CFT$ correspondence, one may attribute theadditional term to thermal radiation in the boundary theory. Then, fortemperatures well below the AdS scale, the entropy of this radiation agreeswith the entropy of the black hole in the AdS bulk.
