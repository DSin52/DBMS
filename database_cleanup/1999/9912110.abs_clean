We dispute a recent claim for a nonperturbative nonrenormalisation theoremstating that mass cannot be spontaneously generated in supersymmetric QED. Wealso extend a long-standing perturbative result, namely that the effectivepotential is zero to all orders of perturbation theory, to the nonperturbativeregime for arbitrary numbers of flavours.
