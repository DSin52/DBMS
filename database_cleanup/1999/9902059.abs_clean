The exclusion principle of Maldacena and Strominger is seen to follow fromdeformed Heisenberg algebras associated with the chiral rings of S_N orbifoldCFTs. These deformed algebras are related to quantum groups at roots of unity,and are interpreted as algebras of space-time field creation and annihilationoperators. We also propose, as space-time origin of the stringy exclusionprinciple, that the $ADS_3 \times S^3$ space-time of the associatedsix-dimensional supergravity theory acquires, when quantum effects are takeninto account, a non-commutative structure given by $SU_q(1,1) \times SU_q (2)$.Both remarks imply that finite N effects are captured by quantum groups$SL_q(2)$ with $q= e^{{i \pi \over {N + 1}}}$. This implies that a properframework for the theories in question is given by gravity on a non-commutativespacetime with a q-deformation of field oscillators. An interesting consequenceof this framework is a holographic interpretation for a product structure inthe space of all unitary representations of the non-compact quantum group$SU_q(1,1)$ at roots of unity.
