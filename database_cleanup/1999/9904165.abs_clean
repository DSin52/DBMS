21-25 Sept. 1998, 1 LaTeX file, 16 pagesAn intense study of the relationship between certain quantum theories ofgravity realized on curved backgrounds and suitable gauge theories, has beenoriginated by a remarkable conjecture put forward by Maldacena almost one yearago. Among the possible curved vacua of superstring or M-theory, spaces havingthe form of an Anti-de Sitter space-time times a compact Einstein manifold,have been playing a special role in this correspondence, since the quantumtheory realized on them, in the original formulation of the conjecture, wasidentified with the effective superconformal theory on the world volume ofparallel p-branes set on the boundary of such a space (holography). Animportant step in order to verify such a conjecture and eventually generalizeit, consists in a precise definition of the objects entering both sides of theholographic correspondence. In the most general case indeed it turns out thatimportant features of the field theory on the boundary of the curvedbackground, identified with the quantum theory of gravity in the bulk, areencoded in the dynamics of the coinciding parallel p-branes set on the boundaryof the same space. The study of p-brane dynamics in curved space-times whichare vacua of superstring of M-theory, turns out therefore to be a relevantissue in order to verify the existence of the holographic correspondence. Inthe present paper, besides providing a hopefully elementary introduction toMaldacena's duality,I shall deal in a tentatively self contained way with a particular aspect ofthe problem of p-brane dynamics in Anti-de Sitter space-time, discussing somerecent results.
