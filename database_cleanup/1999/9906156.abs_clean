We demonstrate the reparametrization invariance of perturbatively definedone-dimensional functional integrals up to the three-loop level for a pathintegral of a quantum-mechanical point particle in a box. We exhibit the originof the failure of earlier authors to establish reparametrization invariancewhich led them to introduce, superfluously, a compensating potential dependingon the connection of the coordinate system. We show that problems withinvariance are absent by defining path integrals as the epsilon-> 0 -limit of1+ epsilon -dimensional functional integrals.
