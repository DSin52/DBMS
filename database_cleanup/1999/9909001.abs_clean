I construct solutions to Einstein's equations in 6 dimensions with bulkcosmological constant and intersecting 4-branes. Solutions exist for acontinuous range of 4-brane tension, with long distance gravity localized to a3+1 dimensional Minkowski intersection, provided that the additional tension ofthe intersection satisfies one condition.
