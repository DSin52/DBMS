We study an extreme non-static limit of 2+1-dimensional QED obtained bymaking a dimensional reduction so that all fields are spatially uniform buttime dependent. This dimensional reduction leads to a 0+1-dimensional fieldtheory that inherits many of the features of the 2+1-dimensional model, such asChern-Simons terms, time-reversal violation, an analogue of parity violation,and global U(2) flavor symmetry. At one-loop level, interactions induce aChern-Simons term at finite T with coefficient tanh(beta m_F/2), where m_F isthe fermion mass. The finite temperature two loop self-energies are alsocomputed, and are non-zero for all temperatures.
