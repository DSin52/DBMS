It has been shown in literature that a possible mechanism of mass generationfor gauge fields is through a topological coupling of vector and tensor fields.After integrating over the tensor degrees of freedom, one arrives at aneffective massive theory that, although gauge invariant, is nonlocal. Here wequantize this nonlocal resulting theory both by path integral and canonicalprocedures. This system can be considered as equivalent to one with an infinitenumber of time derivatives and consequently an infinite number of momenta. Thismeans that the use of the canonical formalism deserves some care. We show theconsistency of the formalism we use in the canonical procedure by showing thatthe obtained propagators are the same as those of the (Lagrangian) pathintegral approach. The problem of nonlocality appears in the obtainment of thespectrum of the theory. This fact becomes very transparent when we list theinfinite number of commutators involving the fields and their velocities.
