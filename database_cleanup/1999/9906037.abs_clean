PACS. 11.15.Bt General properties of perturbation theoryThe canonical quantization is performed at a light-front surface for theSU(N) Yang-Mills theory. The Weyl gauge is imposed as a gauge condition. Thesuitable parameterization is chosen for the transverse gauge field componentsin order to have Dirac brackets independent of interactions. The generatingfunctional is defined for the perturbation theory and it is shown to coincidewith its equal-time counterpart.
