We show that on three-dimensional Riemannian manifolds without boundaries andwith trivial first real de Rham cohomology group (and in no other dimensions)partition functions is given by the Ray-Singer torsion of the manifold. On thelevel of interaction with external currents, the equivalence persists providedthere is a fixed relation between the charges and the currents.
