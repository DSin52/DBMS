We consider the general hypermultiplet Low-Energy Effective Action (LEEA)that may appear in quantized, four-dimensional, N=2 supersymmetric, gaugetheories, e.g. in the Coulomb and Higgs branches. Our main purpose is adescription of the exact LEEA of n magnetically charged hypermultiplets. Thehypermultiplet LEEA is given by the N=2 supersymmetric Non-Linear Sigma-Model(NLSM) with a 4n-dimensional hyper-K"ahler metric, subject to non-anomaloussymmetries. Harmonic Superspace (HSS) and the NLSM isometries are very usefulto constrain the hyper-K"ahler geometry of the LEEA. We use N=2 supersymmetricprojections of HSS superfields to N=2 linear (tensor) O(2) and O(4) multipletsin N=2 Projective Superspace (PSS) to deduce the explicit form of the LEEA insome particular cases. As the by-product, a simple new classification of allmulti-monopole moduli space metrics having su(2)_R symmetry is proposed interms of real quartic polynomials of 2n variables, modulo Sp(n)transformations. The 4d hypermultiplet LEEA for n=2 can be encoded in terms ofan elliptic curve.
