The linearized interactions of eleven-dimensional supergravity are obtainedin a manifestly supersymmetric light-cone gauge formalism. These vertices areused to calculate certain one-loop processes involving external gravitini,antisymmetric three-form potentials and gravitons, thereby determining someprotected terms in the effective action of M-theory compactified on atwo-torus.
