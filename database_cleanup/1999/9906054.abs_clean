We compute the conformal anomalies of boundary CFTs for scalar and fermionicfields propagating in AdS spacetime at one-loop. The coefficients arequantized, with values related to the mass-spectra for Kaluza-Kleincompactifications of Supergravity on AdS5xS5 and AdS7xS4. Our approachinterprets the boundary partition function of fields propagating on AdSspacetime in terms of wave-functionals that satisfy the functional Schrodingerequation.
