Recently it was pointed out that in the TeV-scale brane world there is alogical possibility where the electroweak Higgs can be identified with a fourthgeneration slepton. In this paper we address various issues in thisfour-generation TeV-scale Supersymmetric Standard Model with Higgs as aslepton. In particular we discuss how to achieve proton stability bysuppressing the corresponding baryon number violating operators via gauging (adiscrete subgroup of) the baryon number U(1) symmetry. Dimension five leptonnumber violating operators which would result in unacceptably large neutrinomasses can be similarly suppressed via gauging a discrete subgroup of thelepton number U(1) symmetry. In fact, the four generation feature allows for anovel higher dimensional mechanism for generating small Majorana neutrinomasses. We also discuss how to achieve gauge coupling unification, which can beas precise at one loop as in the MSSM, and point out a possible geometricembedding of the corresponding matter content in the brane world context.Finally, we discuss adequate suppression of flavor changing neutral currents inthis model, and also point out a novel possibility for supersymmetry breakingvia a non-zero F-term of the fourth generation lepton superfield.
