Solutions in multidimensional gravity with m p-branes related to Toda-likesystems (of general type) are obtained. These solutions are defined on aproduct of n+1 Ricci-flat spaces M_0 x M_1 x...x M_n and are governed by oneharmonic function on M_0. The solutions are defined up to the solutions ofLaplace and Toda-type equations and correspond to null-geodesics of the(sigma-model) target-space metric. Special solutions relating to A_m Todachains (e.g. with m =1,2) are considered.
