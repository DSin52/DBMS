We consider an exotic `compactification' of spacetime in which there are twoinfinite extra dimensions, using a global string instead of a domain wall. Byhaving a negative cosmological constant we prove the existence of a nonsingularstatic solution using a dynamical systems argument. A nonsingular solution alsoexists in the absence of a cosmological constant with a time-dependent metric.We compare and contrast this solution with the Randall-Sundrum universe and theCohen-Kaplan spacetime, and consider the options of using such a model as arealistic resolution of the hierarchy problem.
