Title: On an Alternative Approach to Gravitation

Comments: 28 pages, 2 figures

Several energy-momentum "tensors" of gravitational field are considered andcompared in the lowest approximation. Each of them together withenergy-momentum tensor of point-like particles satisfies the conservation lawswhen equation of motion of particles are the same as in general relativity. Itis shown that in Newtonian approximation the considered tensors differ one fromthe other in the way their energy density is distributed between energy densityof interection (nonzero only at locations of particles) and energy density ofgravitational field.Starting from Lorentz invariance the Lagrangians for spin-2, mass-0 field areconstracted. They differ only by divergences. From these Lagrangians byBelinfante-Rosenfeld procedure the energy-momentum tensors are build. Only oneof them is suitable for explaining the perihelion shift. This tensor does notcoincide with Weinberg`s one (directly obtainable from Einstein equation).It is noted that phenomenological field-theoretical approach (utilizing onlyvertices and propagators) can lead to modification of theory in the region ofstrong field, where till now no observational data are available.
