We obtain, for a subclass of structure functions characterizing a first classHamiltonian system, recursive relations from which the general form of thelocal symmetry transformations can be constructed in terms of the independentgauge parameters. We apply this to a non-trivial Hamiltonian system involvingtwo primary constraints, as well as two secondary constraints of the Nambu-Gototype.
