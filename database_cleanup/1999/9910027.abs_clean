The approach which relates thermal Green functions to forward scatteringamplitudes of on-shell thermal particles is applied to the calculation of thegluon self-energy, in a class of temporal gauges. We show to all orders that,unlike the case of covariant gauges, the exact self-energy of the gluon istransverse at finite temperature. The leading T^2 and the sub-leading ln(T)contributions are obtained for temperatures T high compared with the externalmomentum. The logarithmic contributions have the same structure as theultraviolet pole terms which occur at zero temperature.
