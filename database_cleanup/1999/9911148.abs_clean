Self-gravitating SU(2) Higgs magnetic monopoles exist up to a critical valueof the ratio of the vector meson mass to the Planck mass, which depends on theHiggs boson mass. At the critical value a critical solution with a degeneratehorizon is reached. As pointed out by Lue and Weinberg, there are two types ofcritical solutions, with a transition at an intermediate Higgs boson mass. Herewe investigate this transition for black holes, and reconsider it for the caseof gravitating monopoles.
