We inspect the excitation energy spectrum of a confining string in terms ofsolitons in an effective field theory model. The spectrum can be characterizedby a spectral function, and twisting and bending of the string is manifested bythe invariance of this function under a duality transformation. Both generalconsiderations and numerical simulations reveal that the spectral function canbe approximated by a simple rational form, which we propose becomes exact inthe Yang-Mills theory.
