In the London limit of the Ginzburg-Landau theory (Abelian Higgs model),vortex dipoles (small vortex loops) are treated as a grand canonical ensemblein the dilute gas approximation. The summation over these objects with the mostgeneral rotation- and translation invariant measure of integration over theirshapes leads to effective sine-Gordon theories of the dual fields. Therepresentations of the partition functions of both grand canonical ensemblesare derived in the form of the integrals over the vortex dipoles and the smallvortex loops, respectively. By virtue of these representations, the bilocalcorrelator of the vortex dipoles (loops) is calculated in the low-energy limit.It is further demonstrated that once the vortex dipoles (loops) are consideredas such an ensemble rather than individual ones, the London limit of theGinzburg-Landau theory (Abelian Higgs model) with external monopoles isequivalent up to the leading order in the inverse UV cutoff to the compact QEDin the corresponding dimension with the charge of Cooper pairs changed due tothe Debye screening.
