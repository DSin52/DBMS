Title: Seiberg-Witten Curves and Integrable Systems

Comments: 17 pages, LaTeX; Talk at the Edinburgh conference "Integrability

Seiberg-Witten and Whitham Equations", 14-19 September 1998This talk gives an introduction into the subject of Seiberg-Witten curves andtheir relation to integrable systems. We discuss some motivations and originsof this relation and consider explicit construction of various families ofSeiberg-Witten curves in terms of corresponding integrable models.
