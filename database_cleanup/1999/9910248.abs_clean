We introduce a method of using the a dual type IIA string to computealpha'-corrections to the moduli space of heterotic string compactifications.In particular we study the hypermultiplet moduli space of a heterotic string ona K3 surface. One application of this machinery shows that type IIB stringscompactified on a Calabi-Yau space suffer from worldsheet instantons, spacetimeinstantons and, in addition, "mixed" instantons which in a sense are bothworldsheet and spacetime. As another application we look at the hyperkaehlerlimit of the moduli space in which the K3 surface becomes an ALE space. This isa variant of the "geometric engineering" method used for vector multipletmoduli space and should be applicable to a wide range of examples. Inparticular we reproduce Sen and Witten's result for the heterotic string on anA1 singularity and a trivial bundle and generalize this to a collection of E8point-like instantons on an ALE space.
