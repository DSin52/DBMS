We study the decoupling effects in N=1 (global) supersymmetric theories withchiral superfields at the one-loop level. The examples of gauge neutral chiralsuperfields with the minimal (renormalizable) as well as non-minimal (non-renormalizable) couplings are considered, and decoupling in gauge theories withU(1) gauge superfields that couple to heavy chiral matter is studied. Wecalculate the one-loop corrected effective Lagrangians that involve lightfields and heavy fields with mass of order M. The elimination of heavy fieldsby equations of motion leads to decoupling effects with terms that growlogarithmically with M. These corrections renormalize light fields andcouplings in the theory (in accordance with the "decoupling theorem"). When thefield theory is an effective theory of the underlying fundamental theory, likesuperstring theory, where the couplings are calculable, such decoupling effectsmodify the low-energy predictions for the effective couplings of light fields.In particular, for the class of string vacua with an "anomalous" U(1) thevacuum restabilization triggers the decoupling effects, which can significantlymodify the low energy predictions for the couplings of the surviving lightfields. We also demonstrate that quantum corrections to the chiral potentialdepending on massive background superfields and corresponding to supergraphswith internal massless lines and external massive lines can also arise at thetwo-loop level.
