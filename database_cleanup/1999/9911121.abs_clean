Starting from the Fierz transform of the two-flavour 't Hooft interaction (afour-fermion Lagrangian with antisymmetric Lorentz tensor interaction termsaugmented by an NJL type Lorentz scalar inetraction responsible for dynamicaltensor Nambu-Goldstone bosons appear provided that the scalar and tensorcouplings stand in the proportion of two to one, which ratio appears naturallyin the Fierz transform of the two-flavour 't Hooft interaction; (2) non-Abelianvector gauge bosons coupled to this system acquire a non-zero mass.Axial-vector fields do not mix with antisymmetric tensor fields, so there is nomass shift there.
