Using a one-loop approximation for the effective potential in the Higgs modelof electrodynamics for a charged scalar field, we argue for the existence of atriple point for the renormalized (running) values of the selfinteraction$\lambda$ and the "charge" g given by $(\lambda_{run}, g^2) = (-{10/9}\pi^2,{4/3}\sqrt{{5/3}}{\pi^2}) \approx(-11, 17)$. Considering thebeta-function as a typical quantity we estimate that the one-loop approximationis valid with accuracy of deviations not more than 30% in the region of the\stackrel{<}{\sim}1.35.$ The phase diagram given in the present papercorresponds to the above-mentioned region of $\alpha, \tilde \alpha$. Under thepoint of view that the Higgs particle is a monopole with a magnetic charge g,the obtained electric fine structure constant turns out to be$\alpha_{crit}\approx{0.18_5}$ by the Dirac relation. This value is very closeto the $\alpha_{crit}^{lat}\approx{0.20}$ which in a U(1) lattice gauge theorycorresponds to the phase transition between the "Coulomb" and confinementphases. Such a result is very encouraging for the idea of an approximate"universality" (regularization independence) of gauge couplings at the phasetransition point. This idea was suggested by the authors in their earlierpapers.
