We exhibit a relationship between the massless $a_2^{(2)}$ integrable quantumfield theory and a certain third-order ordinary differential equation, therebyextending a recent result connecting the massless sine-Gordon model to theSchr\"odinger equation. This forms part of a more general correspondenceinvolving $A_2$-related Bethe ansatz systems and third-order differentialequations. A non-linear integral equation for the generalised spectral problemis derived, and some numerical checks are performed. Duality properties arediscussed, and a simple variant of the nonlinear equation is suggested as acandidate to describe the finite volume ground state energies of minimalconformal field theories perturbed by the operators $\phi_{12}$, $\phi_{21}$and $\phi_{15}$. This is checked against previous results obtained using thethermodynamic Bethe ansatz.
