We consider the integrable XXZ model with the special open boundaryconditions. We perform Quantum Group reduction of this model in roots of unityand use it for the definition Minimal Models of Interable lattice theory. It isshown that after this Quantum Group reduction Sklyanin's transfer-matricessatisfy the closed system of the truncated functional relations. We solve theseequations for the simplest case.
