From the topological properties of a three dimensional vector orderparameter, the topological current of point defects is obtained. One shows thatthe charge of point defects is determined by Hopf indices and Brouwer degrees.The evolution of point defects is also studied. One concludes that there existcrucial cases of branch processes in the evolution of point defects when theJacobian $D(\frac \phi x)=0$.
