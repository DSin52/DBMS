The truncation in the number of single-trace chiral primary operators of$\N=4$ SYM and its conjectured connection with gravity on quantum spacetimesare elaborated. The model of quantum spacetime we use is $AdS^5_q \times S^5_q$for $q$ a root of unity. The quantum sphere is defined as a homogeneous spacewith manifest $SU_q(3)$ symmetry, but as anticipated from the field theorycorrespondence, we show that there is a hidden $SO_q(6)$ symmetry in theconstrution. We also study some properties of quantum space quotients ascandidate models for the quantum spacetime relevant for some $Z_n$ quiverquotients of the $\N=4$ theory which break SUSY to $\N=2$. We find variousqualitative agreements between the proposed models and the properties of thecorresponding finite $N$ gauge theories.
