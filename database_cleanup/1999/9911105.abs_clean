We study a two-dimensional disordered system consisting of Dirac fermionscoupled to a scalar potential. This model is closely related to a more generaldisordered system that has been introduced in conjunction with the integerquantum Hall transition. After disorder averaging, the interaction can bewritten as a marginal osp(2|2) current-current perturbation. The osp(2|2)current-current model in turn can be viewed as the fully renormalized versionof an osp(2|2)^(1) Toda-type system (at the marginal point). We build non-localcharges for the Toda system satisfying the U_q[osp(2|2)^(1)] quantumsuperalgebra. The corresponding quantum group symmetry is used to construct aToda S-matrix for the vector representation. We argue that in the marginal (orrational) limit, this S-matrix gives the exact (Yangian symmetric) physicalS-matrix for the fundamental "solitons" of the osp(2|2) current-current model.
