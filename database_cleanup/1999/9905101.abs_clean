It is known that the quantization of a system defined on a topologicallynon-trivial configuration space is ambiguous in that many inequivalent quantumsystems are possible. This is the case for multiply connected spaces as well asfor coset spaces. Recently, a new framework for these inequivalentquantizations approach has been proposed by McMullan and Tsutsui, which isbased on a generalized Dirac approach. We employ this framework for thequantization of the Yang-Mills theory in the simplest fashion. The resultinginequivalent quantum sectors are labelled by quantized non-dynamicaltopological charges.
