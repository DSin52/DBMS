We investigate the consequence of the energy-momentum conservation law forthe holographic S-matrix from AdS/CFT correspondence. It is shown that theconservation law is not a natural consequence of conformal invariance in thelarge N limit. We predict a new singularity for the four point correlationfunction of a marginal operator. Only the two point scattering amplitude isexplicitly calculated, and the result agrees with what is expected.
