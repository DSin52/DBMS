Univ., Fiz. AstronSolutions, exactly expressed in terms of elementary functions (uniqueLaughlin states), of the correlated motion problem for a pair of 2D-electronsin a constant and uniform magnetic field have been shown to exist for a certainrelation between the magnetic field induction and the electron charge.Arguments that can help to understand the physical meaning of these remarkablemagnetic field values have been provided. The special interest to this problemis justified by the importance of the new state of matter recently observed.
