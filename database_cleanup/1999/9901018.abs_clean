Title: From Threebranes to Large N Gauge Theories

Authors: Igor R. Klebanov

Comments: 20 pages, LaTeX; Based on the talk at Orbis Scientiae '98, Ft.

This is a brief introductory review of the AdS/CFT correspondence and of theideas that led to its formulation. Emphasis is placed on dualities betweenconformal large $N$ gauge theories in 4 dimensions and string backgrounds ofthe form $AdS_5\times X_5$. Attempts to generalize this correspondence toasymptotically free theories are also included.
