An open superstring field theory action has been proposed which does notsuffer from contact term divergences. In this paper, we compute the on-shellfour-point tree amplitude from this action using the Giddings map. Afterincluding contributions from the quartic term in the action, the resultingamplitude agrees with the first-quantized prescription.
