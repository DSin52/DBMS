We show that quantum effects can stabilize a soliton in a model with nosoliton at the classical level. The model has a scalar field chirally coupledto a fermion in 1+1 dimensions. We use a formalism that allows us to calculatethe exact one loop fermion contribution to the effective energy for a spatiallyvarying scalar background. This energy includes the contribution fromcounterterms fixed in the perturbative sector of the theory. The resultingenergy is therefore finite and unambiguous. A variational search then yields afermion number one configuration whose energy is below that of a single freefermion.
