We compare the way one of us got spinors out of fields, which are a prioriantisymmetric tensor fields, to the Dirac-K\"ahler rewriting. Since using ourGrassmann formulation is simple it may be useful in describing theDirac-K\"ahler formulation of spinors and in generalizing it to vector internaldegrees of freedom and to charges. The ``cheat'' concerning the Lorentztransformations for spinors is the same in both cases and is put clearlyforward in the Grassmann formulation. Also the generalizations are clearlypointed out. The discrete symmetries are discussed, in particular theappearance of two kinds of the time-reversal operators as well as theunavoidability of four families.
