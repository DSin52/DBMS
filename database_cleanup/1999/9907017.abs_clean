We directly derive the classical equation of motion, which governs the centreof mass of a test string, from the string action. In a certain case, theequation is basically same as one derived by Papapetrou, Dixon and Wald for atest extended body. We also discuss the force balance using a stringy probeparticle for an exact spinning multi-soliton solution ofEinstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory. It is well known that the force balancecondition yields the saturation of the Bogomol'nyi type bound in the lowestorder. In the present formulation the gyromagnetic ratio of the stringy probeparticle is automatically determined to be $g=2$ which is the same value as thebackground soliton. As a result we can confirm the force balance via thegravitational spin-spin interaction.
