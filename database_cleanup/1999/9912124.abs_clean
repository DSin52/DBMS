Duality in the integrable systems arising in the context of Seiberg-Wittentheory shows that their tau-functions indeed can be seen as generatingfunctions for the mutually Poisson-commuting hamiltonians of the {\em dual}systems. We demonstrate that the $\Theta$-function coefficients of theirexpansion can be expressed entirely in terms of the co-ordinates of theSeiberg-Witten integrable system, being, thus, some set of hamiltonians for adual system.
