It is shown that, under certain conditions, the existence of a Killing spinoron a bosonic background of a supergravity theory implies that the Einsteinequations are also satisfied. As an application of the theorem, we obtain a newblack fivebrane solution of D=11 supergravity, which has $K3\times R$ topologyand preserves 1/4'th supersymmetries of the theory.
