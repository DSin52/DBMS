We discuss the Matrix Model aspect of configurations saturating a fixednumber of fermionic zero modes. This number is independent of the rank of thegauge group and the instanton number. This will allow us to define alarge-$N_c$ limit of the embeddeding of $K$ D-instantons in the Matrix Modeland make contact with the leading term (the measure factor) of the supergravitycomputations of D-instanton effects. We show that the connection between thesetwo approaches is done through the Abelian modes of the Matrix variables.
