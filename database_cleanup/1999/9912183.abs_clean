We describe in detail the techniques needed to compute scattering amplitudesfor colored scalars from the infinite tension limit of bosonic string theory,up to two loops. These techniques apply both to cubic and quartic interactions,and to planar as well as non-planar diagrams. The resulting field theories arenaturally defined in the space-time dimension in which they are renormalizable.With a careful analysis of string moduli space in the Schottky representationwe determine the region of integration for the moduli, which plays a crucialrole in the derivation of the correct combinatorial and color factors for alldiagrams.
