We study the 3D field theory on one D3-brane stretched between (r,s) and(p,q)5-branes. The boundary conditions are determined from the analysis of NS5and D5 charges of the two 5-branes. We carry out the mode expansions for allthe fields and identify the field theory as Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. Weexamine the mass spectrum to determine the conditions for unbrokensupersymmetry (SUSY) in this field theory and compare the results with thosefrom the brane configurations. The spectrum is found to be invariant under theType IIB SL(2,{\bf Z})-transformation. We also discuss the theory with mattersand its S-dual configuration. The result suggests that the equivalence underS-duality may be valid if we include all the higher modes in the theories withmatters. We also find an interesting phenomenon that SUSY enhancement happensin the field theory after dimensional reduction from 3D to 2D.
