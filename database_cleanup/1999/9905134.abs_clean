In this paper we fill a necessary gap in order to realize the explicitcomparison between the Kaluza Klein spectra of supergravity compactified onAdS_4 x X^7 and superconformal field theories living on the world volume ofM2-branes. On the algebraic side we consider the superalgebra Osp(N|4) and westudy the double interpretation of its irreducible representations either assupermultiplets of particle states in the bulk or as conformal superfields onthe boundary. On the lagrangian field theory side we construct, using rheonomyrather than superfield techniques, the generic form of an N=2, d=3 gaugetheory. Indeed the superconformal multiplets are supposed to be compositeoperators in a suitable gauge theory.
