Starting from 2D Euclidean quantum gravity, we show that one recovers 2DLorentzian quantum gravity by removing all baby universes. Using a peelingprocedure to decompose the discrete, triangulated geometries along aone-dimensional path, we explicitly associate with each Euclidean space-time a(generalized) Lorentzian space-time. This motivates a map between the parameterspaces of the two theories, under which their propagators get identified. Intwo dimensions, Lorentzian quantum gravity can therefore be viewed as a``renormalized'' version of Euclidean quantum gravity.
