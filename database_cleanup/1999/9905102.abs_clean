1909-1910It is shown that the modulus of any graded or, more generally, twisted KMSfunctional of a C*-dynamical system is proportional to an ordinary KMS stateand the twist is weakly inner in the corresponding GNS-representation. If thefunctional is invariant under the adjoint action of some asymptotically abelianfamily of automorphisms, then the twist is trivial. As a consequence, suchfunctionals do not exist for supersymmetric C*-dynamical systems. This is incontrast with the situation in compact spaces where super KMS functionals occuras super-Gibbs functionals.
