A longstanding puzzle concerns the calculation of the gluino condensate<{tr\lambda^2\over 16\pi^2}> = c\Lambda^3 in N=1 supersymmetric SU(N) gaugestrong-coupling instanton (SCI) calculations give, instead,c=2[(N-1)!(3N-1)]^{-1/N}. By examining correlators of this condensate inarbitrary multi-instanton sectors, we cast serious doubt on the SCI calculationof <{tr\lambda^2\over 16\pi^2}> by showing that an essential step --- namelycluster decomposition --- is invalid. We also show that the addition of aso-called Kovner-Shifman vacuum (in which <{tr\lambda^2\over 16\pi^2}> = 0)cannot straightforwardly resolve this mismatch.
