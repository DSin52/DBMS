325-337In this talk, based on work done in collaboration with G. Landi and R.JSzabo, I will review how string theory can be considered as a noncommutativegeometry based on an algebra of vertex operators. The spectral triple ofstrings is introduced, and some of the string symmetries, notably target spaceduality, are discussed in this framework.
