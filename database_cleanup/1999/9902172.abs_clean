Title: Fields topology and perturbation theory

Comments: 14 pp., LaTex, no figures. Talk given at XXXIII PINP Winter School,

Gatchina, Febr. 8-12, 1999The fields nonlinear modes quantization scheme is discussed. New form of theperturbation theory achieved by unitary mapping the quantum dynamics in thespace $W_G$ of (action, angle)-type collective variables. It is shown why thetransformed perturbation theory contributions may accumulated exactly on theboundary $\pa W_G$. Abilities of the developed formalism are illustrated byexamples from quantum mechanics and field theory.
