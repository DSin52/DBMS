We study the hybrid formulation of Green-Schwarz superstrings on AdS_3 withNS flux and the boundary N=4 superconformal algebra. We show the equivalencebetween the NSR and GS superstrings by a field redefinition. The boundary N=4superconformal algebra is realized by the free fields of the affine Liesuperalgebra A(1|1)^{(1)}. We also consider the light-cone gauge and obtain theN=4 super-Liouville theory which describes the effective theory of the singlelong string near the singularities of the D1-D5 system.
