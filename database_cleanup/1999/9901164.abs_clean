By carefully analysing the picture-dependence of the BRST cohomology aninfinite set of symmetry charges of the closed N=2 string is identified. Thetransformation laws of the physical vertex operators are shown to coincide withthe linearised non-local symmetries of the Plebanski equation (which is theeffective field theory of the closed N=2 string). Moreover, the correspondingWard identities are powerful enough to allow for a rederivation of the wellknown vanishing theorem for the tree-level correlation functions with more thanthree external legs.
