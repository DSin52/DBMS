Thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations are coupled non-linear integralequations which appear frequently when solving integrable models. Thoseassociated with models with N=2 supersymmetry can be related to differentialequations, among them Painleve III and the Toda hierarchy. In the simplest suchcase the massless limit of these non-linear integral equations can be solved interms of the Airy function. This is the only known closed-form solution ofthermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations, outside of free or classical models. Thisturns out to give the spectral determinant of the Schrodinger equation in alinear potential.
