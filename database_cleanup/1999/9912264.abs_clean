Symposium, Karpacz, Poland, September 21--25, 1999We discuss the dynamics of a superparticle in a superspace whose isometry isgenerated by the superalgebra OSp(1|4) or its central-charge contraction. Extracoordinates of the superspace associated with tensorial central charges areshown to describe spin degrees of freedom of the superparticle, so quantumstates form an infinite tower of (half)-integer helicities. A peculiar featureof the model is that it admits BPS states which preserve 3/4 of target-spacesupersymmetries.
