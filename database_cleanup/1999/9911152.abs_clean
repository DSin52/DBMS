We generalize the local surface counterterm prescription suggested inEinstein gravity for higher derivative (HD) and Weyl gravities. Explicitly, thesurface counterterm is found for three- and five-dimensional HD gravities. As aresult, the gravitational action for asymptotically AdS spaces is finite andgravitational energy-momentum tensor is well-defined. The holographic traceanomaly for d2 and d4 boundary (gauge) QFT dual to above HD gravity iscalculated from gravitational energy-momentum tensor. The calculation of AdSblack hole mass in HD gravity is presented within above prescrition. Thecomparison with the standard prescription (using reference spacetime) is done.
