We consider the problem of creating locally supersymmetric theories insignature (10,2). The most natural algebraic starting point is the F-algebra,which is the de Sitter-type (10,2) extension of the super-Poincare algebra. Wederive the corresponding geometric group curvatures and evaluate thetransformations of the associated gauge fields under the action of aninfinitesimal group element. We then discuss the formation of locallysupersymmetric actions using these quantities. Due to the absence of anyvielbein terms there is no obvious way to define spacetime as such. Inaddition, there is also no way in which we may naturally construct an actionwhich is linear in the twelve dimensional curvatures. We consider theimplications of the simplest possible quadratic theories. We then investigatethe relationship between the twelve dimensional theories and Lorentz signaturetheories in lower dimensions. We argue that in this context the process ofdimensional reduction must be replaced by that of group theoretic contraction.Upon contraction a regular spacetime emerges and we find that the twelvedimensional curvature constraint reduces to an Einstein-type equation in whicha quadratic non-linearity in the Ricci scalar is suppressed by a factor of thesame magnitude as the cosmological constant. Finally, we discuss the degrees offreedom of multi-temporal variables and their relation to ultra-hyperbolic waveequations.
