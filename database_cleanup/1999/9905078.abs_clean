In this note we discuss D-branes on T^4/Z_2 using the boundary statesformalism. Explicit formulas for the untwisted boundary states inherited fromthe underlying T^4 and twisted states corresponding to branes wrappingcollapsed 2-cycles at the orbifold singularities are given. The exact CFTdescription of the orbifold makes it possible to study how the boundary statestransform under R_i -> 1/R_i transformation on all directions of the underlyingT^4. We compare their transformation law with results obtained from worldvolume considerations.
