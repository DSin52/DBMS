We review interactions between certain 7-planes which are composed out ofmutually non-local (p,q) 7-branes and which correspond to specific Kodairasingularities. We discuss in particular how to compute certain moduli-dependentterms in the effective action. These do not only probe the local Chern-Simonsterms on the world-volumina, but also certain global aspects of planeinteractions that can be attributed to ``torsion'' (or \ZZ_N-valued) D-branecharges.
