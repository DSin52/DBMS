We study the generic $p-p^\prime$ system in the presence of constant NS2-form $B_{ij}$ field. We derive properties concerning with thenoncommutativity of D-brane worldvolume, the Green functions and the spectrumof this system. In the zero slope limit, a large number of light states appearas the lowest excitations in appropriate cases. We are able to relate theenergies of the lowest states after the GSO projection with the configurationsof branes at angles. Through analytic continuation, the system is compared withthe branes with relative motion.
