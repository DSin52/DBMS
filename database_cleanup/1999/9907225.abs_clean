Supersymmetry is one of the most plausible and theoretically motivatedframeworks for extending the Standard Model. However, any supersymmetry inNature must be a broken symmetry. Dynamical supersymmetry breaking (DSB) is anattractive idea for incorporating supersymmetry into a successful descriptionof Nature. The study of DSB has recently enjoyed dramatic progress, fueled byadvances in our understanding of the dynamics of supersymmetric field theories.These advances have allowed for direct analysis of DSB in strongly coupledtheories, and for the discovery of new DSB theories, some of which contradictearly criteria for DSB. We review these criteria, emphasizing recentlydiscovered exceptions. We also describe, through many examples, varioustechniques for directly establishing DSB by studying the infrared theory,including both older techniques in regions of weak coupling, and new techniquesin regions of strong coupling. Finally, we present a list of representative DSBmodels, their main properties, and the relations between them.
