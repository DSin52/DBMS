We describe how the presence of the antisymmetric tensor (torsion) on theworld sheet action of string theory renders the size of the target space agauge non invariant quantity. This generalizes the R <--> 1/R symmetry in whichmomenta and windings are exchanged, to the whole O(d,d,Z). The crucial point isthat, with a transformation, it is possible always to have all of the lowesteigenvalues of the Hamiltonian to be momentum modes. We interpret this in theframework of noncommutative geometry, in which algebras take the place of pointspaces, and of the spectral action principle for which the eigenvalues of theDirac operator are the fundamental objects, out of which the theory isconstructed. A quantum observer, in the presence of many low energy eigenvaluesof the Dirac operator (and hence of the Hamiltonian) will always interpretedthe target space of the string theory as effectively uncompactified.
