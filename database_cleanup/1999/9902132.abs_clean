We study conformally invariant boundary conditions that break part of thebulk symmetries. A general theory is developped for those boundary conditionsfor which the preserved subalgebra is the fixed algebra under an abelianorbifold group. We explicitly construct the boundary states and reflectioncoefficients as well as the annulus amplitudes. Integrality of the annuluscoefficients is proven in full generality.
