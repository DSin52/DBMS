The search for intersecting brane solutions in supergravity is a large andprofitable industry. Recently, attention has focused on finding localized formsof known `delocalized' solutions. However, in some cases, a localized versionof the delocalized solution simply does not exist. Instead, localized separatedbranes necessarily delocalize as the separation is removed. This phenomenon isrelated to black hole no-hair theorems, i.e. `baldness.' We continue thediscussion of this effect and describe how it can be understood, in the case ofDirichlet branes, in terms of the corresponding intersection field theory. Whenit occurs, it is associated with the quantum mixing of phases and lack ofsuperselection sectors in low dimensional field theories. We find surprisinglywide agreement between the field theory and supergravity both with respect towhich examples delocalize and with respect to the rate at which this occurs.
