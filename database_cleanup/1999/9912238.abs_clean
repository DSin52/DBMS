The geometric picture of the star-product based on its Fourier representationkernel is utilized in the evaluation of chains of star-products and theintuitive appreciation of their associativity and symmetries. Suchconstructions appear even simpler for a variant asymmetric product, and carrythrough for the standard star-product supersymmetrization.
