We show that a realization of the correspondence AdS_2/CFT_1 for nearextremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in arbitrary dimensionalEinstein-Maxwell gravity exactly reproduces, via Cardy's formula, the deviationof the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy from extremality. We also show that thismechanism is valid for Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes around thedegenerate solution dS_2xS^n. These results reinforce the idea that theBekenstein-Hawking entropy can be derived from symmetry principles.
