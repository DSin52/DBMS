Freed, Harvey, Minasian and Moore have proposed a mechanism to cancel thegravitational anomaly of the M-theory fivebrane coming from diffeomorphismsacting on the normal bundle. This procedure is based on a modification of theconventional M-theory Chern-Simons term. We compactify this space-timeinteraction to the ten-dimensional type IIA theory. We then analyze therelation to the anomaly cancellation mechanism for the type IIA fivebraneproposed by Witten.
