We consider the two-dimensional dilute q-state Potts model on its first orderphase transition surface for 0<q\leq 4. After determining the exact scatteringtheory which describes the scaling limit, we compute the two-kink form factorsof the dilution, thermal and spin operators. They provide an approximation forthe correlation functions whose accuracy is illustrated by evaluating thecentral charge and the scaling dimensions along the tricritical line.
