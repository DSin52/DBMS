We discuss the quantization of the Green-Schwarz string action on $AdS_5\times S^5$. We construct consistent, globally well-defined, gauge fixingchoices for kappa symmetry and worldsheet diffeomorphism invariance. We thenproceed to quantize the theory in a perturbation series in the inverse radiusof curvature, in a background field expansion. We discuss vertex operators andcorrelation functions, and demonstrate agreement with supergravity results inthe appropriate limit.
