In [hep-th/9907222] Hannibal claims to exclude the existence of particle-likestatic axially symmetric non-abelian solutions in SU(2)Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton theory. His argument is based on the asymptoticbehaviour of such solutions. Here we disprove his claim by giving explicitlythe asymptotic form of non-abelian solutions with winding number n=2.
