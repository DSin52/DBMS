The goal of this paper is to give a representation-theoretic interpretationof the sine-Gordon equation. We consider a vertex operator representation ofaffine Kac-Moody algebra \hat{sl_2} on the space of differential operators. Inthis formulation, the tau-function becomes a function of non-commutingvariables. Using the skew Casimir operators, we obtain a hierarchy of equationsin Hirota form that contains sine-Gordon, KdV and mKdV equations and constructtheir soliton solutions.
