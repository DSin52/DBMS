We review the geometrical approach to the description of the dynamics ofsuper-p-branes, Dirichlet branes and the M5-brane, which is based on ageneralization of the elements of surface theory to the description of theembedding of supersurfaces into target superspaces. Being manifestlysupersymmetric in both, the superworldvolume of the brane and the targetsuperspace, this approach unifies the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond and theGreen-Schwarz formulation and provides the fermionic kappa-symmetry of theGreen-Schwarz-type superbrane actions with a clear geometrical meaning ofstandard worldvolume local supersymmetry. We describe the properties of doublysupersymmetric (superembedding) brane actions and show how they are related tothe standard Green-Schwarz formulation. In the second part of the article basicgeometrical grounds of the (super)embedding approach are considered and appliedto the description of the M2-brane and the M5-brane. Various applications ofthe superembedding approach are reviewed.
