International School of Subnuclear Physics, Erice, 29 Aug. - 7 Sep. 1999SystemsIn the framework of the Closed-Time-Path formalism, we show how topologicaldefects may arise in Quantum Field Theory as result of a localized(inhomogeneous) condensation of particles. We demonstrate our approach on twoexamples; kinks in the $2D \lambda \psi^{4}$ theory (both at zero and finitetemperature) and vortices in the complex $4D \lambda \psi^{4} $ theory.
