By means of the heterotic/type IIB duality, we study properties of junctionson backgrounds with a positively charged orientifold seven-plane and D-branes,which are expected to give seven dimensional Sp(r) gauge theories. We give amodified BPS condition for the junctions and show that it reproduces theadjoint representation of the Sp(r) group.
