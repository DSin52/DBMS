We study a certain class of four-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric orientifoldsfor which the world-sheet parity transformation is combined with a complexconjugation in the compact directions. We investigate in detail theorientifolds of the Z_3, Z_4, Z_6 and Z_6' toroidal orbifolds finding solutionsto the tadpole cancellation conditions for all models. Generically, all themassless spectra turn out to be non-chiral.
