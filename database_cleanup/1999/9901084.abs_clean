It is shown, that recently constructed PST Lagrangians for chiralsupergravities follow directly from earlier Kavalov-Mkrtchyan Lagrangians by anAnsatz for the $\theta $ tensor by expressing this in terms of the PST scalar.The susy algebra which included earlier $\alpha$-symmetry in the commutator ofsupersymmetry transformations, is now shown to include both PST symmetries,which arise from the single $\alpha$-symmetry term. The Lagrangian for the5-brane is not described by this correspondence, and probably can be obtainedfrom more general Lagrangians, posessing $\alpha$-symmetry.
