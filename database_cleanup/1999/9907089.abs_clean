at finite temperature and small N in 2+1 dimensionsAuthors: Egor Babaev

Comments: a factor 2 corrected. An extended discussion of similarities and

differences of low-N behavior of the chiral GN model and various models ofsuperconductivity is currently in preparation and will be presented inadditional articleJournal-ref: Phys.Lett. B497 (2001) 323

The chiral Gross-Neveu model is one of the most popular toy models for QCD.In the past, it has been studied in detail in the large-N limit. In this paperwe study its small-N behavior at finite temperature in 2+1 dimensions. We showthat at small N the phase diagram of this model is {\it principally} differentfrom its behavior at $N\to \infty$. We show that for a small number $N$ offermions the model possesses two characteristic temperatures $T_{KT}$ and$T^*$. That is, at small N, along with a quasiordered phase $0<T<T_{KT}$ thesystem possesses a very large region of precursor fluctuations $T_{KT}<T<T^*$which disappear only at a temperature $T^*$, substantially higher than thetemperature $T_{KT}$ of Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.
