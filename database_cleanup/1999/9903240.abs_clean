We describe the Brown-Henneaux asymptotic symmetry of the general black holesin the Chern-Simons gauge theory of the gauge group $SL(2;{\bf R})_L\timesSL(2;{\bf R})_R$. We make it clear that the vector-like subgroup $SL(2; {\bfR})_{L+R}$ plays an essential role in describing the asymptotic symmetryconsistently. We find a quite general black hole solution in the $AdS_3$gravity theory. The solution is specified by an infinite number of conservedquantities which constitute a family of mapping from $S^1$ to the gauge group.The BTZ black hole is one of the simplest case.
