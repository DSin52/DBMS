We start with a new first order gauge non-invariant formulation of massivespin-one theory and map it to a reducible gauge theory viz; abelian$B{\wedge}F$ theory by the Hamiltonian embedding procedure of Batalin, Fradkinand Tyutin(BFT). This equivalence is shown from the equations of motion of theembedded Hamiltonian. We also demonstrate that the original gauge non-invariantmodel and the topologically massive gauge theory can both be obtained bysuitable choice of gauges, from the phase space partition function of theemebedded Hamiltonian, proving their equivalence. Comparison of the first orderformulation with the other known massive spin-one theories is also discussed.
