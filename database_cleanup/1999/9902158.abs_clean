Title: Tachyon Condensation and Graviton Production in Matrix Theory

Authors: H. Awata, S. Hirano and Y. Hyakutake

Comments: 14 pages, LaTeX, Considerable improvements have been made in the

arguments on the effective theory of the membrane - antimembrane system.Accordingly the statement on the mechanism of the tachyon condensation andthe graviton production has been refined. Abstract and References alsocorrectedWe study a membrane -- anti-membrane system in Matrix theory. It in factexhibits the tachyon instability. By suitably representing this configuration,we obtain a (2+1)-dimensional U(2) gauge theory with a 't Hooft's twistedboundary condition. We identify the tachyon field with a certain off-diagonalelement of the gauge fields in this model. Taking into account the boundaryconditions carefully, we can find vortex solutions which saturate theBogomol'nyi-type bound and manifest the tachyon condensation. We show that theycan be interpreted as gravitons in Matrix theory.
