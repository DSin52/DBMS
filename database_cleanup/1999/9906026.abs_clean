A broad class of contour gauges is shown to be determined by admissiblecontractions of the geometrical region considered and a suitable equivalenceclass of curves is defined. In the special case of magnetostatics, the relevantelectromagnetic potentials are directly related to the ponderomotive forces.Schwinger's method of extracting a gauge invariant factor from the fermionpropagator could, it is argued, lead to incorrect results. Dirac brackets ofboth Maxwell and Yang-Mills theories are given for arbitrary admissiblespace-like paths. It is shown how to define a non-abelian flux and localcharges which obey a local charge algebra. Fields associated with the chargesdiffer from the electric fields of the theory by singular topological terms; toavoid this obstruction to the Gauss law it is necessary to exclude a single,gauge fixing curve from the region considered.
