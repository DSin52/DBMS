Journal-ref: Quantum Field Theory

Mitra (Hindustan Publishing Com., New Delhi, 2000)The question of anyons and fractional statistics in field theories in 2+1dimensions with Chern-Simons (CS) term is discussed in some detail. Argumentsare spelled out as to why fractional statistics is only possible in two spacedimensions. This phenomenon is most naturally discussed within the framework offield theories with CS term, hence as a prelude to this discussion I firstdiscuss the various properties of the CS term. In particular its role as agauge field mass term is emphasized. In the presence of the CS term, anyons canappear in two different ways i.e. either as soliton of the corresponding fieldtheory or as a fundamental quanta carrying fractional statistics and bothapproaches are elaborated in some detail.
