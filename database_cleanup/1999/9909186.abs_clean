We construct the retarded Green function and the Hadamard function in theLorentzian (d+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime for the Poincar\'ecoordinate by performing the mode integration directly. We explore thestructure of singularities for the position-space Feynman propagator derivedfrom them. The boundary scaling limits of the bulk Feynman propagator yield thebulk-boundary propagator and the boundary conformal correlation function withan extra factor.
