Title: Metric Fluctuations in Brane Worlds

Authors: M. G. Ivanov and I. V. Volovich

Comments: 6 pages, LaTeX, Missed term in eq.(15) is added, which does not

change the resultRecently a realization of the four-dimensional gravity on a brane infive-dimensional spacetime has been discussed. Randall and Sundrum have shownthat the equation for the longitudinal components of the metric fluctuationsadmit a normalizable zero mode solution, which has been interpreted as thelocalized gravity on the brane. We point out that the equation for thetransverse components of the metric fluctuations has a solutions which is notlocalized on the brane. This indicates that probably the effective theory isunstable or, in other words, actually it is not four-dimensional butfive-dimensional. Perhaps a modification of the proposal by using matter fieldscan lead to the trapping of gravity to the brane.
