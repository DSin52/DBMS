Issues related with microcausality violation and continuum limit in thecontext of (1+1) dimensional scalar field theory in discretized light-conequantization (DLCQ) are addressed in parallel with discretized equal timequantization (DETQ) and the fact that Lorentz invariance and microcausality arerestored if one can take the continuum limit properly is emphasized. In thefree case, it is shown with numerical evidence that the continuum results canbe reproduced from DLCQ results for the Pauli-Jordan function and the real partof Feynman propagator. The contributions coming from $k^+$ near zero region inthese cases are found to be very small in contrast to the common belief that$k^+=0$ is an accumulation point. In the interacting case, aspects related tothe continuum limit of DLCQ results in perturbation theory are discussed.
