We give a unified analysis of four-dimensional elliptic models with N=2supersymmetry and a simple gauge group, and their relation to M-theory.Explicit calculations of the Seiberg-Witten curves and the resultingone-instanton prepotential are presented. The remarkable regularities thatemerge are emphasized. In addition, we calculate the prepotential in theCoulomb phase of the (asymptotically-free) Sp(2N) gauge theory with N_ffundamental hypermultiplets of arbitrary mass.
