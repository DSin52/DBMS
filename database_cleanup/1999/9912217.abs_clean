Following the general principles of noncommutative geometry, it is possibleto define a metric on the space of pure states of the noncommutative algebragenerated by the coordinates. This metric generalizes the usual Riemannian one.We investigate some general properties of this metric in the finite commutativecase which corresponds to a metric on a finite set, and also give some examplesof computations in both commutative and noncommutative cases.
