Various structural properties of the space of symmetry breaking boundaryconditions that preserve an orbifold subalgebra are established. To each suchboundary condition we associate its automorphism type. It is shown thatcorrelation functions in the presence of such boundary conditions areexpressible in terms of twisted boundary blocks which obey twisted Wardidentities. The subset of boundary conditions that share the same automorphismtype is controlled by a classifying algebra, whose structure constants areshown to be traces on spaces of chiral blocks. T-duality on boundary conditionsis not a one-to-one map in general. These structures are illustrated in anumber of examples. Several applications, including the construction of non-BPSboundary conditions in string theory, are exhibited.
