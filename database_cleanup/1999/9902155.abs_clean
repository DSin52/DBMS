We derive a solution of type IIB supergravity which is asymptotic to AdS_5 xS^5, has SO(6) symmetry, and exhibits some of the features expected ofgeometries dual to confining gauge theories. At the linearized level, thesolution differs from pure AdS_5 x S^5 only by a dilaton profile. It has anaked singularity in the interior. Wilson loops follow area law behavior, andthere is a mass gap. We suggest a field theory interpretation in which allmatter fields of N=4 gauge theory acquire a mass and the infrared theory isconfining.
