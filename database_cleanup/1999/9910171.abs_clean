It is shown that the Born-Infeld-type modification of the quadraticYang-Mills action suggested by the superstring theory gives rise to classicalparticle-like solutions prohibited in the standard Yang-Mills theory. Thisbecomes possible due to the scale invariance breaking by the Born-Infeldnon-linearity. New classical glueballs are sphaleronic in nature and exhibit astriking similarity with the Bartnik-McKinnon solutions of the Yang-Millstheory coupled to gravity.
