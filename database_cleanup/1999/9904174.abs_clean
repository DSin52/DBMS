A static, spherically symmetric and purely magnetic solution of theEinstein-Yang-Mills-Dilaton theory, found previously by numerical integrationis shown to obey a system of first order Bogomol'nyi equations. As common forsuch equations, there is a tight relation to supersymmetry, in the present caseto the N=4 gauged SU(2)$\times$SU(2) supergravity of Freedman and Schwarz.Specifically, the dilaton potential of the latter can be avoided by choosingone of the two gauge coupling constants to be imaginary. It is argued that thiscorresponds to a hitherto unknown N=4 gauged SU(2)$\times$SU(1,1) supergravityin four Euclidean dimensions leading to Bogomol'nyi equations withasymptotically flat solutions.
