We show that the degeneracy of topological solitons in the gauged O(3)non-linear sigma model with Chern-Simons term may be removed by chosing aself-interaction potential with symmetry - breaking minima. The topologicalsolitons in the model has energy,charge,flux and angular momentum quantised ineach topological sector.
