We investigate the formation of dynamical gaugino condensates andsupersymmetry breaking in the compactifications of Horava-Witten theory withperturbative nonstandard embeddings. Specific models are considered where theunderlying massless charged states of the condensing sector are determined bythe spectra of $Z_2 \times Z_2 $ and $Z_4 $ orbifolds with nonstandardembeddings. We find among them viable examples where gaugino condensation istriggered on the wall with the weakest gauge coupling at $M_{GUT} $. In allthese cases the magnitude of the condensate formed is below the energy scalesat which extra dimensions are resolved, and so justifies the analysis ofcondensation in an effective 4-dimensional framework. We make some commentsconcerning the size of the largest extra dimension in the models considered. Wediscuss racetrack scenarios in the framework of perturbative nonstandardembeddings.
