We formulate a superspace field theory which is shown to be equivalent to the$c-\bar{c}$ symmetric BRS/Anti-BRS invariant Yang-Mills action. The theory usesa 6-dimensional superspace and one OSp(3,1|2) vector multiplet of unconstrainedsuperfields. We establish a superspace WT identity and show that theformulation has an asymptotic OSp(3,1|2) invariance as the gauge parameter goesto infinity. We give a physical interpretation of this asymptotic OSp(3,1|2)invariance as a symmetry transformation among the longitudinal/time likedegrees of freedom of $A_\mu$ and the ghost degrees of freedom.
