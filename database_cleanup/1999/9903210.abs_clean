We derive the complete $(curvature)^2$ terms of effective D-brane actions,for arbitrary ambient geometries and world-volume embeddings, at lowest order(disk-level) in the string-loop expansion. These terms reproduce the$o(\alpha'^2)$ corrections to string scattering amplitudes, and are consistentwith duality conjectures. In the particular case of the D3-brane with trivialnormal bundle, considerations of $SL(2,\IZ)$ invariance lead to a complete sumof D-instanton corrections for both the parity-conserving and theparity-violating parts of the effective action. These corrections are requiredfor the cancellation of the modular anomalies of massless modes, and areconsistent with the absence of chiral anomalies in the intersection domain ofpairs of D-branes. We also show that the parity-conserving part of thenon-perturbative R^2 action follows from a one-loop quantum calculation in thesix-dimensional world-volume of the M5-brane compactified on a two-torus.
