We establish the existence of the topological vector supersymmetry in the sixdimensional topological field theory for two-form fields introduced by Baulieuand West. We investigate the relation of these symmetries to the twistoperation for the (2,0) supersymmetry and comment on their resemblance to theanalogous symmetries in topological Yang-Mills theory.
