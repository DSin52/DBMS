We study the relation between the D8-branes wrapped on an orientable compactmanifold $W$ in a massive Type IIA supergravity background and the M9-braneswrapped on a compact manifold $Z$ in a massive d=11 supergravity backgroundfrom the K-theoretic point of view. By speculating on the use of thedimensional reduction to relate the two theories in different dimensions and byinterpreting the D8-brane charges as elements of $K_0 (C(W))$ and the(inequivalent classes of) spaces of gauge fields on the M9-branes as theelements of $K_0(C(Z)\times_{\bar{k}^*}G}$ a connection between charges andgauge fields is argued to exist. This connection is realized as a map betweenthe corresponding algebraic K-theory groups.
