We propose that Little String Theories in six dimensions are quasilocalquantum field theories. Such field theories obey a modification of Wightmanaxioms which allows Wightman functions (i.e. vacuum expectation values ofproducts of fundamental fields) to grow exponentially in momentum space.Wightman functions of quasilocal fields in x-space violate microlocality atshort distances. With additional assumptions about the ultraviolet behavior ofquasilocal fields, one can define approximately local observables associated tobig enough compact regions. The minimum size of such a region can beinterpreted as the minimum distance which observables can probe. We argue thatfor Little String Theories this distance is of order {\sqrt N}/M_s.
