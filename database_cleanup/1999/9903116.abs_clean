The quantized magnetic flux $\Phi=-4\pi N\sk, N=0,\pm1,...$ ofnon-topological vortices in the non-relativistic Chern-Simons theory is relatedto the topological degree of the $S^2\to S^2$ mapping defined by lifting theproblem to the Riemann spheres. Regular solutions with finite degree only arisefor rational functions, whose topological degree, $N$, is the commun number oftheir zeros and poles on the Riemann sphere, also called their algebraic order.
