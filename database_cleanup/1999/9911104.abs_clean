We study junctions of supersymmetric domain walls in N=1 supergravitytheories in four dimensions, coupled to a chiral superfield with quarticsuperpotential having $Z_3$ symmetry. After deriving a BPS equation of thedomain wall junction, we consider a stable hexagonal configuration of networkof brane junctions, which are only approximately locally BPS. We propose amodel for a mechanism of supersymmetry breaking without loss of stability,where a messenger for the SUSY breaking comes from the neighboring anti-BPSjunction world, propagating along the domain walls connection them.
