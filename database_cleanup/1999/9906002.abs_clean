The pahse transition from instanton-dominated quantum tunneling regime tosphaleron-dominated classical crossover regime is explored in (1+1)-dimensionalscalar field theory when spatial coordinate is compactified. It is shown thatthe type of sphaleron transition is critically dependent on the circumferenceof the spatial coordinate.
