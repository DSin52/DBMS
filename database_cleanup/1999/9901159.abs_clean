We argue that M2 brane is realized as a topological soliton on a coincidentpair of M5 and anti-M5 branes, as the two five-branes annihilate each other.Topology and quantum numbers of this world-volume soliton are discussed in somedetail, and its formation is explained qualitatively. It follows from acompactification that a D4-anti-D4 pair annihilate and produce type IIfundamental strings. The phenomenon is best described as the confinement of aworld-volume U(1) gauge field on D4-anti-D4, where the confined electric fluxstring is identified as the fundamental string. This generalizes to otherD$p$-anti-D$p$ systems, and solves a puzzle recently pointed out by Witten.
