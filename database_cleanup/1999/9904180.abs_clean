By using the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, we study dynamical symmetry breakingin spaces with constant negative curvature. We show that the physical reasonfor zero value of critical coupling value $g_c = 0$ in these spaces isconnected with the effective reduction of dimension of spacetime $1 + D \to 1 +1$ in the infrared region, which takes place for any dimension $1 + D$. Sincethe Laplace-Beltrami operator has a gap in spaces with constant negativecurvature, such an effective reduction for scalar fields is absent and thereare not problems with radiative corrections due to scalar fields. Therefore,dynamical symmetry breaking with the effective reduction of the dimension ofspacetime for fermions in the infrared region is consistent with theMermin-Wagner-Coleman theorem, which forbids spontaneous symmetry breaking in(1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime.
