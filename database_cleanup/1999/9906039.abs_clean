We compute threshold effects to gauge couplings in four-dimensional $Z_N$orientifold models of type I strings with ${\cal N}=2$ and ${\cal N}=1$supersymmetry, and study their dependence on the geometric moduli. We alsocompute the tree-level (disk) couplings of the open sector gauge fields to thetwisted closed string moduli of the orbifold in various models and study theireffects and that of the one-loop threshold corrections on gauge couplingunification. We interpret the results from the (supergravity) effective theorypoint of view and comment on the conjectured heterotic-type I duality
