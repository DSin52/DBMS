In this paper we discuss two approaches to anomaly-free quantization of atwo-dimensional string. The first approach is based on the canonical Diracprescription of quantization of degenerated systems. At the second approach we"weaken" the Dirac quantization conditions requiring the solving of first classconstraints only in the sense of mean values. At both approaches there are nostates with the indefinite metrics.
