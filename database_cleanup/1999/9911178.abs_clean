Title: New non-diagonal solutions to the $a_n^{(1)}$ boundary Yang-Baxter

equationAuthors: G. M. Gandenberger

Comments: 6 pages

Extending previous work on $a_2^{(1)}$, we present a set of reflectionmatrices, which are explicit solutions to the $a_n^{(1)}$ boundary Yang-Baxterequation. Unlike solutions found previously these are multiplet-changing$K$-matrices, and could therefore be used as soliton reflection matrices foraffine Toda field theories on the half-line.
