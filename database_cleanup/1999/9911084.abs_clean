We give a simple proof of the known S-duality of Heterotic String theorycompactified on a T^6. Using this S-duality we calculate the tensions for aclass of BPS 5-branes in Heterotic String theory on a circle. One of these, theKaluza-Klein monopole, becomes tensionless when the radius of the circle isequal to the string length. We study the question of stability of the HeteroticNS5-brane with a transverse circle. For large radii the NS5-brane is absolutelystable. However for small radii it is only marginally stable. We also study themoduli space of 2 Kaluza-Klein monopoles and show that it is equal to themoduli space of a Heterotic A_1 singularity.
