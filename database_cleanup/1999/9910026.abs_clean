We study the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations for a one-parameter quantumfield theory recently introduced by V.A.Fateev. The presence of chemicalpotentials produces a kink condensate that modifies the excitation spectrum.For some combinations of the chemical potentials an additional gapless modeappears. Various energy scales emerge in the problem. An effective fieldtheory, describing the low energy excitations, is also introduced.
