It has been conjectured that at a stationary point of the tachyon potentialfor the D-brane of bosonic string theory, the negative energy density exactlycancels the D-brane tension. We evaluate this tachyon potential by off-shellcalculations in open string field theory. Surprisingly, the condensation of thetachyon mode alone into the stationary point of its cubic potential is found tocancel about 70% of the D-brane tension. Keeping relevant scalars up to fourmass levels above the tachyon, the energy density at the shifted stationarypoint cancels 99% of the D-brane tension.
