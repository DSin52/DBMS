We discuss the fate of certain tachyonic closed string theories from twoperspectives. In both cases our approach involves studying directlyconfigurations with finite negative tree-level cosmological constant. Closedstring analogues of orientifolds, which carry negative tension, are argued torepresent the minima of the tachyon potential in some cases. In other cases, wemake use of the fact, noted in the early string theory literature, that stringscan propagate on spaces of subcritical dimension at the expense of introducinga tree-level cosmological constant. The form of the tachyon vertex operator inthese cases makes it clear that a subcritical-dimension theory results fromtachyon condensation. Using results of Kutasov, we argue that in someScherk-Schwarz models, for finely-tuned tachyon condensates, a minimal modelCFT times a subcritical dimension theory results. In some instances, these twosets of ideas may be related by duality.
