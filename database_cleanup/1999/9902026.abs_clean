Two classes of Conformal Field Theories have been proposed to describe thecharacterized by the symmetry U(1)xSU(m)_1 and the W_{1+\infty} minimal modelswith central charge c=m. In spite of having the same spectrum of edgeexcitations, they manifest differences in the degeneracy of the states and inthe quantum statistics, which call for a more detailed comparison between them.Here, we describe their detailed relation for the general case, c=m and extendthe methods previously published for c < 4. Specifically, we obtain thereduction in the number of degrees of freedom from the multi-component Abeliantheory to the minimal models by decomposing the characters of the U(1)xSU(m)_1representations into those of the c=m W_{1+\infty} minimal models. Furthermore,we find the Hamiltonian whose renormalization group flow interpolates betweenthe two models, having the W_{1+\infty} minimal models as infra-red fixedpoint.
