We present two new solutions of Romans' massive type IIA supergravityNSNS 2-form and the RR 7-form. They can be interpreted respectively as theintersection of a fundamental string and a D8-brane over a D0-brane and theintersection of a D6-brane with a D8-brane over a NSNS5-brane. The D8-branemanifests itself through the mass parameter and in the massless limit onerecovers the standard fundamental string and D6-brane solutions. Although thesesolutions do not have the usual form for BPS bound states at threshold and eachof them involves 3 objects, both of them preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetries.
