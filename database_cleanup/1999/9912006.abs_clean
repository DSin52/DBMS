Instantons in massless theories do not carry over to massive theories due toDerrick's theorem. This theorem can, however, be circumvented, if a constraintthat restricts the scale of the instanton is imposed on the theory. Constrainedinstantons are considered in four dimensions in phi^4 theory and SU(2)Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. In each of these theories a calculational sceme is setup and solved in the lowest few orders in the mass parameter in such a way thatthe need for a constraint is exhibited clearly. Constrained instantons areshown to exist as finite action solutions of the field equations withexponential fall off only for specific constraints that are unique in lowestorder in the mass parameter in question.
