A compactification of 11-dimensional supergravity with two (or more) walls isconsidered. The whole tower of massive Kaluza-Klein modes along the fifthdimension is taken into account. With the sources on the walls, an explicitcomposition in terms of Kaluza-Klein modes of massless gravitino (in thesupersymmetry preserving case) and massive gravitino (in the supersymmetrybreaking case) is obtained. The super-Higgs effect is discussed in detail.
