We compute the leading-order back-reaction to dilaton-driven inflation, dueto graviton, dilaton and gauge-boson production. The one-loop effect turns outto be non-vanishing (unlike the case for pure de-Sitter and for power-lawinflation), to be of relative order $\ell_P^2H^2(t)$, and to have the correctsign for favouring the exit to a FRW phase.
