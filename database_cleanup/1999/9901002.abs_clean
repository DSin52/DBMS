We show that the minimally coupled massless scalar wave equation in thebackground of an six-dimensional extremal dyonic string (or D1-D5 braneintersection) is exactly solvable, in terms of Mathieu functions. Using thisfact, we calculate absorption probabilities for these scalar waves, and presentthe explicit results for the first few low energy corrections to theleading-order expressions. For a specific tuning of the dyonic charges one canreach a domain where the low energy absorption probability goes to zero withinverse powers of the logarithm of the energy. This is a dividing domainbetween the regime where the low energy absorption probability approaches zerowith positive powers of energy and the regime where the probability is anoscillatory function of the logarithm of the energy. By the conjectured AdS/CFTcorrespondence, these results shed novel light on the strongly coupledtwo-dimensional field theory away from its infrared conformally invariant fixedpoint (the strongly coupled ``non-critical'' string).
