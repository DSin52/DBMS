We apply a boost-invariant similarity renormalization group procedure to alight-front Hamiltonian of a scalar field phi of bare mass mu and interactionterm g phi^3 in 6 dimensions using 3rd order perturbative expansion in powersof the coupling constant g. The initial Hamiltonian is regulated using momentumdependent factors that approach 1 when a cutoff parameter Delta tends toinfinity. The similarity flow of corresponding effective Hamiltonians isintegrated analytically and two counterterms depending on Delta are obtained ininteraction vertex requires a Delta-independent counterterm that contains aboost invariant function of momenta of particles participating in theinteraction. The resulting effective Hamiltonians contain a running couplingconstant that exhibits asymptotic freedom. The evolution of the coupling withchanging width of effective Hamiltonians agrees with results obtained usingFeynman diagrams and dimensional regularization when one identifies therenormalization scale with the width. The effective light-front Schroedingerequation is equally valid in a whole class of moving frames of referenceincluding the infinite momentum frame. Therefore, the calculation describedhere provides an interesting pattern one can attempt to follow in the case ofHamiltonians applicable in particle physics.
