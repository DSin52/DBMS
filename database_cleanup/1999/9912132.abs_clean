We provide an algebraic classification of all supersymmetric domain wallsolutions of maximal gauged supergravity in four and seven dimensions, in thepresence of non-trivial scalar fields in the coset SL(8,R)/SO(8) andSL(5,R)/SO(5) respectively. These solutions satisfy first-order equations,which can be obtained using the method of Bogomol'nyi. From aneleven-dimensional point of view they correspond to various continuousdistributions of M2- and M5-branes. The Christoffel-Schwarz transformation andthe uniformization of the associated algebraic curves are used in order todetermine the Schrodinger potential for the scalar and graviton fluctuations onthe corresponding backgrounds. In many cases we explicitly solve theSchrodinger problem by employing techniques of supersymmetric quantummechanics. The analysis is parallel to the construction of domain walls offive-dimensional gauged supergravity, with scalar fields in the cosetSL(6,R)/SO(6), using algebraic curves or continuous distributions of D3-branesin ten dimensions. In seven dimensions, in particular, our classification ofdomain walls is complete for the full scalar sector of gauged supergravity. Wealso discuss some general aspects of D-dimensional gravity coupled to scalarfields in the coset SL(N,R)/SO(N).
