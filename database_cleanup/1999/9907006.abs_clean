We investigate domain-wall/quantum field theory correspondences in variousdimensions. Our general analysis does not only cover the well-studied cases inten and eleven dimensions but also enables us to discuss new cases like a TypeI/Heterotic 6-brane in ten dimensions and domain wall dualities in lower thanten dimensions. The examples we discuss include `d-branes' in six dimensionspreserving 8 supersymmetries and extreme black holes in various dimensions. Inthe latter case we construct the quantum mechanics Hamiltonian and discussseveral limits.
