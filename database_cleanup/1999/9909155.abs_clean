Recently it was proposed that matching of global charges induced in vacuum byslowly varying, topologically non-trivial scalar fields provides consistencyconditions analogous to the 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions. We studymatching of induced charges in supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theories with quantummodified moduli space. We find that the Wess-Zumino term should be present inthe low energy theory in order that these consistency conditions are satisfied.We calculate the lowest homotopy groups of the quantum moduli space, and showthat there are no obstructions to the existence of the Wess-Zumino term atarbitrary N. The explicit expression for this term is given. It is shown thatneither vortices nor topological solitons exist in the model. The case ofsoftly broken supersymmetry is considered as well. We find that the possibilityof global flavor symmetric vacuum is strongly disfavored.
