The Newtonian character of gauge theories on a light front requires that thelongitudinal momentum P^+, which plays the role of Newtonian mass, beconserved. This requirement conflicts with the standard definition of the forcebetween two sources in terms of the minimal energy of quantum gauge fields inthe presence of a quark and anti-quark pinned to points separated by a distanceR. We propose that, on a light front, the force be defined by minimizing theenergy of gauge fields in the presence of a quark and an anti-quark pinned tolines (1-branes) oriented in the longitudinal direction singled out by thelight front and separated by a transverse distance R. Such sources will have alimited 1+1 dimensional dynamics. We study this proposal for weak couplinggauge theories by showing how it leads to the Coulomb force law. For QCD wealso show how asymptotic freedom emerges by evaluating the S-matrix through oneloop for the scattering of a particle in the N_c representation of colorSU(N_c) on a 1-brane by a particle in the \bar N_c representation of color on aparallel 1-brane separated from the first by a distance R<<1/Lambda_{QCD}.Potential applications to the problem of confinement on a light front arediscussed.
