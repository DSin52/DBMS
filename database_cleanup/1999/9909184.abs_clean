We obtain new solutions where a string and a pp-wave lie in the commonworldvolume directions of the non-standard intersection of two gauge 5-branesin the heterotic string. The two 5-branes are supported by independent SU(2)Yang-Mills instantons in their respective (non-overlapping) transverse spaces.We present a detailed study of the unbroken supersymmetry, focusing especiallyon a comparison between a direct construction of Killing spinors and a countingof zero eigenvalues in the annticommutator of supercharges. The results are inagreement with some previous arguments, to the effect that additional zeroeigenvalues resulting from a ``fine-tuning'' between positive-energy andnegative-energy contributions from different components in an intersection arespurious, and should not be taken as an indication of supersymmetryenhancements. These observations have a general applicability that goes beyondthe specific example we study in this paper.
