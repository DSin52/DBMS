We extend a recently proposed non-local version of Coleman's equivalencebetween the Thirring and sine-Gordon models to the case in which the originalfermion fields interact with fixed impurities. We explain how our results canbe used in the context of one-dimensional strongly correlated systems (the socalled Tomonaga-Luttinger model) to study the dependence of the charge-densityoscillations on the range of the fermionic interactions.
