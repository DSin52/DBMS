We show that the recently formulated Equivalence Principle (EP) implies abasic cocycle condition both in Euclidean and Minkowski spaces, which holds inany dimension. This condition, that in one-dimension is sufficient to fix theSchwarzian equation [6], implies a fundamental higher dimensional Moebiusinvariance which in turn univocally fixes the quantum version of theHamilton-Jacobi equation. This holds also in the relativistic case, so that weobtain both the time-dependent Schroedinger equation and the Klein-Gordonequation in any dimension. We then show that the EP implies that masses arerelated by maps induced by the coordinate transformations connecting differentphysical systems. Furthermore, we show that the minimal coupling prescription,and therefore gauge invariance, arises quite naturally in implementing the EP.Finally, we show that there is an antisymmetric two-tensor which underliesQuantum Mechanics and sheds new light on the nature of the QuantumHamilton-Jacobi equation.
