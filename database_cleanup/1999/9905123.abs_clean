In order to obtain a consistent formulation of octonionic quantum mechanics(OQM), we introduce left-right barred operators. Such operators enable us tofind the translation rules between octonionic numbers and $8\times 8$ realmatrices (a translation is also given for $4\times 4$ complex matrices). Theuse of a complex geometry allows us to overcome the hermiticity problem anddefine an appropriate momentum operator within OQM. As an application of ourresults, we develop an octonionic relativistic free wave equation, linear inthe derivatives. Even if the wave functions are only one-component we show thatfour independent solutions, corresponding to those of the Dirac equation,exist.
