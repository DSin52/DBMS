Title: Duality Symmetry in the Schwarz-Sen Model

Authors: H. O. Girotti (Instituto de Fisica - UFRGS)

Comments: 11 pages, latex, to be published in "Trends in Theoretical Physics

II", edited by H. Falomir, R. E. Gamboa Saravi and F. Schaposnik, AIPConference Proceedings 484, 1999The duality symmetric but not manifestly covariant action proposed bySchwarz-Sen is canonically quantized in the Coulomb gauge. The resulting theoryturns out to be, nevertheless, relativistically invariant. It is shown,afterwards, that the Schwarz-Sen model naturally emerges when duality isimplemented as a local symmetry of sourceless electrodynamics. This implies inthe equivalence of these theories at the quantum level.
