We investigate a string/M theoretic realization of the varying speed of lightscenario. We consider a 3+1 dimensional probe-brane universe in the backgroundof a black hole in the bulk formed by a stack of branes, in the spirit ofKiritsis (hep-th/9906206). We generalize the dynamics of the system at hand byincluding rotation and Hubble damping of the bulk space-time and show that thismay lead to a mechanism to stabilize the brane-universe and hence fix the speedof light at late times.
