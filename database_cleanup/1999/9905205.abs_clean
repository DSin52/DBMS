Thermodynamics of d=4, N=4 supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory is studiedwith particular attention on perturbative expansion at weak `t Hooft couplingregime and interpolation to strong coupling regime thereof. Non-ideal gaseffect to free-energy is calculated and found that leading- andnext-to-leading-order corrections contribute with relative opposite sign. Padeapproximant method is adopted to improve fixed-order, perturbative series andis found to decrease free-energy monotonically as `t Hooft coupling parameteris increased. This may be regarded as an indication of smooth interpolation ofthermodynamics between weak and strong `t Hooft coupling regimes, as suggestedby Maldacena's AdS/CFT correspondence.
