We study D=4, N=1, type IIA orientifold with orbifold group $Z_N$ and $Z_N\times Z_M$. We calculate one-loop vacuum amplitudes for Klein bottle, cylinderand Mobius strip and extract the tadpole divergences. We find that the tadpolecancellation conditions thus obtained are satisfied by the $Z_4$, $Z_8$,$Z'_8$, $Z'_{12}$ orientifolds while there is no solution for $Z_3$, $Z_7$,$Z_6$, $Z'_6$, $Z_{12}$. The $Z_4 \times Z_4$ type IIA orientifold is alsoconstructed by introducing four different configurations of 6-branes. We argueabout perturbative versus non-perturbative orientifold vacua under T- dualitybetween the type IIA and the type IIB $Z_N$ orientifolds in four dimensions.
