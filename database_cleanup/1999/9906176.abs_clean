Title: Conformally Invariant Sigma Models on Anti de Sitter Spaces,

Chern-Simons p-branes and W GeometryComments: Revised Tex file, 21 pages. An addition of the recent work on

p-branes from Moyal Deformation of Generalized Yang Mills (hep-th/9908115)has been addedConformally invariant sigma models in $D=2n$ dimensions with targetnon-compact O(2n,1) groups are studied. It is shown that despite thenon-compact nature of the O(2n,1) groups, the classical action and Hamiltonianare positive definite. Instanton field configurations are found to correspondgeometrically to conformal ``stereographic'' mappings of $R^{2n}$ into theEuclidean signature $AdS_{2n}$ spaces. Zaikov's relationship between Self Dual$p$-branes and Chern-Simons $p'$-branes, provided $p=p'+1$ and the embedding$D=p+1$-dimensional manifold is Euclidean, is elaborated further. Branesactions can be obtained also from a Moyal deformation quantization ofGeneralized Yang Mills Theories. Using this procedure, we show how fourdimensional SU(N) YM theories contain Chern-Simons membranes and hadronic bagsin the large $N$ limit. Since Chern-Simons $p'$-branes have an underlyinginfinite dimensional algebra containing $W_{1+\infty}$, as shown by Zaikov, wediscuss the importance that $W$ geometry should have in the final formulationof $M$ theory.
