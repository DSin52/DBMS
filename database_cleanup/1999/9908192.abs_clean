We examine the behaviour of Killing spinors on AdS5 under various discretesymmetries of the spacetime. In this way we discover a number of supersymmetricorbifolds, reproducing the known ones and adding a few novel ones to the list.These orbifolds break the SO(4,2) invariance of AdS5 down to subgroups. We alsomake some comments on the non-compact Stiefel manifold W{4,2}.
