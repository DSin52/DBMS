Majorana-Weyl spacetimes offer a rich algebraic setup and new types ofspace-time dualities besides those discussed by Hull. The trialityautomorphisms of Spin(8) act non-trivially on Majorana-Weyl representations andMajorana-Weyl spacetimes with different signatures. In particular relationsexist among the (1+9)-(5+5)-(9+1) spacetimes, as well as their transversecoordinates spacetimes (0+8)-(4+4)-(8+0). Larger dimensional spacetimes such as(2+10)-(6+6)-(10+2) also show dualities induced by triality. A precisethree-languages dictionary is here given. It furnishes the exact translationsamong, e.g., the three different versions (one in each signature) of theten-dimensional N=1 superstring and superYang-Mills theories. Their dualitiesclose the six-element permutation group S_3. Bilinear and trilinear invariantsallowing to formulate theories with a manifest space-time symmetry areconstructed.
