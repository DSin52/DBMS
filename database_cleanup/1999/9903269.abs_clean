We investigate maximal gauged supergravity in seven dimensions and some ofits solitonic solutions. By focusing on a truncation of the gauged SO(5)R-symmetry group to its U(1)^2 Cartan subgroup, we construct general two chargeblack holes that are asymptotically anti-de Sitter. We demonstrate that 1- and2-charge black holes preserve 1/2 and 1/4 of the supersymmetries respectively.Additionally, we examine the odd-dimensional self-duality equation governingthe three-form potential transforming as the 5 of SO(5), and provide someinsight on the construction of membrane solutions in anti-de Sitterbackgrounds.
