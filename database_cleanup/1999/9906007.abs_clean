Four different types of free energies are computed by both thermodynamicalBethe Ansatz (TBA) techniques and by weak coupling perturbation theory in anintegrable one-parameter deformation of the O(4) principal chiral sigma-model(with SU(2)xU(1) symmetry). The model exhibits both `fermionic' and `bosonic'type free energies and in all cases the perturbative and the TBA results are inperfect agreement, strongly supporting the correctness of the proposed Smatrix. The mass gap is also computed in terms of the Lambda parameters of themodified minimal substraction scheme and a lattice regularized version of themodel.
