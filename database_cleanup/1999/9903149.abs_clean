Motivated by the search for a space-time supersymmetric extension of the N=2string, we construct a particle model which, upon quantization, describes(abelian) self-dual super Yang-Mills in 2+2 dimensions. The local symmetries ofthe theory are shown to involve both world-line supersymmetry and kappasymmetry.
