We investigate the supersymmetric index of N=2,3 SU(n) supersymmetricYang-Mills Chern Simons theories at level k by using the brane configurationwith a (p,q)5-brane. We can explain that the supersymmetry breaking occurs whenk<n in terms of the s-rule for Type IIB branes. The supersymmetric indexcoincides with the number of the possible supersymmetric brane configurations.We also discuss a construction of a family of theories which have the samesupersymmetric index.
