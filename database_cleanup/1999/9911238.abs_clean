We discuss the full nonlinear Kaluza-Klein (KK) reduction of the originalformulation of d=11 supergravity on $AdS_7\times S_4$ to gauged maximal ({\calN}=4) supergravity in 7 dimensions. We derive the full nonlinear embedding ofthe d=7 fields in the d=11 fields (``the ansatz'') and check the consistency ofthe ansatz by deriving the d=7 supersymmetry laws from the d=11 transformationlaws in the various sectors. The ansatz itself is nonpolynomial but the finald=7 results are polynomial. The correct d=7 scalar potential is obtained. Formost of our results the explicit form of the matrix U connecting the d=7gravitino to the Killing spinor is not needed, but we derive the equation whichU has to satisfy and present a solution. Requiring that the expression $\deltaF=d\delta A$ in d=11 can be written as $\delta d(fields in d=7)$, we find theansatz for the 4-form F. It satisfies the Bianchi identities. The correspondingansatz for A modifies the geometrical proposal by Freed et al. by including d=7scalar fields. A first order formulation for the three index photon$A_{\Lambda\Pi\Sigma}$ in d=11 is needed to obtain the d=7 supersymmetry lawsand the action for the nonabelian selfdual antisymmetric tensor field$S_{\alpha\beta\gamma,A}$. Therefore selfduality in odd dimensions originatesfrom a first order formalism in higher dimensions.
