Title: Supergravity Solution for M5-brane Intersection

Authors: Sergey A. Cherkis

Comments: 13 pages, LaTeX, references and some comments added

Supergravity solution describing two intersecting M5-branes is presented. Thebranes are fixed in the relative transverse directions and are delocalizedalong the overall transverse ones. The intersection can be smoothed, so thatthe M5-branes present one holomorphic cycle. We also obtain a solutioncorresponding to an M5-brane on a holomorphic cycle of multi-Taub-NUT space.All these solutions preserve 1/4 of supersymmetry.
