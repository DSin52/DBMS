We test the renormalization of Wilson operators and the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt gauge in the case when the sides of the loop are parallel to the n,n* vectors used in the M-L gauge. Graphs which in the Feynman gauge are free ofultra-violet divergences, in the M-L gauge show double divergences and singledivergences with non-local Si and Ci functions. These non-local functionscancel out when we add all graphs together and the constraints of gaugeinvariance are satisfied. In Appendix C we briefly discuss the problems of theM-L gauge for loops containing spacelike lines.
