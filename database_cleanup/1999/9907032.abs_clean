A generalized second law in string cosmology accounts for geometric andquantum entropy in addition to ordinary sources of entropy. The proposedgeneralized second law forbids singular string cosmologies, under certainconditions, and forces a graceful exit transition from dilaton-driven inflationby bounding curvature and dilaton kinetic energy.
