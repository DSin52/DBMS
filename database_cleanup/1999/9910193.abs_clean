Title: U-duality of Born-Infeld Theory

Authors: Gysbert Zwart

Comments: 6 pages, talk presented at QFTHEP'99, Moscow, May 27 - June 2, 1999

and at the TMR-meeting `Quantum aspects of gauge theories, supersymmetry andunification', Paris ENS, September 1-7, 1999String theory compactified on a three-torus possesses an SL(5,Z) U-dualitygroup. We investigate the realisation of this symmetry on the Born-Infeldtheory on a three-brane, and discuss a U-duality covariant formulation of theBPS sector of the theory where the rank of the gauge group is treated on anequal footing with the fluxes.
