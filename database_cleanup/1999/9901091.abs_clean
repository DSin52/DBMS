We use toric geometry to investigate the recently proposed relation between aset of D3 branes at a generalized conifold singularity and type IIAconfigurations of D4 branes stretched between a number of relatively rotatedNS5 branes. In particular we investigate how various resolutions of thesingularity corresponds to moving the NS branes and how Seiberg's duality isrealized when two relatively rotated NS-branes are interchanged.
