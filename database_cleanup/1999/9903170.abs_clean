We construct dual Lagrangians for $G/H$ models in two space-time dimensionsfor arbitrary Lie groups $G$ and $H\subset G$. Our approach does not requirechoosing coordinates on $G/H$, and allows for a natural generalization toLie-Poisson duality. For the case where the target metric on $G/H$ is inducedfrom the invariant metric on $G$, the dual system is a gauged Higgs model, witha nonconstant metric and a coupling to an antisymmetric tensor. The dynamicsfor the gauge connection is governed by a $BF$-term. Lie-Poisson duality isrelevant once we allow for a more general class of target metrics, as well asfor couplings to an antisymmetric tensor, in the primary theory. Then the dualtheory is written on a group $\tilde G$ dual to $G$, and the gauge group $H$(which, in general, is not a subgroup of $\tilde G$) acts nonlinearly on$\tilde G$. The dual system therefore gives a nonlinear realization of a gaugetheory. All dual descriptions are shown to be canonically equivalent to thecorresponding primary descriptions, at least at the level of the currentalgebra.
