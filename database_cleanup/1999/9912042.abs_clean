Title: Conformal Blocks and Correlators in WZNW Model. I. Genus Zero

Comments: LaTeX, 25pp

We consider the free field approach or bosonization technique for theWess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model with arbitrary Kac-Moody algebra on Riemannsurface of genus zero. This subject was much studied previously, and the papercan be partially taken as a brief survey. The way to obtain well-knownSchechtman-Varchenko solutions of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations ascertain correlators in free chiral theory is revisited. This gives rise tosimple description of space of the WZNW conformal blocks. The general $N$-pointcorrelators of the model are constructed from the conformal blocks usingnon-chiral action for free fields perturbed by exactly marginal terms. Themethod involved generalizes the Dotsenko-Fateev prescription for minimalmodels. As a consequence of this construction we obtain new integralidentities.
