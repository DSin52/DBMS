We consider the effects of anomalies on the supersymmetry-breaking parametersin supergravity theories. We construct a supersymmetric expression for theanomaly-induced terms in the 1PI effective action; we use this result tocompute the complete one-loop formula for the anomaly-induced gaugino mass. Themass receives contributions from the super-Weyl, Kahler, and sigma-modelanomalies of the supergravity theory. We point out that the anomaly-mediatedgaugino mass can be affected by local counterterms that cancel thesuper-Weyl-Kahler anomaly. This implies that the gaugino mass cannot bepredicted unless the full high-energy theory is known.
