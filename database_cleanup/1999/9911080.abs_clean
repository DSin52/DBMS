Title: Duality and Strings, Space and Time

Authors: C. M. Hull

Comments: Contribution to Proceedings of "Mathematical Sciences beyond the

Second Millenium" held at the Center for Advanced Mathematical Sciences,Beirut. 15 pages, Latex, sprocl.styDuality symmetries in M--theory and string theory are reviewed, withparticular emphasis on the way in which string winding modes and brane wrappingmodes can lead to new spatial dimensions. Brane world-volumes wrapping aroundLorentzian tori can give rise to extra time dimensions and in this waydualities can change the number of time dimensions as well as the number ofspace dimensions. This suggests that brane wrapping modes and spacetime momentashould be on an equal footing and M--theory should not be formulated in aspacetime of definite dimension or signature.
