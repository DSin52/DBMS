We discuss a formalism for solving (2+1) AdS gravity on Riemann surfaces. Inthe torus case the equations of motion are solved by two functions f and g,solutions of two independent O(2,1) sigma models, which are distinct becausetheir first integrals contain a different time dependent phase factor. We thenshow that with the gauge choice $k = \sqrt{\Lambda}/ tg (2 \sqrt{\Lambda}t)$the same couple of first integrals indeed solves exactly the Einstein equationsfor every Riemann surface. The $X^A=X^A(x^mu)$ polydromic mapping which extendsthe standard immersion of a constant curvature three-dimensional surface in aflat four-dimensional space to the case of external point sources or topology,is calculable with a simple algebraic formula in terms only of the two sigmamodel solutions f and g. A trivial time translation of this formalism allows usto introduce a new method which is suitable to study the scattering of blackholes in (2+1) AdS gravity.
