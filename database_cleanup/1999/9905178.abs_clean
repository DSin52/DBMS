If the vacuum is passive for uniformly accelerated observers in anti-deSitter space-time (i.e. cannot be used by them to operate a "perpetuummobile"), they will (a) register a universal value of the Hawking-Unruhtemperature, (b) discover a TCP symmetry, and (c) find that observables incomplementary wedge-shaped regions are commensurable (local) in the vacuumstate. These results are model independent and hold in any theory which iscompatible with some weak notion of space-time localization.
