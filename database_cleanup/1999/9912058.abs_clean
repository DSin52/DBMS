The AdS/CFT correspondence implies that the effective action of certainstrongly coupled large $N$ gauge theories satisfy the Hamilton-Jacobi equationof 5d gravity. Using an analogy with the relativistic point particle, Iconstruct a low energy effective action that includes the Einstein action andobeys a Callan-Symanzik-type RG-flow equation. It follows from the flowequation that under quite general conditions the Einstein equations admit aflat space-time solution, but other solutions with non-zero cosmologicalconstant are also allowed. I discuss the geometric interpretation of thisresult in the context of warped compactifications.
