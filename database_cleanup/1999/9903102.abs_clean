We construct the model with light-like world-lines for the massive 4Dspinning particles and 3D anyons. It is obtained via the formal bosonization ofpseudoclassical model for the massive Dirac particle with subsequent reductionto the light-like curves. The peculiarity of the light-like trajectoriesproduced due to the Zitterbewegung is explained from the viewpoint of reductionand reparametrization invariance.
