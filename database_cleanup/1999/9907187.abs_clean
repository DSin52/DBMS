We investigate the properties of non-linear electromagnetism based on theBorn-Infeld Lagrangian in multi-dimensional theories of Kaluza-Klein type. Weconsider flat space-time solutions only, which means that the space-time metricis constant, and the only supplementary variable is the dilaton field, ascalar. We show that in the case of Kaluza-Klein theory, the Born-InfeldLagrangian describes an interesting interaction between the electromagnetic andscalar fields, whose propagation properties are modified in a non-trivialmanner.
