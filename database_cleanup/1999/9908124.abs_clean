We calculate a renormalized Hamiltonian for pure-glue QCD and diagonalize it.The renormalization procedure is designed to produce a Hamiltonian that willyield physical states that rapidly converge in an expansion in free-particleFock-space sectors. To make this possible, we use light-front field theory toisolate vacuum effects, and we place a smooth cutoff on the Hamiltonian toforce its free-state matrix elements to quickly decrease as the difference ofthe free masses of the states increases. The cutoff violates a number ofphysical principles of light-front pure-glue QCD, including Lorentz covarianceand gauge covariance. This means that the operators in the Hamiltonian are notrequired to respect these physical principles. However, by requiring theHamiltonian to produce cutoff-independent physical quantities and by requiringit to respect the unviolated physical principles of pure-glue QCD, we are ableto derive recursion relations that define the Hamiltonian to all orders inperturbation theory in terms of the running coupling. We approximate allphysical states as two-gluon states, and use our recursion relations tocalculate to second order the part of the Hamiltonian that is required tocompute the spectrum. We diagonalize the Hamiltonian using basis-functionexpansions for the gluons' color, spin, and momentum degrees of freedom. Weexamine the sensitivity of our results to the cutoff and use them to analyzethe nonperturbative scale dependence of the coupling. We investigate the effectof the dynamical rotational symmetry of light-front field theory on therotational degeneracies of the spectrum and compare the spectrum to recentlattice results. Finally, we examine our wave functions and analyze the varioussources of error in our calculation.
