This brief report presents analytical solutions to the equations of motion ofa null string. The background spacetime is a magnetically charged Kaluza-Kleinblack hole. The string coordinates are expanded with the world-sheet velocityof light as an expansion parameter. It is shown that the zeroth order solutionscan be expressed in terms of elementary functions in an appropriate largedistance approximation. In addition, a class of exact solutions correspondingto the Pollard-Gross-Perry-Sorkin monopole case is also obtained.
