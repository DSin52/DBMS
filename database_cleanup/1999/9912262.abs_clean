We show that symmetries are preserved exactly along the (Wilsonian)renormalization group flow, though the IR cutoff deforms concrete forms of thetransformations. For a gauge theory the cutoff dependent Ward-Takahashiread off the renormalized BRS transformation from the master equation. TheMaxwell theory is studied explicitly to see how it works. The renormalized BRStransformation becomes non-local but keeps off-shell nilpotency. Our formalismis applicable for a generic global symmetry. The master equation considered forthe chiral symmetry provides us with the continuum analog of theGinsparg-Wilson relation and the L{\" u}scher's symmetry.
