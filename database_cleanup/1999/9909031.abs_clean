We describe an extension of the nonlinear integral equation (NLIE) method toVirasoro minimal models perturbed by the relevant operator $\Phi_{(1,3)$. Alongthe way, we also complete our previous studies of the finite volume spectrum ofsine-Gordon theory by considering the attractive regime and more specifically,breather states. For the minimal models, we examine the states with zerotopological charge in detail, and give numerical comparison to TBA and TCSresults. We think that the evidence presented strongly supports the validity ofthe NLIE description of perturbed minimal models.
