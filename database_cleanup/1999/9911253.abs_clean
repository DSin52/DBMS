We describe a simple method for generating new string solutions for which thebrane worldvolume is a curved space. As a starting point we use solutions withNS-NS charges combined with 2-d CFT's representing different parts ofspace-time. We illustrate our method with many examples, some of which areassociated with conformally invariant sigma models. Using U-duality, we alsoobtain supergravity solutions with RR charges which can be interpreted asD-branes with non-trivial worldvolume geometry. In particular, we discuss thecase of a D5-brane wrapped on AdS_3 x S^3, a solution interpolating betweenAdS_3 x S^3 x R^5 and AdS_3 x S^3 x S^3 x R, and a D3-brane wrapped over S^3 xR or AdS_2 x S^2. Another class of solutions we discuss involves NS5-branesintersecting over a 3-space and NS5-branes intersecting over a line. Thesesolutions are similar to D7-brane or cosmic string backgrounds.
