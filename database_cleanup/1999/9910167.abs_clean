The renormalization of the periodic potential is investigated in theframework of the Euclidean one-component scalar field theory by means of thedifferential RG approach. Some known results about the sine-Gordon model arerecovered in an extremely simple manner. There are two phases, an ordered onewith asymptotical freedom and a disordered one where the model isnon-renormalizable and trivial. The order parameter of the periodicity, thewinding number, indicates spontaneous symmetry breaking in the ordered phasewhere the fundamental group symmetry is broken and the solitons acquiredynamical stability. It is argued that the periodicity and the convexity are sostrong constraints on the effective potential that it always becomes flat. Thisflattening is reproduced by integrating out the RG equation.
