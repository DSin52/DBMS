We construct D-brane states on an asymmetric orbifold of type IIA on afour-torus, which is modded out by T-duality. We find explicit boundary statescharged under the twisted sector gauge fields. Unlike other cases, the boundarystates involve an explicit dependence on the twist fields. The D-brane spectrumis consistent with the model being equivalent to type IIA on a four-torus.
