Paper'', Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Path Integralsfrom peV to TeV, August 25--29, 1998, Florence, Italy. Edited byR.Casalbuoni, R.Giachetti, V.Tognetti, R.Vaia and P.Verrucchi (WorldScientific, Singapore, 1999) p.137-141The notion of the integral over the anticommuting Grassmann variables isapplied to analyze the fermionic structure of the 2D Ising model with quenchedsite dilution. In the $N$-replica scheme, the model is explicitly reformulatedas a theory of interacting fermions on a lattice. For weak dilution, thecontinuum-limit approximation implies the log-log singularity in the specificheat near $T_c$.
