1012-1035We perform the dual transformation of the Yang-Mills theory in d=3 dimensionsusing the Wilson action on the cubic lattice. The dual lattice is made oftetrahedra triangulating a 3-dimensional curved manifold but embedded into aflat 6-dimensional space (for the SU(2) gauge group). In the continuum limitthe theory can be reformulated in terms of 6-component gauge-invariant scalarfields having the meaning of the external coordinates of the dual latticesites. These 6-component fields induce a metric and a curvature of the3-dimensional dual colour space. The Yang-Mills theory can be identicallyrewritten as a quantum gravity theory with the Einstein-Hilbert action butpurely imaginary Newton constant, plus a homogeneous `matter' term.Interestingly, the theory can be formulated in a gauge-invariant and local formwithout explicit colour degrees of freedom.
