We study the interaction of two D-particles in the space-time of the shockwave. We first write the amplitude in string theory and find that, at largedistances from the shock-wave source, the O(v^4) term in the relative velocityv is an \alpha'-independent function of the interbrane separation b. Theamplitude is therefore that of supergravity--for large b, only closed-stringmassless modes contribute. We then show how the same result is obtained in thematrix model (at small b) by setting up the formulation of the dimensionallyreduced super Yang-Mills theory in the curved background of the shock wave.
