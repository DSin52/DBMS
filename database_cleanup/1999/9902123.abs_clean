We consider the AdS/CFT correspondence for theories with a Chern-Simons termin three dimensions. We find the two-point functions of the boundary conformalfield theories for the Proca-Chern-Simons theory and the Self-Dual model. Wealso discuss particular limits where we find the two-point function of theboundary conformal field theory for the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. Inparticular our results are consistent with the equivalence between theMaxwell-Chern-Simons theory and the Self-Dual model.
