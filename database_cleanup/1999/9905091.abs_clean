We study the scattering of three gravitons in M-atrix theory at finite N.With a specific choice of the background we obtain the complete result up totwo loops. The contributions from three-body forces agree with the onespresented in recent papers. We extend the calculation and evaluate the two-bodyexchanges as well. Such terms, somewhat difficult to isolate and compute, hadbeen neglected so far in the existing literature. We show that the result wehave obtained from M-atrix theory precisely matches the result fromone-particle reducible tree diagrams in eleven-dimensional supergravity .
