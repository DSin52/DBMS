``Supersymmetries and Quantum Symmetries'', held at JINR, Dubna, July 26-31,1999. A minor changeAccording to the holographic principle all information in the bulk of a spaceis coded at its border. We will check this statement in three situationsinvolving the AdS/CFT correspondence. There is a well known equivalence betweenthe Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory and the self-dual model in 3 dimensions whenthe parameters of both theories are related in a given way. We will show thatwhen this relation holds the corresponding CFT's at the border are the same.Then we will study scalar fields. There are two quantum theories for the scalarfield in AdS space. The usual prescription of the AdS/CFT correspondence whichtakes Dirichlet boundary conditions at the border corresponds to one of thequantum theories. We will show that changing boundary conditions will allow usto get the other quantum theory. Finally we consider an Abelian gauge theory inAdS. We will show that the corresponding CFT is independent of the gauge choiceand that the gauge dependence stays only in the contact terms at the border.
