Found is a general form of static solutions in exactly solvable models of 2ddilaton gravity at finite temperature. We reveal a possibility for theexistence of everywhere regular solutions including black holes, semi-infinitethroats and star-like configurations. In particular, we consider theBose-Parker-Peleg (BPP) model which possesses a semi-infinite throat andanalyze it at finite temperature. We also suggest generalization of the BPPmodel in which the appearance of semi-infinite throat has a generic characterand does not need special fine tuning between parameters of the solution.
