Title: Partial algebraization and a q-deformed harmonic oscillator

Authors: Abilio De Freitas and Sebastian Salamo

Comments: 19 pages, Latex

From the algebraic treatment of the quasi-solvable systems, and aq-deformation of the associated $su(2)$ algebra, we obtain exact solutions forthe q-deformed Schrodinger equation with a 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonicoscillator potential.
