We present a calculation of the matrix theory 2-loop effective action for aD0-brane in the background of the recently discussed D0-D6 bound stateconfiguration. The effective DBI action of a D0-brane probe in the backgroundof the corresponding 4-dimensional non-supersymmetric black hole solution tolow-energy type IIA string theory compactified on a 6-torus is known to agreewith the matrix theory calculation at 1-loop order, in the limit in which theratio of the D0-brane to the D6-brane charges carried by the black hole islarge. Agreement at 2-loop between the supergravity description and aconjectured nonabelian BDI effective superYang-Mills description has also beenrecently reported. However, we find uncanceled ultraviolet divergences in ourdirect matrix theory calculation of the 2-loop effective action. This isconsistent with the expected nondecoupling of massive open string states fromthe 6-brane.
