Comments: 13 pages, 6 figures, uses the macro psbox.tex, replaced by a revised

version to be published in Phys. Rev. D. The section on the Seiberg-Wittenequations, which contained a sign error, has been removed. This removal leadsto further issues which will appear in a future publicationJournal-ref: Phys.Rev. D60 (1999) 125001

We investigate zero modes of the Dirac operator coupled to an Abelian gaugefield in three dimensions. We find that the existence of a certain class ofzero modes is related to a specific topological property precisely when therequirement of finite Chern--Simons action is imposed.
