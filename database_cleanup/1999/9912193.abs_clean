We argue that the familiar gauge hierarchy between the fundamental Planckscale M_{Pl} and the electroweak scale M_{W}, can be naturally explained inhigher dimensional theories with relatively large radii (R_c > 1/M_{Pl}) extradimensions. In particular, we show that it is possible that the electroweakHiggs mass at high energies is of the order of M_{Pl}, but radiativecorrections drive it to an infrared stable fixed-point $\sim M_{W}$ at lowenergies thus inducing a large hierarchy without any fine tuning of parameters.
