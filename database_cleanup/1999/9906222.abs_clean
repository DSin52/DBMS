In this note we discuss dynamical mechanisms for brane stabilization in thebrane world context. In particular, we consider supersymmetry preserving branestabilization, and also brane stabilization accompanied by supersymmetrybreaking. These mechanisms are realized in some four dimensional N=1supersymmetric orientifold models. For illustrative purposes we consider twoexplicit orientifold models previously constructed in hep-th/9806008. In bothof these models branes are stabilized at a finite distance from the orientifoldplanes. In the first model brane stabilization occurs via supersymmetrypreserving non-perturbative gauge dynamics. In the second model supersymmetryis dynamically broken, and brane stabilization is due to an interplay betweennon-perturbatively generated superpotential and tree-level Kahler potential.
