A formula constituting the non-Abelian Stokes theorem for general semi-simplecompact gauge groups is presented. The formula involves a path integral over agroup space and is applicable to Wilson loop variables irrespective of thetopology of loops. Some simple expressions analogous to the 't Hooft tensor ofa magnetic monopole are given for the 2-form of interest. A special property inthe case of the fundamental representation of the group SU(N) is pointed out.
