We study the embedding of D(8-p)-branes in the background geometry ofparallel Dp-branes for $p\le 6$. The D(8-p)-brane is extended along thedirections orthogonal to the Dp-branes of the background. The D(8-p)-braneconfiguration is determined by its Dirac-Born-Infeld plus Wess-Zumino-Wittenaction. We find a BPS condition which solves the equation of motion. Theanalytical solution of the BPS equation for the near-horizon and asymptoticallyflat geometries is given. The embeddings we obtain represent branes joined bytubes. By analyzing the energy of these tubes we conclude that they can beregarded as bundles of fundamental strings. Our solution provides an explicitrealization of the Hanany-Witten effect. When $p=6$ the solution of the BPSequation must be considered separately and, in general, the embeddings of theD2-branes do not admit the same interpretation as in the $p<6$ case.
