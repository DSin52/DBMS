We investigate the rotating D3-brane solution with maximum number of angularmomentum parameters. After determining the angular velocities, Hawkingtemperature, ADM mass and entropy, we use this geometry to construct generalthree-parameter models of non-supersymmetric pure SU(N) Yang-Mills theories in2+1 dimensions. We calculate glueball masses in the WKB approximation andobtain closed analytic expressions for generic values of the parameters. Wealso determine the masses of Kaluza--Klein states associated with internalparts of the ten-dimensional metric and investigate the parameter region wheresome of these states are decoupled. To leading order in 1/\lambda and 1/N(where \lambda is the 't Hooft coupling) we find a global U(1)^3 symmetry andstates with masses comparable to glueball masses, which have no counterpart inthe more familiar (finite \lambda, N) Yang-Mills theories.
