A systematic algorithm to derive superpropagators in the case of eitherexplicitly or spontaneously broken supersymmetric three-dimensional theories ispresented. We discuss how the explicit breaking terms that are introduced attree-level induce 1-loop radiative corrections to the effective action. We alsopoint out that the renormalisation effects and the breaking-inducing-breakingmechanism become more immediate whenever we adopt the shifted superpropagatorsdiscussed in this letter.
