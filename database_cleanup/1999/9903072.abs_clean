We consider the simplest bosonic-type S-matrix which is usually regarded asunphysical due to the complex values of the finite volume ground state energy.While a standard quantum field theory interpretation of such a scatteringtheory is precluded, we argue that the physical situation described by thisS-matrix is of a massive Ising model perturbed by a particular set ofirrelevant operators. The presence of these operators drastically affects thestability of the original vacuum of the massive Ising model and its ultravioletproperties.
