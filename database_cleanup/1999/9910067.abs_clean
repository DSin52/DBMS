How to gauge fix $\k$-symmetry for the super 0-brane action on $AdS_2 \timesS^2$ in Killing gauge properly is discussed in order to find the superconformalmechanics which describes super 0-brane probes moving on $AdS_2 \times S^2$.The dependence on the coordinate frame for the proper Killing gauge isconsidered and the subtleties of gauge-fixing $\k$-symmetry in Killing gaugeare analysed explicitly. It is found that the Killing gauge works indeedwithout the imcompatibility if the magnetic charge of the super 0-brane isnonzero.
