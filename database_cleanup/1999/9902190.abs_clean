We discuss the thermodynamics of a gas of black holes in five-dimensionalanti-de-Sitter (AdS) space, showing that they are described by a van der Waalsequation of state. Motivated by the Maldacena conjecture, we relate the energydensity and pressure of this non-ideal AdS black-hole gas to those offour-dimensional gauge theory in the unconfined phase. We find that the energydensity rises rapidly above the deconfinement transition temperature, whilstthe pressure rises more slowly towards its asymptotic high-temperature value,in qualitative agreement with lattice simulations.
