(1999) 116-123In the old papers of Ogievetskii and Polubarinov, Hayashi, Kalb and Ramondthe {\it notoph} concept, the longitudinal field originated from theantisymmetric tensor, has been proposed. In our work we analyze the theory ofantisymmetric tensor field of the second rank from a viewpoint of thenormalization problem. We obtain the 4-potentials and field strengths, whichcoincide with those which have been previously obtained in the works ofAhluwalia and Dvoeglazov. Slightly modifying the Bargmann-Wigner field functionwe conclude that it is possible to describe explicitly the degrees of freedomof the photon and of the {\it notoph} by the same equation. The physicalconsequences, such as parity properties of field functions, are discussed,relations to the previous works are discussed as well. Moreover, we deriveequations for {\it symmetric} tensor of the second rank on the basis of thesame modification of the Bargmann-Wigner formalism, i.e. the equations whichdescribe dynamical behavior of the fields of maximal spin 2.
