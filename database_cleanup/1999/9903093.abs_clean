We study local mirror symmetry on non-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds (conifoldtype of singularities) in the presence of D3 brane probes. Using anintermediate brane setup of NS 5-branes `probed' by D4 resp. D5 branes, we canexplicitly T-dualize three isometry directions to relate a non-compactCalabi-Yau manifold to its local mirror. The intermediate brane setup is theone that is best suited to read off the gauge theory on the probe. Bothintervals and boxes of NS 5-branes appear as brane setups. Going from one tothe other is equivalent to performing a conifold transition in the dualgeometry. One result of our investigation is that the brane box rules as theyhave been discussed so far should be generalized. Our new rules do not needdiagonal fields localized at the intersection. The old rules reappear onbaryonic branches of the theory.
