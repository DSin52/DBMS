We analyze the structure of singularities, Mordell-Weil lattices and torsionsof a rational elliptic surface using string junctions in the background of 127-branes. The classification of the Mordell-Weil lattices due to Oguiso-Shiodais reproduced in terms of the junction lattice. In this analysis an importantrole played by the global structure of the surface is observed. It is thenfound that the torsions in the Mordell-Weil group are generated by the fractionof loop junctions which represent the imaginary roots of the loop algebra $\hatE_9$. From the structure of the Mordell-Weil lattice we find 7-braneconfigurations which support non-BPS junctions carrying conserved Abeliancharges.
