New string dynamics is formulated on the basis of the extended set ofsupergauge constraints including not only supergauge Virasoro conditions butalso nilpotent supercurrent constraints . This approach arises from a naturalgeneralization of the classical operator many-string vertices. The formulationof this model leads to three two-dimensional surfaces for description of hadronstrings. It gives some dynamical generalization of Chan-Paton factor for stringamplitudes in terms of operator vertices. Supersymmetry on the 2-d worldsurface is present but ten-dimensional supersymmetry is absent.In this approach two-dimensional fermion string fields make it possible togive a unified description of hadron and lepton degrees of freedom and of itsdynamics. This model allows to solve the problem of elimination of the mostpart of parity twins in the baryon spectrum.One-loop (and many-loops perhaps) amplitudes in this model are finite due tothe extended set of supergauge constraints and to the significant excess of thetotal number of fermion two-dimensional fields over the number of boson 2-dfields.
