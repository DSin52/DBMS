It has been demonstrated in a recent paper (Mod.Phys.Lett. A13, 1265 (1998);hep-th/9902020) that the existence of a non-thermodynamic arrow of time at theatomic level is a fundamental requirement for conservation of energy inmatter-radiation interaction. Since the universe consists of two things onlyearlier result, particles and antiparticles must necessarily move in oppositedirections in time. Our result further indicates that the CPT theorem can beextended to cover non-local gauge fields.
