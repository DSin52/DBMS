256-276We propose and develop a new calculus for local variational differentialoperators. The main difference of the new formalism with the canonicaldifferential calculus is that the image of higher order operators on localfunctionals does not contain indefinite quantities like $\delta(0)$. We applythis formalism to BV formulation of general gauge field theory and to itsSp(2)-symmetric generalization. Its relation to a quasiclassical expansion isalso discussed.
