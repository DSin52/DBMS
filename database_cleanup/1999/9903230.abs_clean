Four-dimensional N-extended superconformal symmetry and correlation functionsof quasi-primary superfields are studied within the superspace formalism. Asuperconformal Killing equation is derived and its solutions are classified interms of supertranslations, dilations, Lorentz transformations, R-symmetrytransformations and special superconformal transformations. In general, due tothe invariance under supertranslations and special superconformaltransformations, superconformally invariant n-point functions reduce to oneunspecified (n-2)-point function which must transform homogeneously under theremaining rigid transformations, i.e. dilations, Lorentz transformations andR-symmetry transformations. Based on this result, we are able to identify allthe superconformal invariants and obtain the general form of n-point functionsfor scalar superfields. In particular, as a byproduct, a selection rule forcorrelation functions is derived, the existence of which in N=4 superYang-Mills theory was previously predicted in the context of AdS/CFTcorrespondence. Superconformally covariant differential operators are alsodiscussed.
