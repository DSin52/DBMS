It is shown that a large class of higher-order (i.e. non-quadratic) scalarkinetic terms can, without the help of potential terms, drive an inflationaryevolution starting from rather generic initial conditions. In many models, thiskinetically driven inflation (or "k-inflation" for short) rolls slowly from ahigh-curvature initial phase, down to a low-curvature phase and can exitinflation to end up being radiation-dominated, in a naturally graceful manner.We hope that this novel inflation mechanism might be useful in suggesting newways of reconciling the string dilaton with inflation.
