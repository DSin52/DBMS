We study matrix string scattering amplitudes and matrix string instantons ona marked Riemann surface in the limit of a vanishing string coupling constant.We give an explicit parameterization of the moduli space of such instantons. Wealso give a description of the set of fermionic supermoduli. The integrationover the supermoduli leads to the inclusion of picture changing operators atthe interaction points. Finally we investigate the large N limit of the measureon the instanton moduli space and show its convergence to the Weil-Peterssonmeasure on the moduli space of marked Riemann surfaces.
