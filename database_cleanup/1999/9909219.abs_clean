It is emphasized that compactified little string theories have compact modulispaces of vacua, which globally probe compact string geometry. Compactifyingvarious little string theories on T^3 leads to 3d theories with exact, quantumvolume M_s^2, and moduli spaces of G=SU(N), SO(2N), or E_{6,7,8} instantons onan arbitrary T^4 or K3 of fixed volume. Compactifying instead on a T^2 leads to4d theories with a compact Coulomb branch base which, when combined with theexact photon gauge coupling fiber, is a compact, elliptically-fibered spacerelated to the above spaces.
