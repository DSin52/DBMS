We study the thermodynamic behavior of branched polymers. We first studyrandom walks in order to clarify the thermodynamic relation between thecanonical ensemble and the grand canonical ensemble. We then show thatcorrelation functions for branched polymers are given by those for $\phi^3$theory with a single mass insertion, not those for the $\phi^3$ theorythemselves. In particular, the two-point function behaves as $1/p^4$, not as$1/p^2$, in the scaling region. This behavior is consistent with the fact thatthe Hausdorff dimension of the branched polymer is four.
