We study the world-volume effective action of stable non-BPS branes presentin Type II theories compactified on K3. In particular, by exploiting theconformal description of these objects available in the orbifold limit, weargue that their world-volume effective theory can be chiral. The resultinganomalies are cancelled through the usual inflow mechanism provided there areanomalous couplings, similar to those of BPS branes, to the twisted R-R fields.We also show that this result is in agreement with the conjecturedinterpretation of these non-BPS configurations as BPS branes wrapped onnon-supersymmetric cycles of the K3.
