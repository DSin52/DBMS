Modifications of the Bekenstein-Hawking area law for black holes are crucialin order to find agreement between the microscopic entropy based on statecounting and the macroscopic entropy based on an effective field theorycomputation. We discuss this and related issues for the case offour-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric black holes. We also briefly comment on thestate counting for N=4 and N=8 black holes.
