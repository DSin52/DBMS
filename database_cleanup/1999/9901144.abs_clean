The general correlator of composite operators of N=4 supersymmetric gaugefield theory is divergent. We introduce a means for renormalizing thesecorrelators by adding a boundary theory on the AdS space correcting for thedivergences. Such renormalizations are not equivalent to the standard normalordering of current algebras in two dimensions. The correlators contain contactterms that contribute to the OPE; we relate them diagrammatically tocorrelation functions of compound composite operators dual to multi-particlestates.
