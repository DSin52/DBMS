We study the unitary supermultiplets of the N=4 d=7 anti-de Sitter (AdS_7)superalgebra OSp(8^*|4), with the even subalgebra SO(6,2) X USp(4), which isthe symmetry superalgebra of M-theory on AdS_7 X S^4. We give a completeclassification of the positive energy doubleton and massless supermultiplets ofOSp(8^*|4) . The ultra-short doubleton supermultiplets do not have aPoincar\'{e} limit in AdS_7 and correspond to superconformal field theories onthe boundary of AdS_7 which can be identified with d=6 Minkowski space. We showthat the six dimensional Poincare mass operator vanishes identically for thedoubleton representations. By going from the compact U(4) basis ofSO^*(8)=SO(6,2) to the noncompact basis SU^*(4)XD (d=6 Lorentz group timesdilatations) one can associate the positive (conformal) energy representationsof SO^*(8) with conformal fields transforming covariantly under the Lorentzgroup in d=6. The oscillator method used for the construction of the unitarysupermultiplets of OSp(8^*|4) can be given a dynamical realization in terms ofchiral super-twistor fields.
