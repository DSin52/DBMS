We study BPS dominated loop amplitudes in M-theory on T^2. For this purposewe generalize the concept of helicity supertraces to nine spacetime dimensions.These traces distinguish between various massive supermultiplets and appear ascoefficients in their one-loop contributions to n-graviton scatteringamplitudes. This can be used to show that only ultrashort BPS multipletscontribute to the R^4 term in the effective action, which was first computed byGreen, Gutperle and Vanhove. There are two inequivalent ultrashort BPSmultiplets which describe the Kaluza-Klein states and the wrapped membranesthat cover the torus a number of times. From the perspective of the type-IIstrings they correspond to momentum and winding states and D0 or D1 branes.
