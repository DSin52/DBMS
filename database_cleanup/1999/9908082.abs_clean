We develop a graphical representation of polynomial invariants of unitarygauge groups, and use it to find the algebraic curve corresponding to ahyperkahler quotient of a linear space. We apply this method to fourdimensional ALE spaces, and for the A_k, D_k, and E_6 cases, derive theexplicit relation between the deformations of the curves away from the orbifoldlimit and the Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters in the corresponding quotientconstruction. We work out the orbifold limit of E_7, E_8, and some higherdimensional examples.
