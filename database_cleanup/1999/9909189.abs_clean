We study an Abelian Chern-Simons and Fermion system in three dimensions. Inthe presence of a fixed prescribed background magnetic field we find aninfinite number of fully three-dimensional solutions. These solutions arerelated to Hopf maps and are, therefore, labelled by the Hopf index. Further wediscuss the interpretation of the background field.
