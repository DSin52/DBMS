Three-dimensional N-extended superconformal symmetry is studied within thesuperspace formalism. A superconformal Killing equation is derived and itssolutions are classified in terms of supertranslations, dilations, Lorentztransformations, R-symmetry transformations and special superconformaltransformations. Superconformal group is then identified with a supermatrixgroup, OSp(N|2,R), as expected from the analysis on simple Lie superalgebras.In general, due to the invariance under supertranslations and specialsuperconformal transformations, superconformally invariant n-point functionsreduce to one unspecified (n-2)-point function which must transformhomogeneously under the remaining rigid transformations, i.e. dilations,Lorentz transformations and R-symmetry transformations. After constructingbuilding blocks for superconformal correlators, we are able to identify all thesuperconformal invariants and obtain the general form of n-point functions.Superconformally covariant differential operators are also discussed.
