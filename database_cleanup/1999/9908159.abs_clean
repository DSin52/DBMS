In this letter we study 1+1 anyon fields at finite temperature and densitywith non-vanishing chemical potentials. Our approach is based on an operatorformalism for bosonization at finite temperature; the correlation functions forthe system are given in an explicit form. Two are the main results of thissystems; from the analysis of 2-point anyon field correlation function, aremarkable and new condensation phenomenon in momentum space is discovered. Asa concrete example, the above formalism is applied to the Thirring model.
