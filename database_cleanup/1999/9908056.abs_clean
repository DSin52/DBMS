We construct a simple physical model of a particle moving on the infinitenoncommutative 2-plane. The model consists of a pair of opposite charges movingin a strong magnetic field. In addition, the charges are connected by a spring.In the limit of large magnetic field, the charges are frozen into the lowestLandau level. Interaction of such particles include Moyal bracket phasescharacteristics of field theory on noncommutative space. The simple systemarises in lightcone quantization of open strings attached to D-branes in a.s.tensor background. We use the model to work out the general form of lightconevertices from string splitting. We then consider Feynman diagrams inuncompactified NC YM theories and find that for all planar diagrams the comm.and noncomm. theories are the same. This means large N theories are equivalentin the 't Hooft limit. Non planar diagrams convergence is improved.
