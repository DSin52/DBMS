We consider the scattering of relativistic electrons from a thin magneticflux tube and perturbatively calculate the order $\alpha$, radiativecorrection, to the first order Born approximation. We show also that the secondorder Born amplitude vanishes, and obtain a finite inclusive cross section forthe one-body scattering which incorporates soft photon bremsstrahlung effects.Moreover, we determine the radiatively corrected Aharonov-Bohm potential and,in particular, verify that an induced magnetic field is generated outside ofthe flux tube.
