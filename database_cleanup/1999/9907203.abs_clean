We consider anomaly cancelations in Type IIB orientifolds on T^4/Z_N withquantized NS-NS sector background B-flux. For a rank b B-flux on T^4 (b isalways even) and when N is even, the cancelation requires a 2^{b/2}multiplicity of states in the 59-open string sector. We identify the twistedsector R-R scalars and tensor multiplets which are involved in theGreen-Schwarz mechanism. We give more details of the construction of thesemodels and argue that consistency with the 2^{b/2} multiplicity of 59-sectorstates requires a modification of the relation between the open string 1-loopchannel modulus and the closed string tree channel modulus in the 59-cylinderamplitudes.
