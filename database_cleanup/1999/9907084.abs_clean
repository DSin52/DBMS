We introduce and solve a family of discrete models of 2D Lorentzian gravitywith higher curvature, which possess mutually commuting transfer matrices, andwhose spectral parameter interpolates between flat and curved space-times. Wefurther establish a one-to-one correspondence between Lorentzian triangulationsand directed Random Walks. This gives a simple explanation why the Lorentziantriangulations have fractal dimension 2 and why the curvature model lies in theuniversality class of pure Lorentzian gravity. We also study integrablegeneralizations of the curvature model with arbitrary polygonal tiles. All ofthem are found to lie in the same universality class.
