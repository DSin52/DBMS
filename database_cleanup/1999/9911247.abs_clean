Title: K\"ahler Fermions on the Weitzenb\"ock space-time

Authors: I.B. Pestov

Comments: LATeX, 7 pages, no figures and tables

The K\"ahler-Dirac equation is derived on the Weitzenb\"ock space-time, whichhas a quadruplet of parallel vector fields as the fundamental structure. Aconsistent system of equations for the K\"ahler fields and parallel vectorfields is obtained.
