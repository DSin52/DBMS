SU(N) Yang-Mills integrals form a new class of matrix models which, in theirmaximally supersymmetric version, are relevant to recent non-perturbativedefinitions of 10-dimensional IIB superstring theory and 11-dimensionalM-theory. We demonstrate how Monte Carlo methods may be used to establishimportant properties of these models. In particular we consider the partitionfunctions as well as the matrix eigenvalue distributions. For the latter wederive a number of new exact results for SU(2). We also report preliminarycomputations of Wilson loops.(Based on talk presented by M. Staudacher at Strings '99, Potsdam, July 19-241999)
