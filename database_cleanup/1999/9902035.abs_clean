Using s-wave and large N approximation the one-loop effective action for 2ddilaton coupled scalars and spinors which are obtained by spherical reductionof 4d minimal matter is found. Quantum effective equations for reduced Einsteingravity are written. Their analytical solutions corresponding to 4dKantowski-Sachs (KS) Universe are presented. For quantum-corrected Einsteingravity we get non-singular KS cosmology which represents 1) quantum-correctedKS cosmology which existed on classical level or 2)purely quantum solutionwhich had no classical limit. The analogy with Nariai BH is briefly mentioned.For purely induced gravity (no Einstein term) we found general analyticalsolution but all KS cosmologies under discussion are singular. Thecorresponding equations of motion are reformulated as classical mechanicsproblem of motion of unit mass particle in some potential V.
