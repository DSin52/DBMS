We consider N = 2 super Yang-Mills theory with SU(2) gauge group and a singlequark hypermultiplet in the fundamental representation. For a specific value ofthe quark bare mass and at a certain point in the moduli space of vacua, thecentral charges corresponding to two mutually non-local electro-magneticcharges vanish simultaneously, indicating the possibility of massless suchstates in the spectrum. By realizing the theory as an M-theory configuration,we show that these states indeed exist in the spectrum near the critical point.
