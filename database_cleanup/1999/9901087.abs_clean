In this paper we describe a Liouville gravity which is induced by a set ofquantum fields (constituents) and represents a two-dimensional analog ofSakharov's induced gravity. The important feature of the considered theory isthe presence of massless constituents which are responsible for the appearanceof the induced Liouville field. The role of the massive constituents is only toinduce the cosmological constant. We consider the instanton solutions of theEuclidean Liouville gravity with negative and zero cosmological constants, someinstantons being interpreted as two-dimensional anti-de Sitter $AdS_2$ blackholes. We study thermodynamics of all the solutions and conclude that theirentropy is completely determined by the statistical-mechanical entropy of themassless constituents. This shows, in particular, that the constituents of theinduced gravity are the true degrees of freedom of $AdS_2$ black holes. Specialattention is also paid to the induced Liouville gravity with zero cosmologicalconstant on a torus. We demonstrate the equivalence of its thermodynamics tothe thermodynamics of BTZ black holes and comment on computations of the BTZblack hole entropy.
