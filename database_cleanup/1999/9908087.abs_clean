A relativistic quantum field theory is presented for finite density problemsbased on the principle of locality. It is found that, in addition to theconventional ones, a local approach to the relativistic quantum field theoriesat both zero and finite density consistent with the violation of Bell likeinequalities should contain, and provide solutions to at least three additionalproblems, namely, 1) the statistical gauge invariance 2) the dark components ofthe local observables and 3) the fermion statistical blocking effects, baseupon an asymptotic non-thermo ensemble. An application to models are presentedto show the importance of the discussions.
