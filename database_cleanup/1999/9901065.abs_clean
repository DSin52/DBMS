Title: Possible Physical Manifestation of the Weyl Non-Abelian Gauge Field

Authors: B.M. Barbashov, A.B. Pestov

Comments: LATeX, 6 pages, no figures and tables

On the basis of the Weyl equations of congruent transference, we consider apossible influence of the Weyl non-Abelian gauge field defining thetransference on the precession of a gyroscope. Plane-wave solutions to theequations of the non-Abelian gauge field are derived.
