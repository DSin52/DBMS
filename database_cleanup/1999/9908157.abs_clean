Authors: L. M. Baker, D. B. Fairlie

Comments: 14 pages, latex, no figures. Clarification of the type of Lagrangians

used; references addedThe quantum mechanical transition between a free particle Lagrangian and theKlein Gordon field description of a free particle (particle wave duality) isconjectured to extend to an analogous construction of relativisticallyinvariant wave equations associated with strings and branes, which we proposeto call brane-wave duality. Electromagnetic interactions in the two systems arediscussed. It is emphasised that all integrable free field theories, includingthose of Dirac-Born-Infeld type, are associated with Lagrangians equivalent todivergences on the space of solutions of the equations of motion.
