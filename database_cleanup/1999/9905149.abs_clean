We show that the single-mode parafermionic type systems possesssupersymmetry, which is based on the symmetry of characteristic functions ofthe parafermions related to the generalized deformed oscillator ofDaskaloyannis et al. The supersymmetry is realized in both unbroken andspontaneously broken phases. As in the case of parabosonic supersymmetryobserved recently by one of the authors, the form of the associatedsuperalgebra depends on the order of the parafermion and can be linear ornonlinear in the Hamiltonian. The list of supersymmetric parafermionic systemsincludes usual parafermions, finite-dimensional q-deformed oscillator,q-deformed parafermionic oscillator and parafermionic oscillator with internal$Z_2$ structure.
