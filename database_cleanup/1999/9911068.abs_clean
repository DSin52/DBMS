This is a summary of key issues in Matrix Theory and its compactifications.It is emphasized that Matrix Theory is a valid Discrete Light Cone Quantizationof M Theory with at least 6 noncompact asymptotically flat dimensions and 16 or32 Supersymmetry Charges. The background dependence of the quantum mechanics ofM Theory, and the necessity of working in light cone frame in asymptoticallyflat spacetimes are explained in terms of the asymptotic density of states ofthe theory, which follows from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula. In fournoncompact dimensions one is led to expect a Hagedorn spectrum in light coneenergy. This suggests the possible relevance of ``little string theories''(LSTs) to the quantum description of four dimensional compactifications,because one can argue that their exact high energy spectrum has the Hagedornform. Some space is therefore devoted to a discussion of the properties ofLSTs, which were first discovered as the proper formulation of Matrix Theory onthe five torus.
