We study the dynamics and thermodynamics of a probe D3-brane in the rotatingD3-brane background and in its extremal limit, which is a multicenterconfiguration of D3-branes distributed uniformly on a disc. In the extremalbackground, if the angular momentum of the probe does not vanish, the probe isalways bounced back at some turning point. When its angular momentum vanishes,in the disc plane, the probe will be captured at the edge of the disc; in thehyperplane orthogonal to the disc, the probe will be absorbed at the center ofthe disc. In the non-extremal background, if the probe is in the hyperplaneorthogonal to the disc, it will be captured at the horizon; if the probe isrestricted in the disc plane, the probe will be bounced back at a turningpoint, which is just the infinite red-shift hyperplane of the rotatingbackground, even when the angular momentum of the probe vanishes. Thethermodynamics of a relative static D3-brane probe is also investigated to therotating D3-brane source. Two critical points are found. One is just thethermodynamically stable boundary of the source rotating D3-branes; the otheris related to the distance between the probe and the source, which can beregarded as the mass scale in the corresponding super Yang-Mills theory. If theprobe is static, the second critical point occurs as the probe is at theinfinite red-shift hyperplane of the background. The relevance to thethermodynamics of the super Yang-Mills theory is discussed briefly.
