Title: Towards a unified description of the four interactions in terms of

Dirac-Bergmann observablesComments: 40 pages, revtex file, Invited contribution to the book of the Indian

National Science Academy for the International Mathematics Year 2000 adA review is given of the status and developments of the research programaiming to reformulate the physics of the four interactions at the classicallevel in a unified way in terms of Dirac-Bergmann observables with specialemphasis on the open mathematical, physical and interpretational problems.
