We study the non-commutative supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at strongcoupling using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The supergravity description and theUV/IR relation confirms the expectation that the non-commutativity affects theultra-violet but not the infra-red of the Yang-Mills dynamics. We show that thesupergravity solution dual to the non-commutative N=4 SYM in four dimensionshas no boundary and defines a minimal scale. We also show that the relationbetween the B field and the scale of non-commutativity is corrected at largecoupling and determine its dependence on the 't Hooft coupling \lambda.
