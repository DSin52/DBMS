Title: A Correspondence Between Supersymmetric Yang-Mills and Supergravity

TheoriesAuthors: E.T. Akhmedov

Comments: Latex 35pp; The version to appear in UFN

AdS/CFT-correspondence establishes a relationship between supersymmetricgravity (SUGRA) on Anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space and supersymmetric Yang-Mills(SYM) theory which is conformaly invariant (CFT). The AdS space is the solutionof the Einstein-Hilbert equations with a constant negative curvature. Why isthis relationship important? What kind of relationship is this? How does onefind it? The purpose of this text is to answer these questions. We try topresent the main ideas and arguments underlying this relationship, startingwith a brief sketch of old string theory statements and proceeding with thedefinition of D-branes and a description of their main features. We finish withthe observation of the correspondence in question and the arguments that favorit.
