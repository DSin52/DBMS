We discuss the thermal properties of string gases propagating in variousD-brane backgrounds in the weak-coupling limit, and at temperatures close tothe Hagedorn temperature. We determine, in the canonical ensemble, whether theHagedorn temperature is limiting or non-limiting. This depends on thedimensionality of the D-brane, and the size of the compact dimensions. We findthat in many cases the non-limiting behaviour manifest in the canonicalensemble is modified to a limiting behaviour in the microcanonical ensemble andshow that, when there are different systems in thermal contact, the energyflows into open strings on the `limiting' D-branes of largest dimensionality.Such energy densities may eventually exceed the D-brane intrinsic tension. Wediscuss possible implications of this for the survival of Dp-branes with largevalues of p in an early cosmological Hagedorn regime. We also discuss thegeneral phase diagram of the interacting theory, as implied by the holographicand black-hole/string correspondence principles.
