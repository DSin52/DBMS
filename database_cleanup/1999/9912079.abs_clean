We study conformal field theory correlation functions relevant for stringdiagrams with open strings that stretch between several parallel branes ofdifferent dimensions. In the framework of conformal field theory, they involveboundary condition changing twist fields which intertwine between Neumann andDirichlet conditions. A Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-like differential equation forcorrelators of such boundary twist fields and ordinary string vertex operatorsis derived, and explicit integral formulas for its solutions are provided.
