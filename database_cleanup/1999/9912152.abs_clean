We show how turning on Flux for RR (and NS-NS) field strengths on non-compactCalabi-Yau 3-folds can serve as a way to partially break supersymmetry from N=2to N=1 by mass deformation. The freezing of the moduli of Calabi-Yau in thepresence of the flux is the familiar phenomenon of freezing of fields insupersymmetric theories upon mass deformations.
