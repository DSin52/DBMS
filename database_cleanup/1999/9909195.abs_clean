Title: Branched Polymers Re-Revisited

We point out some misconceptions in a recent paper by H. Aoki et al.[hep-th/9909060]. In particular, the claim that the two-point function ofbranched polymers behaves as 1/p^4 instead of 1/p^2 for large p is mistaken andin no way a precondition for the Hausdorff dimension of branched polymershaving the well known value four.
