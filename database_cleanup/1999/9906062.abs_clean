The QCD-vacuum is characterized by the Higgs phenomenon for colored scalarfields. In this dual picture the gluons appear as the octet of vector mesons.Also quarks and baryons are identified. Gluon-meson and quark-baryon dualitycan account in a simple way for realistic masses of all low-mass hadrons andfor their interactions.
