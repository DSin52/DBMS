In these lectures we discuss the application of discrete light conequantization (DLCQ) to supersymmetric field theories. We will see that it ispossible to formulate DLCQ so that supersymmetry is exactly preserved in thediscrete approximation. We call this formulation of DLCQ, SDLCQ and it combinesthe power of DLCQ with all of the beauty of supersymmetry. In these lecture wewill review the application of SDLCQ to several interesting supersymmetrictheories. We will discuss two dimensional theories with (1,1), (2,2) and (8,8)supersymmetry, zero modes, vacuum degeneracy, massless states, mass gaps,theories in higher dimensions, and the Maldacena conjecture among othersubjects.
