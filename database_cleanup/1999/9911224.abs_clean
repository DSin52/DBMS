A complete derivation, from first principles, of the reaction-rate formulafor a generic reaction taking place in an out of equilibrium quantum-fieldsystem is given. It is shown that the formula involves no finite-volumecorrection. Each term of the reaction-rate formula represents a set of physicalprocesses that contribute to the reaction under consideration.
