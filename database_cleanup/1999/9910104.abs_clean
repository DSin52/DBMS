In the light of $\phi$-mapping method and the topological tensor currenttheory, the topological structure and the topological quantization oftopological defects are obtained under the condition that Jacobian$J(\phi/v)\neq0$. When $J(\phi/v)=0$, it is shown that there exists the crucialcase of branch process. Based on the implicit function theorem and the Taylorexpansion, the generation, annihilation and bifurcation of the linear defectsare detailed in the neighborhoods of the limit points and bifurcation points of$\phi$-mapping, respectively.
