the 4th International Workshop on Gravitation and Astrophysics, Beijing,October, 1999A correspondence between the three-block truncated 11D supergravity and the8D pure Einstein gravity with two commuting Killing symmetries is discussed.The Kaluza-Klein two-forms of the 6D theory obtained after dimensionalreduction along the Killing orbits generate the four-form field of supergravityvia an inverse dualization. Thus any solution to the vacuum Einstein equationsin eight dimensions depending on six coordinates have 11D-supergravitycounterparts with the non-trivial four-form field. Using this proposed dualitywe derive a new dyon solution of 11D supergravity describing the M2 andM5-branes intersecting at a point.
