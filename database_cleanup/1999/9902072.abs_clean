Title: Universal Thermal Instabilities and the High-Temperature Phase of the

N=4 SuperstringsComments: 15 pages, LATEX file, no figures

Using the properties of gauged N=4 supergravity, we show that it is possibleto derive a universal thermal effective potential that describes all possiblehigh-temperature instabilities of the known N=4 superstrings. Theseinstabilities are due to non-perturbative dyonic modes, which become tachyonicin a region of the thermal moduli space M={s,t,u}; M is common to allnon-perturbative dual-equivalent N=4 superstrings in five dimensions. Weanalyse the non-perturbative thermal potential and show the existence of aphase transition at high temperatures corresponding to a condensation of5-branes. This phase is described in detail, using an effective non-criticalstring theory.
