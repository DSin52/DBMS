For the description of space-time fermions, Dirac-K\"ahler fields(inhomogeneous differential forms) provide an interesting alternative to theDirac spinor fields. In this paper we develop a similar concept within thesymplectic geometry of phase-spaces. Rather than on space-time, symplecticDirac-K\"ahler fields can be defined on the classical phase-space of anyHamiltonian system. They are equivalent to an infinite family of metaplecticspinor fields, i.e. spinors of Sp(2N), in the same way an ordinaryDirac-K\"ahler field is equivalent to a (finite) mulitplet of Dirac spinors.The results are interpreted in the framework of the gauge theory formulation ofquantum mechanics which was proposed recently. An intriguing analogy is foundbetween the lattice fermion problem (species doubling) and the problem ofquantization in general.
