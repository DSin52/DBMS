In the previous paper [hep-th/9904112], we argued that there exist BPS boundstates of Dp branes carrying certain units of quantized constant electric fieldfor every $p$ (with $1 \le p \le 8$). Each of these bound states preserves onehalf of the spacetime supersymmetries. In this paper, we construct these boundstate configurations explicitly for $2 \le p \le 7$ from Schwarz's$(m,n)$-string or (F, D1) bound state in type IIB string theory by T-dualitiesalong the transverse directions. We calculate the charge per $(2\pi)^{p -1}\alpha'^{(p - 1)/2}$ of $(p -1)$-dimensional area for F-strings in (F, Dp) andthe tension for each of these bound states. The results agree precisely withthose obtained previously from the worldvolume study. We study the decouplinglimit for the (F, D3) bound state and find that Maldacena's $AdS_5/CFT_4$correspondence may hold true even with respect to thisbound state but now withan effective string coupling rather than the usual string coupling. Thiscoupling is quantized and can be independent of the usual string coupling incertain limit.
