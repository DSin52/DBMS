We study two-dimensional SQED viewed as the world-volume theory of a D-stringin the presence of D5-branes with non-zero background fields that induceattractive forces between the branes. In various approximations, the low-energydynamics is given by a hyperKahler, or hyperKahler with torsion, massivesigma-model. We demonstrate the existence of kink solutions corresponding tothe string interpolating between different D5-branes. Bound states of theD-string with fundamental strings are identified with Q-kinks which, in turn,are identified with dyonic instanton strings on the D5-brane world-volume.
