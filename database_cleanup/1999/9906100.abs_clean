An exact expression for the Green function of a purely fermionic systemmoving on the manifold $\Re \times \Sigma^{D-1}$, where $\Sigma^{D-1}$ is a$(D-1)$-torus, is found. This expression involves the bosonic analog of $\chi_n= e^{in\theta}$ corresponding to the irreducible representation for the n-thclass of homotopy and in the fermionic case for D=2 and 3, $\chi_n$ is ameasure of the statistics of the particles. For higher dimensions ($D \geq 4$),there is no analogue interpretation however this could, presumably, indicate ageneration of mass as in quantum field theories at finite temperature.
