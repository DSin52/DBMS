We investigate nonperturbative effects in M-theory compactificationsarising from wrapped membranes. In particular, we show that in $d=4, \CN=1$compactifications along manifolds of $G_2$ holonomy, membranes wrapped on rigidsupersymmetric 3-cycles induce nonzero corrections to the superpotential. Thus,membrane instantons destabilize many M-theory compactifications. Ourcomputation shows that the low energy description of membrane physics isusefully described in terms of three-dimensional topological field theories,and the superpotential is expressed in terms of topological invariants of the3-cycle. We discuss briefly some applications of these results. For example,using mirror symmetry we derive a counting formula for supersymmetricthree-cycles in certain Calabi-Yau manifolds.
