A model for quantized gravitation based on the simplicial latticediscretization is studied in detail using a comprehensive finite size scalinganalysis combined with renormalization group methods. The results areconsistent with a value for the universal critical exponent for gravitation$\nu=1/3$, and suggest a simple relationship between Newton's constant, thegravitational correlation length and the observable average space-timecurvature. Some perhaps testable phenomenological implications of these resultsare discussed. To achieve a high numerical accuracy in the evaluation of thelattice path integral a dedicated parallel machine was assembled.
