We construct the finite energy path between topologically distinct vacua of a4 dimensional SO(4) Higgs model which is known to support an instanton, andshow that there is a sphaleron with Chern-Simons number N_CS=1/2 at the top ofthe energy barrier. This is carried out using the original geometric loopconstruction of Manton.
