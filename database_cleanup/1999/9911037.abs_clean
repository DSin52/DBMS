We discuss dualities of the integrable dynamics behind the exact solution tothe N=2 SUSY YM theory. It is shown that T duality in the string theory isrelated to the separation of variables procedure in dynamical system. We arguethat there are analogues of S duality as well as 3d mirror symmetry in themany-body systems of Hitchin type governing low-energy effective actions.
