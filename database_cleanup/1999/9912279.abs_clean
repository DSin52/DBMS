Just as D-brane charge of Type IIA and Type IIB superstrings is classified,respectively, by K^1(X) and K(X), Ramond-Ramond fields in these theories areclassified, respectively, by K(X) and K^1(X). By analyzing a recent proposalfor how to interpret quantum self-duality of RR fields, we show that the Diracquantization formula for the RR p-forms, when properly formulated, receivescorrections that reflect curvature, lower brane charges, and an anomaly ofD-brane world-volume fermions. The K-theory framework is important here,because the term involving the fermion anomaly cannot be naturally expressed interms of cohomology and differential forms.
