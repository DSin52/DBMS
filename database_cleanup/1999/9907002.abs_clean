Title: Membrane Horizons

Comments: LaTeX, 81 pages, 1 figure

This thesis addresses some classical and semi-classical aspects of blackholes using an effective membrane representation of the event horizon. Theclassical "membrane paradigm" equations are derived from an underlying actionformulation, even though the equations are dissipative. It is shown how themembrane action can also account for the hole's entropy, including thenumerical factor. Two short derivations of Hawking radiation are thenpresented, the first based on particles in a dynamical geometry and the secondon the membrane. The calculations obey conservation laws and lead to acorrection to the thermal spectrum. Finally, a possible Penrose diagram for theformation and evaporation of a charged black hole is given, with the propertythat the post-evaporation spacetime is predictable from initial conditions,provided that the dynamics of the time-like singularity can be calculated.
