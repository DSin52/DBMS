We use logarithmic conformal field theory techniques to describe recoileffects in the scattering of two Dirichlet branes in D dimensions. In theparticular case that a D1 brane strikes a D3 brane perpendicularly, therebyfolding it, we find that the recoil space-time is maximally symmetric, withAdS_3 x E_{D-3} geometry. We comment on the possible applications of thisresult to the study of transitions between different background metrics.
