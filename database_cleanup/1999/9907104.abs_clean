We construct the Georgi-Glashow Lagrangian for gauge group SU_q(n). Breakingthis symmetry spontaneously gives q-dependent masses of gauge field and vacuummanifold. It turned out that the vacuum manifold is parameterized by thenon-commutative quantities. We showed that the monopole solutions exist in thismodel, which is indicated by the presence of the BPS states.
