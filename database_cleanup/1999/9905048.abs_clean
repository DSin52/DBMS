The two-point Green function of a local operator in CFT corresponding to amassive symmetric tensor field on the AdS background is computed in theframework of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The obtained two-point function isshown to coincide with the two-point function of the graviton in the limit whenthe mass vanishes.
