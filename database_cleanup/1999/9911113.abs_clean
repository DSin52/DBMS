A realization of E_{n+1} monopoles in string theory is given. The NS fivebrane stuck to an Orientifold eight plane is identified as the 't HooftPolyakov monopole. Correspondingly, the moduli space of many such NS branes isidentified with the moduli space of SU(2) monopoles. These monopoles transformin the spinor representation of an SO(2n) gauge group when n D8 branes arestacked upon the orientifold plane. This leads to a realization of E_{n+1}monopole moduli spaces. Charge conservation leads to a dynamical effect whichdoes not allow the NS branes to leave the orientifold plane. This suggests thatthe monopole moduli space is smooth for n<8. Odd n>8 obeys a similar condition.Using a chain of dualities, we also connect our system to an Heteroticbackground with Kaluza-Klein monopoles.
