The BPS method is used to find BPS solutions of the worldvolume theory of aD5-brane in the near horizon geometry of a D3-brane. The BPS bound isinterpreted in terms of the `maximally extended' D5 worldvolume supersymmetryalgebra in the corresponding curved background, which is OSp(1|16). Thisalgebra is an extension of the worldvolume superalgebra OSp(4^*|4). Theanalysis is generalized to the non-near horizon case.
