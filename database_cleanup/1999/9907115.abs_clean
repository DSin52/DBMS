Title: Holographic Cosmology and its Relevant Degrees of Freedom

Authors: Richard Dawid

Comments: 16 pages

We reconsider the options for cosmological holography. We suggest that aglobal and time--symmetric version of the Fischler-Susskind bound is the mostnatural generalization of the holographic bound encountered in AdS and DeSitter space. A consistent discussion of cosmological holography seems to implyan understanding of the notion of ``number of degrees of freedom'' thatdeviates from its simple definition as the entropy of the current state. Theintroduction of a more adequate notion of degree of freedom makes the suggestedvariation of the Fischler-Susskind bound look like a stringent and viable boundin all 4--dimensional cosmologies without a cosmological constant.
