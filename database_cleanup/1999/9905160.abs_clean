In this paper, a new approach to string dynamics is proposed. Stringcoordinates are identified with a non-commuting set of operators familiar fromfree string quantization, and the dynamics follows from the Virasoro algebra.There is a very large gauge group operating on the non-commuting coordinates.The gauge has to be fixed suitably to make contact with the standard stringpicture.
