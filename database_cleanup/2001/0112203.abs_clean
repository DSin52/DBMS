We present a generalization of the boundary state formalism for the bosonicstring that allows us to calculate the overlap of the boundary state witharbitrary closed string states. We show that this generalization exactlyreproduces world-sheet sigma model calculations, thus giving the correctoverlap with both on- and off-shell string states, and that this new boundarystate automatically satisfies the requirement for integrated vertex operatorsin the case of non-conformally invariant boundary interactions.
