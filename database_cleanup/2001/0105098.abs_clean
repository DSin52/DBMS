B with a title "One loop partitionfunction in the presence of tachyon background and corrections to tachyoncondensation"We compute the one-loop partition function for quadratic tachyon backgroundin open string theory.Both closed and open string representations are developed. Using theserepresentations we study the one-loop divergences in the partition function inthe presence of the tachyon background. The divergences due to the open andclosed string tachyons are treated by analytic continuation in the tachyon masssquared. We pay particular attention to the imaginary part of the analyticallycontinued expressions. The last one gives the decay rate of the unstablevacuum. The dilaton tadpole is also given some partial consideration. Thepartition function is further used to study corrections to tachyon condensationprocesses describing brane descent relations. Assuming the boundary stringfield theory prescription for construction of the string field action viapartition function holds at one loop level we study the one-loop corrections tothe tachyon potential and to the tensions of lower-dimensional branes.
