We present a generalization of the five dimensional multigravity models tosix dimensions. The key characteristic of these constructions is that that weobtain solutions which do not have any negative tension branes while at thesame time the branes are kept flat. This is due to the fact that in sixdimensions the internal space is not trivial and its curvature allows bounceconfigurations with the above feature. These constructions give for the firsttime a theoretically and phenomenologically viable realization of multigravity.
