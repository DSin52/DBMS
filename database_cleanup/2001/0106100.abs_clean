In the intersecting braneworld models, higher curvature corrections to theEinstein action are necessary to provide a non-trivial geometry (brane tension)at the brane junctions. By introducing such terms in a Gauss-Bonnet form, wegive an effective description of localized gravity on the singulardelta-function branes. There exists a non-vanishing brane tension at thefour-dimensional brane intersection of two 4-branes. Importantly, we giveexplicit expressions of the graviton propagator and show that theRandall-Sundrum single-brane model with a Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulkcorrectly gives a massless graviton on the brane as for the RS model. Weexplore some crucial features of completely localized gravity in the solitonicbraneworld solutions obtained with a choice (\xi=1) of solutions. The no-gotheorem known for Einstein's theory may not apply to the \xi=1 solution. Ascomplementary discussions, we provide an effective description of the power-lawcorrections to Newtonian gravity on the branes or at the common intersectionthereof.
