We consider a class of models with infinite extra dimension, where bulk spacedoes not possess SO(1,3) invariance, but Lorentz invariance emerges as anapproximate symmetry of the low-energy effective theory. In these models, themaximum attainable speeds of the graviton, gauge bosons and scalar particlesare automatically equal to each other and smaller than the maximum speed in thebulk. Additional fine-tuning is needed in order to assure that the maximumattainable speed of fermions takes the same value. A peculiar feature of ourscenario is that there are no truly localized modes. All four-dimensionalparticles are resonances with finite widths. The latter depends on the energyof the particle and is naturally small at low energies.
