We construct a Heisenberg-like algebra for the one dimensional quantum freeKlein-Gordon equation defined on the interval of the real line of length $L$.Using the realization of the ladder operators of this type Heisenberg algebrain terms of physical operators we build a 3+1 dimensional free quantum fieldtheory based on this algebra. We introduce fields written in terms of theladder operators of this type Heisenberg algebra and a free quantum Hamiltonianin terms of these fields. The mass spectrum of the physical excitations of thisquantum field theory are given by $\sqrt{n^2 \pi^2/L^2+m_q^2}$, where $n=1,2,...$ denotes the level of the particle with mass $m_q$ in an infinitesquare-well potential of width $L$.
