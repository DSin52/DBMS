We discuss the tachyon condensation in a single unstable D-brane in theframework of boundary state formulation. The boundary state in the backgroundof the tachyon condensation and the NS B-field is explicitly constructed. Weshow in both commutative theory and noncommutative theory that the unstableD-branes behaves like an extended object and eventually reduces to the lowerdimensional D-branes as the system approaches the infrared fixed point. Weclarify the relationship between the commutative field theoretical descriptionof the tachyon condensation and the noncommutative one.
