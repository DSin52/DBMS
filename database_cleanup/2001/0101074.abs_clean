We describe the complete coupling of $(1,0)$ six-dimensional supergravity totensor, vector and hypermultiplets. The generalized Green-Schwarz mechanismimplies that the resulting theory embodies factorized gauge and supersymmetryanomalies, to be disposed of by fermion loops. Consequently, the low-energytheory is determined by the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions, rather than bythe requirement of supersymmetry. As already shown for the case withouthypermultiplets, this procedure does not fix a quartic coupling for thegauginos. With respect to these previous results, the inclusion of chargedhypermultiplets gives additional terms in the supersymmetry anomaly. We alsoconsider the case in which abelian vectors are present. As in the absence ofhypermultiplets, abelian vectors allow additional couplings. Finally, we applythe Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin prescription to this model.
