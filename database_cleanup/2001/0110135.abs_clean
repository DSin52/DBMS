Title: CPT violation

Comments: Invited talk at the 7-th International Wigner Symposium, College Park

A new mechanism for T and CPT violation is reviewed, which relies on chiralfermions, gauge interactions and nontrivial spacetime topology. Also discussedare the possible effects on the propagation of electromagnetic waves in vacuo,in particular for the cosmic microwave background radiation.
