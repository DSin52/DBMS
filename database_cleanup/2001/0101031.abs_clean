The classical equations of motion of Maxwell and Born-Infeld theories areknown to be invariant under a duality symmetry acting on the field strengths.We implement the SL(2,Z) duality in these theories as linear but non-localtransformations on the potentials. We show that the action and the partitionfunction in the Hamiltonian formalism are modular invariant in any gauge. Forthe Born-Infeld theory we find that the longitudinal part of the fields have tobe complexified.
