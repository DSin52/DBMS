Title: Perturbative Quantization of Gravity Theories

Authors: Z. Bern (UCLA)

Comments: Talk presented at 5th International Symposium on Radiative

Corrections (RADCOR-2000), Carmel CA, September 11-15, 2000. Latex, 12 pagesWe discuss string theory relations between gravity and gauge theory treeamplitudes. Together with $D$-dimensional unitarity, these relations can beused to perturbatively quantize gravity theories, i.e. they contain thenecessary information for calculating complete gravity $S$-matrices to any looporders. This leads to a practical method for computing non-trivial gravity$S$-matrix elements by relating them to much simpler gauge theory ones. We alsodescribe arguments that N=8 D=4 supergravity is less divergent in theultraviolet than previously thought.
