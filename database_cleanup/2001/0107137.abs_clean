We study the decay of a near-extremal black hole in AdS$_2$, related to thenear-horizon region of 3+1-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime,following Fabbri, Navarro, and Navarro-Salas. Back-reaction is included in asemiclassical approximation. Calculations of the stress-energy tensor of mattercoupled to the physical spacetime for an affine null observer demonstrate thatthe black hole evaporation proceeds smoothly and the near-extremal black holeevolves back to an extremal ground state, until this approximation breaks down.
