The AdS/CFT correspondence is explored for ``partially massless'' fields inAdS space (which have fewer helicity states than a massive field but more thana conventional massless field). Such fields correspond in the boundaryconformal field theory to fields obeying a certain conformally-invariantdifferential equation that has been described by Eastwood et al. The firstdescendant of such a field is a conformal field of negative norm. Hence,partially massless fields may make more physical sense in de Sitter as opposedto Anti de Sitter space.
