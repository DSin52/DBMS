We present an alternative way to determine the unknown parameter associatedto a gaussian approximation in a generic two-dimensional model. Instead of thestandard variational approach, we propose a procedure based on a quantitativeprediction of conformal invariance, valid for systems in the scaling regime,away from criticality. We illustrate our idea by considering, as an example,the sine-Gordon model. Our method gives a good approximation for the solitonmass as function of $\beta$.
