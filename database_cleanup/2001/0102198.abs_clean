We explore some aspects of monodromies of D-branes in the Kahler moduli spaceof Calabi-Yau compactifications. Here a D-brane is viewed as an object of thederived category of coherent sheaves. We compute all the interestingmonodromies in some nontrivial examples and link our work to recent results andconjectures concerning helices and mutations. We note some particularproperties of the 0-brane.
