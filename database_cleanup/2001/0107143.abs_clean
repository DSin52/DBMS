We construct the first three family N=1 supersymmetric string model withStandard Model gauge group SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y from an orientifold oftype IIA theory on T^6/(Z_2 x Z_2) and D6-branes intersecting at angles. Inaddition to the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model particles, the modelcontains right-handed neutrinos, a chiral (but anomaly-free) set of exoticmultiplets, and extra vector-like multiplets. We discuss some phenomenologicalfeatures of this model.
