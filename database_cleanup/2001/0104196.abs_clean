The coordinate transformations which establish the direct relationshipbetween the actions of linear and nonlinear realizations of supermembranes areproposed. It is shown that the Rocek-Tseytlin constraint known in the frameworkof the linear realization of the theory is simply equivalent to a limit of a"pure" nonlinear realization in which the field describing the massive mode ofthe supermembrane puts to zero.
