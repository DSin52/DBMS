The dual Meissner effect scenario of confinement is discussed by studying thelow energy regime of SU(2) Yang-Mills in a maximal Abelian gauge. The Abelianprojected effective action is computed perturbatively. This serves as an inputfor a study of the non-perturbative regime, which is undertaken using exactrenormalisation group methods. It is argued that the effective action derivedhere contains the relevant degrees of freedom for confinement if ultravioletirrelevant vertices are retained.
