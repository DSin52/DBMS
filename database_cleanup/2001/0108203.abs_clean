The limitations of the approach based on using fields restricted to thelightfront (Lightfront Quantization or p$\to \infty $ Frame Approach) whichdrive quantum fields towards canonical and ultimately free fields are wellknown. Here we propose a new concept which does not suffer from thislimitation. It is based on a procedure which cannot be directly formulated interms of pointlike fields but requires ``holographic'' manipulations of thealgebras generated by those fields. We illustrate the new concepts in thesetting of factorizable d=1+1 models and show that the known fact of absence ofultraviolet problems in those models (in the presence of higher than canonicaldimensions) also passes to their holographic images. In higher spacetimedimensions d\TEXTsymbol{>}1+1 the holographic image lacks the transversallocalizability; however this can be remedied by doing holography on d-2additional lightfronts which share one lightray (Scanning by d-1 chiralconformal theories).
