Title: Resolution of the causality paradox in quantum gravity

The metric determines the casual structure of spacetime, but in quantumgravity it is also a dynamical field which must be quantized using this causalof space-like separation entirely. This can be done by describing all fields interms on p-jets, living on the observer's trajectory; all points on thetrajectory have time-like separations. Such a description is necessary toconstruct well-defined projective representations of vect(4), which is thecorrect symmetry algebra of general relativity. The limit p \to \infty, neededto reconstruct the quantum fields throughout spacetime, only exists if bothbosons and fermions are present.
