We present a technique that can be used to generate a static, axisymmetricsolution of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton equations from a stationary,axisymmetric solution of the vacuum Einstein equations. Starting from the Kerrsolution, Davidson and Gedalin have previously made use of this technique toobtain a pair of oppositely charged, extremal dilatonic black holes, known as ablack dihole. In this paper, we shall instead start from the Kerr-NUT solution.It will be shown that the new solution can also be interpreted as a dihole, butwith the black holes carrying unbalanced magnetic charges. The effect of theNUT-parameter is to introduce a net magnetic charge into the system. Finally,we uplift our solution to ten dimensions to describe a system consisting of D6and anti-D6-branes with unbalanced charges. The limit in which they coincideagrees with a solution recently derived by Brax et al..
