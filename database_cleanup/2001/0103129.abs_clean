We formulate Lorentz group representations in which ordinary complex numbersare replaced by linear functions of real quaternions and introduce dotted andundotted quaternionic one-dimensional spinors. To extend to parity thespace-time transformations, we combine these one-dimensional spinors intobi-dimensional column vectors. From the transformation properties of thetwo-component spinors, we derive a quaternionic chiral representation for thespace-time algebra. Finally, we obtain a quaternionic bi-dimensional version ofthe Dirac equation.
