made integral with paperThe elementary particles are modeled as harmonic oscillator excitations oftransverse U(1) gauge fields propagating at v = c, with open and closedstring-like propagation paths. One, two and three node states represent theleptons, bosons, and quarks. We incorporate a twist theta for the gauge fieldcomponents which rotate counterclockwise (L) for the electron, yielding achiral model. Theta increases by pi from node to node, making the lepton modelsSU(2) representations. At nodes the twist may reverse, creating new particlestates. For three nodes, twist combinations map the SU(3) color states of thequarks. Generations are modeled topologically by the winding number of thestrings. Mapping model E fields to distant observers makes understandable howfractional charges arise for the quarks. These models are 3D slices ofspacetime, allowing us to make drawings of particle field conformations. Frommodel particle quantum numbers, new mass relationships are derived.
