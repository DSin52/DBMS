Thick branes obtained from a bulk action containing Gauss-Bonnetself-interactions are analyzed in light of the localization properties of thevarious modes of the geometry. The entangled system describing the localizationof the tensor, vector and scalar fluctuation is decoupled in terms of variablesinvariant for infinitesimal coordinate transformations. The dynamics of thevarious zero modes is discussed and solved in general terms. Provided thefour-dimensional Planck mass is finite and provided the geometry is everywhereregular, it is shown that the vector and scalar zero modes are not localized.The tensor zero mode is localized leading to four-dimensional gravity. Thegeneral formalism is illustrated through specific analytical examples
