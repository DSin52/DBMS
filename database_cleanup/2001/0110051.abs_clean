A simplified higher dimensional Randall-Sundrum-like model in 6 dimensions isconsidered. It has been observed previously by Goldberger and Wise that in sucha self-interacting scalar theory on the bulk with a conical singularity thereis mixing of renormalization of 4d brane couplings with that of the bulkcouplings. We study the influence of the running bulk couplings on the runningof the 4d brane couplings. We find that bulk quantum effects may completelyalter the running of brane couplings. In particular, the structure of theLandau pole may be drastically altered and non-asymptotically free running mayturn into asymptotically safe (or free) behavior.
