We find the N-soliton solution at infinite theta, as well as the metric onthe moduli space corresponding to spatial displacements of the solitons. We usea perturbative expansion to incorporate the leading 1/theta corrections, andfind an effective short range attraction between solitons. We study thestability of various solutions. We discuss the finite theta corrections toscattering, and find metastable orbits. Upon quantization of the two-solitonmoduli space, for any finite theta, we find an s-wave bound state.
