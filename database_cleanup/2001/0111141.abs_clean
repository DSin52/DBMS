Title: The Poisson-Sigma Model - A Nonlinear Gauge Theory

Comments: Contribution to the Proceedings of the 3rd international Conference

on Geometry, Integrability and Quantization, which was heldin Varna,Bulgaria, 14-23 June 2001I investigate the Poisson-sigma model on the classical and quantum level.First I show how the interaction can be obtained by a deformation of theclassical master equation of an Abelian BF theory in two dimensions. On theclassical level this model includes various known two-dimensional fieldtheories, in particular the Yang-Mills theory. On the quantum level theperturbation expansion of the path integral in the covariant gauge yields theKontsevich deformation formula. Finally I perform the calculation of the pathintegral in a general gauge, and demonstrate how the derived partition functionreduces in the special case of a linear Poisson structure to the familiar formof 2d Yang-Mills theory.
