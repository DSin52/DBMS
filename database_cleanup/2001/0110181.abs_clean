Workshop on Statistical Field Theories, Como 18-23 June 2001In contrast to what happens for ferromagnets, the lattice structureparticipates in a crucial way to determine existence and type of criticalbehaviour in antiferromagnetic systems. It is an interesting question toinvestigate how the memory of the lattice survives in the field theorydescribing a scaling antiferromagnet. We discuss this issue for the squarelattice three-state Potts model, whose scaling limit as T->0 is argued to bedescribed exactly by the sine-Gordon field theory at a specific value of thecoupling. The solution of the scaling ferromagnetic case is recalled forcomparison. The field theory describing the crossover from antiferromagnetic toferromagnetic behaviour is also introduced.
