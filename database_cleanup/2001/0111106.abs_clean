We consider partial spontaneous breaking of N=1 AdS4 supersymmetry OSp(1|4)down to N=1, d=3 Poincare supersymmetry in the nonlinear realizationsframework. We construct the corresponding worldvolume Goldstone superfieldaction and show that it describes the N=1 AdS4 supermembrane. It enjoysOSp(1|4) supersymmetry realized as a field-dependent modification of N=1, d=3superconformal symmetry and goes into the superfield action of ordinary N=1,D=4 supermembrane in the flat limit. Its bosonic core is the Maldacena-typeconformally invariant action of the AdS4 membrane. We show how to reproduce thelatter action within a nonlinear realization of the AdS4 group SO(2,3). Thesame universal nonlinear realizations techniques can be used to constructconformally-invariant worldvolume actions for (d-2)-branes in generic AdSdspaces.
