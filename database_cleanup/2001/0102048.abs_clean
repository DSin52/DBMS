The noncommutative generalisation of the standard electroweak model due toBalakrishna, Gursey and Wali is formulated in terms of the derivationsDer_2(M_3) of a three dimensional representation of the su(2) Lie algebra ofweak isospin. A light Higgs boson of mass about 130 GeV, together with fourvery heavy scalar bosons are predicted.
