Authors: A.Marshakov

Comments: Contribution to the proceedings of the conference SUSY01, Dubna, June

2001; LaTeX, 8 ppThe role of associativity or WDVV equations in effective supersymmetricquantum theories is discussed and it is demonstrated that for wide class oftheir solutions when residue formulas are valid the proof of associativityequations can be reduced to solving the system of ordinary linear equations anddepends only upon corresponding matching and nondegeneracy conditions. Thecovariance of WDVV equations upon generic duality transformations and the roleof associativity equations in general context of quasiclassical integrablesystems is also discussed.
