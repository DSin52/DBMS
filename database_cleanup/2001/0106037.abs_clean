In contrast with pseudo-gravitational effects that are mathematicallyanalogous but physically quite distinct from gravity, this presentation dealswith a kind of quasi-gravitational effect that can act in an asymmetricallymoving brane worldsheet in a manner that approximates (and in a crude analysismight be physically indistinguishable from) the effect that would arise fromgenuine gravitation, of ordinary Newtonian type in non-relativisticapplications, and of scalar - tensor (Jordan - Brans - Dicke rather than pureEinstein) type in relativistic applications.
