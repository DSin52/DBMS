We show the existence of some new local, covariant and continuous symmetriesfor the BRST invariant Lagrangian density of a free two ($1 + 1$)-dimensional(2D) Abelian U(1) gauge theory in the framework of superfield formalism. TheNoether conserved charges corresponding to the above local continuoussymmetries find their geometrical origin as the translation generators alongthe odd (Grassmannian)- and even (bosonic) directions of the four ($2 +2)$-dimensional compact supermanifold. Some new discrete symmetries are shownto exist in the superfield formulation. The logical origin for the existence ofBRST- and co-BRST symmetries is shown to be encoded in the Hodge decomposedversions (of the 2D fermionic vector fields) that are consistent with thediscrete symmetries of the theory.
