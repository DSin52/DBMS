In this paper, we calculate the spectrum of scalar field fluctuations in abouncing, asymptotically flat Universe, and investigate the dependence of theresult on changes in the physics on length scales shorter than the Plancklength which are introduced via modifications of the dispersion relation. Inthis model, there are no ambiguities concerning the choice of the initialvacuum state. We study an example in which the final spectrum of fluctuationsdepends sensitively on the modifications of the dispersion relation withoutneeding to invoke complex frequencies. Changes in the amplitude and in thespectral index are possible, in addition to modulations of the spectrum. Thisstrengthens the conclusions of previous work in which the spectrum ofcosmological perturbations in expanding inflationary cosmologies was studied,and it was found that, for dispersion relations for which the evolution is notadiabatic, the spectrum changes from the standard prediction ofscale-invariance.
