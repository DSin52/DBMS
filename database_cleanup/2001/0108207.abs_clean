We begin by reviewing the noncommutative supersymmetric tubularconfigurations in the matrix theory. We identify the worldvolume gauge fields,the charges and the moment of R-R charges carried by the tube. We also studythe fluctuations around many tubes and tube-D0 systems. Based on thesupersymmetric tubes, we have constructed more general configurations thatapproach supersymmetric tubes asymptotically. These include a bend with angleand a junction that connects two tubes to one. The junction may be interpretedas a finite-energy domain wall that interpolates U(1) and U(2) worldvolumegauge theories. We also construct a tube along which the noncommutativity scalechanges. Relying upon these basic units of operations, one may build physicalconfigurations corresponding to any shape of Riemann surfaces of arbitrarytopology. Variations of the noncommutativity scale are allowed over the Riemannsurfaces. Particularly simple such configurations are Y-shaped junctions.
