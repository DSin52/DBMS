We consider the evolution of a scalar field coupled to curvature intopological black hole spacetimes. We solve numerically the scalar waveequation with different curvature-coupling constant $\xi$ and show that a richspectrum of wave propagation is revealed when $\xi$ is introduced. Relationsbetween quasinormal modes and the size of different topological black holeshave also been investigated.
