A boundary-state computation is performed to obtain derivative corrections tothe Chern-Simons coupling between a p-brane and the RR gauge potential C(p-3).We work to quadratic order in the gauge field strength F, but all orders inderivatives. In a certain limit, which requires the presence of a constantB-field background, it is found that these corrections neatly sum up into the*2 product of (commutative) gauge fields. The result is in agreement with arecent prediction using noncommutativity.
