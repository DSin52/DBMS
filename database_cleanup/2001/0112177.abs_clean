We consider simple superalgebras which are a supersymmetric extension of$\fspin(s,t)$ in the cases where the number of odd generators does not exceed64. All of them contain a super Poincar\'e algebra as a contraction and anotheras a subalgebra. Because of the contraction property, some of these algebrascan be interpreted as de Sitter or anti de Sitter superalgebras. However, thenumber of odd generators present in the contraction is not always minimal dueto the different splitting properties of the spinor representations under asubalgebra. We consider the general case, with arbitrary dimension andsignature, and examine in detail particular examples with physical implicationsin dimensions $d=10$ and $d=4$.
