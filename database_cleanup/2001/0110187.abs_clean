We discuss compactifications of the heterotic string in the presence ofbackground fluxes. Specifically we consider compactifications on T^6, T^5, K3 xT^2 and K3 x S^1 for which we derive the bosonic sector of the low energyeffective action. The consistency with the corresponding gauged supergravitiesis demonstrated.
