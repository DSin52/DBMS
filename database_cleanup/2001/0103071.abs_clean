We address the behaviour of the scalar field with negative mass squared inthe five dimensional AdS space where the Randall-Sundrum brane-world isembedded. We point out that the tachyonic scalar allowed in the bulk spacedestabilizes the embedded brane-world where the cosmological constant is zero.The resolution of this instability is discussed from the viewpoint of AdS/CFTcorrespondence.
