We investigate the classical geometry corresponding to a collection offractional D3 branes in the orbifold limit of an ALE space. We discuss itsinterpretation in terms of the world-volume gauge theory on the branes, whichis in general a non conformal N=2 Yang-Mills theory with matter. The twistedfields reproduce the perturbative behaviour of the gauge theory. We regulatethe IR singularities for both twisted and untwisted fields by means of anenhancon mechanism qualitatively consistent with the gauge theory expectations.The five-form flux decreases logarithmically towards the IR with a coefficientdictated by the gauge theory beta-functions.
