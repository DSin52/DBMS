We study a class of type I string models with supersymmetry broken on theworld-volume of some D-branes and vanishing tree-level potential. Despite thenon-supersymmetric spectrum, supersymmetry is non-linearly realized on theseD-branes, while it is spontaneously broken in the bulk by Scherk-Schwarzboundary conditions. These models can easily accommodate 3-branes withinteresting gauge groups and chiral fermions. We also study the effective fieldtheory and in particular we compute the four-fermion couplings of the localizedGoldstino with the matter fermions on the brane.
