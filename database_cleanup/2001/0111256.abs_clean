We discuss the renormalization of a BRST and anti-BRST invariant compositeoperator of mass dimension 2 in Yang-Mills theory with the general BRST andanti-BRST invariant gauge fixing term of the Lorentz type. The interest of thisstudy stems from a recent claim that the non-vanishing vacuum condensate of thecomposite operator in question can be an origin of mass gap and quarkconfinement in any manifestly covariant gauge, as proposed by one of theauthors. First, we obtain the renormalization group flow of the Yang-Millstheory. Next, we show the multiplicative renormalizability of the compositeoperator and that the BRST and anti-BRST invariance of the bare compositeoperator is preserved under the renormalization. Third, we perform the operatorproduct expansion of the gluon and ghost propagators and obtain the Wilsoncoefficient corresponding to the vacuum condensate of mass dimension 2.Finally, we discuss the connection of this work with the previous works andargue the physical implications of the obtained results.
