We study the framing dependence of the Wilson loop observable of U(N)Chern-Simons gauge theory at large N. Using proposed geometrical large N dual,this leads to a direct computation of certain topological string amplitudes ina closed form. This yields new formulae for intersection numbers of cohomologyclasses on moduli of Riemann surfaces with punctures (including all theamplitudes of pure topological gravity in two dimensions). The reinterpretationof these computations in terms of BPS degeneracies of domain walls leads tonovel integrality predictions for these amplitudes. Moreover we find evidencethat large N dualities are more naturally formulated in the context of U(N)gauge theories rather than SU(N).
