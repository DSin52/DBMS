We consider the problem of the interaction between D0-brane bound state and1-form RR photons by the world-line theory. Based on the fact that in theworld-line theory the RR gauge fields depend on the matrix coordinates ofD0-branes, the gauge fields also appear as matrices in the formulation. At theclassical level, we derive the Lorentz-like equations of motion for D0-branes,and it is observed that the center-of-mass is colourless with respect to theSU(N) sector of the background. Using the path integral method, theperturbation theory for the interaction between the bound state and the RRbackground is developed. We discuss what kind of field theory may becorresponded to the amplitudes which are calculated by the perturbationexpansion in world-line theory. Qualitative considerations show that thepossibility of existence of a map between the world-line theory and thenon-Abelian gauge theory is very considerable.
