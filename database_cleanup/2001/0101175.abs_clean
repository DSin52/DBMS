Title: Scaling Dimensions of Lattice Quantized Gravity

Comments: Talk presented at the 9-th Marcel Grossman Meeting (LaTeX, 10 pages)

I discuss a model for quantized gravitation based on the simplicial latticediscretization. It has been studied in some detail using a comprehensive finitesize scaling analysis combined with renormalization group methods. The resultsare consistent with a value for the universal critical exponent for gravitation$\nu=1/3$, and suggest a simple relationship between Newton's constant, thegravitational correlation length and the observable average space-timecurvature. Some perhaps testable phenomenological implications are discussed,such as the scale dependence of Newton's constant and properties of quantumcurvature fluctuations.
