We study the three dimensional Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS$_3$) black holewhich corresponds essentially to a conical defect. We compute the mass of theSdS$_3$ black hole from the correct definition of the mass in asymptotically deSitter space. Then we clarify the relation between the mass, entropy andtemperature for this black hole without any ambiguity. Also we establish theSdS$_3$/CFT$_2$-correspondence for the entropy by applying the Cardy formula toa CFT with a central charge $c=3\ell/2G_3$. Finally we discuss the entropybounds for the SdS$_3$ black hole.
