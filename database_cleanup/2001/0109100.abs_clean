Although the equations of motion for the Neveu-Schwarz (NS) and Ramond (R)sectors of open superstring field theory can be covariantly expressed in termsof one NS and one R string field, picture-changing problems prevent theconstruction of an action involving these two string fields. However, aconsistent action can be constructed by dividing the NS and R states into threestring fields which are real, chiral and antichiral.The open superstring field theory action includes a WZW-like term for thereal field and holomorphic Chern-Simons-like terms for the chiral andantichiral fields. Different versions of the action can be constructed witheither manifest d=8 Lorentz covariance or manifest N=1 d=4 super-Poincar\'ecovariance. The lack of a manifestly d=10 Lorentz covariant action is relatedto the self-dual five-form in the Type IIB R-R sector.
