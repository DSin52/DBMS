Consistency conditions for the local existence of massless spin 3/2 fieldshas been explored that the field equations for massless helicity 3/2 areconsistent iff the space-time is Ricci-flat and that in Minkowski space-timethe space of conserved charges for the fields is its twistor space itself.After considering the twistorial methods to study such massless helicity 3/2fields, we derive in flat space-time that the charges of spin-3/2 fieldsdefined topologically by the first Chern number of their spin-lowered self-dualMaxwell fields, are given by their twistor space, and in curved space-time thatthe (anti-)self-duality of the space-time is the necessary condition. Since inN=1 supergravity torsions are the essential ingredients, we generalize ourspace-time to that with torsion (Einstein-Cartan theory) and have investigatedthe consistency of existence of spin 3/2 fields in it. A simple solution isfound that the space-time has to be conformally (anti-)self-dual, left-(orright-)torsion-free. The integrability condition on $\alpha$-surface shows thatthe (anti-)self-dual Weyl spinor can be described only by the covariantderivative of the right-(left-)handed-torsion.
