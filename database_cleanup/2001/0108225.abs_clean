In order to estimate the effect of dynamical gluons to chiral condensate, thegap equation of SU(2) gauged Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, under a constantbackground magnetic field, is investigated up to the two-loop order in 2+1 and3+1 dimensions. We set up a general formulation allowing both cases of electricas well as magnetic background field. We rely on the proper time method tomaintain gauge invariance. In 3+1 dimensions chiral symmetry breaking($\chi$SB) is enhanced by gluons even in zero background magnetic field andbecomes much striking as the background field grows larger. In 2+1 dimensionsgluons also enhance $\chi$SB but whose dependence on the background field isfixed four-fermi coupling.
