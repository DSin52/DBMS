The properties of brane-antibrane systems and systems of unstable D-branes inType II superstring theory are investigated using the formalism ofsuperconnections. The low-energy open string dynamics is shown to be probed bygeneralized Dirac operators. The corresponding index theorems are used tocompute the chiral gauge anomalies in these systems, and hence theirgravitational and Ramond-Ramond couplings. A spectral action for thegeneralized Dirac operators is also computed and shown to exhibit precisely theexpected processes of tachyon condensation on the brane worldvolumes. TheChern-Simons couplings are thereby shown to be naturally related to Fredholmmodules and bivariant K-theory, confirming the expectations that D-brane chargeis properly classified by K-homology.
