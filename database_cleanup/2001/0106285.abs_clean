We construct cosmological solutions of four-dimensional effective heteroticM-theory with a moving five-brane and evolving dilaton and T modulus. It isshown that the five-brane generates a transition between two asymptoticrolling-radii solutions. Moreover, the five-brane motion always drives thesolutions towards strong coupling asymptotically. We present an explicitexample of a negative-time branch solution which ends in a brane collisionaccompanied by a small-instanton transition. The five-dimensional origin ofsome of our solutions is also discussed.
