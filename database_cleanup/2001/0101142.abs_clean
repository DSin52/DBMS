We give graphical rules, based on earlier work for the functional Schrodingerequation, for constructing the density matrix for scalar and gauge fields atfinite temperature T. More useful is a dimensionally-reduced effective action(DREA) constructed from the density matrix by further functional integrationover the arguments of the density matrix coupled to a source. The DREA is aneffective action in one less dimension which may be computed order by order inperturbation theory or by dressed-loop expansions; it encodes all thermalmatrix elements. The DREA is useful because it gives a dimensionally-reducedfield theory usable at any T including infinity, where it yields the usualdimensionally-reduced field theory (DRFT). However, it cannot and does not havespurious infinities which sometimes occur in the density matrix or the DRFT;these come from ln T factors at infinite temperature. An example of spuriousdivergences in the DRFT occurs in d 2+1 $\phi^4$ theory dimensionally reducedto d=2. We show that the rules for the DREA replace these "wrong" divergencesin physical parameters by calculable powers of ln T; we also compute the phasetransition temperature of this theory at one loop order.
