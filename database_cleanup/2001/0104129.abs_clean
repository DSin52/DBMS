A geometrical interpretation of Grassmannian anticommuting coordinates isgiven. They are taken to represent an indefiniteness inherent in everyspacetime point on the level of the spacetime foam. This indeterminacy isconnected with the fact that in quantum gravity in some approximation we do notGrassmanian numbers, (b) a displacement of the wormhole mouth is connected witha change of the Grassmanian numbers (coordinates). In such an interpretation ofsupersymmetry the corresponding supersymmetrical fields must be described in aninvariant manner on the background of the spacetime foam.
