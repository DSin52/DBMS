We use a 0-brane to probe a ten-dimensional near-extremal black hole with Nunits of 0-brane charge. We work directly in the dual strongly-coupled quantummechanics, using mean-field methods to describe the black hole backgroundnon-perturbatively. We obtain the distribution of W boson masses, and find aclear separation between light and heavy degrees of freedom. To localize theprobe we introduce a resolving time and integrate out the heavy modes. After anon-trivial change of coordinates, the effective potential for the probe agreeswith supergravity expectations. We compute the entropy of the probe, and findthat the stretched horizon of the black hole arises dynamically in the quantummechanics, as thermal restoration of unbroken U(N+1) gauge symmetry. Ouranalysis of the quantum mechanics predicts a correct relation between thehorizon radius and entropy of a black hole.
