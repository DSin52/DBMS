The two-component approach to the one-dimensional Dirac equation is appliedto the Woods-Saxon potential. The scattering and bound state solutions arederived and the conditions for a transmission resonance (when the transmissioncoefficient is unity) and supercriticality (when the particle bound state is atE=-m) are then derived. The square potential limit is discussed. The recentresult that a finite-range symmetric potential barrier will have a transmissionresonance of zero-momentum when the corresponding well supports a half-boundstate at E=-m is demonstrated.
