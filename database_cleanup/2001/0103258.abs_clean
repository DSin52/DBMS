The Spinning Particle Model for anyon is analysed in the Batalin-Tyutinscheme of quantisation in extended phase space. Here additional degrees offreedom are introduced in the phase space such that all the constraints in thetheory are rendered First Class that is commuting in the sense of PoissonBrackets. Thus the theory can be studied without introducing the Dirac Bracketswhich appear in the presence of non-commuting or Second Class constraints. Inthe present case the Dirac Brackets make the configuration space of the anyonnon-canonical and also being dynamical variable dependent, poses problems forthe quantisation programme. We show that previously obtained results, (e.g.gyromagnetic ratio of anyon being 2), are recovered in the Batalin-Tyutinvariable independent sector in the extended space. The Batalin-Tyutin variablecontributions are significant and are computable in a straightforward manner.The latter can beunderstood as manifestations of the non-commutative space-timein the enlarged phase space.
