Extending previous work, we calculate in this note the fermionic spectrum oftwo-dimensional QCD (QCD_2) in the formulation with SU(N_c) currents. Togetherwith the results in the bosonic sector this allows to address the as yetunresolved task of finding the single-particle states of this theory as afunction of the ratio of the numbers of flavors and colors, \lambda=N_f/N_c,anew. We construct the Hamiltonian matrix in DLCQ formulation as an algebraicfunction of the harmonic resolution K and the continuous parameter \lambda.Amongst the more surprising findings in the fermionic sector chiefly consideredhere is that the fermion momentum is a function of \lambda. This dependence isnecessary in order to reproduce the well-known 't Hooft and large N_f spectra.Remarkably, those spectra have the same single-particle content as the ones inthe bosonic sectors. The twist here is the dramatically different sizes of theFock bases in the two sectors, which makes it possible to interpret inprinciple all states of the discrete approach. The hope is that some of thisinsight carries over into the continuum. We also present some new findingsconcerning the single-particle spectrum of the adjoint theory.
