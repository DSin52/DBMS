In the conformal field theories having affine SL(2) symmetry, we study theoperator product expansion (OPE) involving primary fields in highest weightrepresentations. For this purpose, we analyze properties of primary fields withdefinite SL(2) weights, and calculate their two- and three-point functions.Using these correlators, we show that the correct OPE is obtained when one ofthe primary fields belongs to the degenerate highest weight representation. Webriefly comment on the OPE in the SL(2,R) WZNW model.
