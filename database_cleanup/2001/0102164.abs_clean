The multiloop amplitudes for open bosonic string in presence of a constantB-field are derived from first principles. The basic ingredients of theconstruction are the commutation relations for the string modes and the Reggeonvertex describing the interaction among three generic string states. Themodifications due to the presence of the B-field affect non--trivially only thezero modes. This makes it possible to write in a simple and elegant way thegeneral expression for multiloop string amplitudes in presence of a constantB-field. The field theory limit of these string amplitudes is also considered.We show that it reproduces exactly the Feynman diagrams of noncommutative fieldtheories. Issues of UV/IR are briefly discussed.
