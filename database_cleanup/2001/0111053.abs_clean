We prove, for an arbitrary finite root system, the periodicity conjecture ofAl.B.Zamolodchikov concerning Y-systems, a particular class of functionalrelations arising in the theory of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. Algebraically,Y-systems can be viewed as families of rational functions defined by certainbirational recurrences formulated in terms of the underlying root system. Inthe course of proving periodicity, we obtain explicit formulas for all theserational functions, which turn out to always be Laurent polynomials.In a closely related development, we introduce and study a family ofsimplicial complexes that can be associated to arbitrary root systems. In typeA, our construction produces Stasheff's associahedron, whereas in type B, itgives the Bott-Taubes polytope, or cyclohedron. We enumerate the faces of thesecomplexes, prove that their geometric realization is always a sphere, anddescribe them in concrete combinatorial terms for the classical types ABCD.
