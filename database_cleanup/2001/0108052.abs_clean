A chemical potential may be introduced into the AdS/CFT correspondence bysetting the D3 branes of the construction spinning. In the field theory thefermionic modes are expected to condense as Cooper pairs, although at zerotemperature the chemical potential destabilizes the scalar sector of the N=4theory obscuring this phenomena. We show, in the case where a chemicalpotential is introduced for a small number of the gauge colours, that there isa metastable vacuum for the scalar fields where fermionic Cooper pairing isapparently manifest. In this vacuum the D3 branes expand non-commutatively (tobalance the centrifugal force) into a D5 brane, in a mechanism analogous toHarmark and Savvidy's (M)atrix theory construction of a spinning D2 brane. Weshow that the D5 brane acts as a source for the RR 3-form whose UV scaling andsymmetries are those of a fermion bilinear. The D5 brane rotates within the S^5and so decays by the emission of RR fields which we interpret as the metastablevacuum decaying via higher dimension operators.
