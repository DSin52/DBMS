We study supersymmetry breaking effects in N=1 SYM from the point of view ofquantum effective actions. Restrictions on the geometry of the effectivepotential from superspace are known to be problematic in quantum effectiveactions, where explicit supersymmetry breaking can and must be studied. On theother hand the true ground state can be determined from this effective action,only. We study whether some parts of superspace geometry are still relevant forthe effective potential and discuss whether the ground states found this wayjustify a low energy approximation based on this geometry. The answer to bothbehavior of the auxiliary fields completely and demand for a new interpretationof superspace geometry. These non-semiclassical effects can breaksupersymmetry.
