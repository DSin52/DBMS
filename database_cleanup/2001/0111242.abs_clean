The basic results in calculations of the thermodynamic functions ofelectromagnetic field in the background of a dilute dielectric ball at zero andfinite temperature are presented. Summation over the angular momentum values isaccomplished in a closed form by making use of the addition theorem for therelevant Bessel functions. The behavior of the thermodynamic characteristics inthe low and high temperature limits is investigated. The $T^3$-term in the lowtemperature expansion of the free energy is recovered (this term has been lostin our previous calculations).
