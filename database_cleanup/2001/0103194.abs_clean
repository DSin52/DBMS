The behaviour of the 3D axial next-nearest neighbour Ising (ANNNI) model atthe uniaxial Lifshitz point is studied using Monte Carlo techniques. A newvariant of the Wolff cluster algorithm permits the analysis of systems farlarger than in previous studies. The Lifshitz point critical exponents are$\alpha=0.18(2)$, $\beta=0.238(5)$ and $\gamma=1.36(3)$. Data for the spin-spincorrelation function are shown to be consistent with the explicit scalingfunction derived from the assumption of local scale invariance, which is ageneralization of conformal invariance to the anisotropic scaling {\em at} theLifshitz point.
