In Quantum Mechanics operators must be hermitian and, in a direct productspace, symmetric. These properties are saved by Lie algebra operators but notby those of quantum algebras. A possible correspondence between observables andquantum algebra operators is suggested by extending the definition of matrixelements of a physical observable, including the eventual projection on theappropriate symmetric space. This allows to build in the Lie space ofrepresentations one-parameter families of operators belonging to the envelopingLie algebra that satisfy an approximate symmetry and have the propertiesrequired by physics.
