We consider SU(2) gauge potentials over a space with a compactifieddimension. A non-Abelian Fourier transform of the gauge potential in thecompactified dimension is defined in such a way that the Fourier coefficientsare (almost) gauge invariant. The functional measure and the gauge fieldstrengths are expressed in terms of these Fourier coefficients. The emergingformulation of the non-Abelian gauge theory turns out to be an Abelian gaugetheory of a set of fields defined over the initial space with the compactifieddimension excluded. The Abelian theory contains an Abelian gauge field, ascalar field, and an infinite tower of vector matter fields, some of whichcarry Abelian charges. Possible applications of this formalism are discussedbriefly.
