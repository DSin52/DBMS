The topology of center vortices is studied. For this purpose it is sufficientto consider mathematically idealised vortices, defined in a gauge invariant wayas closed (infinitely thin) flux surfaces (in D=4 dimensions) which contributethe n'th power of a non-trivial center element to Wilson loops when they aren-foldly linked to the latter. In ordinary 3-space generic center vorticesrepresent closed magnetic flux loops which evolve in time. I show that thetopological charge of such a time-dependent vortex loop can be entirelyexpressed by the temporal changes of its writhing number.
