Effective field theories with (large) extra dimensions are studied within aphysical regularization scheme provided by string theory. Explicit stringcalculations then allow us to consistently analyze the ultraviolet sensitivityof Kaluza--Klein theories in the presence or absence of low energysupersymmetry.
