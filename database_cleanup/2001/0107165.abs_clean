We generalize the Jackiw-Rebbi-Hasenfratz-'t Hooft construction of fermionsfrom bosons to demonstrate the fermionic nature of certain bound statesinvolving SU(N) instantons in even spatial dimensions and SO(N) instantons in$8k+1$ spatial dimensions. We use this result to identify several fermionicexcitations in various perturbatively bosonic string theories. In some exampleswe are able to identify these fermions as excitations in known conformal fieldtheories and independently confirm their fermionic nature. Examples of thefermions we find include certain 3-string junctions in type 0B theory,excitations of the 0-p system in type 0A theory, excitations of the stableD-particle of type O theory, and a rich spectrum of fermions in the bosonicstring compactified on the SO(32) group lattice.
