We study the supersymmetric GUT models where the supersymmetry and GUT gaugesymmetry can be broken by the discrete symmetry. First, with the ansatz thatthere exist discrete symmetries in the branes' neighborhoods, we discuss thegeneral reflection $Z_2$ symmetries and GUT breaking on $M^4\times M^1$ and$M^4\times M^1\times M^1$. In those models, the extra dimensions can be largeand the KK states can be set arbitrarily heavy. Second, considering the extraspace manifold is the annulus $A^2$ or disc $D^2$, we can define any $Z_n$symmetry and break any 6-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric SU(M) models down tothe 4-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)^{M-4}$models for the zero modes. In particular, there might exist the interestingscenario on $M^4\times A^2$ where just a few KK states are light, while theothers are relatively heavy. Third, we discuss the complete global discretesymmetries on $M^4\times T^2$ and study the GUT breaking.
