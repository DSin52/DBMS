This article presents the derivation of the stress-energy tensor of a freescalar field with a general non-linear dispersion relation in curved spacetime.This dispersion relation is used as a phenomelogical description of the shortdistance structure of spacetime following the conventional approach oftrans-Planckian modes in black hole physics and in cosmology. Thisstress-energy tensor is then used to discuss both the equation of state oftrans-Planckian modes in cosmology and the magnitude of their backreactionduring inflation. It is shown that gravitational waves of trans-Planckianmomenta but subhorizon frequencies cannot account for the form of cosmic vacuumenergy density observed at present, contrary to a recent claim. Thebackreaction effects during inflation are confirmed to be important and genericfor those dispersion relations that are liable to induce changes in the powerspectrum of metric fluctuations. Finally, it is shown that in pure de Sitterinflation there is no modification of the power spectrum except for a possiblemagnification of its overall amplitude independently of the dispersionrelation.
