We show that the Abelian Higgs field equations in the background of the fourdimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole have a vortex line solution. Thissolution, which has axial symmetry, is a generalization of the AdS spacetimeNielsen-Olesen string. By a numerical study of the field equations, we showthat black hole could support the Abelian Higgs field as its Abelian hair.Also, we conside the self gravity of the Abelian Higgs field both in the pureAdS spacetime and AdS-Schwarzschild black hole background and show that theeffect of string as a black hole hair is to induce a deficit angle in theAdS-Schwarzschild black hole.
