Quantum field theory in 4+1 dimensional bulk space with boundary,representing a 3-brane, is considered. We study the impact of the initialconditions in the bulk on the field dynamics on the brane. We demonstrate thatthese conditions determine the Kaluza-Klein measure. We also establish theexistence of a rich family of quantum fields on the brane, generated by thesame bulk action, but corresponding to different initial conditions. A simpleclassification of these fields is proposed and it is shown that some of themlead to ultraviolet finite theories, which have some common features withstrings.
