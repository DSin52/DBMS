We show that the entropy of any black object in any dimension can beunderstood as the entropy of a highly excited string on the stretched horizon.The string has a gravitationally renormalized tension due to the large redshiftnear the horizon. The Hawking temperature is given by the Hagedorn temperatureof the string. As examples, we consider black holes with one (black p-branes)or two charges, Reissner-Nordstrom black holes and the BTZ black hole inaddition to Schwarzschild black holes. We show that the vanishing andnonvanishing extremal entropies can be obtained as smooth limits of thenear-extreme cases.
