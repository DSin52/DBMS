We provide the explicit gauging of all the SU(2,1) isometries of one N=2supergravity hypermultiplet, which spans SU(2,1)/U(2) coset space parameterizedin terms of two complex projective coordinate fields z_1 and z_2. We derive thefull, explicit Killing prepotential that specifies the most generalsuperpotential. As an application we consider the supersymmetric flowthe flat, supersymmetric space-time and (ii) the flow that violates c-theoremwith the superpotential crossing zero.
