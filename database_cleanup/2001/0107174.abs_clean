We study static brane configurations in the bulk background of thetopological black holes in asymptotically flat spacetime. We find that suchconfigurations are possible even for flat black hole horizon, unlike the AdSblack hole case. We construct the brane world model with an orbifold structureS^1/Z_2 in such bulk background. We also study massless bulk scalar field.
