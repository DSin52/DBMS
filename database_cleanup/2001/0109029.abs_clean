Title: Introductory Lectures on D-Branes

Comments: 49 pages, LATeX file, some minor errors corrected and references

addedThis is a pedagogical introduction to D-branes, addressed to graduatestudents in field theory and particle physics and to other beginners in stringtheory. I am not going to review the most recent results since there arealready many good papers on web devoted to that. Instead, I will present someold techniques in some detail in order to show how some basic properties ofstrinfs and branes as the massless spectrum of string, the effective action ofD-branes and their tension can be computed using QFT techniques. Also, I willpresent shortly the boundary state description of D-branes. The details areexposed for bosonic branes since I do not assume any previous knowledge ofsupersymmetry which is not a requirement for this school. However, forcompleteness and to provide basic notions for other lectures, I will discusssome properties of supersymemtric branes. The present lectures were deliveredat Jorge Andr\'{e} Swieca School on Particle and Fields, 2001, Campos doJord\~{a}o, Brazil.
