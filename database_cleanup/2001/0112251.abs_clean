Superconformal transformations are derived for the $\N=2,4 supermultipletscorresponding to the simplest chiral primary operators. These are applied totwo, three and four point correlation functions. When $\N=4$, results areobtained for the three point function of various descendant operators,including the energy momentum tensor and SU(4) current. For both $\N=2$ or 4superconformal identities are derived for the functions of the two conformalinvariants appearing in the four point function for the chiral primaryoperator. These are solved in terms of a single arbitrary function of the twoconformal invariants and one or three single variable functions. The resultsare applied to the operator product expansion using the exact formula for thecontribution of an operator in the operator product expansion in fourdimensions to a scalar four point function. Explicit expressions representingexactly the contribution of both long and possible short supermultiplets to thechiral primary four point function are obtained. These are applied to give theleading perturbative and large N corrections to the scale dimensions of longsupermultiplets.
