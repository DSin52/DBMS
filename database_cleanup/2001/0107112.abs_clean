We consider the path-sum of Ponzano-Regge with additional boundarycontributions in the context of the holographic principle of Quantum Gravity.We calculate an holographic projection in which the bulk partition functiongoes to a semi-classical limit while the boundary state functional remainsquantum-mechanical. The properties of the resulting boundary theory arediscussed.
