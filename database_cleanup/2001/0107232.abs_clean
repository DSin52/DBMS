Workshop, National Observatory of Athens (Penteli), 19-20 April 2001.References addedInflation is now a basic ingredient of the modern cosmology. After reviewingthe basic characteristics of inflation, we briefly discuss inflation in stringand brane theories, focusing on the problem of the exit from inflation in thesetheories. We present a model, based on type-0 string theory, in which ouruniverse after the inflationary phase, passes smoothly to a flatRobertson-Walker universe.
