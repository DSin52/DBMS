Classical configurations of a M2-brane, a D2-brane and D0-branes areinvestigated in the background of an infinite array of M5-branes or NS5-branes.On the M2-brane, we discuss three kinds of configurations, such as a sphere, acylinder and a torus-like one. These are stabilized by virtue of the backgroundfluxes of M5-branes. The torus-like M2-brane configuration has winding andmomentum numbers of 11th direction, and in terms of the type IIA superstringtheory, this corresponds to a torus-like D2-brane with electric and magneticfluxes on it. We also reproduce the same configuration from a non-abelianBorn-Infeld action for D0-branes. It will be a construction of closed stringsfrom D0-branes. An electric flux quantization condition on the D2-brane is alsodiscussed in terms of D0-branes.
