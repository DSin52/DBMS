We consider gauge bosons in the bulk of AdS5 in a two-brane theory thataddresses the hierarchy problem. We show such a theory can be consistent withgauge coupling unification at a high scale. We discuss subtleties in thiscalculation and show how to regulate consistently in a bounded AdS5 background.Our regularization is guided by the holographic dual of the calculation.
