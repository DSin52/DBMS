Quantization is still a central problem of modern physics. One example of anunsolved problem is the quantization of Nambu mechanics. After a brief commenton the role of Harrison cohomology, this review concentrates on the centralproblem of quantization of QCD and, more generally, quark confinement seen as aproblem of quantization. Several suggestions are made, some of them ratherextravagant.
