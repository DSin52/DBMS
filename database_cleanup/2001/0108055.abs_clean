We study gravity in codimension-2 brane world scenarios with infinite volumeextra dimensions. In particular, we consider the case where the brane hasnon-zero tension. The extra space then is a two-dimensional ``wedge'' with adeficit angle. In such backgrounds we can effectively have the Einstein-Hilbertterm on the brane at the classical level if we include higher curvature(Gauss-Bonnet) terms in the bulk. Alternatively, such a term would be generatedat the quantum level if the brane matter is not conformal. We study(linearized) gravity in the presence of the Einstein-Hilbert term on the branein such backgrounds. We find that, just as in the original codimension-2Dvali-Gabadadze model with a tensionless brane, gravity is almost completelylocalized on the brane with ultra-light modes penetrating into the bulk.
