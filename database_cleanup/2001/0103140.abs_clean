Rajasekaran, IMSc-report No. 119, Eds. D. Indumathi, M.V.N. Murthy and R.Parthasarathy, Chapter 12 (2001) pp. 73--79We sketch briefly the essentials of the quantum groups and their applicationto the dynamics of a q-deformed simple harmonic oscillator moving on a quantumline, defined in the q-deformed cotangent (momentum phase) space. In thisendeavour, the quantum group $GL_{qp} (2)$- and the conventional rotationalinvariances are respected together. During the course of this discussion, wetouch upon Rajaji's personality as a critical physicist and a bold andadventurous man of mathematical physics.
