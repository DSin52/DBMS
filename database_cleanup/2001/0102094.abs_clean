2000, Ft. Lauderdale, 14-17 December 2000, to appear in the proceedings,Kluwer Academic PressIt appears that string-M-theory is the only viable candidate for a completetheory of matter. It must therefore contain both gravity and QCD. What isparticularly surprising is the recent conjecture that strongly coupled QCDmatrix elements can be evaluated though a duality with weakly coupled gravity.To date there has been no direct verification of this conjecture by Maldacenabecause of the difficulty of direct strong coupling calculations in gaugetheories. We report here on some progress in evaluating a gauge-invariantcorrelator in the non-perturbative regime in two and three dimensions in SYMtheories. The calculations are made using supersymmetric discrete light-conequantization (SDLCQ). We consider a Maldacena-type conjecture applied to thenear horizon geometry of a D1-brane in the supergravity approximation, solvethe corresponding N=(8,8) SYM theory in two dimensions, and evaluate thecorrelator of the stress-energy tensor. Our numerical results support theMaldacena conjecture and are within 10-15% of the predicted results. We alsopresent a calculation of the stress-energy correlator in N=1 SYM theory in 2+1dimensions. While there is no known duality relatingthis theory tosupergravity, the theory does have massless BPS states, and the correlatorgives important information about the BPS wave function in the non-perturbativeregime.
