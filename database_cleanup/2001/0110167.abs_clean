A long-standing problem of theoretical physics is the exceptionally smallvalue of the cosmological constant $\Lambda \sim 10^{-120}$ measured in naturalPlanckian units. Here we derive this tiny number from a toroidal stringcosmology based on closed strings. In this picture the dark energy arises fromthe correlation between momentum and winding modes that for short distances hasan exponential fall-off with increasing values of the momenta.The freeze-out bythe expansion of the background universe for these transplanckian modes may beinterpreted as a frozen condensate of the closed-string modes in the threenon-compactified spatial dimensions.
