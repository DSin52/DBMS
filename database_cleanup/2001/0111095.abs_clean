Several models in NCG with mild changes to the standard model(SM)areintroduced to discuss the neutrino mass problem. We use two constraints,Poincar$\acute{e}$ duality and gauge anomaly free, to discuss the possibilityof containing right-handed neutrinos in them. Our work shows that no model inthis paper, with each generation containing a right-handed neutrino, cansatisfy these two constraints in the same time. So, to consist with neutrinooscillation experiment results, maybe fundamental changes to the presentversion of NCG are usually needed to include Dirac massive neutrinos.
