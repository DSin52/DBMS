Title: Noncommutative X-Y model and Kosterlitz Thouless transition

Comments: 15 pages, TeX with harvmac

Matrix models have been shown to be equivalent to noncommutative fieldtheories. In this work we study noncommutative X-Y model and try to understandKosterlitz Thouless transition in it by analysing the equivalent matrix model.We consider the cases of a finite lattice and infinite lattice separately. Weshow that the critical value of the matrix model coupling is identical for thefinite and infinite lattice cases. However, the critical values of the couplingof the continuum field theory, in the large $ N $ limit, is finite in theinfinite lattice case and zero in the case of finite lattice.
