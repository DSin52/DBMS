Theoretical Methods in Physics, July 31 - August 05, 2000, Dubna (Russia)A root systems in Carroll spaces with degenerate metric are defined. It isshown that their Cartan matrices and reflection groups are affine. With thehelp of the geometric consideration the root system structure of affinealgebras is determined by a sufficiently simple algorithm.
