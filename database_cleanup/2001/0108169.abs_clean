Using the method developed in {\tt hep-th/0103015}, we determine thenon-abelian Born-Infeld action through ${\cal O}(\alpha'{}^3)$. We start fromsolutions to a Yang-Mills theory which define a stable holomorphic vectorbundle. Subsequently we investigate its deformation away from this limit.Through $ {\cal O}(\alpha'{}^2)$, a unique, modulo field redefinitions,solution emerges. At $ {\cal O}(\alpha'{}^3)$ we find a one-parameter family ofallowed deformations. The presence of derivative terms turns out to beessential. Finally, we present a detailed comparison of our results toexisting, partial results.
