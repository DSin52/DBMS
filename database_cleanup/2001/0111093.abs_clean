In this paper we discuss the question of whether the entropy of cosmologicalhorizon in some asymptotically de Sitter spaces can be described by theCardy-Verlinde formula, which is supposed to be an entropy formula of conformalfield theory in any dimension. For the Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution,although the gravitational mass is always negative (in the sense of theprescription in hep-th/0110108 to calculate the conserved charges ofasymptotically de Sitter spaces), we find that indeed the entropy ofcosmological horizon can be given by using naively the Cardy-Verlinde formula.The entropy of pure de Sitter spaces can also be expressed by theCardy-Verlinde formula. For the topological de Sitter solutions, which have acosmological horizon and a naked singularity, the Cardy-Verlinde formula alsoworks well. Our result is in favour of the dS/CFT correspondence.
