We identify a class of chiral models where the one-loop effective potentialfor Higgs scalar fields is finite without any requirement of supersymmetry. Itcorresponds to the case where the Higgs fields are identified with thecomponents of a gauge field along compactified extra dimensions. We present asix dimensional model with gauge group U(3)xU(3) and quarks and leptonsaccomodated in fundamental and bi-fundamental representations. The model can beembedded in a D-brane configuration of type I string theory and, uponcompactification on a T^2/Z_2 orbifold, it gives rise to the standard modelwith two Higgs doublets.
