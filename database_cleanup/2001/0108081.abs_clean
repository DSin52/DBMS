Title: Self-tuning solutions of the cosmological constant

Comments: Latex file of 9 pages. Talk presented at SUSY'01, Dubna, Russia,

11--17 June 2001I briefly review the cosmological constant problem and attempts toward itssolution, and present the first nontrivial example for the self-tuningmechanism with a $1/H^2$ term with the antisymmetric field strength $H_{MNPQ}$in a 5D RS-II setup.
