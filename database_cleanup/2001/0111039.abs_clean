Many years ago Friedman and Sorkin [1] established the existence of certaintopological solitonic excitations in quantum gravity called (topological)geons. Geons can have quantum numbers like charge and can be tensorial orspinorial having integer or half-odd integer spin. A striking result is thatgeons can violate the canonical spin-statistics connection [2,3]. Suchviolation induces novel physical effects at low energies. The latter will besmall since the geon mass is expected to be of the order of Plank mass.Nevertheless, these effects are very striking and include CPT and causalityviolations and distortion of the cosmic microwave spectrum. Interestingrelations of geon dynamics to supersymmetry are also discussed.
