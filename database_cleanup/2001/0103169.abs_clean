The D1-D5 system is believed to have an `orbifold point' in its moduli spacewhere its low energy theory is a N=4 supersymmetric sigma model with targetspace M^N/S^N, where M is T^4 or K3. We study correlation functions of chiraloperators in CFTs arising from such a theory. We construct a basic class ofchiral operators from twist fields of the symmetric group and the generators ofthe superconformal algebra. We find explicitly the 3-point functions for thesechiral fields at large N; these expressions are `universal' in that they areindependent of the choice of M. We observe that the result is a significantlysimpler expression than the corresponding expression for the bosonic theorybased on the same orbifold target space.
