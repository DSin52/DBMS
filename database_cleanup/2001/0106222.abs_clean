in the Proceedings, Editors H. J. de Vega, I. Khalatnikov, N. Sanchez.(Kluwer Pub)Accurate and powerful analytic and computational methods developped by theauthor allow to obtain the highly non trivial total absorption spectrum of theBlack Hole, as well as phase shifts and cross sections (elastic and inelastic),the angular distribution of absorbed and scattered waves, and the Hawkingemission rates. The exact total absorption spectrum of waves by the Black Holepresents as a function of frequency a remarkable oscillatory behaviourcharacteristic of a diffraction pattern. It oscillates around its opticalgeometric limit (27/4) pi (r_s)^2 with decreasing amplitude and almost constantperiod. This is an unique distinctive feature of the black hole absorption, anddue to its r=0 singularity. Ordinary absorptive bodies and optical models donot present these features. The Hamiltonian describing the wave-black holeinteraction is non hermitian (despite being real) due to its singularity at theorigin (r=0). The unitarity optical theorem of scattering theory is generalizedto the black hole case explicitely showing that absorption takes place only atthe origin (r = 0). All these results allow to understand and reproduce theBlack Hole absorption spectrum in terms of Fresnel-Kirchoff diffraction theory.These fundamental features will be present for generic higher dimensional BlackHole backgrounds, and whatever the low energy effective theory they arise from.In recent and increasing litterature on absorption cross sections (`grey bodyfactors') of black holes (whatever ordinary, stringy, D-braned), thefundamental remarkable features of the Black Hole Absorption spectrum areoverlooked.
