The aim of this paper is to find out a correspondence between one-loopeffective action $W_E$ defined by means of path integral in Euclidean gravityand the free energy $F$ obtained by summation over the modes. The analysis isgiven for quantum fields on stationary space-times of a general form. For suchproblems a convenient procedure of a "Wick rotation" from Euclidean toLorentzian theory becomes quite non-trivial implying transition from one realsection of a complexified space-time manifold to another. We formulateconditions under which $F$ and $W_E$ can be connected and establish an explicitrelation of these functionals. Our results are based on the Kaluza-Klein methodwhich enables one to reduce the problem on a stationary space-time toequivalent problem on a static space-time in the presence of a gaugeconnection. As a by-product, we discover relation between the asymptoticheat-kernel coefficients of elliptic operators on a $D$ dimensional stationaryspace-times and the heat-kernel coefficients of a $D-1$ dimensional ellipticoperators with an Abelian gauge connection.
