Comments: Talk given at the 10th Lomonosov Conference on Elementary Particle

Physics, Moscow, Russia, August 23rd - 29th, 2001; 7 pages, LaTeX2e, usesws-p8-50x6-00.cls, no figuresThe renormalization-group (RG) flow in the finite-temperature(2+1)-dimensional Georgi-Glashow model is explored. This is done in the limitwhen the squared electric coupling constant is much larger than the mass of theHiggs field. The novel equation describing the evolution of the Higgs mass isderived and integrated along the separatrices of the RG flow in the limit whenthe original theory reduces to the 2D XY model. In particular, it is checkedthat in the vicinity of the phase-transition point, there exists a range ofparameters allowing to the Higgs mass evolved along some of the separatrices toremain much smaller than the squared electric coupling constant.
