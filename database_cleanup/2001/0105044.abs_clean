We study non-supersymmetric SO(3)-invariant deformations of d=3, N=8 superYang-Mills theory and their type IIA string theory dual. By adding both gauginomass and scalar mass, dielectric D4-brane potential coincides with D5-branepotential in type IIB theory. We find the region of parameter space where thenon-supersymmetric vacuum is described by stable dielectric NS5-branes. Byconsidering the generalized action for NS5-branes in the presence of D4-flux,we also analyze the properties of dielectric NS5-branes.
