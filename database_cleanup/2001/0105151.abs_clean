There are two important examples of physical systems which violate the strongcosmological constant, and wormholes. We suggest that a positive cosmologicalconstant can be reconciled with string theory by considering wormholes inbrane-worlds with positive cosmological constants give rise to bulksingularities which are best resolved by embedding the brane-world in anAdS/CFT wormhole; and second, for the simplest kind of wormhole in anasymptotically AdS space, we show that the IR stability of the matter needed tokeep the wormhole open requires the presence of a brane-world. UV stabilityconditions then forbid a negative cosmological constant on the brane-world.
