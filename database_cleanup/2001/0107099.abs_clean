We derive an explicit expression for an associative *-product on fuzzycomplex projective spaces. This generalises previous results for the fuzzy2-sphere and gives a discrete non-commutative algebra of functions on fuzzycomplex projective spaces, represented by matrix multiplication. The matricesare restricted to ones whose dimension is that of the totally symmetricrepresentations of SU(N). In the limit of infinite dimensional matrices werecover the commutative algebra of functions on ordinary projective space.Derivatives on the fuzzy projective space are also expressed as matrixcommutators.
