Title: Refined Algebraic Quantization of Constrained Systems with Structure

FunctionsAuthors: Oleg Yu. Shvedov

Comments: 10 pages, LaTeX

The method of refined algebraic quantization of constrained systems which isbased on modification of the inner product of the theory rather than onimposing constraints on the physical states is generalized to the case ofconstrained systems with structure functions and open gauge algebras. A newprescription for inner product for the open-algebra systems is suggested. It isillustrated on a simple example. The correspondence between refined algebraicand BRST-BFV quantizations is investigated for the case of nontrivial structurefunctions.
