Gravitational tidal forces may induce polarization of D0 branes, in analogyto the same effects arising in the context of constant background gauge fields.Such phenomena can teach us about the correspondence between smooth curvedspacetime and its underlying non-commutative structure. However, unlikepolarization by gauge fields, the gravitational counterpart involves concernsregarding the classical stability of the corresponding polarized states. Inthis work, we study this issue with respect to the solutions presented inhep-th/0010237 and find that they are classically unstable. The instabilityhowever appears with intricate features with all but a few decay channels beinglifted. Through a detailed analysis, we then argue that these polarized statesmay be expected to be long-lived in a regime where the string coupling is smalland the number of D0 branes is large.
