Title: S-duality for 2-d gravity

Authors: J. A. Nieto

Comments: 15 pages, Latex

We investigate the analogue of S-duality for 2-d gravity. Our analysis isbased in a partition function associated to the Katanaev-Volovich type actionfor 2-d gravity. We find a S-dual 2-d gravitational action which is related tothe original 2-d gravitational action by strong-weak duality transformation.
