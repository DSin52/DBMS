correctedWe construct an eleven-dimensional superspace with superspace coordinates andformulate a finite M-theory using non-anticommutative geometry. The conjecturedM-theory has the correct eleven-dimensional supergravity low energy limit. Weconsider the problem of finding a stable finite M-theory which has de Sitterspace as a natural ground state, and the problem of eliminating possible futurehorizons.
