The free field realization of the eight-vertex model is extended to formfactors. It is achieved by constructing off-diagonal with respect to the groundstate sectors matrix elements of the $\Lambda$ operator which establishes arelation between corner transfer matrices of the eight-vertex model and of theSOS model. As an example, the two-particle form factor of the $\sigma^z$operator is evaluated explicitly.
