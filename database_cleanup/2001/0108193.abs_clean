Title: A gauge boson from the Kaluza-Klein approach of the Randall-Sundrum

brane worldComments: 7 pages, typo corrected and comments added

We clarify a mechanism to obtain a massless gauge boson from the Kaluza-Kleinapproach of the Randall-Sundrum(RS) brane world. This corresponds exactly tothe same mechanism of achieving a localization of the gauge boson by addingboth the bulk and brane mass terms. Accordingly this work puts another examplefor a localization-mechanism of the gauge boson on the brane.
