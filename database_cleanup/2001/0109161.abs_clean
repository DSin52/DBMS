We analyse in detail the quantization of a simple noncommutative model ofspontaneous symmetry breaking in zero dimensions taking into account thenoncommutative setting seriously. The connection to the counting argument ofFeyman diagrams of the corresponding theory in four dimensions is worked outexplicitly. Special emphasis is put on the motivation as well as thepresentation of some well-known basic notions of quantum field theory which inthe zero-dimensional theory can be studied without being spoiled by technicalcomplications due to the absence of divergencies.
