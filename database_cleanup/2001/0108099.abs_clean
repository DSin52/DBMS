We construct a class of spin foam models describing matter coupled togravity, such that the gravitational sector is described by the unitaryirreducible representations of the appropriate symmetry group, while the mattersector is described by the finite-dimensional irreducible representations ofthat group. The corresponding spin foam amplitudes in the four-dimensionalgravity case are expressed in terms of the spin network amplitudes forpentagrams with additional external and internal matter edges. We also give aquantum field theory formulation of the model, where the matter degrees offreedom are described by spin network fields carrying the indices from theappropriate group representation. In the non-topological Lorentzian gravitycase, we argue that the matter representations should be appropriate SO(3) orSO(2) representations contained in a given Lorentz matter representation,depending on whether one wants to describe a massive or a massless matterfield. The corresponding spin network amplitudes are given as multipleintegrals of propagators which are matrix spherical functions.
