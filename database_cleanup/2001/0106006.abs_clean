corrected, references addedWe study radial waves in (2+1)-dimensional noncommutative scalar fieldtheory, using operatorial methods. The waves propagate along a discrete radialcoordinate and are described by finite series deformations of Bessel-typefunctions. At radius much larger than the noncommutativity scale$\sqrt{\theta}$, one recovers the usual commutative behaviour. At smalldistances, classical divergences are smoothed out by noncommutativity.
