We study the quantization of chiral fermions coupled to generalized Diracoperators arising in NCG Yang-Mills theory. The cocycles describing chiralsymmetry breaking are calculated. In particular, we introduce a generalizedlocality principle for the cocycles. Local cocycles are by definitionexpressions which can be written as generalized traces of operator commutators.In the case of pseudodifferential operators, these traces lead in fact tointegrals of ordinary local de Rham forms. As an application of the generalideas we discuss the case of noncommutative tori. We also develop a gerbetheoretic approach to the chiral anomaly in hamiltonian quantization of NCGfield theory.
