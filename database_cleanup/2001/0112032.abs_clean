Unrenormalizable theories contain infinitely many free parameters.Considering these theories in terms of the Wilsonian renormalization group(RG), we suggest a method for removing this large ambiguity. Our basicassumption is the existence of the maximal ultraviolet cutoff in a cutofftheory, and we require that the theory be so fine-tuned as to reach the maximalcutoff. The theory so obtained behaves as a local continuum theory to theshortest distance. In concrete examples of the scalar theory we find that atleast in a certain approximation to the Wilsonian RG, this requirement enableus to make unique predictions in the infrared regime in terms of a finitenumber of independent parameters. Therefore, the method might provide a way forcalculating quantum corrections in a low-energy effective theory of quantumgravity.
