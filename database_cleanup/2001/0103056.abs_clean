The amplitudes in perturbative open string theory are examined as functionsof the tachyon condensate parameter. The boundary state formalism demonstratesthe decoupling of the open string modes at the non-perturbative minima of thetachyon potential via a degeneration of open world-sheets and identifies anindependence of the coupling constants $g_s$ and $g_{YM}$ at general values ofthe tachyon condensate. The closed sector is generated at the quantum level; itis also generated at the classical level through the condensation of thepropagating open string modes on the D-brane degrees of freedom.
