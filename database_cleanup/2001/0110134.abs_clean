A one-loop renormalization group (RG) analysis is performed fornoncommutative Landau-Ginsburg theory in an arbitrary dimension. We adopt amodern version of the Wilsonian RG approach, in which a shell integration inmomentum space bypasses the potential IR singularities due to UV-IR mixing. Themomentum-dependent trigonometric factors in interaction vertices,characteristic of noncommutative geometry, are marginal under RGtransformations, and their marginality is preserved at one loop. A negative$\Theta$-dependent anomalous dimension is discovered as a novel effect of theUV-IR mixing. We also found a noncommutative Wilson-Fisher (NCWF) fixed pointin less than four dimensions. At large noncommutativity, a momentum spaceinstability is induced by quantum fluctuations, and a consequential first-orderphase transition is identified together with a Lifshitz point in the phasediagram. In the vicinity of the Lifshitz point, we introduce two criticalexponents $\nu_m$ and $\beta_k$, whose values are determined to be 1/4 and 1/2,respectively, at mean-field level.
