It is speculated that the observed universe has a dual representation asrenormalization group flow between two conformal fixed points of athree-dimensional Euclidean field theory. The infrared fixed point correspondsto the inflationary phase in the far past. The ultraviolet fixed pointcorresponds to a de Sitter phase dominated by the cosmological constantindicated in recent astronomical data. The monotonic decrease of the Hubbleparameter corresponds to the irreversibility of renormalization group flow.
