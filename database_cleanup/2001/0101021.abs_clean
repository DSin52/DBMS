Superconvergence relations for the transverse gauge field propagator can beused in order to show that the corresponding gauge quanta are not elements ofthe physical state space, as defined by the BRST algebra. With a given gaugegroup, these relations are valid for a limited region in the number of matterfields, indicating a phase transition at the boundary. In the case of SUSYgauge theories with matter fields in the fundamental representation, theresults predicted by superconvergence can be compared directly with thoseobtained on the basis of duality and the conformal algebra. There is exactagreement.
