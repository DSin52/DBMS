Title: Dualities between K3 fibered Calabi-Yau three-folds

Authors: Mitsuko Abe

Comments: AmsLatex, 42 pages v2

We examine the relations of Calabi-Yau three-folds having the same Hodgenumbers, $(h^{1,1},h^{2,1})=(5,185)$ with the various number of K3 fibers. Wealso argue their implications to string duality.
