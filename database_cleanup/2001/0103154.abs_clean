We show how the classical string dynamics in $D$-dimensional gravitybackground can be reduced to the dynamics of a massless particle constrained ona certain surface whenever there exists at least one Killing vector for thebackground metric. We obtain a number of sufficient conditions, which ensurethe existence of exact solutions to the equations of motion and constraints.These results are extended to include the Kalb-Ramond background. The$D1$-brane dynamics is also analyzed and exact solutions are found. Finally, weillustrate our considerations with several examples in different dimensions.All this also applies to the tensionless strings.
