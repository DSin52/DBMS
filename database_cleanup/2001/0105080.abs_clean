Title: Gravitational Stability and Screening Effect from Extra Timelike

DimensionsAuthors: Satoshi Matsuda

Comments: 4 pages, based on the invited talk at the XXXVIth Rencontres de

Moriond, to appear in proceedings. Typos correctedWe discuss extra timelike dimensions and their effects on the gravitationalstability of spherical massive bodies. Here we specifically report our resultsfor the case of one extra timelike dimension where we have made analyticallyrigorous investigations on the tachyonic graviton exchange due to the infinitetower of the Kaluza-Klein mode. With the scale $L$ of the extra timelikedimension we find that some spherical bodies of radius $R$ can be stable atcritical radii $R=2\pi Lp$ for some positive integer $p$. We also obtain thegeneric property of massive bodies that for the short distance range $0<R\leq\pi L$ the gravitational force due to the ordinary massless graviton exchangeis screened by the Kaluza-Klein mode exchange of tachyonic gravitons.
