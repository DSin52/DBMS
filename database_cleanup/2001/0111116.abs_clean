Huyghens principle and Planck law are studied in Maxwell andMaxwell-Chern-Simons frameworks in (2+1) dimensions. Contrary to (3+1)dimensions, massless photons are shown to violate Huyghens principle in planarworld. In addition, we obtain that Planck law is no longer proportional to$\nu^3$, but to the squared frequency, $\nu^2$, of the planar photons. We alsobriefly discuss possible physical consequences of these results.
