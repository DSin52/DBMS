We study the moduli space of the D0-brane system on Dp-branes realized in thenoncommutative super Yang-Mills theory. By examining the fluctuations aroundthe solitonic solutions generated by solution generating technique, we confirmthe interpretation of the moduli as the positions of D0-branes on Dp-branes.Low-energy scattering process is also examined for two D0-branes. We find thatthe D0-branes scatter at right angle for head-on collision in the D0-D4 system.For D0-D6 and D0-D8 systems we find special solutions which reduce to the D0-D4case, giving the same behavior. This suggests that the scattering at rightangle for head-on collision is a universal behavior of this kind of solitonscatterings.
