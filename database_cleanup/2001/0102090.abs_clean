A broad class of higher dimensional instanton solutions are found for atheory which contains gravity, a scalar field and antisymmetric tensor fieldsof arbitrary rank. The metric used, a warp product of an arbitrary number ofany compact Einstein manifolds, includes many of great interest in particlephysics and cosmology. For example 4D FRW universes with additional dimensionscompactified on a Calabi-Yau three fold, a torus, a compact hyperbolic manifoldor a sphere are all included. It is shown that the solution of this form whichdominates the Hartle Hawking path integral is always a higher dimensionalgeneralisation of a Hawking Turok instanton when the potential of the scalarfield is such that these instantons can exist. On continuation to Lorentziansignature such instantons give rise to a spacetime in which all of the spatialdimensions are of equal size and where the spatial topology is that of asphere. The extra dimensions are thus not hidden. In the case where thepotential for the scalar field is generated solely by a dilatonic coupling tothe form fields we find no integrable instantons at all. In particular we findno integrable solutions of the type under consideration for the supergravitytheories which are the low energy effective field theories of superstrings.
