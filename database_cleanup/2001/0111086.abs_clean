We use the Witten index in the open string sector to determine tadpolecharges of orientifold planes and D-branes. As specific examples we considertype I compactifications on Calabi Yau manifolds and noncompact orbifolds. Thetadpole constraints suggest that the standard embedding is not a natural choicefor the gauge bundle. Rather there should be a close connection of the gaugebundle and the spin bundle. In the case of a four fold, the standard embeddingdoes not in general fulfill the tadpole conditions. We show that this agreeswith the Green-Schwarz mechanism. In the case of noncompact orbifolds we areable to solve the tadpole constraints with a gauge bundle, which is related tothe spin bundle. We compare these results to anomaly cancellation on the fixedplane of the orbifold. In the case of branes wrapping noncompact cycles, thereare fractional intersection numbers and anomaly coefficients, which we explainin geometric terms.
