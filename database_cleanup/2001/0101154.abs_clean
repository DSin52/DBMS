We study the evaporation of black holes in space-times with extra dimensionsof size L. We first obtain a description which interpolates between theexpected behaviors of very large and very small black holes and then show thatthe luminosity is greatly damped when the horizon shrinks towards L from alarger value. Analogously, black holes born with an initial size smaller than Lare almost stable. This effect is due to the dependence of both the Hawkingtemperature and the grey-body factor of a black hole on the dimensionality ofspace. Although the picture of what happens when the horizon becomes of size Lis still incomplete, we argue that there occurs a (first order) phasetransition, possibly signaled by an outburst of energy which leaves aquasi-stable remnant.
