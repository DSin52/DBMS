Title: Thermodynamic Properties of the Relativistic Composite String -

Expository RemarksAuthors: I. Brevik, A. A. Bytsenko and B. M. Pimentel

Comments: 29 pages, LaTeX, no figures; misprints in sect. 7 (on the Hagedorn

temperature) corrected. To appear in Int. J. Theor. Phys., Group Theory andNonlinear OpticsThe Casimir energy for the transverse oscillations of a piecewise uniformclosed string is calculated. The great adaptability of this string model withrespect to various regularization methods is pointed out. We survey severalmethod, and the zeta-function method. The most powerful method in the presentcase is the contour integration method. The Casimir energy turns out to benegative, and more so the larger is the number of pieces in the string. Thethermodynamic free energy and the critical Hagedorn temperature are calculatedfor a two-piece string. Mass and decay spectra are calculated for quantummassive excitations and the physical meaning of the critical temperaturescharacterizing the radiation in the decay of a massive microstate is discussed.
