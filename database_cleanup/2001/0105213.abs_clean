Journal-ref: JHEP 10 (2001) 030 published as "On the correspondence between

fermionic number and statistics of solitons"Solitons of a nonlinear field interacting with fermions often acquire afermionic number or an electric charge if fermions carry a charge. We show howthe same mechanism (chiral anomaly) gives solitons statistical and rotationalproperties of fermions. These properties are encoded in a geometrical phase,i.e., an imaginary part of a Euclidian action for a nonlinear sigma-model. Inthe most interesting cases the geometrical phase is non-perturbative and has aform of an integer-valued theta-term.
