General features of the spectra of matter states in all 175 models found in aprevious work by the author are discussed. Only twenty patterns ofrepresentations are found to occur. Accomodation of the Minimal SupersymmetricStandard Model (MSSM) spectrum is addressed. States beyond those contained inthe MSSM and nonstandard hypercharge normalization are shown to be generic,though some models do allow for the usual hypercharge normalization found inSU(5) embeddings of the Standard Model gauge group. The minimum value of thehypercharge normalization consistent with accomodation of the MSSM isdetermined for each model. In some cases, the normalization can be smaller thanthat corresponding to an SU(5) embedding of the Standard Model gauge group,similar to what has been found in free fermionic models. Bizzare hyperchargestypically occur for exotic states, allowing for matter which does not occur inthe decomposition of SU(5) representations---a result which has been noted manytimes before in four-dimensional string models. Only one of the twenty patternsof representations, comprising seven of the 175 models, is found to be withoutan anomalous U(1). The sizes of nonvanishing vacuum expectation values inducedby the anomalous U(1) are studied. It is found that large radius modulistabilization may lead to the breakdown of sigma-model perturbativity. Variousquantities of interest in effective supergravity model building are tabulatedfor the set of 175 models. In particular, it is found that string moduli massesappear to be generically quite near the gravitino mass. String scale gaugecoupling unification is shown to be possible, albeit contrived, in an examplemodel. The intermediate scales of exotic particles are estimated and the degreeof fine-tuning is studied.
