It is known that the Seiberg-Witten invariants, derived from supersymmetricYang-Mill theories in four-dimensions, do not distinguish smooth structure ofcertain non-simply-connected four manifolds. We propose generalizations ofDonaldson-Witten and Vafa-Witten theories on a K\"{a}hler manifold based onHiggs Bundles. We showed, in particular, that the partition function of ourgeneralized Vafa-Witten theory can be written as the sum of contributions ourgeneralized Donaldson-Witten invariants and generalized Seiberg-Witteninvariants. The resulting generalized Seiberg-Witten invariants might have,conjecturally, information on smooth structure beyond the originalSeiberg-Witten invariants for non-simply-connected case.
