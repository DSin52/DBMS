We recall how the idea of Softly Broken Supersymmetry led to the constructionof the Supersymmetric Standard Model in 1981. Its first prediction, thesupersymmetric unification of gauge couplings, was conclusively verified by theexistence of superparticles at the electroweak scale; a stable lightestsuperparticle (LSP) with a mass of $\sim 100$ GeV, anticipated to be a neutralelectroweak gaugino; the universality of scalar and gaugino masses at theunification scale. The original motivation for the model, solving the hierarchyproblem, indicates that the superparticles should be discovered at the LHC orthe TeVatron.
