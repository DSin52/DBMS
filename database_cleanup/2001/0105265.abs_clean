We consider deformations of a toroidal orbifold $T^4/Z_2$ and an orbifold ofquartic in $CP^3$. In the $T^4/Z_2$ case, we construct a family ofnoncommutative K3 surfaces obtained via both complex and noncommutativedeformations. We do this following the line of algebraic deformation done byBerenstein and Leigh for the Calabi-Yau threefold. We obtain 18 as thedimension of the moduli space both in the noncommutative deformation as well asin the complex deformation, matching the expectation from classicalconsideration. In the quartic case, we construct a $4 \times 4$ matrixrepresentation of noncommutative K3 surface in terms of quartic variables in$CP^3$ with a fourth root of unity. In this case, the fractionation of branesoccurs at codimension two singularities due to the presence of discretetorsion.
