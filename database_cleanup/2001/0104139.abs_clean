We propose the leading couplings, in an alpha' expansion, of noncommutativeD-branes to RR potentials in a constant NSNS B-field for an arbitrary choice ofnoncommutative parameter. The proposal is motivated by some string amplitudecomputations. The zero momentum couplings are topological in nature and involveElliott's noncommutative Chern character. The finite momentum couplings aregiven by smearing the zero momentum operators along an open Wilson line.Comparisons between the RR couplings in different descriptions lead to a betterunderstanding of the field redefinitions between gauge field variables (theSeiberg-Witten map) and help constrain alpha' corrections. In particular werecover the Seiberg-Witten map conjectured by one of the authors inhep-th/0011125. We also discuss the dynamics of the transverse scalar fieldsand find evidence for a new derivative-driven dielectric effect.
