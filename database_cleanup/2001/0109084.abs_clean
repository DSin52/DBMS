We demonstrate that the UV/IR mixing problems found recently for a scalar$\phi^4$ theory on the fuzzy sphere are localized to tadpole diagrams and canbe overcome by a suitable modification of the action. This modification isequivalent to normal ordering the $\phi^4$ vertex. In the limit of thecommutative sphere, the perturbation theory of this modified action matchesthat of the commutative theory.
