The orbifold lines IIA/I_8 and IIB/$I_8 (-1)^{F_L} possess BPS discretetorsion variants which carry fundamental string (NSNS) charge. We show thatthese variants are actually classified by an integral electric field F from thetwisted RR sector, and compute their tension and NSNS charge as a function ofF. The analysis employs equivariant K-theory and the string creationphenomenon. The K-theory results demonstrate the corrections to cohomology inthe case of torsion; it is found that 8 units of F are invisible at transverseinfinity for IIA, and correspondingly 16 units for IIB.
