Although eigenspectra of one dimensional shape invariant potentials withunbroken supersymmetry are easily obtained, this procedure is not applicablewhen the parameters in these potentials correspond to broken supersymmetry,since there is no zero energy eigenstate. We describe a novel two-step shapeinvariance approach as well as a group theoretic potential algebra approach forsolving such broken supersymmetry problems.
