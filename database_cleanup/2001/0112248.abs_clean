Computing all divergent one-loop Green's functions of \theta-expandednoncommutative quantum electrodynamics up to first order in \theta, we showthat this model is not renormalizable. The reason is a divergence in theelectron four-point function which cannot be removed by field redefinitions.Ignoring this problem, we find however clear hints for new symmetries inwould be compatible with gauge and Lorentz symmetries and which are notreachable by field redefinitions are absent.
