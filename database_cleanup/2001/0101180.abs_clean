We determine the form factor expansion of the one-point functions inintegrable quantum field theory at finite temperature and find that it issimpler than previously conjectured. We show that no singularities are left inthe final expression provided that the operator is local with respect to theparticles and argue that the divergences arising in the non-local case arerelated to the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking on the cylinder. As aspecific application, we give the first terms of the low temperature expansionof the one-point functions for the Ising model in a magnetic field.
