Authors: M. Chaichian, A. Kobakhidze, M. Tsulaia

Comments: 3 pages, LaTeX. Talk at the 9th International Conference on

Supersymmetry and Unification of Fundamental Interactions, Dubna, Russia,June 11-17, 2001We consider the problem of supersymmetry breaking in 5 dimensional N=1supersymmetric models with $S^1/Z_2$ compactification.
