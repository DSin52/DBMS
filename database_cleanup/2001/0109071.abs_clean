Title: Monopole potential and confining strings in the (2+1)-dimensional

Georgi-Glashow modelComments: Talk given at the 6th Workshop on Nonperturbative QCD, Paris, France,

June 5th-9th, 2001; 6 pages, LaTeX2e, uses ws-p8-50x6-00.cls, no figuresConfining strings are investigated in the (2+1)D Georgi-Glashow model. Thisis done in the limit when the electric coupling constant is much larger thanthe square root of the mass of the Higgs field, but much smaller than thevacuum expectation value of this field. The modification of the Debye mass ofthe dual photon with respect to the case when it is considered to be negligiblysmall compared to the Higgs mass, is found. Analogous modifications of thepotential of monopole densities and string coupling constants are found aswell.
