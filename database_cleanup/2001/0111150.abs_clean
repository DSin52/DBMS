We consider the quantum theory of a two-form gauge field on a space-timewhich is a direct product of time and a spatial manifold, taken to be a compactfive-manifold with no torsion in its cohomology. We show that the Hilbert spaceof this non-chiral theory is a certain subspace of a tensor product of twospaces, that are naturally interpreted as the Hilbert spaces of a chiral andanti-chiral two-form theory respectively. We also study the observableoperators in the non-chiral theory that correspond to the electric and magneticfield strengths, the Hamiltonian, and the exponentiated holonomy of thegauge-field around a spatial two-cycle. All these operators can be decomposedinto contributions pertaining to the chiral and anti-chiral sectors of thetheory.
