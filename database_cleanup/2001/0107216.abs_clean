We present a teleparallel complex gravity as the foundation for theformulation of noncommutative gravity theory. The negative energy ghosts in theconventional formulation with U(1,3) local Lorentz connection no longer exists,since the local Lorentz invariance is broken down to U(1,3) global Lorentzsymmetry. As desired, our teleparallel complex gravity theory also passes thekey classical test of perihelion advance of Mercury. Based on this result, wepresent a lagrangian for the noncommutative teleparallel gravity theory.
