We study the localization properties of bulk form potentials on dilatonicdomain walls. We find that bulk form potentials of any ranks can be localizedas form potentials of the same ranks or one lower ranks, for any values of thedilaton coupling parameter. For large enough values of the dilaton couplingparameter, bulk form potentials of any ranks can be localized as formpotentials of both the same ranks and one lower ranks.
