Title: Integrable Boundary Conditions for the O(N) Nonlinear $\sigma$ Model

Authors: M. Moriconi

Comments: 9 pages. To appear in the proceedings of the NATO Advanced Research

typos correctedWe discuss the new integrable boundary conditions for the O(N) nonlinear$\sigma$ model and related solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation,which were presented in our previous paper hep-th/0108039.
