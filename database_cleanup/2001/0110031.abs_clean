We show that the asymptotic dynamics of three-dimensional gravity withpositive cosmological constant is described by Euclidean Liouville theory. Thisprovides an explicit example of a correspondence between de Sitter gravity andconformal field theories. In the case at hand, this correspondence isestablished by formulating Einstein gravity with positive cosmological constantin three dimensions as an SL(2,C) Chern-Simons theory. The de Sitter boundaryconditions on the connection are divided into two parts. The first part reducesthe CS action to a nonchiral SL(2,C) WZNW model, whereas the second providesthe constraints for a further reduction to Liouville theory, which lives on thepast boundary of dS_3.
