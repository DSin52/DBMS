As pointed out, chiral non-commutative theories exist, and examples can beconstructed via string theory. Gauge anomalies require the matter content ofindividual gauge group factors, including U(1) factors, to be non-chiral. All``bad'' mixed gauge anomalies, and also all ``good'' (e.g. for $\pi ^0\to\gamma \gamma$) ABJ type flavor anomalies, automatically vanish innon-commutative gauge theories. We interpret this as being analogous to stringautomatically contain ``closed string,'' Green-Schwarz fields, which cancelthese anomalies.
