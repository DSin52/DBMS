Symposium, Fukuoka, Japan, July 3-7, 2001. 12 pages, 1 figureThe fact that both the D6-brane and the orientifold 6-plane have smooth,horizon-free descriptions in M-theory makes them especially useful inunderstanding certain aspects of brane physics. We briefly review how thisconnection has been used to understand a number of effects, several of whichare associated with the Hanany-Witten transition. One particular outcome is a"confinement mod 2" effect for zero-branes in the background of a singleD8-brane. We also discuss an interesting puzzle associated with flux-expulsionfrom D6-branes in this context. Finally, we discuss the promise of using asimilar M-theoretic description of the orientifold 6-plane to understand theconsistency of stringy negative energy objects with the 2nd law of black holethermodynamics.
