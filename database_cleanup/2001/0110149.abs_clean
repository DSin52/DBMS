If spacetime possesses extra dimensions of size and curvature radii muchlarger than the Planck or string scales, the dynamics of these extra dimensionsshould be governed by classical general relativity. We argue that in generalrelativity, it is highly nontrivial to obtain solutions where the extradimensions are static and are dynamically stable to small perturbations. Wealso illustrate that intuition on equilibrium and stability built up fromnon-gravitational physics can be highly misleading. For all static, homogeneoussolutions satisfying the null energy condition, we show that the Riccicurvature of space must be nonnegative in all directions. Much of our analysisfocuses on a class of spacetime models where space consists of a product ofhomogeneous and isotropic geometries. A dimensional reduction of these modelsis performed, and their stability to perturbations that preserve the spatialsymmetries is analyzed. We conclude that the only physically realistic examplesof classically stabilized large extra dimensions are those in which theextra-dimensional manifold is positively curved.
