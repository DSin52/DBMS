Eighth International Symposium on Particles, Strings and Cosmology (PASCOS2001), University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, April 10-15, 2001,Reference addedSupersymmetry (SUSY) breaking without messenger fields is proposed. We assumethat our world is on a wall and SUSY is broken only by the coexistence ofanother wall with some distance from our wall. The Nambu-Goldstone (NG) fermionis localized on the distant wall. Its overlap with the wave functions ofphysical fields on our wall gives the mass splitting of physical fields on ourwall thanks to a low-energy theorem. We propose that this overlap provides apractical method to evaluate mass splitting in models with SUSY breaking due tothe coexistence of walls.
