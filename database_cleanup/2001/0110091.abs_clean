We calculate the gravitational potential energy between infinitely longparallel strings with tensions \tau_1 and \tau_2. Classically, it vanishes, butat one loop, we find that the long range gravitational potential energy perunit length is U/L = 24G_N^2\tau_1\tau_2/(5 \pi a^2) + ..., where a is theseparation between the strings, G_N is Newton's constant, and we set \hbar = c=1. The ellipses represent terms suppressed by more powers of G_N \tau_i.Typically, massless bulk fields give rise at one loop to a long range potentialbetween p-branes in space-times of dimension p+2+1. The contribution to thispotential from bulk scalars is computed for arbitrary p (strings correspond top=1) and in the case of three-branes its possible relevance for cosmologicalquintessence is commented on.
