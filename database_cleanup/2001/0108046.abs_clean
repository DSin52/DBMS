In built noncommutativity of supermembranes with central charges in elevendimensions is disclosed. This result is used to construct an action for anoncommutative supermembrane where interesting topological terms appear. Inorder to do so, we first set up a global formulation for noncommutative YangMills theory over general symplectic manifolds. We make the above constructionsfollowing a pure geometrical procedure using the concept of connections overWeyl algebra bundles on symplectic manifolds. The relation betweennoncommutative and ordinary supermembrane actions is discussed.
