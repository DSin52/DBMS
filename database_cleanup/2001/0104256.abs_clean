Title: A fresh look at the Bohr-Rosenfeld analysis and a proof of a conjecture

of HeisenbergAuthors: H. Gopalkrishna Gadiyar

Comments: 7 pages

Bohr and Rosenfeld carried out an analysis of the consequences of fieldtheory commutation relations. In this note the analysis is sharpened. Aconjecture of Heisenberg that volume is quantized is shown to be a consequenceof the second quantization of gauge fields. A way to generalize the equationsof physics to include the Planck length is indicated.
