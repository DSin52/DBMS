equations unchangedWe study T-duality for open strings on tori $\T^d$. The general boundaryconditions for the open strings are constructed, and it is shown that T-dualitygroup, which preserves the mass spectrum of closed strings, preserves also themass spectrum of the open strings. The open strings are transformed to thosewith different boundary conditions by T-duality. We also discuss the T-dualityfor D-brane mass spectrum, and show that the D-branes and the open strings withboth ends on them are transformed together consistently.
