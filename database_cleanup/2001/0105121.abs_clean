In an earlier paper (hep-th/0101127), we developed heat kernel techniques inN = 2 harmonic superspace for the calculation of the low-energy effectiveaction of N = 4 SYM theory, which can be considered as the most symmetric N = 2SYM theory. Here, the results are extended to generic N = 2 SYM theories. Thisinvolves a prescription for computing the variation of the hypermultipleteffective action. Integrability of this variation allows the hypermultipleteffective action to be deduced. This prescription permits a very simplesuperfield derivation of the perturbative holomorphic prepotential. Explicitcalculations of the prepotential and the leading non-holomorphic correction arepresented.
