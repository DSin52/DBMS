We analyse some dynamical issues in a modified type IIA supergravity,recently proposed as an extension of M-theory that admits de Sitter space. Inparticular we find that this theory has multiple zero-brane solutions. Thissuggests a microscopic quantum mechanical matrix description which yields amassive deformation of the usual M(atrix) formulation of M-theory and type IIAstring theory.
