The q-electroweak theory obtained by replacing SU(2) by $SU_q(2)$ in theWeinberg-Salam model is experimentally not distinguishable from the standardmodel at the level of the doublet representation. However, differences betweenthe two theories should be observable when higher dimensional representationsare taken into account. In addition the possibility of probing non-localstructure may be offered by the q-theory.
