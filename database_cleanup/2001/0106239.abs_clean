We compute the effective potential of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory using thebackground field method and the Faddeev-Niemi decomposition of the gaugefields. In particular, we find that the potential will depend on the values oftwo scalar fields in the decomposition and that its structure will give rise toa symmetry breaking.
