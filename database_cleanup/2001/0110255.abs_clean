We study the conditions for the existence of black holes that can be producedin colliders at TeV-scale if the space-time is higher dimensional. On employingthe microcanonical picture, we find that their life-times strongly depend onthe details of the model. If the extra dimensions are compact (ADD model),microcanonical deviations from thermality are in general significant near thefundamental TeV mass and tiny black holes decay more slowly than predicted bythe canonical expression, but still fast enough to disappear almostinstantaneously. However, with one warped extra dimension (RS model),microcanonical corrections are much larger and tiny black holes appear to be(meta)stable. Further, if the total charge is not zero, we argue that nakedsingularities do not occur provided the electromagnetic field is strictlyconfined on an infinitely thin brane. However, they might be produced incolliders if the effective thickness of the brane is of the order of thefundamental length scale (~1/TeV).
