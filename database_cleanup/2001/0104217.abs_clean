We study the IR/UV connection of the four-dimensional non-commutative phi^4theory by using the Wilsonian Renormalization Group equation. Extending theusual formulation to the non-commutative case we are able to prove UVrenormalizability to all orders in perturbation theory. The full RG equationsare finite in the IR, but perturbative approximations of them are plagued by IRdivergences. The latter can be systematically resummed in a way analogous towhat is done in finite temperature field theory. As an application,next-to-leading order corrections to the two-point function are explicitlycomputed. The usual Wilsonian picture, i.e. the insensitivity of the IR regimeto the UV, does not hold in the non-commutative case. Nevertheless it can bepartially recovered by a matching procedure, in which a high-energy theory,defined in the deep non-commutative regime, is connected at some intermediatescale to a commutative low-energy theory. The latter knows aboutnon-commutativity only through the boundary conditions for two would-beirrelevant couplings.
