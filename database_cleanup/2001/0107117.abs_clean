of Exactly Solvable Two-Dimensional Models of Quantum Field Theory", eds.S.Pakuliak and G.von Gehlen, Kluwer Academic Publ. NATO SeriesThe correlation function of the two dimensional Ising model with the nearestneighbours interaction on the finite size lattice with the periodical boundaryconditions is derived. The expressions similar to the form factor expansion areobtained both for the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic regions of couplingparameter. The peculiarities caused by finite size are analyzed. The scalinglimit of the lattice form factor expansion is evaluated.
