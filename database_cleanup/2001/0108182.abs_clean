We present a full two-loop O(g^6) perturbative field theoretic calculation ofthe expectation value of two circular Maldacena-Wilson loops in D=4 N=4supersymmetric U(N) gauge theory. It is demonstrated that, after taking intoaccount very subtle cancellations of bulk and boundary divergences, the resultis completely finite without any renormalization. As opposed to previous lowerorder calculations existing in the literature, internal vertex diagrams nolonger cancel identically and lead to subleading corrections to the dominantladder diagrams. Taking limits, we proceed to extract the two-loop staticpotential corresponding to two infinite anti-parallel lines. Our result givessome evidence that the existing strong-coupling calculations using the AdS/CFTconjecture might sum up the full set of large N planar Feynman diagrams.
