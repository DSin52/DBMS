In this note we consider boundary perturbations in the A-Series unitaryminimal models by phi_{r,r+2} fields on superpositions of boundaries. Inparticular, we consider perturbations by boundary condition changing operators.Within conformal perturbation theory we explicitly map out the space ofperturbative renormalisation group flows for the example phi_{1,3} and findthat this sheds light on more general phi_{r,r+2} perturbations. Finally, wefind a simple diagrammatic representation for the space of flows from a singleCardy boundary condition.
