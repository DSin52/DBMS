The possibility of parity violation through spacetime torsion has beenexplored in a scenario containing fields with different spins. Taking theKalb-Ramond field as the source of torsion, an explicitly parity violating$U(1)_{EM}$ gauge invariant theory has been constructed by extending the KRfield with a Chern-Simons term.
