defects which make unbroken symmetries multivalued, induce apparent chargeviolation via Aharonov-Bohm interactions, and form point defects when twistedinto loops. We demonstrate this behavior for both divergent and textured globalAlice strings. Both adiabatically scatter charged particles via effectiveWilson lines. For textured Alice strings, such Wilson lines occur at all radii,and are multivalued only inside the string. This produces measurable effects,including path-dependent charge violation.
