We study the free energy of the 1+1 dimensional O(N) nonlinear sigma-modelsfor even N using the TBA equations proposed recently. We give explicit formulaefor the constant solution of the TBA equations (Y-system) and calculate thefirst two virial coefficients. The free energy is also compared to the leadinglarge N result.
