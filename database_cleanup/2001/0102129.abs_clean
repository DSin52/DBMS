The concept of covariant coordinates on noncommutative spaces leads directlyto gauge theories with generalized noncommutative gauge fields of the type thatarises in string theory with background B-fields. The theory is naturallyexpressed in terms of cochains in an appropriate cohomology; we discuss how itfits into the framework of projective modules. The equivalence of star productsthat arise from the background field with and without fluctuations andKontsevich's formality theorem allow an explicitly construction of a map thatrelates ordinary gauge theory and noncommutative gauge theory (Seiberg-Wittenmap.) As application we show the exact equality of the Dirac-Born-Infeld actionwith B-field in the commutative setting and its semi-noncommutative cousin inthe intermediate picture. Using noncommutative extra dimensions theconstruction is extended to noncommutative nonabelian gauge theory forarbitrary gauge groups; an explicit map between abelian and nonabelian gaugefields is given. All constructions are also valid for non-constant B-field,Poisson structure and metric.
