In this talk we describe the application of the AdS/CFT correspondence for aconfining background to the study of high energy scattering amplitudes in gaugetheory. We relate the energy behaviour of scattering amplitudes to propertiesof minimal surfaces of the helicoidal type. We describe the results ofhep-th/0003059 and hep-th/0010069 for amplitudes with vacuum quantum numberexchange and, very briefly, hep-th/0110024 on the extension of this formalismto Reggeon exchange.
