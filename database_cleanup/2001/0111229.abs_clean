All previous Randall-Sundrum type models have required a Z_2 identificationsource which does not have a known string theoretic origin. We show that thenear-horizon of various resolved branes on an Eguchi-Hanson instantondimensionally reduce to a five-dimensional domain wall that traps gravity,without an additional delta-function source. This brings us substantiallycloser to embedding infinite extra dimensions in M-theory. Also, this providesus with a brane world model for a strongly-coupled Yang-Mills field theory withquark-antiquark charge screening at finite separation distance.
