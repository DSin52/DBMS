We investigate two-dimensional dilaton gravity models with a power-lawdilaton potential, whose black hole solutions contain, among others, thedimensional reduction of the Schwarzschild black hole, the Anti-de Sitter blackhole and Rindler spacetime. We show that the ground state of these modelssatisfies simple transformation laws under the SL(2,R) conformal group. We usethese transformation laws to explain the scaling behavior of thethermodynamical parameters of the black hole and the nonextensivity of thethermodynamical system. The black hole thermodynamical behavior, in particularits entropy, is reproduced by a mapping into a two-dimensional conformal fieldtheory on the cylinder.
