The conditions for validity of the Causal Entropy Bound (CEB) are verified inthe context of non-singular cosmologies with classical sources. It is shownthat they are the same conditions that were previously found to guaranteecosmic fluid needs to be sub-Planckian and not too negative, and its equationof state needs to be causal. In the examples we consider, the CEB is able todiscriminate cosmologies which suffer from potential physical problems morereliably than the energy conditions appearing in singularity theorems.
