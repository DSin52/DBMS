Authors: Mariusz P. Dabrowski

Comments: 7 pages, 2 figures, based on the talks given at Marcel Grossmann

Meeting IX, Rome 2000 and at "Supersymmetry and Quantum Field Theory" (D.V.Volkov Memorial), Kharkov 2000, espcrc2.sty includedWe discuss various superstring effective actions and, in particular, theircommon sector which leads to the so-called pre-big-bang cosmology (cosmology ina weak coupling limit of heterotic superstring). Then, we review the main ideasof the Horava-Witten theory which is a strong coupling limit of heteroticsuperstring theory. Using the conformal relationship between these two theorieswe present Kasner asymptotic solutions of Bianchi type IX geometries withinthese theories and make predictions about possible emergence of chaos. Finally,we present a possible method of generating Horava-Witten cosmological solutionsout of the well-known general relativistic pre-big-bang solutions.
