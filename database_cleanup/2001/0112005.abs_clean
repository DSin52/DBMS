We study Landau Ginzburg (LG) theories mirror to 2D N=2 gauged linear sigmamodels on toric Calabi-Yau manifolds. We derive and solve new constraintequations for Landau Ginzburg elliptic Calabi-Yau superpotentials, depending onthe physical data of dual linear sigma models. In Calabi-Yau threefolds case,we consider two examples. First, we give the mirror symmetry of the canonicalline bundle over the Hirzebruch surfaces $\bf F_n$. Second, we find a specialgeometry with the affine so(8) Lie algebra toric data extending the geometry ofelliptically fibered K3. This geometry leads to a pure N=1 six dimensionalSO(8) gauge model from the F-theory compactification. For Calabi-Yau fourfolds,we give a new algebraic realization for ADE hypersurfaces.
