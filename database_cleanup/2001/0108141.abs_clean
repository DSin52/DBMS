We establish a relationship between the zeros of the partition function inthe complex mass plane and the spectral properties of the Dirac operator inQCD. This relation is derived within the context of chiral Random Matrix Theoryand applies to QCD when chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. Further, weintroduce and examine the concept of normal modes in chiral spectra. Using thisformalism we study the consequences of a finite Thouless energy for the zerosof the partition function. This leads to the demonstration that certainfeatures of the QCD partition function are universal.
