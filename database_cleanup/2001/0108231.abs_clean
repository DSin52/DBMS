Title: Construction of Low-Energy Effective Action in N=4 Super Yang-Mills

TheoriesAuthors: I.L. Buchbinder

Comments: 8 pages, Based on a plenary talk given at the 9th International

Conference on Supersymmetry and Unification of Fundamental Interactions(SUSY01), Dubna, Russia, June 11-17, 2001, to appear in the ProceedingsWe review a recent progress in constructing low-energy effective action inN=4 super Yang-Mills theories. Using harmonic superspace approach we considerN=4 SYM in terms of unconstrained N=2 superfield and apply N=2 background fieldmethod to finding effective action for N=4 SU(n) SYM broken down to U(1)^(n-1).General structure of leading low-energy corrections to effective action isdiscussed.
