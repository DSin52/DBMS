The brane-world scenario offers the possibility for signals to travel outsideour visible universe and reenter it. We find the condition for a signal emittedfrom the brane to return to the brane. We study the propagation of such signalsand show that, as seen by a 4D observer, these signals arrive earlier thanlight traveling along the brane. We also study the horizon problem and findthat, while the bulk signals can travel far enough to homogenize the visibleuniverse, it is unlikely that they have a significant effect since they areredshifted in the gravitational field of the bulk black hole.
