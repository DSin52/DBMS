We study spontaneous supersymmetry breaking induced by brane-localizeddynamics in five-dimensional supergravity compactified on S^1/Z_2. We considera model with gravity in the bulk and matter localized on tensionless branes atthe orbifold fixed points. We assume that the brane dynamics give rise toeffective brane superpotentials that trigger the supersymmetry breaking. Weanalyze in detail the super-Higgs effect. We compute the full spectrum and showthat the symmetry breaking is spontaneous but nonlocal in the fifth dimension.We demonstrate that the model can be interpreted as a new, non-trivialimplementation of a coordinate-dependent Scherk-Schwarz compactification.
