We study the warped geometry of heterotic M-Theory in five dimensions wherefive-branes are included in the bulk. Five-branes wrapping holomorphic curveslead to BPS configurations where the junction conditions are automaticallysatisfied. We consider five-branes wrapped around non-supersymmetric cycles andshow that the configuration is unstable. We describe explicitly the resultingtime-dependent geometry where the bulk five-branes move towards theHorova-Witten boundary walls. The five-branes collide with the boundary wallsin a finite time resulting in the restoration of supersymmetry.
