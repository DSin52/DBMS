We consider a Dirac field in 2+1 dimensions with a domain wall like defect inits mass, minimally coupled to a dynamical Abelian vector field. The mass ofthe fermionic field is assumed to have just one linear domain wall, which isexternally fixed and unaffected by the dynamics. We show that, under somegeneral conditions on the parameters, the localized zero modes predicted by theCallan and Harvey mechanism are stable under the electromagnetic interaction ofthe fermions.
