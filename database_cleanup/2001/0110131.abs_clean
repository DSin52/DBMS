We develop a superspace Noether procedure for supersymmetric field theoriesin 4-dimensions for which an off-shell formulation in ordinary superspaceexists. In this way we obtain an elegant and compact derivation of the varioussupercurrents in these theories. We then apply this formalism to compute thecentral charges for a variety of effective actions. As a by-product we alsoobtain a simple derivation of the anomalous superconformal Ward-identity in N=2Yang-Mills theory. The connection with linearized supergravity is alsodiscussed.
