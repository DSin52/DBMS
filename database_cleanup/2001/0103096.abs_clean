The recently proposed all orders beta function is further investigated. Byusing a strong-weak coupling duality of the beta function, and some addedtopology of the space of couplings we are able to extend the flows toarbitrarily large or small scales. Using a non-trivial RG invariant we are ableto identify sine-Gordon, sinh-Gordon and Kosterlitz-Thouless phases. We alsofind an additional phase with cyclic or roaming RG trajectories.
