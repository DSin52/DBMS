Free noncommutative fields constitute a natural and interesting example ofconstrained theories with higher derivatives. The quantization methodsinvolving constraints in the higher derivative formalism can be nicely appliedto these systems. We study real and complex free noncommutative scalar fieldswhere momenta have an infinite number of terms. We show that these expressionscan be summed in a closed way and lead to a set of Dirac brackets which matchesthe usual corresponding brackets of the commutative case.
