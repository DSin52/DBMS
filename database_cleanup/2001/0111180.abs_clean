We consider correlation functions for string theory on AdS_3. We analyzetheir singularities and we provide a physical interpretation for them. Weexplain which worldsheet correlation functions have a sensible physicalinterpretation in terms of the boundary theory. We consider the operatorproduct expansion of the four point function and we find that it factorizesonly if a certain condition is obeyed. We explain that this is the correctphysical result. We compute correlation functions involving spectral flowedoperators and we derive a constraint on the amount of winding violation.
