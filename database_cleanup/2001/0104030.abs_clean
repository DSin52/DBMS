Authors: T. Garavaglia

Comments: Invited contribution

5 pages ps, plain tex using mtexsis.tex(included)Covariant relativistic quantum theory is used to study the covariant Green'sfunction, which can be used to determine the proper time evolved wave functionsthat are solutions to the covariant Schr\"odinger type equation for a massivespin zero particle. The concept of covariant action is used to obtain theGreen's function for an accelerated relativistic particle.
