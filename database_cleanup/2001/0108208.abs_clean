We formulate models of complex scalar fields in the space-time that has atwo-dimensional sphere as extra dimensions. The Dirac-Wu-Yang monopole is setin two-sphere S^2 as a background gauge field. The nontrivial topology of themonopole induces topological defects, i.e. vortices. When the radius of S^2 islarger than a critical radius, the scalar field develops a vacuum expectationvalue and creates vortices in S^2. Then the vortices break the rotationalsymmetry of S^2. We exactly evaluate the critical radius as r_q =\sqrt{|q|}/\mu, where q is the monopole number and \mu is the imaginary mass ofthe scalar. We show that the vortices repel each other. We analyze the vacua ofwhen q=1/2, a single vortex exists; when q=1, two vortices sit at diametricalpoints on S^2; when q=3/2, three vortices sit at the vertices of the largesttriangle on S^2. The symmetry of the model G = U(1) x SU(2) x CP is broken toH_{1/2} = U(1)', H_{1} = U(1)'' x CP, H_{3/2} = D_{3h}, respectively. HereD_{3h} is the symmetry group of a regular triangle. We extend our analysis tothe doublet scalar fields and show that the symmetry is broken from G_{doublet}= U(1) x SU(2) x SU(2)_f x P to H_{doublet} = SU(2)' x P. Finally we obtain theexact vacuum of the model with the multiplet (q_1, q_2,..., q_{2j+1}) = (j,j,..., j) and show that the symmetry is broken from G_{multiplet} = U(1) xSU(2) x SU(2j+1)_f x CP to H_{multiplet} = SU(2)' x CP'. Our results cautionthat a careful analysis of dynamics of the topological defects is required forconstruction of a reliable model that possesses such a defect structure.
