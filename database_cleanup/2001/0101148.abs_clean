We derive expressions for the phase-space of a particle of momentum $p$decaying into $N$ particles, that are valid for any number of dimensions. Theseare the imaginary parts of so-called `sunset' diagrams, which we also obtain.The results are given as a series of hypergeometric functions, which terminatefor odd dimensions and are also well-suited for deriving the thresholdbehaviour.
