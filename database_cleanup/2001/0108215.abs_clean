We investigate aspects of cosmology in brane world theories with a bulkscalar field. We concentrate on a recent model motivated from supergravity insingular spaces. After discussing the background evolution of such abrane-world, we present the evolution of the density contrast. We compare ourresults to those obtained in the (second) Randall-Sundrum scenario and usual 4Dscalar-tensor theories.
