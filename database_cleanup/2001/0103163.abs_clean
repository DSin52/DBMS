We analyze the holographic description of several properties of $\N=1$confining gauge dynamics. In particular we discuss Wilson loops including theissues of a Luscher term and the broadening of the flux tubes, 't Hooft loops,baryons, instantons, chiral symmetry breaking, the gluino condensate and BPSdomain walls.
