We have examined the deformation of a generic non-Abelian gauge theoryobtained by replacing its Lie group by the corresponding quantum group. Thisdeformed gauge theory has more degrees of freedom than the theory from which itis derived. By going over from point particles in the standard theory tosolitonic particles in the deformed theory, it is proposed to interpret the newdegrees of fredom as descriptive of a non-locality of the deformed theory. Italso turns out that the original Lie algebra gets replaced by two dualalgebras, one of which lies close to and approaches the original Lie algebra ina correspondence limit, while the second algebra is new and disappears in thissame correspondence limit. The exotic field particles associated with thesecond algebra can be interpreted as quark-like constituents of the solitons,which are themselves described as point particles in the first algebra. Theseideas are explored for q-deformed SU(2) and $GL_q(3)$.
