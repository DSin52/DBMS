Recently quintessence is proposed to explain the observation data ofsupernova indicating a time-varying cosmological constant and acceleratinguniverse. Inspired by this and its mysterious origin, we look for thepossibility of quintessence as the holographic dark matters dominated in thelate time in the brane world scenarios. We consider both the cases of staticand moving brane in a dilaton gravity background. For the static brane we usethe Hamilton-Jacobi method motivated by holographic renormalization group tostudy the intrinsic FRW cosmology on the brane and find out the constraint onthe bulk potential for the quintessence. This constraint requires a negativeslowly varying bulk potential which implies an anti-de Sitter-like bulkgeometry and could be possibly realized from the higher dimensionalsupergravities or string theory. We find the similar constraint for the movingbrane cases and that the quintessence on it has the effect as a mildlytime-varying Newton constant.
