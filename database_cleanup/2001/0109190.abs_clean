We discuss the quantization of a self-interacting string consisting ofmaximally charged matter. We construct the Hamiltonian in the non-relativisticlimit by expanding around a static solution of the Einstein-Maxwell fieldequations. Conformal symmetry is broken on the worldsheet, but a subgroup ofthe conformal group acts as the gauge group of the theory. Thus, theFaddeev-Popov quantization procedure of fixing the gauge is applicable. Wecalculate the Hamiltonian and show that, if properly quantized, the systempossesses a well-defined ground state and the spacing of its energy levels isof order the Planck mass. This generalizes earlier results on a system ofmaximally charged black holes to the case of continuous matter distributions.
