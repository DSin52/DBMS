We study the space-time symmetries and transformation properties of thenon-commutative U(1) gauge theory, by using Noether charges. We carry out ouranalysis by keeping an open view on the possible ways $\theta^{\mu \nu}$ couldtransform. We conclude that $\theta^{\mu \nu}$ cannot transform under anyspace-time transformation since the theory is not invariant under the conformaltransformations, with the only exception of space-time translations. The sameanalysis applies to other gauge groups.
