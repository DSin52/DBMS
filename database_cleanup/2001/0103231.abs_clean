We revisit the problem of precursors in the AdS/CFT correspondence.Identification of the precursors is expected to improve our understanding ofthe tension between holography and bulk locality and of the resolution of theblack hole information paradox. Previous arguments that the precursors arelarge, undecorated Wilson loops are found to be flawed. We argue that the roleof precursors should become evident when one saturates a certain localitybound. The spacetime uncertainty principle is a direct consequence of thisbound.
