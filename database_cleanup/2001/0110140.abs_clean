A superfield algorithm for master actions of a class of gauge field theoriesincluding topological ones in arbitrary dimensions is presented generalizing aprevious treatment in two dimensions. General forms for master actions insuperspace are given, and possible theories are determined by means of a ghostnumber prescription and the master equations. The resulting master actionsdetermine the original actions together with their gauge invariances.Generalized Poisson sigma models in arbitrary dimensions are constructed bymeans of this algorithm, and other applications in low dimensions are givenincluding the Chern-Simon model.
