Using the generalised AdS/CFT correspondence, we show that there are certainten-dimensional differentiable manifolds such that string theory on such amanifold is unstable [to the emission of "large branes"] no matter what themetric may be. The instability is thus due to the [differential] topology ofthe manifold, not to any particular choice of its geometry. We propose aprecise criterion for this "topology selection mechanism", and prove it in manycases. The techniques employed may be useful in more general cases.
