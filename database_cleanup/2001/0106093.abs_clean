We describe orientifold operation defining O3 plane in the conifoldbackground by deriving it from that of O4 plane in the Type IIA braneconstruction by T-duality. We find that both $O3^+$ and $O3^-$ are at the tipof the cone so that there is no net untwisted RR charge. RG analysis shows thatwe need two `fractional' branes for the conformal invariance in orientifoldedconifold. We argue that the gravity solution is the same as Klebanov andTsyetlin since SUGRA cannot distinguish the orientifolds and D branes in thiscase. We describe the duality cascade as well as the quantum deformation of themoduli space of the field theory in the presence of the orientifold.The finitely resolved conifold does not allow the orientifold, while deformedconifold leaves us an unresolved issue on supersymmetry.
