The gauge equivalent formulation of the Faddeev-Skyrme model is used for thestudy of the quantum theory. The rotational quantum excitations around thesoliton solution of Hopf number unity are investigated by the method ofcollective coordinates. The quantum Hamiltonian of the system is found tocoincide with the Hamiltonian of a symmetrical top rotating in SU(2). Thus, theirreducible representations of physical observables can be constructed.
