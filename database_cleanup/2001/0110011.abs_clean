given at the SUSY'01 conference (Dubna, June 11-17, 2001) and at the IXWorkshop on High Energy Spin Physics, SPIN-01 (Dubna, August 2-7, 2001)We consider particlelike solutions to supergravity based on the Kerr-NewmanBH solution. The BH singularity is regularized by means of a phase transitionto a new superconducting vacuum state near the core region. We show that thisphase transition can be controlled by gravity in spite of the extreme smallnessof the local gravitational field.Supersymmetric BPS domain wall model is suggested which can provide thisphase transition and formation the stable charged (dual) superconducting core.
