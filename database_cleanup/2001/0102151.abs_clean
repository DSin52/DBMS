Quantum corrections to the energy of D0-branes in a constant RR 4-formbackground are studied. Using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we computethe long-range interaction between two spherical D2-D0 bound states. We extendthis calculation to the case where some mass terms are added. For the specialvalue of masses at which the classical energy vanishes, we find completecancellations of two boson-fermion pairs in the quantum mechanical expressionof the zero-point energy, suggesting possible restoration of (partial)supersymmetries. We also briefly discuss the interaction between a dielectric2-brane and a single D0-brane.
