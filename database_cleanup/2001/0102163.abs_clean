We study the reflection amplitudes of affine Toda field theories withboundary, following the ideas developed by Fring and Koberle and focusing ourattention on the $E_{n}$ series elements, because of their interestingstructure of higher order poles. We also investigate the corresponding minimalreflection matrices, finding, with respect to the bulk case, a more complicatedrelation between the spectra of bound states associated to the minimal and tothe ''dressed'' amplitudes.
