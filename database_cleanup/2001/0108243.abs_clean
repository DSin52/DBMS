The superspace Lagrangian formulation of N=1 supersymmetric quantum mechanicsis presented. The general Lagrangian constructed out of chiral and antichiralsupercoordinates containing up to two derivatives and with a canonicallynormalized kinetic energy term describes the motion of a nonrelativistic spin1/2 particle with Land\'e g-factor 2 moving in two spatial dimensions under theinfluence of a static but spatially dependent magnetic field. Noether's theoremis derived for the general case and is used to construct superspace dependentcharges whose lowest components give the superconformal generators. Thesupercoordinate of charges containing an R symmetry charge, the supersymmetrycharges and the Hamiltonian are combined to form a supercharge supercoordinate.Superconformal Ward identities for the quantum effective action are derivedfrom the conservation equations and the source of potential symmetry breakingterms are identified.
