Comments: 77 pages, no figures, Latex

These are expanded notes of lectures given at the summer school "Gif 2000" inParis. They constitute the first part of an "Introduction to supersymmetry andsupergravity" with the second part on supergravity by J.-P. Derendinger tospinors and the Poincar\'e group, the susy algebra and susy multiplets,superfields and susy lagrangians, susy gauge theories, spontaneously brokensusy, the non-linear sigma model, N=2 susy gauge theories, and finallySeiberg-Witten duality.
