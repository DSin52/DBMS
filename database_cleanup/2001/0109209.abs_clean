We employ the twistor approach to the construction of U(2) multi-instantons`a la 't Hooft on noncommutative R^4. The noncommutative deformation of theCorrigan-Fairlie-'t Hooft-Wilczek ansatz is derived. However, naivelysubstituting into it the 't Hooft-type solution is unsatisfactory because theresulting gauge field fails to be self-dual on a finite-dimensional subspace ofthe Fock space. We repair this deficiency by a suitable Murray-von Neumanntransformation after a specific projection of the gauge potential. The propernoncommutative 't Hooft multi-instanton field strength is given explicitly, ina singular as well as in a regular gauge.
