We study the metrics on the families of moduli spaces arising from probingwith a brane the ten and eleven dimensional supergravity solutionscorresponding to renormalisation group flows of supersymmetric large n gaugetheory. In comparing the geometry to the physics of the dual gauge theory, itis important to identify appropriate coordinates, and starting with the case ofSU(n) gauge theories flowing from N=4 to N=1 via a mass term, we demonstratethat the metric is Kahler, and solve for the Kahler potential everywhere alongthe flow. We show that the asymptotic form of the Kahler potential, and hencethe peculiar conical form of the metric, follows from special properties of thegauge theory. Furthermore, we find the analogous Kahler structure for the N=4preserving Coulomb branch flows, and for an N=2 flow. In addition, we establishsimilar properties for two eleven dimensional flow geometries recentlypresented in the literature, one of which has a deformation of the conifold asits moduli space. In all of these cases, we notice that the Kahler potentialappears to satisfy a simple universal differential equation. We prove that thisequation arises for all purely Coulomb branch flows dual to both ten and elevendimensional geometries, and conjecture that the equation holds much moregenerally.
