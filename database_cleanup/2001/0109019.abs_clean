An F-theory dual of a nonsupersymmetric orientifold is considered. It isargued that the condensation of both open and closed string tachyons in theorientifold corresponds to the annihilation of branes and anti-branes in theF-theory dual. The end-point of tachyon condensation is thus expected to be thevacuum of Type-IIB superstring. Some speculations are presented about theF-theory dual of the bosonic string and tachyon condensation thereof.
