GeometryThe 'anholonomic frame' method (see gr-qc/0005025, gr-qc/0001060 andhep-th/0110250) is applied for constructing new classes of exact solutions ofvacuum Einstein equations with off-diagonal metrics in 4D and 5D gravity. Weexamine several black tori solutions generated by anholonomic transforms withnon-trivial topology of the Schwarzshild metric, which have a static toroidalhorizon. We define ansatz and parametrizations which contain warping factors,running constants (in time and extra dimension coordinates) and effectivenonlinear gravitational polarizations. Such anisotropic vacuum toroidalmetrics, the first example was given in gr-qc/0005025, differ substantiallyfrom the well known toroidal black holes (see hep-th/9511188 and gr-qc/9709013)which were constructed as non-vacuum solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell gravitywith cosmological constant. Finally, we analyze two anisotropic 5D and 4D blacktori solutions with cosmological constant.
