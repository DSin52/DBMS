Title: The one loop measure in the Group Theoretic approach to String Theory

the case of two finite fixed pointsAuthors: Leonidas Sandoval Jr

Comments: LaTeX2e, 11 pages

The measure for the one loop scattering of one and $N$ bosonic strings iscalculated using the Group Theoretic approach to String Theory. The calculationis done for the case when the projective transformation associated with theloop can be parametrized in terms of two finite fixed points and themultiplier.
