We obtain a solution describing a gravitational shockwave propagating along ahand, it is the first exact solution for a localized source on aRandall-Sundrum three-brane. On the other hand, one can use it to study forwardscattering at Planckian energies, including the effects of the continuum ofKaluza-Klein modes. We map out the different regimes for the scatteringobtained by varying the center-of-mass energy and the impact parameter. We alsodiscuss exact shockwaves in ADD scenarios with compact extra dimensions.
