We give the explicit form of the four dimensional effective supergravityaction, which describes low energy physics of the Randall-Sundrum model withmoduli fields in the bulk and charged chiral matter living on the branes. Thederived from the compactification of a locally supersymmetric model in fivedimension. The presence of odd $Z_2$ parity scalars in the bulk gives rise toeffective potential for the radion in four dimensions. We describe themechanism of supersymmetry breaking mediation, which relies on non-trivialconfiguration of these $Z_2$-odd bulk fields. Broken supersymmetry leads tostabilization of the interbrane distance.
