It has been observed recently by Giovanni Amelino-Camelia \cite{gac1, gac2}that the hypothesis of existence of a minimal observer-independent (Planck)length scale is hard to reconcile with special relativity. As a remedy hepostulated to modify special relativity by introducing an observer-independentlength scale. In this letter we set forward a proposal how one should modifythe principles of special relativity, so as to assure that the values of massand length scales are the same for any inertial observer. It turns out that onecan achieve this by taking dispersion relations such that the speed of lightgoes to infinity for finite momentum (but infinite energy), proposed e.g., inthe framework of the quantum $\kappa$-Poincar\'e symmetry. It follows that atthe Planck scale the world may be non-relativistic.
