We study loop corrections in boundary string field theory (BSFT). Aftercommenting on problems with quantizing the tree level BSFT as an ordinary fieldtheory, we discuss the tree level coupling to closed strings and define theloop corrections via factorization in the closed string channel. Thisdescription is weakly coupled in the vicinity of the closed string vacuum. Ourproposal for the one-loop effective action differs in general from computingthe annulus or cylinder partition functions. We also compute the decay ratesand the loop corrections to the tensions of unstable branes in perturbativestring theory.
