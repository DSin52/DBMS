We compute the metric associated to noncommutative spaces described by atensor product of spectral triples. Well known results of the two-sheets model(distance on a sheet, distance between the sheets) are extended to any productof two spectral triples. The distance between different points on differentfibres is investigated. When one of the triple describes a manifold, one find aPythagorean theorem as soon as the direct sum of the internal states (viewed asprojections) commutes with the internal Dirac operator. Scalar fluctuationsyield a discrete Kaluza-Klein model in which the extra metric component isgiven by the internal part of the geometry. In the standard model, this extracomponent comes from the Higgs field.
