The strongly coupled limit of string scattering and the automorphicconstruction of the graviton S-matrix is compared with the eleven dimensionalformulation of M-theory. In a particular scaling limit at strong stringcoupling, M-theory is described by eleven-dimensional supergravity which doesnot possess a dilaton, but rather a perturbative expansion in the gravitationalcoupling and derivatives. The latter theory provides an off-shell descriptionof the string, upon dimensional reduction.
