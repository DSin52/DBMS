BPS walls and junctions are studied in ${\cal N}=1$ SUSY nonlinear sigmamodels in four spacetime dimensions. New BPS junction solutions connecting Ndiscrete vacua are found for nonlinear sigma models with several chiral scalarsuperfields. A nonlinear sigma model with a single chiral scalar superfield isalso found which has a moduli space of the topology of $S^1$ and admits BPSwalls and junctions connecting arbitrary points in moduli space. SUSY conditionin nonlinear sigma models are classified either as stationary points ofsuperpotential or singularities of the K\"ahler metric in field space. Thetotal number of SUSY vacua is invariant under holomorphic field redefinitionsif we count ``runaway vacua'' also.
