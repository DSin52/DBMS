The spectrum of stable electrically and magnetically charged supersymmetricparticles can change discontinuously as one changes the vacuum on the Coulombbranch of gauge theories with extended supersymmetry in four dimensions. Weshow that this decay process can be understood and is well described bysemiclassical field configurations purely in terms of the low energy effectiveaction on the Coulomb branch even when it occurs at strong coupling. Theresulting picture of the stable supersymmetric spectrum is a generalization ofthe ``string web'' picture of these states found in string constructions forcertain theories.
