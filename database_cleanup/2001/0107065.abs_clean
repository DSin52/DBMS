We discuss the possibility of quintessence in the dilatonic domain wallsincluding the Randall-Sundrum brane world. We obtain the zero mode effectiveaction for gravitating objects in the dilatonic domain wall. First we considerthe four dimensional (4D) gravity and the Brans-Dicke graviscalar with apotential. This can be further rewritten as a minimally coupled scalar with theLiouville-type potential in the Einstein frame. However this model fails toinduce the quintessence on the dilatonic domain wall because the potential isnegative. Second we consider the 4D gravity with the dilaton. In this case wefind also a negative potential. Any negative potential gives us negative energydensity and positive pressure, which does not lead to an accelerating universe.Consequently it turns out that the zero mode approach of the dilatonic domainwall cannot accommodate the quintessence in cosmology.
