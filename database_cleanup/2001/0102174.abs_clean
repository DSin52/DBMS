We explored a variety of brane configurations in our previous paper withinthe two derivative truncation of the unstable D9-brane effective theory. Inthis paper we extend our previous results with emphasis on the inclusion of thehigher derivative corrections for the tachyon and the gauge fields computed inthe boundary string field theories. We give the exact solutions to BPS braneconfigurations studied in our previous paper and find remarkable exactagreements of their energies and RR-charges with the expected results. Wefurther find a few more solutions that we could not construct in the twoderivative truncations, such as a (F,D6) bound state ending on a D8-brane whoseexistence turns out to be due to a higher derivative effect and also thedielectric brane of Emparan and Myers as a nonsupersymmetric example. These arealso in exact agreements with the results obtained in the effective theory ofsupersymmetric D-branes.
