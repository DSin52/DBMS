We study the relationship between ADHM/Nahm construction and ``solutiongenerating technique'' of BPS solitons in noncommutative gauge theories.ADHM/Nahm construction and ``solution generating technique'' are the moststrong ways to construct exact BPS solitons. Localized solitons are thesolitons which are generated by the ``solution generating technique.'' Theshift operators which play crucial roles in ``solution generating technique''naturally appear in ADHM/Nahm construction and we can construct various exact(=localized calorons) and localized doubly-periodic instantons. Nahmconstruction also gives rise to BPS fluxons straightforwardly from theappropriate input Nahm data which is expected from the D-brane picture of BPSfluxons. We also show that the Fourier-transformed soliton of the localizedcaloron in the zero-period limit exactly coincides with the BPS fluxon.
