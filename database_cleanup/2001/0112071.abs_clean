We study compactifications of string theory and M-theory to six dimensionswith background fluxes. The nonzero fluxes lead to additional mass parameters.We derive the S- and T-duality rules for the corresponding (massive)supergravity theories. Specifically, we investigate the massive T-dualitybetween Type IIA superstring theory compactified on K3 with background fluxesand Type IIB superstring theory compactified on K3. Furthermore, we generaliseto the massive case the 6D 'string-string' S-duality between M-theory on K3 xS^1 and the Heterotic String on T^4. Whereas in the case of massive T--dualitythe mass parameters are in the fundamental representation of the U-dualitygroup O(4,20) we find that in the case of massive S-duality they are in the3-index antisymmetric representation. In the latter case the mass parametersinvolved extend those of Kaloper and Myers. We apply our duality rules tomassive brane solutions, like the domain wall solutions corresponding to themass parameters and find new massive brane solutions. Finally, we discuss thehigher-dimensional interpretation of the dualities and brane solutions.
