Gravitational time delay in asymptotically Anti de Sitter spaces hasconsequences for holographic duality. We argue that the requirement of bulkcausality implies that it is not possible for a collection of boundaryobservers, performing local measurements, to extract information fromprecursors. Using similar arguments, we derive an integrated weak energyconstraint on spacetimes which can admit a holographic dual.
