Comments: 12 pages, no figures. Written version of the invited lecture given at

the Euroconference "Brane New World and Noncommutative Geometry", VillaGualino, Torino, Italy, October 2-7 2000. To be published in the conferenceproceedings by World ScientificJournal-ref: Mod.Phys.Lett. A16 (2001) 311-320

Chiral gauge anomalies on noncommutative Minkowski Space-time are computedand have their origin elucidated. The consistent form and the covariant form ofthe anomaly are obtained. Both Fujikawa's method and Feynman diagram techniquesare used to carry out the calculations
