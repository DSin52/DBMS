We investigate the semiclassical instability of the Randall-Sundrum braneworld. We carefully analyze the bubble solution with the Randall-Sundrumbackground, which expresses the decay of the brane world. We evaluate the decayprobability following the Euclidean path integral approach to quantum gravity.Since a bubble rapidly expands after the nucleation, the entire spacetime willbe occupied by such bubbles.
