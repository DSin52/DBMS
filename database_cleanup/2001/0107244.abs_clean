small separation between branes and new references are addedWe construct braneworld effective action in two brane Randall-Sundrum modeland show that the radion mode plays the role of a scalar field localizingessentially nonlocal part of this action. Non-minimal curvature coupling ofthis field reflects the violation of AdS/CFT-correspondence for finite valuesof brane separation. Under small detuning of the brane tension from theRandall-Sundrum flat brane value, the radion mode can play the role ofinflaton. Inflationary dynamics corresponds to branes moving apart in the fieldof repelling interbrane inflaton-radion potential and implies the existenceacceleration stage caused by remnant cosmological constant at late (large braneseparation) stages of evolution. We discuss the possibility of fixing initialconditions in this model within the concept of braneworld creation from thetunneling or no-boundary cosmological state, which formally replaces theconventional moduli stabilization mechanism.
