We study the ratio of the entropy to the total energy in conformal fieldtheories at finite temperature. For the free field realizations of {\cal N}=4super Yang-Mills theory in D=4 and the (2,0) tensor multiplet in D=6, the ratiois bounded from above. The corresponding bounds are less stringent than therecently proposed Verlinde bound. We show that entropy bounds arise genericallyin CFTs in connection to monotonicity properties with respect to temperaturechanges of a generalized C-function. For strongly coupled CFTs with AdS duals,we show that the ratio obeys the Verlinde bound even in the presence ofrotation. For such CFTs, we point out an intriguing resemblance in theirthermodynamic formulas with the corresponding ones of two-dimensional CFTs. Weshow that simple scaling forms for the free energy and entropy of CFTs with AdSduals reproduce the thermodynamical properties of (D+1)-dimensional AdS blackholes.
