Nodland Ralston (PRL,1997) investigated the cosmological anisotropy ofelectromagnetic fields.In this paper we show that it is possible obtain atorsion correction to Nodland-Ralston action starting from the massive Procaelectrodynamics in Riemannian spacetime and performing the minimal couplingwith torsion.We end up with an action which contains the Nodland Ralston actionwithout breaking the gauge invariance.This mechanism however gives a photon amass generated by the nonlinear torsion terms.The torsion vector is along thecosmic rotation axis and interacts with the massive photon.This method whichbreaks conformal invariance allow us to determine a primordial torsion of theorder $10^{-29}eV$ from the well-known photon mass limits.
