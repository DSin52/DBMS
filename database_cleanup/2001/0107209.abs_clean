We discuss the dimensional reduction of various effective actions,particularly that of the closed Bosonic string and pure gravity, to two andthree dimensions. The result for the closed Bosonic string leads to cosetsymmetries which are in agreement with those recently predicted and argued tobe present in a new unreduced formulation of this theory. We also show thatpart of the Geroch group appears in the unreduced duality symmetric formulationof gravity recently proposed. We conjecture that this formulation can beextended to a non-linear realisation based on a Kac-Moody algebra which weidentify. We also briefly discuss the proposed action of Bosonic M-theory.
