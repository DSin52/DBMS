The generalization of the Vafa-Witten theorem ruling out parity violation toQCD at finite temperature is considered. It is shown that this generalizationof the theorem rules out Lorentz-invariant parity violating operators fromspontaneously acquiring vacuum expectation values. However, it does not ruleout Lorentz-noninvariant parity-violating operators from acquiring expectationvalues. Other situations where the theorem is inapplicable are also discussed.
