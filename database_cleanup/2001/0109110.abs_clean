central charge density by Shifman, Vainshtein, and Voloshin. We compute theone-loop shift in the background field for the bosonic and the susy kink,confirming SVV for the latter. We compute the energy density for both casesand find agreement with the central charge density for the susy caseDirect calculation of the one-loop contributions to the energy density ofregularization. Requiring the mode density in the soliton and trivial sector tobe equal at each point in space yields the anomalous part of the energydensity. (2) Phase space factorization. A striking position-momentumfactorization for reflectionless potentials gives the non-anomalous energydensity a simple relation to that for the bound state. For the supersymmetrickink, energy and central charge densities agree as expected.
