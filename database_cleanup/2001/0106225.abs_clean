Quantum effects of bulk matter, in the form of massive fermions, areconsidered in the Randall-Sundrum $AdS_5$ brane world at finite temperatures.The thermodynamic energy (modulus potential) is calculated in the limiting casewhen the temperature is low, and is shown to possess a minimum, thus suggestinga new dynamical mechanism for stabilizing the brane world. Moreover, thesequantum effects may solve the hierarchy scale problem, at quite lowtemperatures. The present note reviews essentially the fermion-related part ofthe recent article by I. Brevik, K. A. Milton, S. Nojiri, and S. D. Odintsov,hep-th/0010205 .
