327-332We formulate the problem of finding self-dual Hamiltonians (associated withintegrable systems) as deformations of free systems given on various symplecticmanifolds and discuss several known explicit examples, including recently founddouble elliptic Hamiltonians. We consider as basic the notion of self-duality,while the duality in integrable systems (of the Toda/Calogero/Ruijsenaars type)comes as a derivative notion (degenerations of self-dual systems). This is atalk presented at the Workshop "Classical and Quantum Integrable Systems",Protvino, January, 2001.
