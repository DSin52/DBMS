Title: Brane Dynamics in CFT Backgrounds

Authors: Stefan Fredenhagen and Volker Schomerus

Comments: 12 pages, 2 figures

In this note we discuss bound states of un- or meta-stable braneconfigurations in various non-trivial (curved) backgrounds. We begin byreviewing some known results concerning brane dynamics on group manifolds.These are then employed to study condensation in cosets of the WZW model. Whilethe basic ideas are more general, our presentation focuses on parafermiontheories and, closely related, N=2 superconformal minimal models. We determinethe (non-commutative) low energy effective actions for all maximally symmetricbranes in a decoupling limit of the two theories. These actions are used toshow that the lightest branes can be regarded as elementary constituents forall other maximally symmetric branes.
