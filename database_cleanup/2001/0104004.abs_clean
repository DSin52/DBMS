Foliated manifolds are particular examples of noncommutative spaces. In thisarticle we try to give a qualitative description of the Godbillon-Vey class andits relation on the one hand to the holonomy and on the other hand to thetopological entropy of a foliation, using a remarkable theorem proved recentlyby G. Duminy relating these three notions in the case of codim-1 foliations.Moreover we shall investigate its possible relation with the black hole entropyadopting the superstring theory origin of the black hole entropy in theextremal case. This situation we believe has some striking similarities withthe explanation due to Bellissard of the integrality of the Hall conductivityin the quantum Hall effect. Our starting point is the Connes-Douglas-Schwarzarticle on compactifications of matrix models to noncommutative tori.
