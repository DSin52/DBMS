I present here some new results which make explicit the role of the divisionalgebras R,C,H,O in the construction and classification of, respectively,N=1,2,4,8 global supersymmetric quantum mechanical and classical dynamicalsystems. In particular an N=8 Malcev superaffine algebra is introduced and itsrelation to the non-associative N=8 SCA is discussed. A list of present andpossible future applications is given.
