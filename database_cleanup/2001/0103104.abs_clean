In this thesis, we investigate various integral submodels and generalizethem. In part I, we study the submodel of the nonlinear $\mathbf{C}P^1$-modeland the related submodels in $(1+2)$ dimensions. In part II, we constructintegrable submodels of the nonlinear Grassmann models in any dimension. Wecall them the Grassmann submodels. To show that our submodels are integrable,we construct an infinite number of conserved currents in two ways. One is thatwe make full use of the Noether currents of the nonlinear Grassmann models. Theother is that we use a method of multiplier. Next we investigate symmetries ofthe Grassmann submodel. By using the symmetries, we can construct a wide classof exact solutions for our submodels. In part III, keeping some properties ofour submodels, we generalize our submodels to higher-order equations. First weprepare the Bell polynomials and the generalized Bell polynomials which playthe most important roles in our theory of generalized submodels. Next wegeneralize the $\mathbf{C}P^1$-submodel to higher-order equations. Lastly wegeneralize the Grassmann submodel to higher-order equations. By using thegeneralized Bell polynomials, we can show that the generalized Grassmannsubmodels are also integrable. As a result, we obtain a hierarchy of systems ofintegrable equations in any dimension which includes Grassmann submodels. Theseresults lead to the conclusion that the integrable structures of ourgeneralized submodels are closely related to some fundamental properties of theBell polynomials.
