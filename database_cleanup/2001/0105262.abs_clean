In the previous paper, we have introduced the Abelian tensor field togetherwith two parameters $\rho$ and $\sigma$ to rewrite the non-Abelian gauge theoryin maximal Abelian gauge into an Abelian effective theory, and we determinedthe anomalous dimensions of Abelian tensor field and a parameter $\rho$ byrequiring the renormalizability with respect to Abelian effective theory. Thenwe obtained the renormalizable Abelian Projected Effective Gauge Theory. Inthis paper, the anomalous dimension of a parameter $\sigma$ is determined.However, before proceeding to determine the anomalous dimension of $\sigma$, wemust modify the gauge fixing terms from the viewpoint of renormalizability. Weobtain the anomalous dimensions under this modification.
