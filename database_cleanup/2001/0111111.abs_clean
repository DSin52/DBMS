Title: Large B-Fields and Noncommutative Solitons

Authors: Jorge Moreno

Comments: 5 pages, latex, no figures, talk delivered at the `VIII Workshop on

Particles and Fields', Zacatecas, Mexico; November 2001The purpose of this talk is to review a few issues concerningnoncommutativity arising from String Theory. In particular, it is shown how inType IIB Theory, the annihilation of a D3-\bar{D3} brane pair yields aD1-string. This object, in the presence of a large B-field and fermions,happens to be a complex noncommutative soliton endowed with superconductivity.
