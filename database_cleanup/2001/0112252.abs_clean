Title: From noncommutative space-time to quantum relativistic symmetries with

fundamental mass parameterAuthors: Jerzy Lukierski (Institute of Theoretical Physics, University of

Wroclaw, Poland)Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX. Talk given at II-nd International Symposium "Quantum

Theory and Symmetries" (QTS2) 18-21.07.2001, Cracow (Poland) and SummerSchool in Modern Mathematical Physics 13-25.08.2001, Sokobanja, Serbia. To bepublished in the Proceedings of QTS2, ed. A. Horzela and E Kapuscik, WorldScientificWe consider the simplest class of Lie-algebraic deformations of space-timealgebra, with the selection of $\kappa$-deformations as providing quantumdeformation of relativistic framework. We recall that the $\kappa$-deformationalong any direction in Minkowski space can be obtained. Some problems of theformalism of $\kappa$-deformations will be considered. We shall comment on theconformal extension of light-like $\kappa$-deformation as well as on theapplications to astrophysical problems.
