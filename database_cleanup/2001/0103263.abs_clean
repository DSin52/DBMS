We investigate the presence of irrelevant operators in the 2d Ising modelperturbed by a magnetic field, by studying the corrections induced by theseoperators in the spin-spin correlator of the model. To this end we perform aset of high precision simulations for the correlator both along the axes andalong the diagonal of the lattice. By comparing the numerical results with thepredictions of a perturbative expansion around the critical point we findunambiguous evidences of the presence of such irrelevant operators. It turnsout that among the irrelevant operators the one which gives the largestcorrection is the spin 4 operator T^2 + \bar T^2 which accounts for thebreaking of the rotational invariance due to the lattice. This result agreeswith what was already known for the correlator evaluated exactly at thecritical point and also with recent results obtained in the case of the thermalperturbation of the model.
