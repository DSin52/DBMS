We give a new construction of the minimal unitary representation of theexceptional group E_8(8) on a Hilbert space of complex functions in 29variables. Due to their manifest covariance with respect to the E_7(7) subgroupof E_8(8) our formulas are simpler than previous realizations, and thus wellsuited for applications in superstring and M theory.
