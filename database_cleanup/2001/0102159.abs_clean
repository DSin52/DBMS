In this note we study a massive IIA supergravity theory obtained inhep-th/9707139 by compactification of M-theory. We point out that de Sitterspace in arbitrary dimensions arises naturally as the vacuum of this theory.This explicitly shows how de Sitter space can be embedded intoeleven-dimensional supergravity. In addition we discuss the novel way in whichthis theory avoids various `no-go theorems' which assert that de Sitter spaceis not a consistent vacua of eleven-dimensional supergravity theory. We alsopoint out that the eight-branes of this theory, which couple electrically tothe ten-form, can sweep out de Sitter world-volumes.
