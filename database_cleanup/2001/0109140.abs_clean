Based on the assumption that the warp factor of four-dimensional spacetimeand the one of fifth dimension are tied through a parameter $\alpha$, weconsider five-dimensional gravity with a 3-brane coupled to a bulk scalarfield. For arbitrary value of $\alpha$, the form of the warp factor isimplicitly determined by hypergeometric function. Concretely, we show that thewarp factor becomes explicit form for appropriate value of $\alpha$, and studythe relation between four-dimensional effective Planck scale and the branetension. This setup allows the possibility of extending the diversity of braneworld.
