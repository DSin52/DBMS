We propose a new mechanism of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking innoncommutative gauge theories. We find that in N=1 noncommutative gaugetheories both supersymmetry and gauge invariance are dynamically broken.Supersymmetry is broken spontaneously by a Fayet-Iliopoulos D-term whichnaturally arises in a noncommutative U(n) theory. For a non-chiral mattercontent the Fayet-Iliopoulos term is not renormalized and its tree-level valuecan be chosen to be much smaller than the relevant string/noncommutativityscale. In the low energy theory, the noncommutative U(n) gauge symmetry isbroken down to a commutative U(1) x SU(n). This breaking is triggered by theIR/UV mixing and manifests itself at and below the noncommutativity mass scaleM_{NC}\sim \theta^{-1/2}. In particular, the U(1) degrees of freedom decouplefrom the SU(n) in the infrared and become arbitrarily weakly coupled, thusplaying the role of the hidden sector for supersymmetry breaking.
