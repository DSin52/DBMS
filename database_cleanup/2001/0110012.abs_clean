Title: Duality Transformations and temperature inversion symmetry

Authors: F C Santos and A C Tort

Comments: 5 pages, no figures, standard Latex

We argue that the temperature inversion symmetry present in the originalCasimir setup and also in other Casimir systems for which symmetrical boundaryconditions are imposed is not related to the duality transformations that inthe context defined in Ref. [1] are transformations relating spatial extensionand temperature, and pressure and energy density. We provide an example of aCasimir system for which in principle there is no temperature inversionsymmetry but nevertheless these duality transformations can be found.
