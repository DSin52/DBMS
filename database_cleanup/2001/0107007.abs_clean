We study a matrix version of the purely cubic open string field theory asdescribing the expansion around the closed string vacuum. Any D-branes in thegiven closed string background can appear as classical solutions by using theidentity projectors. Expansion around this solution gives the correct kineticterm for the open strings on the created D-branes while there are somesubtleties in the unwanted degree of freedom.
