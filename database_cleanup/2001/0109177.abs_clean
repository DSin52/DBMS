We find a new solution of Type IIB supergravity which represents a collectionof D5 branes wrapped on the topologically non-trivial S^3 of the deformedconifold geometry T^*S^3. The Type IIB solution is obtained by lifting a newsolution of D=7 SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R gauged supergravity to ten dimensions inwhich SU(2)_D gauge fields in the diagonal subgroup are turned on. Thesupergravity solution describes a slice of the Coulomb branch in the large Nlimit of N=2 SYM in three dimensions.
