The region of moduli space of string theories which is most likely todescribe the "real world" is where the string coupling is about unity and thevolume of extra compact dimensions is about the same size as the string volume.Here we map the landscape of this "central" region in a model-independent way,assuming only that the string coupling and compact volume moduli are chiralsuperfields of N=1 supergravity in 4 dimensions, and requiring only widelyweak scale and that the cosmological constant be of acceptably small magnitude.We find that the superpotential has (in the supersymmetric limit) a fourthorder zero in the SUSY breaking direction. The potential near the minimum isvery steep in the SUSY preserving directions, and very flat in the SUSYbreaking direction, consequently the SUSY breaking field has a weak scale mass,while other moduli are heavy. We also argue that there will be additional nearby minima with a large negative cosmological constant.
