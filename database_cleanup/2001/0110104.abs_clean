Exact renormalization group techniques are applied to mass deformed N=4supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, viewed as a regularised N=2 model. Thesolution of the flow equation, in the local potential approximation, reproducesthe one-loop (perturbatively exact) expression for the effective action of N=2supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, when the regularising mass, M, reaches thevalue of the dynamical cutoff. One speculates about the way in which furthernon-perturbative contributions (instanton effects) may be accounted for.
