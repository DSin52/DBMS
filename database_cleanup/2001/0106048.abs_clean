We review the generalization of field theory to space-time with noncommutingcoordinates, starting with the basics and covering most of the activedirections of research. Such theories are now known to emerge from limits of Mtheory and string theory, and to describe quantum Hall states. In the last fewyears they have been studied intensively, and many qualitatively new phenomenahave been discovered, both on the classical and quantum level.To appear in Reviews of Modern Physics.
