The symmetry properties of the bosonic string effective action underPoisson-Lie duality transformations are investigated. A convenient and simpleformulation of these duality transformations is found, that allows thereduction of the string effective action in a Kaluza-Klein framework. It isshown that the action is invariant provided that the two Lie algebras, formingthe Drinfeld double, have traceless structure constants. Finally, a functionalrelation is found between the Weyl anomaly coefficients of the original anddual non-linear sigma models.
