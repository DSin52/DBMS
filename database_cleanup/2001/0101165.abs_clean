We study the transformation law of quantum fields in super Yang-Mills theoryquantized in the Wess-Zumino gauge. It can be derived from a local version ofgeneralized Slavnov-Taylor identities for general Green functions. Undersuitable normalization conditions the transformations are local. Within thevector multiplet anomalous dimensions become equal. The breaking of susy showsup in Fock but not in Hilbert space and is not reflected in the transformationlaw for the fields.
