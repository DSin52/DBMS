Recently, a proposal for the full non-abelian open superstring effectiveaction through ${\cal O}(\alpha'{}^3)$ has been formulated in {\tthep-th/0108169}. We test this result by calculating the spectrum in thepresence of constant magnetic background fields and by comparing the result tostring theoretic predictions. The agreement is perfect. Other proposals for thesuperstring effective action through this order do not reproduce the spectrumcorrectly.
