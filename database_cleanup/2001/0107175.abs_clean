We discuss the brane world model of Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati in whichbranes evolve in an infinite bulk and the brane curvature term is added to theaction. If Z_2 symmetry between the two sides of the brane is not imposed, weshow that the model admits the existence of "stealth branes" which follow thestandard 4D internal evolution and have no gravitational effect on the bulkspace. Stealth branes can nucleate spontaneosly in a Minkowski bulk. Thisprocess is described by the standard 4D quantum cosmology formalism withtunneling boundary conditions for the brane world wave function. The notoriousambiguity in the choice of boundary conditions is fixed in this case due to thepresence of the embedding spacetime. We also point to some problematic aspectsof models admitting stealth brane solutions.
