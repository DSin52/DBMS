Physics, 2001, 204-213We report on joint work, past and in progress, with K.Fredenhagen and withJ.E,Roberts, on the quantum structure of spacetime in the small which isdictated by the principles of Quantum Mechanics and of General Relativity; wecomment on how these principles point to a deep link between coordinates andfields. This is an expanded version of a lecture delivered at the 37th KarpaczSchool in Theoretical Physics, February 2001.
