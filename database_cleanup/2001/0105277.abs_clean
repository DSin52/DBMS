We consider the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. Wecompute the one-loop contributions to the effective action with five externalvector fields and compare them with corresponding results in open superstringtheory. Our calculation determines the structure of the F^5 terms that appearin the nonabelian generalization of the Born Infeld action. The trace operationon the gauge group indices receives contributions from the symmetric as well asthe antisymmetric part. We find that in order to study corrections to thesymmetrized trace prescription one has to consistently take into accountderivative contributions not only with antisymmetrized products\nabla_{[\mu}\nabla_{\nu]} but also with symmetrized ones\nabla_{(\mu}\nabla_{\nu)}.
