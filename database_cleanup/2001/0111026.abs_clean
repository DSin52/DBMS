D2-branes are studied in the context of Born-Infeld theory as a source of the3-form RR gauge potential. Considering the static case with only a radialmagnetic field it is shown that a locally stable hemispherical deformation ofthe brane exists which minimises the energy locally. Since the D2-brane carriesalso the charge of D0-branes, and the RR spacetime potential is unbounded frombelow, these can tunnel to condense on the D2-brane. The correspondinginstanton-like configuration and the tunneling rate are derived and discussed.
