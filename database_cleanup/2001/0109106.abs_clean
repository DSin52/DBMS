In an earlier work extensions of supersymmetry and super Lie algebras wereconstructed consistently starting from any representation $\D$ of any Liealgebra $\g$. Here it is shown how infinite dimensional Lie algebras appearnaturally within the framework of fractional supersymmetry. Using adifferential realization of $\g$ this infinite dimensional Lie algebra,containing the Lie algebra $\g$ as a sub-algebra, is explicitly constructed.
