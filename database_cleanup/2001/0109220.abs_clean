It is proposed that a non-Abelian adjoint two-form in BF type theoriestransform inhomogeneously under the gauge group. The resulting restrictions oninvariant actions are discussed. The auxiliary one-form which is required formaintaining vector gauge symmetry transforms like a second gauge field, andhence cannot be fully absorbed in the two-form. But it can be replaced, via avector gauge transformation, by the usual gauge field, leading to gaugeequivalences between different types of theories. A new type of symmetry alsoappears, one which depends on local functions but cannot be generated byconstraints. It is connected to the identity in the limit of a vanishing globalparameter, so it should be called a semiglobal symmetry. The correspondingconserved currents and BRST charges are parametrized by the space of flatconnections.
