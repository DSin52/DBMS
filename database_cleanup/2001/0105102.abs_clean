Title: Introduction to the Superembedding Description of Superbranes

Authors: Dmitri Sorokin

Comments: LaTeX2e file, 11 pages. Invited lecture given at the XXXVII Karpacz

Winter School "New Developments in Fundamental Interactions Theories"(February 6-15, 2000, Karpacz, Poland). To be published in ProceedingsBasics of the geometrical formulation of the dynamics of supersymmetricobjects are considered and its relation to conventional formulations ofsuperbranes is discussed. In particular, we demonstrate how the kappa-symmetryof the Green-Schwarz formulation shows up from local worldvolume supersymmetry,and briefly discuss applications of the superembedding approach.
