We consider a model in which the universe is the direct product of a(3+1)-dimensional Friedmann, Robertson-Walker (FRW) space and a compacthyperbolic manifold (CHM). Standard Model fields are confined to a point in theCHM (i.e. to a brane). In such a space, the decay of massive Kaluza-Klein modesleads to the injection of any initial bulk entropy into the observable (FRW)universe. Both Kolmogoro-Sinai mixing due to the non-integrability of flows onCHMs and the large statistical averaging inherent in the collapse of theinitial entropy onto the brane smooth out any initial inhomogeneities in thedistribution of matter and of 3-curvature on any slice of constant 3-position.If, as we assume, the initial densities and curvatures in each fundamentalcorrelation volume are drawn from some universal underlying distributionsindependent of location within the space, then these smoothing mechanismseffectively reduce the density and curvature inhomogeneities projected onto theFRW. This smoothing is sufficient to account for the current homogeneity andflatness of the universe. The fundamental scale of physics can be $\gsim 1$TeV.All relevant mass and length scales can have natural values in fundamentalunits. All large dimensionless numbers, such as the entropy of the universe,are understood as consequences of the topology of spacetime which is notexplained. No model for the origin of structure is proffered.
