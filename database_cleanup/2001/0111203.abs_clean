We study quantum corrections in the earlier proposed string theory, which isbased on Weyl invariant purely extrinsic curvature action. At one-loop level itremains Weyl invariant irrespective of the dimension D of the embeddingspacetime. To some extent the counterterms are reminiscent of the ones in purequantum gravity. At classical level the string tension is equal to zero andquarks viewed as open ends of the surface are propagating freely withoutinteraction. We demonstrate that quantum fluctuations generate nonzero areaterm (string tension).
