Title: The Effective Potential for Composite Operator in the Scalar Model at

Finite TemperatureAuthors: G.N.J. Ananos, N.F.Svaiter

Comments: LaTeX, 14 pages with 1 figure

We discuss the $\phi^4$ and $\phi^6$ theory defined in a flat $D$-dimensionalspace-time. We assume that the system is in equilibrium with a thermal bath attemperature $\beta^{-1}$. To obtain non-perturbative result, the $ 1/N $expansion is used. The method of the composite operator (CJT) for summing alarge set of Feynman graphs, is developed for the finite temperature system.The ressumed effective potential and the analysis of the D=3 and D=4 cases aregiven.
