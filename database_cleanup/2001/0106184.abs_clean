Based on a heuristic boost argument, we propose that the 4 dimensional deSitter space can be described by a spherical Chern-Simons matrix model near thecosmological horizon, or models generalizing this simple choice. The dimensionof the Hilbert space is naturally finite. We also make some comments onpossible realization of holography in this approach, and on possible relationto the conformal field theory approach.
