Multi-brane backgrounds are studied in the framework of the backgroundindependent open string field theory. A simple description of the non-abeliandegrees of freedom is given. Algebra of the differential operators acting onthe space of functions on the space-time provides a natural tool for thediscussion of this phenomena.
