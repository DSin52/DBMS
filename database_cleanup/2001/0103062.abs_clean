We show that in 6d models localizing gravity on stringlike defects andsatisfying the dominant energy condition, the metric exterior to the stringinevitably depends on the string's thickness. As a consequence, in the limit ofthin string either the gravity delocalizes, or the six-dimensional Planck scalemust be much larger that the four-dimensional one.
