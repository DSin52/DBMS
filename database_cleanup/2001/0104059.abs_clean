University, 58 pages, some comments and references are addedSpacetime non-commutativity appears in string theory. In this paper, thenon-commutativity in string theory is reviewed. At first we review that aDp-brane is equivalent to a configuration of infinitely many D($p-2$)-branes.If we consider the worldvolume as that of the Dp-brane, coordinates of theDp-brane is commutative. On the other hand if we deal with the worldvolume asthat of the D($p-2$)-branes, since coordinates of many D-branes are promoted tomatrices the worldvolume theory is non-commutative one. Next we see that usinga point splitting reguralization gives a non-commutative D-brane, and anon-commutative gauge field can be rewritten in terms of an ordinary gaugefield. The transformation is called the Seiberg-Witten map. And we introducesecond class constraints as boundary conditions of an open string. SinceNeumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions are mixed in the constraints when theopen string is coupled to a NS B field, the end points of the open string isnon-commutative.
