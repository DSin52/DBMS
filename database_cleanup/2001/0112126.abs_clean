We compare two applications of the gauge/gravity correspondence to a nonconformal gauge theory, based respectively on the study of D-branes wrapped onsupersymmetric cycles and of fractional D-branes on orbifolds. We study twobrane systems whose geometry is dual to N=4, D=2+1 super Yang-Mills theory, thefirst one describing D4-branes wrapped on a two-sphere inside a Calabi-Yautwo-fold and the second one corresponding to a system of fractionalD2/D6-branes on the orbifold R^4/Z_2. By probing both geometries we recover theexact perturbative running coupling constant and metric on the moduli space ofthe gauge theory. We also find a general expression for the running couplingconstant of the gauge theory in terms of the "stringy volume" of the two-cyclewhich is involved in both types of brane systems.
