In a recent paper Shiromizu, Maeda and Sasaki derived the gravitationalequations of motion which would hold on a brane which is embedded in a higherdimensional bulk spacetime, showing that even when the Einstein equations areimposed in the bulk, nonetheless the embedding leads to a modification of theEinstein equations on the brane. In this comment on their work we explicitlyidentify and evaluate a delta function singularity effect at the brane whichthey do not appear to have discussed in their paper, an effect which, whileactually being of interest in and of itself, nonetheless turns out not tomodify their reported results.
