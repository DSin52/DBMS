Black p-brane solutions for a wide class of intersection rules and Ricci-flat``internal'' spaces are considered. They are defined up to moduli functions H_sobeying non-linear differential equations with certain boundary conditionsimposed. A new solution with intersections corresponding to the Lie algebra C_2is obtained. The functions H_1 and H_2 for this solution are polynomials ofdegree 3 and 4.
