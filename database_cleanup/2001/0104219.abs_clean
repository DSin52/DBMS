Title: How Does God Play Dice? (Pre-)Determinism at the Planck Scale

Comments: An Essay in honour of John S. Bell. 8 pages TeX, no figures

In deterministic theories, one can start from a set of ontological states toformulate the dynamical laws, but these may not be directly observable.Observable are only equivalence classes of states, and these will span a basisof "beables", to be promoted to an orthonormal basis of Hilbert Space. Aftertransforming this basis to a more conventional basis, a theory may result thatis fundamentally quantum mechanical. It is conjectured that the quantum laws ofthe real world may be understood from exactly such a procedure.
