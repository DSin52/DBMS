Dirac-like monopoles are studied in three-dimensional Abelian Maxwell andMaxwell-Chern-Simons models. Their scalar nature is highlighted and discussedthrough a dimensional reduction of four-dimensional electrodynamics withelectric and magnetic sources. Some general properties and similarities of themwhen are considered in Minkowski or Euclidian space are mentioned. However, byvirtue of the structure of the space-time in which they are considered a numberof differences among them take place. Furthermore, we pay attention to someconsequences of these objects when acting upon usual particles. Among othersubjects, special attention is given to the study of a Lorentz-violatingnon-minimal coupling between neutral fermions and the field generated by amonopole alone. In addition, an analogue of the Aharonov-Casher effect isdiscussed in this framework.
