We consider a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for theFriedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) model. We show that for this purpose it ispossible to include an additional action invariant under reparametrization oftime. The last one does not change the equations of motion for theminisuperspace model, but changes only the constraint. The same procedure isapplied to the supersymmetric case.
