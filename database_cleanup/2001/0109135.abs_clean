The effects of introducing a harmonic spatial inhomogeneity into theKalb-Ramond field, interacting with the Maxwell field according to a`string-inspired' proposal made in earlier work are investigated. We examine inparticular the effects on the polarization of synchrotron radiation fromcosmologically distant (i.e. of redshift greater than 2) galaxies, as well asthe relation between the electric and magnetic components of the radiationfield. The rotation of the polarization plane of linearly polarized radiationis seen to acquire an additional contribution proportional to the square of thefrequency of the dual Kalb-Ramond axion wave, assuming that it is far smallercompared to the frequency of the radiation field.
