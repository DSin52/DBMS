The formalism of spacetime dependent lagrangians developed in Ref.1 isapplied to the Sine Gordon and massive Thirring models.It is shown that thewell-known equivalence of these models (in the context of weak-strong duality)can be understood in this approach from the same considerations as described in[1] for electromagnetic duality. A further new result is that all these can benaturally linked to the fact that the holographic principle has analogues atlength scales much larger than quantum gravity. There is also the possibility11.10/Ef
