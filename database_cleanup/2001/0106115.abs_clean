The relation that exists in quantum mechanics among action variables, anglevariables and the phases of quantum states is clarified, by referring to thesystem of a generalized oscillator. As a by-product, quantum-mechanical meaningof the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation and related matters is clarified,where a new picture of quantum mechanics is introduced, to be called theHamilton-Jacobi picture.
