The Casimir stress on two parallel plates in de Sitter background formassless scalar field satisfying Robin boundary conditions on the plates iscalculated. The metric is written in conformally flat form to make maximum useof the Minkowski space calculations. Different cosmological constants areassumed for the space between and outside of the plates to have general resultsapplicable to the case of domain wall formations in the early universe.
