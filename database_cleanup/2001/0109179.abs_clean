We investigate particular models which can be N-fold supersymmetric atspecific values of a parameter in the Hamiltonians. The models to beinvestigated are a periodic potential and a parity-symmetric sextic triple-wellpotential. Through the quantitative analyses on the non-perturbativecontributions to the spectra by the use of the valley method, we show how thecharacteristic features of N-fold supersymmetry which have been previouslyreported by the authors can be observed. We also clarify the difference betweenquasi-exactly solvable and quasi-perturbatively solvable case in view of thedynamical property, that is, dynamical N-fold supersymmetry breaking.
