We present a (unique?) possibility of de Sitter solution in the framework ofN=2 supersymmetry (hypersymmetry). We show that a model with a vector and acharged hypermultiplet has a hybrid inflation type potential. It leads to aslow-roll regime in de Sitter type background with all supersymmetries brokenspontaneously. Beyond the bifurcation point the waterfall stage abruptly bringsthe system into a ground state with 2 unbroken supersymmetries. De Sitter stageexists under condition that the superconformal SU(2,2|2) symmetry of the modelis softly broken down to N=2 supersymmetry by the vev of the Killingprepotential triplet P^r. This hybrid hypersymmetry model may describe P-terminflation and/or acceleration of the universe at the present epoch.
