We analyse several open and mixed sector tree-level amplitudes in N=2 p-p'systems with a constant magnetic B turned on. The 3-point function vanisheson-shell. The 4-point function, in the Seiberg-Witten (SW) low energylimit\cite{SW}, is local, {\it indicating the possible topological nature ofthe theory (in the SW low energy limit)} and the {\it possible relation betweennoncommutative N=2 p-p' system in two complex dimensions and in the SW limit,and (non)commutative N=2 p'-p' system in two real dimensions.} We discuss threeextreme noncommutativity limits (after having taken the Seiberg-Witten lowenergy limit) of the mixed 3-point function, and get two kinds of commutativenon-associaitive generalized star products. We make some speculative remarksrelated to reproducing the above four-point tree level amplitude in the opensector, from a field theory.
