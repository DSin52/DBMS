We consider the couplings of RR fields with open string sector for$Dp$-${\overline{Dp}}$ backgrounds of various $p$. Proposed approach, based onthe approximation of the open string algebra by the algebra of differentialoperators, provides the unified description of these couplings and theirinterrelations.
