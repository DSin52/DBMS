wrapft.styWe derive an effective Lagrangian for meson fields. This is done in thelight-cone gauge for two-dimensional large-N_c QCD by using the bilocalauxiliary field method. The auxiliary fields are bilocal on light-cone spaceand their Fourier transformation determines the parton momentum distribution.As the first test of our method, the 't Hooft equation is derived from theeffective Lagrangian.
