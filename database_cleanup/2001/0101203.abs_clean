We give a prescription to add the gravitational field of a global topologicaldefect to a solution of Einstein's equations in an arbitrary number ofdimensions. We only demand that the original solution has a O(n) invariancewith n greater or equal 3. We will see that the general effect of a globaldefect is to introduce a deficit solid angle. We also show how the same kind ofscalar field configurations can be used for spontaneous compactification of "n"extra dimensions on an n-sphere.
