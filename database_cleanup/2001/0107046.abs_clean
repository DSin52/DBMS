We construct exact classical solutions in cubic open string field theory. Bythe redefinition of the string field, we find that the solutions correspond tofinite deformations of the Wilson lines. The solutions have well-defined Fockspace expressions, and they have no branch cut singularity of marginalparameters which was found in the analysis using level truncation approximationin Feynman-Siegel gauge. We also discuss marginal tachyon lump solutions atcritical radius.
