Tensor and matrix formulations of Dirac-K\"ahler equation for massive andmassless fields are considered. The equation matrices obtained are simplelinear combinations of matrix elements in the 16-dimensional space. Theprojection matrix-dyads defining all the 16 independent equation solutions arefound. A method of computing the traces of 16-dimensional Petiau-Duffin-Kemmermatrix product is considered. It is shown that the symmetry group of theDirac-K\"ahler tensor fields is SO(4,2). The conservation currentscorresponding this symmetry are constructed. Supersymmetry of theDirac-K\"ahler fields with tensor and spinor parameters is analyzed. We showthe possibility of constructing a gauge model of interacting Dirac-K\"ahlerfields where the gauge group is the noncompact group under consideration.
