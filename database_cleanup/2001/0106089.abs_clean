Quantum Mechanics in the non-commutative plane is shown to admit the``exotic'' symmetry of the doubly-centrally-extended Galilei group. Whencoupled to a planar magnetic field whose strength is the inverse of thenon-commutative parameter, the system becomes singular, and ``Faddeev-Jackiw''reduction yields the ``Chern-Simons'' mechanics of Dunne, Jackiw, andTrugenberger. The reduced system moves according to the Hall law.
