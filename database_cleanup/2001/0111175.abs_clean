Following a previous work on Abelian (2,0)-gauge theories, one reassesseshere the task of coupling (2,0) relaxed Yang-Mills superpotentials to a (2,0)-nonlinear $\sigma$-model, by gauging the isotropy or the isometry group of thelatter. One pays special attention to the extra ``chiral-like'' component-fieldgauge potential that comes out from the relaxation of superspace constraints.
