We present a cohomological method for obtaining the non-AbelianSeiberg-Witten map for any gauge group and to any order in theta. Byintroducing a ghost field, we are able to express the equations defining theSeiberg-Witten map through a coboundary operator, so that they can be solved byconstructing a corresponding homotopy operator.
