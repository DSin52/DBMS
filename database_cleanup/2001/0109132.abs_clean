``Extremely'' localized wavefunctions in noncommutative geometry havedisturbances that are localized to distances smaller than $\sqrt{\theta}$,where $\theta$ is the ``area'' parameter that measures noncommutativity. Inparticular, distributions such as the sign function or the Dirac delta functionare limiting cases of extremely localized wavefunctions. It is shown that Moyalstar products of extremely localized wavefunctions cannot be correctly computedperturbatively in powers of $\theta$. Nonperturbative effects as a function of$\theta$ are explicitly displayed through exact computations in severalexamples. In particular, for distributions, star products end up beingfunctions of $\theta ^{-1}$ and have no expansion in positive powers of$\theta$. This result provides a warning for computations in noncommutativespace that often are performed with perturbative methods. Furthermore, theresult may have interesting applications that could help elucidate the role ofnoncommutative geometry in several areas of physics.
