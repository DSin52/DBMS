in more detail and acknowledgements are addedWe investigate the issue of regularization/renormalization in the presence ofa nontrivial background in the case of 1+1-(supersymmetric) solitons. Inparticular we study and compare the commonly employed regularization methods(mode- energy/momentum- cutoff and derivative regularization). We show that themain point for a consistent regularization/renormalization is to find arelation between the ``cutoffs'' in the vacuum and the nontrivial sector sothat they can be related in a consistent manner. For each scheme we give aprinciple to derive this relation and to perform calculations in a consistentway. These principles are simple and not restricted to two dimensions orsupersymmetric theories.
