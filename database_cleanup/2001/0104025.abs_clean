Authors: E.M. Santangelo

Comments: Lectures given at the IFSAP, St. Petersburg, Russia, December 2000.

LateX, 31 pagesJournal-ref: Theor.Math.Phys. 131 (2002) 527-542; Teor.Mat.Fiz. 131 (2002)

98-117This is an introductory set of lectures on elliptic differential operatorsand boundary problems, and their associated spectral functions. The role ofzeta functions and traces of heat kernels in the regularization of Casimirenergies is emphasized, and the renormalization issue is discussed throughsimple examples.
