In this paper we extend the boundary string field theory action for a non-BPSD-brane to the one including the target space fermions and the nonlinearsupersymmetry with 32 supercharges up to some order. This is based on the ideathat the vacuum with a non-BPS D-brane belongs to the spontaneously brokenphase of the supersymmetry. As a result, we find that the action is almostuniquely determined up to the field redefinition ambiguities.
