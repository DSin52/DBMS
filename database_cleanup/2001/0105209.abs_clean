We examine Kaluza-Klein branes in detail. Specifically, we show thatcodimension four submanifolds that are stationary under a semi-free circleaction may be interpreted as branes or antibranes in the Kaluza-Klein reducedspace that are magnetically charged under the Kaluza-Klein field strength. Wederive the equation in cohomology that is satisfied by such a brane using anexplicit construction of the Thom class of the normal bundle of the braneworldvolume in the reduced space. This may be applied to both the D6-brane ofType IIA String Theory, and also to various recent constructions of magneticbranes immersed in fluxbrane backgrounds. We then go on to study the specialcase of monopole-antimonopole production in a five-dimensional Kaluza-Kleintheory, illustrating our arguments with various concrete examples.
