In this short note we present a mathematical interpretation of tachyoncondensation on (three dimensional) orbifolds within the framework of boundarystring field theory (BSFT). We explicitly show that important parts of decaymodes in brane-antibrane systems with N=2 boundary supersymmetry can beinterpreted as the McKay correspondence described as complexes. This will givean example of the recent interpretation of D-branes as derived category. Wealso discuss the N=4 boundary supersymmetry as a more refined structure.
