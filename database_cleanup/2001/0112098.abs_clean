Seven-manifolds of G_2 holonomy provide a bridge between M-theory and stringtheory, via Kaluza-Klein reduction to Calabi-Yau six-manifolds. We findfirst-order equations for a new family of G_2 metrics D_7, with S^3\times S^3principal orbits. These are related at weak string coupling to the resolvedconifold, paralleling earlier examples B_7 that are related to the deformedconifold, allowing a deeper study of topology change and mirror symmetry inM-theory. The D_7 metrics' non-trivial parameter characterises the squashing ofan S^3 bolt, which limits to S^2 at weak coupling. In general the D_7 metricsare asymptotically locally conical, with a nowhere-singular circle action.
