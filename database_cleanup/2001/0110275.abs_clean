Title: The quantum anharmonic oscillator in the Heisenberg picture and multiple

scale techniquesAuthors: Guy Auberson and Michel Capdequi Peyranere

Comments: 18 pages

Multiple scale techniques are well-known in classical mechanics to giveperturbation series free from resonant terms. When applied to the quantumanharmonic oscillator, these techniques lead to interesting features concerningthe solution of the Heisenberg equations of motion and the Hamiltonianspectrum.
