Title: Gauge Couplings and Group Dimensions in the Standard Model

Authors: Ralf Alfons Engeldinger

Comments: 7 pages

The gauge field term in the Standard Model Lagrangian is slightly rewritten,suggesting that the three gauge couplings have absorbed factors which depend onthe dimensions of the corresponding gauge groups. The ratios of the physicalcouplings may turn out to be dominated by these factors, with deviations due toquantum corrections.
