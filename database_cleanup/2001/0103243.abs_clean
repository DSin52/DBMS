Title: Strings on Calabi--Yau spaces and Toric Geometry

Comments: error in Hodge data of complete intersections corrected, published in

Nucl.Phys. B Conf. Suppl. 102 (2001) 87After a brief introduction into the use of Calabi--Yau varieties in stringdualities, and the role of toric geometry in that context, we review theclassification of toric Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces and present some results oncomplete intersections. While no proof of the existence of a finite bound onthe Hodge numbers is known, all new data stay inside the familiar range$h_{11}+h_{12}\le 502$.
