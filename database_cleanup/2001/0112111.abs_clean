Authors: Valeri V. Dvoeglazov (Universidad de Zacatecas)

Comments: Misprint in the equation(44b) corrected. After submission of the

initial version I learnt about the previous paper hep-th/0110083 by S. I.Kruglov, which may have relations to this paper. 16 pp, ReVTeX file,presented at the VII Wigner Symposium, College Park, MD, USA, August 24-29,2001Journal-ref: Hadronic J. 25 (2002) 137-158

We extend the previous series of articles [HPA] devoted to finding mappingsbetween the Weinberg-Tucker-Hammer formalism and antisymmetric tensor fields.Now we take into account solutions of different parities of the Weinberg-likeequations. Thus, the Proca, Duffin-Kemmer and Bargmann-Wigner formalisms aregeneralized.
