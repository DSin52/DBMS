It is shown that an (n-1)-dimensional inflating brane world instantonicallycreated from nothing can exist in the region beyond the Rindler horizon of theLorentzian spacetime associated with another inflating brane world in ndimensions which is also instantonically created from nothing. Generalizingthis construction we obtain an unbounded from above tower of successive braneworlds, each having one more dimension than the one which it nests and one lessdimension than the one which nests it.
