In this paper, we investigate the near-extremal thermodynamics of theReissner-Nordstrom (RN) black hole. Our methodology is based on a duality thatexists between the near-horizon geometry of the near-extremal RN sector andJackiw-Teitelboim (JT) theory. First, the described correspondence is reviewedat the classical level. Next, we consider first-order perturbations in the dualJT geometry by incorporating a quantum scalar field into the formalism. Thenovelty of our approach is that the matter field is endowed with a4-dimensional pedigree. We ultimately find that back-reaction effects prohibitthe JT black hole from losing all of its mass. This outcome directly impliesthat an RN black hole can not reach extremality and, moreover, can not evencome arbitrarily close to an extremal state.
