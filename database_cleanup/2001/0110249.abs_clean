We present a simple field transformation which changes the field argumentsfrom the ordinary position-space coordinates to the oblique phase-spacecoordinates that are linear in position and momentum variables. This is usefulin studying quantum field dynamics in the presence of external uniform magneticthe given Landau level from that between different Landau levels. We apply thisformalism to both nonrelativistic and relativistic field theories. In the largeexternal magnetic field our formalism provides an efficient method forconstructing the relevant lower-dimensional effective field theories with thefield degrees defined only on the lowest Landau level.
