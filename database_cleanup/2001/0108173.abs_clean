We review a recent development in the theoretical understanding of the nu=5/2quantum Hall plateau and propose a new conformal field theory, slightlydifferent from the Moore-Read one, to describe another universality classrelevant for this plateau. The ground state is still given by the Pfaffian andis completely polarized, however, the elementary quasiholes are charge 1/2anyons with abelian statistics theta=pi/2, which obey complete spin-chargeseparation. The physical hole is represented by two such quasiholes plus a freeneutral Majorana fermion. We also compute the periods and amplitudes of thechiral persistent currents in both states and show that they have differenttemperature dependence. Finally, we find indications of a classical two-stepphase transition between the new and the Moore-Read states, through acompressible state, which is characterized by the spontaneous breaking of ahidden Z_2 symmetry corresponding to the conservation of the chiral fermionparity. We believe that this transition could explain the "kink" observed inthe activation experiment for nu=5/2.
