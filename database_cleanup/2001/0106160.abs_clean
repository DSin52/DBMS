We present string duals of four dimensional N=2 pure SU(N) SYM theory. Thetheory is obtained as the low energy limit of D5-branes wrapped on non-trivialtwo-cycles. Using seven dimensional gauged supergravity and uplifting theresult to ten dimensions, we obtain solutions corresponding to various pointsof the N=2 moduli space. The more symmetric solution may correspond to a pointwith rotationally invariant classical vevs. By turning on seven dimensionalscalar fields, we find a solution corresponding to a linear distribution ofvevs. Both solutions are conveniently studied with a D5-probe, which alsoconfirms many of the standard expectations for N=2 solutions.
