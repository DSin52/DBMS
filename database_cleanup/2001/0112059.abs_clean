We construct supergravity solutions describing the near horizon limit of D1D5systems with non-trivial boundary conditions. Upon reduction to five dimensionsthey define Melvin universes with NS--NS/RR fluxes, that smoothly interpolatebetween two different AdS_3 geometries which define fixed points for theRG--flow of the dual field theory. We discuss the decoupling limits at the twoends of the flow. We also present a systematic study of the global propertiesof our solution. In particular we show how, although the AdS_3 x S^3 globalisometry group is broken down to SU(2)_R x U(1)^3 by global identifications, afull two-dimensional conformal group of isometries, with the expected centralcharge, is restored at infinity.
