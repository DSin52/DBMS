In hep-th/9903210 (curvature)$^2$ terms of the effective D-brane action werederived to lowest order in the string coupling. Their results are correct up toambiguous terms which involve the second fundamental form of the D-brane. Wecompute five point string amplitudes on the disk. We compare the subleadingorder in $\alpha'$ of the string amplitudes with the proposed lagrangian ofhep-th/9903210 supplemented by the ambiguous terms. The comparison determinesthe complete form of the gravitational terms in the effective D-brane action toorder ${\calO}(\alpha^{' 2})$. Our results are valid for arbitrary ambientgeometries and world-volume embeddings.
