We discuss a class of 4-dimensional non-homogeneous quaternionic spaces,which become the two known homogeneous spaces (EAdS_4$ and SU(2,1)/U(2)) incertain limits. These moduli spaces have two regions where the metric ispositive definite, separated by a non-physical region where the metric hastimelike directions and which contains a curvature singularity. They admit fourisometries and we consider their general Abelian gauging. The critical pointsof the resulting superpotential and hence the possible domain wall solutionsdiffer significantly in the two regions. On one side one can construct onlysingular walls, whereas in the other we found a smooth domain wallinterpolating between two infra-red critical points located exactly on theboundary of the physical allowed parameter region.
