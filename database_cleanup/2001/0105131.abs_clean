We study the ratio of the entropy to the total energy in conformal fieldtheories at finite temperature. For the free field realizations of N=4 superYang-Mills theory in D=4 and the (2,0) tensor multiplet in D=6, the ratio isbounded from above. The corresponding bounds are less stringent than therecently proposed Verlinde bound. For strongly coupled CFTs with AdS duals, weshow that the ratio obeys the Verlinde bound even in the presence of rotation.For such CFTs, we point out an intriguing resemblance in their thermodynamicformulas with the corresponding ones of two-dimensional CFTs. The discussion isbased on hep-th/0101076.
