We study a geometry of the partition function which is defined in terms of asolution of the five-term relation. It is shown that the 3-dimensionalhyperbolic structure or Euclidean AdS_3 naturally arises in the classical limitof this invariant. We discuss that the oriented ideal tetrahedron can beassigned to the partition function of string.
