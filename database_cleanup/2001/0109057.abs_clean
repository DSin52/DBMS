The gravitational energy is examined in asymptotically de Sitter space-times.The positivity will be shown for certain cases. The de Sitter/CFT(dS/CFT)correspondence recently proposed and cosmic no-hair conjecture are testified inthe aspect of the gravitational energy. From the holographic renormalizationgroup point of view, the two conjectures are deeply connected with each other.
