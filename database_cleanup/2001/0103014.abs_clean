Comments: 37 pages corrected some typos, two references added

We calculate normalization factors and reflection amplitudes in theW-invariant conformal quantum field theories. Using these CFT data we derivevacuum expectation values of exponential fields in affine Toda theories andrelated perturbed conformal field theories. We apply these results to evaluateexplicitly the expectation values of order parameters in the field theoriesassociated with statistical systems, like XY, Z_n-Ising and Ashkin-Tellermodels. The same results are used for the calculation of the asymptotics ofcylindrically symmetric solutions of the classical Toda equations which appearin topological field theories. The integrable boundary Toda theories areconsidered. We derive boundary reflection amplitudes in non-affine case andboundary one point functions in affine Toda theories. The boundary ground stateenergies are cojectured. In the last section we describe the duality propertiesand calculate the reflection amplitudes in integrable deformed Toda theories.
