A novel inhomogeneous gauge transformation law is proposed for a non-Abelianadjoint two-form in four dimensions. Rules for constructing actions invariantunder this are given. The auxiliary vector field which appears in some of thesemodels transforms like a second connection in the theory. Another localsymmetry leaves the compensated three-form field strength invariant, but doesnot seem to be generated by any combination of local constraints. Both types ofsymmetries change the action by total divergences, suggesting that boundarydegrees of freedom have to be taken into account for local quantization.
