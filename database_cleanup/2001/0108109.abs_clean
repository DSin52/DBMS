We present a simple brane-world model in five dimensions. In this model we donot need any fine-tuning between the five dimensional cosmological constant andthe brane tension to obtain four dimensional flat Minkowski space. Thespace-time of our solution has no naked singularities. Further thecompactification scale of the fifth direction is automatically determined.
