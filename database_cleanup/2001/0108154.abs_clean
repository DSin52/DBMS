We present an action for noncommutative supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory inten-dimensions, and confirm its invariance under supersymmetry. We next addhigher-order derivative terms to such a noncommutative supersymmetric action.These terms contain fields as high as the quartic order. This resulting actioncan be regarded as supersymmetric generalization of noncommutative non-AbelianDirac-Born-Infeld action. Some ambiguities related to field redefinitions arealso clarified.
