We investigate the enlarged CP(N) model in 2+1 dimensions. This is a hybridof two CP(N) models coupled with each other in a dual symmetric fashion, and itexhibits the gauge symmetry enhancement and radiative induction of the finiteoff-diagonal gauge boson mass as in the 1+1 dimensional case. We solve the massgap equations and study the fixed point structure in the large-N limit. We findan interacting ultraviolet fixed point which is in contrast with the 1+1dimensional case. We also compute the large-N effective gauge actionexplicitly.
