We consider the homogeneous cosmological radion, which we define as theinterbrane distance in a two brane and $Z_2$ symmetrical configuration. In acoordinate system where one of the brane is at rest, the junction conditionsfor the second (moving) brane give directly the (non-linear) equations ofmotion for the radion. We analyse the radion fluctuations and solve thenon-linear dynamics in some simple cases of interest.
