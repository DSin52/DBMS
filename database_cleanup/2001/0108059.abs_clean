The integrability of the generalized Benney hierarchy with three primaryfields is investigated from the point of view of two-dimensional topologicalfield theories coupled to gravity. The associated primary free energy andcorrelation functions at genus zero are obtained via Landau-Ginzburgformulation and the string equation is derived using the twistor constructionfor the Orlov operators. By adopting the approach of Dubrovin and Zhang weobtain the genus-one corrections of the Poisson brackets of the generalizedBenney hierarchy.
