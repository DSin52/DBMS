Title: Aspects of Born-Infeld Theory and String/M-Theory

Authors: G W Gibbons

Comments: 29 pages plain Latex. Written version of lectures delivered, amongst

other places, at the 37th Karpacz School on Theoretical Physics and the 4thMexican School on Gravitation and Mathematical PhysicsThese notes provide a hopefully pedagogic introduction to Born-Infeld theoryand some of its uses in String/M-Theory from the perspective of some-oneinterested in spacetime geometry. Causality and the consequences of having boththe open string and closed string metric are stressed. This leads to some newinsighst into old problems, such as strings at finite temperature. Variousstrong coupling limits of both Born-Infeld and the M5-brane theories aredescribed and their relevance for tachyon condensations are mentioned.
