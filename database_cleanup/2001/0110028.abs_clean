We study the dynamics of a large class of N=1 quiver theories, geometricallyrealized by type IIB D-brane probes wrapping cycles of local Calabi-Yauthreefolds. These include N=2 (affine) A-D-E quiver theories deformed bysuperpotential terms, as well as chiral N=1 quiver theories obtained in thepresence of vanishing 4-cycles inside a Calabi-Yau. We consider the variouspossible geometric transitions of the 3-fold and show that they correspond toSeiberg-like dualities (represented by Weyl reflections in the A-D-E case or`mutations' of bundles in the case of vanishing 4-cycles) or large N dualitiesinvolving gaugino condensates (generalized conifold transitions). Also dualitycascades are naturally realized in these classes of theories, and are relatedto the affine Weyl group symmetry in the A-D-E case.
