We consider linearized 5-d gravity in the Randall-Sundrum brane world. Theclass of static solutions for linearized Einstein equations is found. Also weobtaine wave solutions describing radiation from an imaginary point sourcelocated at the Planck distance from the brane. We analyze the fields asymptoticbehavior and peculiarities of matter sources.
