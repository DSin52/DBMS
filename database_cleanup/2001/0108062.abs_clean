The relation between BRST cohomology and the N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Millsaction in 4 dimensions is discussed. In particular, it is shown that both offand on shell N=1 SYM actions are related to a lower dimensional fieldpolynomial by solving the descent equations, which is obtained from thecohomological analysis of linearized Slavnov-Taylor operator $\B$, in theframework of Algebraic Renormalization. Furthermore we show that off and onshell solutions differ only by a $\B$- exact term, which is a consequence ofthe fact that the cohomology of both cases are same.
