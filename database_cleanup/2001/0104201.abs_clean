We present a model with an infinite volume bulk in which a braneworld with acosmological constant evolves to a static, 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.This evolution occurs for a generic class of initial conditions with positiveenergy densities. The metric everywhere outside the brane is that of a5-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, where the effect of the brane is thecreation of a frame with a varying speed of light. This fact is encoded in thestructure of the 4-dimensional graviton propagator on the braneworld, which maylead to some interesting Lorentz symmetry violating effects. In our frameworkthe cosmological constant problem takes a different meaning since the flatnessof the Universe is guaranteed for an arbitrary negative cosmological constant.Instead constraints on the model come from different concerns which we discussin detail.
