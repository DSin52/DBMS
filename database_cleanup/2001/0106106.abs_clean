A previously developed lepton mass equation is extended to include themassive bosons and quarks of all three generations. The particles are modeledas closed, string-like, light front solitons whose key quantum numbers aretheir node number n and their winding number omega. The simplicity and form ofthe mass equation suggests that the dominant mass effect comes from how theparticles embed themselves in spacetime.
