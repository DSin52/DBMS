Canonical differential calculus is defined for finitely generated abeliangroup with an involution existing consistently. Two such canonical calculi arefound out. Fermionic representation for canonical calculus is defined based onquantized calculus. Fermionic representations for above-mentioned two canonicalcalculi are searched.
