Consequences of a strong version of the AdS/CFT correspondence for extremelystringy physics are examined. In particular, properties of N = 4 supersymmetricYang-Mills theory are used to extract results about interacting tensionlessstrings and massless higher spin fields in an AdS_5 x S^5 background.Furthermore, the thermodynamics of this model signals the presence of aHawking-Page phase transition between AdS_5 space and a "black hole"-like hightemperature configuration even in the extreme string limit.
