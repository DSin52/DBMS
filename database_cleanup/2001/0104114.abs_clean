We analyze the superfield equations of the 4-dimensional N=4 SYM-theory usinglight-cone gauge conditions and the harmonic-superspace approach. The harmonicsuperfield equations of motion are drastically simplified in this gauge, inparticular, the basic harmonic-superfield matrices and the correspondingharmonic analytic gauge connections become nilpotent on-shell.
