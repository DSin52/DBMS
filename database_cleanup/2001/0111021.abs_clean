Title: Principles of a Unified Theory of Spacetime and Physical Interactions

Comments: 14 pages, LaTeX using emlines.sty

Principles of a new approach (binary geometrophysics) are presented toconstruct the unified theory of spacetime and the familiar kinds of physicalinteractions. Physically, the approach is a modified S-matrix theory involvingideas of the multidimensional geometric models of physical interactions ofKaluza-Klein's type as well as Fokker-Feynman's action-at-a-distance theory.Mathematically, this is a peculiar binary geometry being described in algebraicterms. In the present approach the binary geometry volume is a prototype ofstrong and electroweak interactions, and the multidimensional metric. Atransition from microworld geometrophysics to the conventional physical theoryin classical spacetime are characterized.
