It is often convenient to view Hawking (black hole) radiation as a process ofquantum tunneling. Within this framework, Kraus and Wilczek (KW) have initiatedan analytical treatment of black hole emission. Notably, their methodologyincorporates the effects of a dynamical black hole geometry. In the currentpaper, the KW formalism is applied to the case of a charged BTZ black hole. Inthe context of this interesting model, we are able to demonstrate a non-thermalspectrum, with the usual Hawking result being reproduced at zeroth order infrequency. Considerable attention is then given to the examination ofnear-extremal thermodynamics.
