We construct an explicit model to describe fermions confined on a fourdimensional brane embedded in a five dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. Weextend previous works to accommodate massive bound states on the brane andexhibit the transverse structure of the fermionic fields. We estimateanalytically and calculate numerically the fermion mass spectrum on the brane,which we show to be discrete. The confinement life-time of the bound states isevaluated, and it is shown that existing constraints can be made compatiblewith the existence of massive fermions trapped on the brane for durations muchlonger than the age of the Universe.
