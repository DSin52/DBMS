We propose a dynamical mechanism of localization of gauge fields on a branein which gauge bosons are excitations of the brane itself or composites madeout of matter fields localized on the brane. The mechanism is operative forboth Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields. Several scalar and scalar-fermioncomposite models of gauge fields are considered. The models exhibit exact gaugeinvariance and therefore charge universality of gauge interactions isautomatically preserved. The mechanism is shown to be equivalent to amodification of the Dvali, Gabadadze and Shifman scenario in which gauge bosonshave no bulk kinetic terms and only possess induced kinetic terms on the brane.
