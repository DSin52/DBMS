We examine the cosmological implications of space-time non-commutativity,discovering yet another realization of the varying speed of light model.Our starting point is the well-known fact that non-commutativity leads todeformed dispersion relations, relating energy and momentum, implying afrequency dependent speed of light. A Hot Big Bang Universe thereforeexperiences a higher speed of light as it gets hotter. We study the statisticalphysics of this "deformed radiation", recovering standard results at lowPlanck's spectrum, a temperature dependent equation of state $w=p/\rho$(ranging from 1/3 to infinity), a new Stephan-Boltzmann law, and a new entropyrelation. These new photon properties closely mimic those of phonons incrystals, hardly a surprising analogy. They combine to solve the horizon andflatness problems, explaining also the large entropy of the Universe. We alsoshow how one would find a direct imprint of non-commutativity in the spectrumof a cosmic graviton background, should it ever be detected.
