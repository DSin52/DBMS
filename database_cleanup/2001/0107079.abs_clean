J. YndurainI present a brief review on some of the recent developments in topologicalquantum field theory. These include topological string theory, topologicalYang-Mills theory and Chern-Simons gauge theory. It is emphasized how theapplication of different field and string theory methods has led to importantprogress, opening entirely new points of view in the context of Gromov-Witteninvariants, Donaldson invariants, and quantum-group invariants for knots andlinks.
