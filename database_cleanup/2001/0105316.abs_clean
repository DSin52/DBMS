We apply a new general method of anholonomic frames with associated nonlinearconnection structure to construct new classes of exact solutions ofEinstein-Dirac equations in five dimensional (5D)gravity. Such solutions areparametrized by off-diagonal metrics in coordinate (holonomic) bases, or,equivalently, by diagonal metrics given with respect to some anholonomic frames(pentads, or funfbiends, satisfing corresponding constraint relations). Weconsider two possibilities of generalization of the Taub NUT metric in order toobtain vacuum solutions of 5D Einsitein equations with effectiverenormalization of constants having distinguished anisotropies on an angularparameter or on extra dimension coordinate. The constructions are extended tosolutions describing self-consistent propagations of 3D Dirac wave packets in5D anisotropic Taub NUT spacetimes. We show that such anisotropicconfigurations of spinor matter can induce gravitational 3D solitons beingsolutions of Kadomtsev-Petviashvili or of sine-Gordon equations.
