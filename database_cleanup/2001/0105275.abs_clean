Using a 2-loop approximation for $\beta$-functions, we have considered thecorresponding renormalization group improved effective potential in the DualAbelian Higgs Model (DAHM) of scalar monopoles and calculated the phasetransition (critical) couplings in U(1) and SU(N) regularized gauge theories.In contrast to our previous result $\alpha_{crit} \approx 0.17$, obtained inthe one-loop approximation with the DAHM effective potential (see Ref.[20]),the critical value of the electric fine structure constant in the 2-loopapproximation, calculated in the present paper, is equal to$\alpha_{crit}\approx 0.208$ and coincides with the lattice result for compactidea of the "abelization" of monopole vacuum in the Yang--Mills theories, wehave obtained an estimation of the SU(N) triple point coupling constants, whichis $\alpha_{N,crit}^{-1}=\frac{N}{2}\sqrt{\frac{N+1}{N-1}}\alpha_{U(1),crit}^{-1}$. This relation was used for the description of thePlanck scale values of the inverse running constants $\alpha_i^{-1}(\mu)$(i=1,2,3 correspond to U(1), SU(2) and SU(3) groups), according to the ideas ofthe Multiple Point Model [16].
