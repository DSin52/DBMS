Bound states of BPS particles in five-dimensional N=2 supergravity arecounted by a topological index. We compute this bound state index exactly fortwo and three black holes as a function of the SU(2)_L angular momentum. Therequired regulator for the infrared continuum of near-coincident black holes ischosen in accord with the enhanced superconformal symmetry.
