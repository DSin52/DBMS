We show that the two-loop Euler-Heisenberg effective Lagrangian for scalarQED in a constant Euclidean self-dual background has a simple explicit closedform expression in terms of the digamma function. This result leads to a simpleanalysis of the weak- and strong-field expansions, the two-loop scalar QED betafunction, and the analytic continuation properties of the effective Lagrangianand its imaginary part.
