We find a three-parameter family of solutions to IIB supergravity thatcorresponds to N=1 supersymmetric holographic RG flows of N=4 supersymmetricYang Mills theory. This family of solutions allows one to give a mass to asingle chiral superfield, and to probe a two-dimensional subspace of theCoulomb branch. In particular, we examine part of the Coulomb branch of theLeigh-Strassler fixed point. We look at the infra-red asymptotics of theseflows from the ten-dimensional perspective. We also make general conjecturesfor the lifting Ansatz of five-dimensional scalar configurations toten-dimensional tensor gauge fields. Our solution provides a highly non-trivialtest of these conjectures.
