Old fashioned duality used to derive the closed string field theory formagnetic vortex from the gauge theory with Higgs scalar, is applied to thestring theories. The bosonic sring theory coupled to the Kalb-Ramond 2-formfield is dually transformed to the 6-brane theory coupled to the 7-form field.The old fashioned dual transformation is also examined for the Type IIA and IIBsuperstrings. For this study, the string field theoretical treatment of thebosonic and fermionic strings is developped based on the reparametrizationinvariant formulation of strings by Marshall and Ramond. In order for theself-duality of the Type IIB superstring to appear, the following dualfunctional is the bosonization of the R-R one.
