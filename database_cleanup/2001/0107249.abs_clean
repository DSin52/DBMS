Feynman's functional formulation of statistical mechanics is used to studythe renormalizability of the well known Linear Chiral Sigma Model in thepresence of fermionic fields at finite temperature in an alternative way. It isshown that the renormalization conditions coincide with those of the zerotemperature model.
