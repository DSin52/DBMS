We derive leading terms in the effective actions describing the coupling ofbulk supergravity fields to systems of arbitrary numbers of Dp-branes andD(p+4)-branes in type IIA/IIB string theory. We use these actions toinvestigate the physics of Dp-D(p+4) systems in the presence of weak backgroundfields. In particular, we construct various solutions describing collections ofDp-branes blown up into open D(p+2)-branes ending on D(p+4)-branes. Theconfigurations are stabilized by the presence of background fields andrepresent an open-brane analogue of the Myers dielectric effect. To deduce theD-brane actions, we use supersymmetry to derive operators corresponding tomoments of various conserved currents in the Berkooz-Douglas matrix model ofM-theory in the presence of longitudinal M5-branes and then use dualities torelate these operators to the worldvolume operators appearing in theDp-D(p+4)-brane effective actions.
