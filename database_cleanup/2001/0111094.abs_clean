We study the algebra ${\cal A}_n$ and the basis of the Hilbert space ${\calH}_n$ in terms of the $\theta$ functions of the positions of $n$ solitons. Thenwe embed the Heisenberg group as the quantum operator factors in therepresentation of the transfer matrice of various integrable models. Finally wegeneralize our result to the generic $\theta$ case.
