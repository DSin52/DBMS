Using the path-integral formalism, we generalize the 't Hooft-Veltman methodof unitary regulators to put forward a framework for finite, alternativequantum theories to a given quantum field theory. Feynman-like rules of such afinite, alternative quantum theory lead to alternative, perturbative Greenfunctions. Which are acceptably regularized perturbative expansions of theoriginal Green functions, causal, and imply no unphysical free particles. Todemonstrate that the proposed framework is feasible, we take the quantum fieldtheory of a single, self-interacting real scalar field and show how we canalter, covariantly and locally, its free-field Lagrangian to obtain finite,alternative perturbative Green functions.
