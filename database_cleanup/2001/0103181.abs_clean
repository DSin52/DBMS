A one-instanton level test is performed for the proposed reparameterisationscheme matching the conjectured exact low energy results and instantonpredictions for N=2 supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theories with 2N masslessfundamental matter hypermultiplets across the entire quantum moduli space. Theconstants within the scheme which ensure agreement between the exact resultsand the instanton predictions for general N are derived. This constitutes anon-trivial test of the scheme, which eliminates the discrepancies arising whenthe two sets of results are compared.
