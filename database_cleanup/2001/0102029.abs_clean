We derive the hard thermal loop action for soft electromagnetic fields in thefinite temperature world-line formulation at imaginary time, by firstintegrating out the hard fermion modes from the microscopic QED action.Further, using the finite T world-line method, we calculate all static higherorder terms in the soft electromagnetic field. At high T, the leadingnon-linear terms are independent of the temperature and, except for a termquartic in the time component of the vector potential, they cancel exactlyagainst the vacuum contribution. The remaining T-dependent non-linear termsbecome more strongly suppressed by the temperature as the number of soft fieldsincreases, thus making the expansion reliable. Applications of this method toother theories and problems at the soft scale are also briefly discussed.
