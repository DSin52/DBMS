We investigate U(N) Chern-Simons theories on noncommutative plane. We showthat for the theories to be consistent quantum mechanically, the coefficient ofthe Chern-Simons term should be quantized $\kappa = n/2\pi$ with an integer$n$. This is a surprise for the U(1) gauge theory. When uniform backgroundcharge density $\rho_e$ is present, the quantization rule changes to $\kappa+\rho_e\theta = n/2\pi$ with noncommutative parameter $\theta$. With the exactexpression for the angular momentum, we argue in the U(1) theory that chargedparticles in the symmetric phase carry fractional spin $1/2n$ and vortices inthe broken phase carry half-integer or integer spin $-n/2$.
