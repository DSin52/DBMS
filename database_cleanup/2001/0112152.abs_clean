We calculate Wilson loop (quark anti-quark potential) in dS/CFTcorrespondence. The brane-world model is considered where bulk is two 5dEuclidean de Sitter spaces and boundary (brane) is 4d de Sitter one. Startingfrom the Nambu-Goto action, the calculation of the effective tension (averageenergy) is presented. Unlike to the case of supergravity calculation of Wilsonloop in AdS/CFT set-up, there is no need to regularize the Nambu-Goto action(the volume of de Sitter space is finite). It turns out that at sufficientlysmall curvature of 5d background the energy (potential) is positive and linearon the distance between quark and anti-quark what indicates to the possibilityof confinement.
