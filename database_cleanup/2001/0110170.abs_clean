We classify generalised supersymmetric fluxbranes in type II string theoryobtained as Kaluza-Klein reductions of the Minkowski space vacuum ofeleven-dimensional supergravity. We obtain two families of smooth solutionswhich contains all the known solutions, new solutions called nullbranes, andsolutions interpolating between them. We explicitly construct all the solutionsand we study the U-duality orbits of some of these backgrounds.
