We find a class of flat supersymmetric brane-antibrane configurations. Theyfollow from ordinary brane-antibrane systems by turning on a specificworldvolume background electric field, which corresponds to dissolvedfundamental strings. We have clarified in detail how they arise and identifiedtheir constituent charges as well as the corresponding supergravity solutions.Adopting the matrix theory description, we construct the worldvolume gaugetheories and prove the absence of any tachyonic degrees. We also studysupersymmetric solitons of the worldvolume theories.
