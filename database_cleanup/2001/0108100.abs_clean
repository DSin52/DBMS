We discuss some physical issues related to the K-theoretic classification ofD-brane charges, putting an emphasis on the role of D-brane instantons. Therelation to D-instantons provides a physical interpretation to the mathematicalalgorithm for computing K-theory known as the ``Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectralsequence.'' Conjecturally, a formulation in terms of D-instantons leads to acomputationally useful formulation of K-homology in general. As an applicationand illustration of this viewpoint we discuss some issues connected withD-brane charges associated with branes in WZW models. We discuss the case ofSU(3) in detail, and comment on the general picture of branes in SU(N), basedon a recent result of M. Hopkins.
