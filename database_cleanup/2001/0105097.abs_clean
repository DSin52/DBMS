Warped compactifications with significant warping provide one of the fewknown mechanisms for naturally generating large hierarchies of physical scales.We demonstrate that this mechanism is realizable in string theory, and giveexamples involving orientifold compactifications of IIB string theory andF-theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau four-folds. In each case, thehierarchy of scales is fixed by a choice of RR and NS fluxes in the compactmanifold. Our solutions involve compactifications of the Klebanov-Strasslergravity dual to a confining N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory,and the hierarchyreflects the small scale of chiral symmetry breaking in the dual gauge theory.
