Certain black branes are unstable toward fluctuations that lead tonon-uniform mass distributions. We study static, non-uniform solutions thatdiffer only perturbatively from uniform ones. For uncharged black strings infive dimensions, we find evidence of a first order transition from uniform tonon-uniform solutions.
