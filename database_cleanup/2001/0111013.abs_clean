We discuss different dualities of QHE in the framework of the noncommutativeChern-Simons theory. First, we consider the Morita or T-duality transformationon the torus which maps the abelian noncommutative CS description of QHE on thetorus into the nonabelian commutative description on the dual torus. It isargued that the Ruijsenaars integrable many-body system provides thedescription of the QHE with finite amount of electrons on the torus. The newIIB brane picture for the QHE is suggested and applied to Jain and generalizedhierarchies. This picture naturally links 2d $\sigma$-model and 3d CSdescription of the QHE. All duality transformations are identified in the branesetup and can be related with the mirror symmetry and S duality. We suggest abrane interpretation of the plateu transition in IQHE in which a critical pointis naturally described by $SL(2,R)$ WZW model.
