At large N, a field theory and its orbifolds (given by projecting out some ofits fields) share the same planar graphs. If the parent-orbifold relationcontinues even nonperturbatively, then properties such as confinement andchiral symmetry breaking will appear in both parent and orbifold. N=1supersymmetric Yang-Mills has many nonsupersymmetric orbifolds which resembleQCD. A nonperturbative parent-orbifold relation predicts many surprisingeffects, exactly valid at large N, and expected to suffer only mild 1/Ncorrections. These include degeneracies among bosonic hadrons and exactpredictions for domain wall tensions. Other predictions are valid even whensupersymmetry in the parent is broken. Since these theories are QCD-like,simulation is possible, so these predictions may be numerically tested. Themethod also relates wide classes of nonsupersymmetric theories.
