We derive a simple no-go theorem relating to self-tuning solutions to thecosmological constant for observers on a brane, which rely on a singularity inan extra dimension. The theorem shows that it is impossible to shield thesingularity from the brane by a horizon, unless the positive energy condition(rho+p >= 0) is violated in the bulk or on the brane. The result holdsregardless of the kinds of fields which are introduced in the bulk or on thebrane, whether Z_2 symmetry is imposed at the brane, or whether higherderivative terms of the Gauss-Bonnet form are added to the gravitational partof the action. However, the no-go theorem can be evaded if the three-brane hasspatial curvature. We discuss explicit realizations of such solutions whichhave both self-tuning and a horizon shielding the singularity.
