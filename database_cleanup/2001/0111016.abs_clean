The chiral superstring measure constructed in the earlier papers of thisseries for general gravitino slices is examined in detail for slices supportedat two points x_\alpha. In this case, the invariance of the measure underinfinitesimal changes of gravitino slices established previously ismoduli space, to be locally and globally independent from the points x_\alpha,as well as from the superghost insertion points p_a, q_\alpha introducedearlier as computational devices. In particular, the measure is completelyunambiguous. The limit x_\alpha = q_\alpha is then well defined. It is ofspecial interest, since it elucidates some subtle issues in the construction ofthe picture-changing operator Y(z) central to the BRST formalism. The formulafor the chiral superstring measure in this limit is derived explicitly.
