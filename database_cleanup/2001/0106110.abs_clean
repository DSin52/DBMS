Global properties of abelian noncommutative gauge theories based on$\star$-products which are deformation quantizations of arbitrary Poissonstructures are studied. The consistency condition for finite noncommutativegauge transformations and its explicit solution in the abelian case are given.It is shown that the local existence of invertible covariantizing maps (whichare closely related to the Seiberg-Witten map) leads naturally to the notion ofa noncommutative line bundle with noncommutative transition functions. Weintroduce the space of sections of such a line bundle and explicitly show thatit is a projective module. The local covariantizing maps define a new starproduct $\star'$ which is shown to be Morita equivalent to $\star$.
