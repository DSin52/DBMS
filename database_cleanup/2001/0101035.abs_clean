We derive Virasoro constraints for the zero momentum part of the QCD-likepartition functions in the sector of topological charge $\nu$. The constraintsdepend on the topological charge only through the combination $N_f +\beta\nu/2$where the value of the Dyson index $\beta$ is determined by the reality type ofthe fermions. This duality between flavor and topology is inherited by thesmall-mass expansion of the partition function and {\em all} spectral sum-rulesof inverse powers of the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator. For the specialcase $\beta=2$ but arbitrary topological charge the Virasoro constraints aresolved uniquely by a Generalized Kontsevich Model with potential ${\cal V}(X) =1/X$.
