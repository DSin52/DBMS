The helicity flip of a spin-1/2 Dirac fermion interacting with a torsion-field endowed with a pseudo-tensorial extension is analysed. Taking the torsionto be represented by a Kalb-Ramond field, we show that there is a finiteamplitude for helicity flip for massive fermions. The lowest order contributionis proportional to the pseudo-tensor term.
