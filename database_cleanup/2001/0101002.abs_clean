Title: BPS Vortices in Brane-Antibrane Effective Theory

Authors: Takao Suyama

Comments: 11 pages, 2 figures

We investigate an action which resembles the effective action ofbrane-antibrane system derived from boundary string field theory. We find thatthe action has smooth vortex solutions which saturate the Bogomol'nyi bound.
