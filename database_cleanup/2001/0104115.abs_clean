The non-abelian version of the self-dual model proposed by Townsend, Pilchand van Nieuwenhuizen presents some well known difficulties not found in theabelian case, such as well defined duality operation leading to self-dualityand dual equivalence with the Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory, for the fullrange of the coupling constant. These questions are tackled in this work usinga distinct gauge lifting technique that is alternative to the master actionapproach first proposed by Deser and Jackiw. The master action, which hasproved useful in exhibiting the dual equivalence between theories in diversedimensions, runs into trouble when dealing with the non-abelian case apart fromthe weak coupling regime. This new dualization technique on the other hand, isinsensitive of the non-abelian character of the theory and generalizestraightforwardly from the abelian case. It also leads, in a simple manner, tothe dual equivalence for the case of couplings with dynamical fermionic matterfields. As an application, we discuss the consequences of this dual equivalencein the context of 3D non-abelian bosonization.
