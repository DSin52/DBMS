We investigate the Casimir effect at finite temperature for a charged scalarfield in the presence of an external uniform and constant magnetic field,perpendicular to the Casimir plates. We have used a boundary conditioncharacterized by a deformation parameter $\theta$; for $\theta=0$ we have aperiodic condition and for $\theta=\pi$, an antiperiodic one, for intermediatevalues, we have a deformation. The temperature was introduced using theimaginary time formalism and both the lagrangian and free energy were obtainedfrom Schwinger proper time method for computing the effective action. We alsocomputed the permeability and its asymptotic expressions for low and hightemperatures.
