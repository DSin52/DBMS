The SU(2) collective coordinates expansion of the Born-Infeld\break SkyrmionLagrangian is performed. The classical Hamiltonian is computed from thisthis non-polynomial Lagrangian up to second-order variable in the collectivecoordinates. This second-class constrained model is quantized by DiracHamiltonian method and symplectic formalism. Although it is not expected tofind symmetries on second-class systems, a hidden symmetry is disclosed byformulating the Born-Infeld Skyrmion %model as a gauge theory. To this end wedeveloped a new constraint conversion technique based on the symplecticformalism. Finally, a discussion on the role played by the hidden symmetry onthe computation of the energy spectrum is presented.
