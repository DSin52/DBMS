The recently found non-critical open string theories is reviewed. These openstrings, noncommutative open string theories (NCOS), arise as consistentquantum theories describing the low energy theory of D-branes in a backgroundelectric B-field in the critical limit. Focusing on the D3-brane case, weconstruct the most general (3+1) NCOS, which is described by four parameters.We study S and T -dualities of these theories and argue the existence of aU-duality group.
