In a previous paper [hep-th/0012251] we proposed a simple class of actionsfor string field theory around the tachyon vacuum. In this paper we search forclassical solutions describing D-branes of different dimensions using theansatz that the solutions factorize into the direct product of a matter stateand a universal ghost state. We find closed form expressions for the matterstate describing D-branes of all dimensions. For the space filling D25-branethe state is the matter part of the zero angle wedge state, the ``sliver'',built in [hep-th/0006240]. For the other D-brane solutions the matter statesare constructed using a solution generating technique outlined in[hep-th/0008252]. The ratios of tensions of various D-branes, requiringevaluation of determinants of infinite dimensional matrices, are calculatednumerically and are in very good agreement with the known results.
