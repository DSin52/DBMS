In this work we have constructed the n=4 extended local conformal timesupersymmetry for the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmological models.This is based on the superfield construction of the action, which is invariantunder wordline local n=4 supersymmetry with $SU(2)_{local} \otimesSU(2)_{global}$ internal symmetry. It is shown that the supersymmetric actionhas the form of the localized (or superconformal) version of the action for n=4supersymmetric quantum mechanics. This superfield procedure provides a welldefined scheme for including supermatter.
