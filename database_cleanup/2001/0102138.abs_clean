Recently, Verlinde noted a surprising similarity between Friedmann equationgoverning radiation dominated universe and Cardy's entropy formula in conformalfield theory. In this note, we study a brane-universe filled with radiation andstiff-matter. We analyze Friedmann equation in this context and compare ourresults with Cardy's entropy formula.
