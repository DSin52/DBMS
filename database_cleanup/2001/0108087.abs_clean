Title: Coupling the Superstring to a D-Brane Ramond-Ramond Background

Authors: Stefan Antusch

Comments: 5 pages, minor changes, references added

We propose a new approach for coupling the type II superstring to theRamond-Ramond background of D-branes in the RNS formalism, alternative tointroducing RR vertex operators. It is based on the mixing betweenRamond-Ramond p-form excitations in the closed string spectrum andtransversally polarized excitations in the open string spectrum.
