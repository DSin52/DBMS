We show that the exact N=1 superpotential of a class of 4d stringcompactifications is computed by the closed topological string compactified totwo dimensions. A relation to the open topological string is used to define aspecial geometry for N=1 mirror symmetry. Flat coordinates, an N=1 mirror mapfor chiral multiplets and the exact instanton corrected superpotential areobtained from the periods of a system of differential equations. The resultpoints to a new class of open/closed string dualities which map individualstring world-sheets with boundary to ones without. It predicts anmathematically unexpected coincidence of the closed string Gromov-Witteninvariants of one Calabi-Yau geometry with the open string invariants of thedual Calabi-Yau.
