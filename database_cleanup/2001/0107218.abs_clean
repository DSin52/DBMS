Title: D-branes and Cosmological Singularities

Authors: Brook Williams

Comments: 8 pages

The motion of a test Dq-brane in a Dp-brane background is studied. Theinduced metric on the test brane is then interpreted as the cosmology of thetest brane universe. One is then able to resolve the resulting cosmologicalsingularities. In particular, for a D3-brane in a D5-brane background, onefinds a 3+1 dimensional FRW universe with equation of state $p = \ed$. It hasbeen argued that this may have been the dominant form of matter at very earlytimes.
