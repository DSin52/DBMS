The spectrum of stable electrically and magnetically charged supersymmetricparticles can change discontinuously due to the decay of these particles as thevacuum on the Coulomb branch is varied. We show that this decay process is welldescribed by semi-classical field configurations purely in terms of the lowenergy effective action on the Coulomb branch even when it occurs at strongcoupling. The resulting picture of the stable supersymmetric spectrum is ageneralization of the ``string web'' picture of these states found in stringconstructions of certain theories.
