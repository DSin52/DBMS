A dual pair of supersymmetric string theories that involves an asymmetricorbifold and an orientifold of Type II is considered. The D-branes of theorbifold theory (that were recently determined by Gutperle) are all non-BPS anddo not carry any conserved gauge charges. It is shown that they carrynon-trivial K-theory charges, and that they can be understood in terms ofbranes wrapping certain homology classes of the M-theory compactification.Using the adiabatic argument, dual partners of some of these non-BPS D-branesare proposed. The relations between these dual states are found to be inagreement with the M-theory description of the D-branes.
