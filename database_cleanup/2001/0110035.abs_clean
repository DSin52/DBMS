We present several results concerning non-commutative instantons and theSeiberg-Witten map. Using a simple ansatz we find a large new class ofinstanton solutions in arbitrary even dimensional non-commutative Yang-Millstheory. These include the two dimensional ``shift operator'' solutions and thefour dimensional Nekrasov-Schwarz instantons as special cases. We also studyhow the Seiberg-Witten map acts on these instanton solutions. The infinitesimalSeiberg-Witten map is shown to take a very simple form in operator language,and this result is used to give a commutative description of non-commutativeinstantons. The instanton is found to be singular in commutative variables.
