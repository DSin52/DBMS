We found an exact solution of elongated U(1) instanton on noncommutative R^4for general instanton number k. The deformed ADHM equation was solved withgeneral k and the gauge connection and the curvature were given explicitly. Wealso checked our solutions and evaluated the instanton charge by a numericalcalculation.
