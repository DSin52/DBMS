We consider a brane-world of co-dimension one without the reflection symmetrythat is commonly imposed between the two sides of the brane. Using thecoordinate-free formalism of the Gauss-Codacci equations, we derive theeffective Einstein equations by relating the local curvature to the matter onthe brane in the case when its bare tension is much larger than the localizedmatter, and hence show that Einstein gravity is a natural consequence of suchmodels in the weak field limit. We find agreement with the recently derivedcosmological case, which can be solved exactly, and point out that such modelscan be realized naturally in the case where there is a minimally coupled formfield in the bulk.
