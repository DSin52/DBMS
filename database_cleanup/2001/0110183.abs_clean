To study noncommutativity properties of the open string with constant B-fieldwe construct a mechanical action which reproduces classical dynamics of thestring sector under consideration. It allows one to apply the Diracquantization procedure for constrained systems in a direct and unambiguous way.The mechanical action turns out to be the first order system without taking thestrong field limit $B\longrightarrow\infty$. In particular, it is true for zeromode of the string coordinate which means that the noncommutativity isintrinsic property of this mechanical system. We describe the arbitrariness inthe relation existent between the mechanical and the string variables and showthat noncommutativity of the string variables on the boundary can be removed.It is in correspondence with the result of Seiberg and Witten on relation amongnoncommutative and ordinary Yang-Mills theories.
