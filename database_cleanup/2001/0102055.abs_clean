Zacatecas, August 2000. A few typos have been correctedIn generalized Yang-Mills theories scalar fields can be gauged just as vectorfields in a usual Yang-Mills theory, albeit it is done in the spinorialrepresentation. The presentation of these theories is aesthetic in theterms and irreducible representations, but with generalized Yang-Millstheories, only two terms and two irreducible representations are required.These theories are constructed based upon the maximal subgroups of the gaugeLie group. The two terms of the lagrangian are the kinetic energy of fermionsand of bosons. A brief review of Yang-Mills theories and covariant derivativesis given, then generalized Yang-Mills theories are defined through ageneralization of the covariant derivative. Two examples are given, onepertaining the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model and another SU(5) grandunification. The first is based upon a $U(3)\supset U(1)\times U(1)\timesSU(2)$ generalized Yang-Mills theory, and the second upon a $SU(6)\supsetU(1)\times SU(5)$ theory. The possibility of expressing generalized Yang-Millstheories using a five-dimensional formalism is also studied. The situation isunclear in this case. At the end a list of comments and criticisms is given.
