Double-trace deformations of the AdS/CFT duality result in a new perturbationexpansion for string theory, based on a non-local worldsheet. We discuss someaspects of the deformation in the low energy gravity approximation, where itappears as a change in the boundary condition of fields. We relate uniquefeatures of the boundary of AdS to the worldsheet becoming non-local, andconjecture that non-local worldsheet actions may be generic in other classes ofbackgrounds.
