The hybrid formalism is used to quantize the superstring compactified totwo-dimensional target-space in a manifestly spacetime supersymmetric manner. Aquantizable sigma model action is then constructed for the Type II superstringin curved two-dimensional supergravity backgrounds which can includeRamond-Ramond flux. Such curved backgrounds include Calabi-Yau four-foldcompactifications with Ramond-Ramond flux, and new extremal black holesolutions in two-dimensional dilaton supergravity theory. These black holesolutions are a natural generalization of the CGHS model and might be possibleto describe using a supergroup version of the SL(2,R)/U(1) WZW model. We alsostudy some dynamical aspects of the new black holes, such as formation andevaporation.
