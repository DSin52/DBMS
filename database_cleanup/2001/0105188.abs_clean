We study tachyon condensation on noncommutative toric orbifolds with a $Z_2$discrete group and explore the various kins of brane bound states arising inthe case of irrational values of the B-field. We show that $Z_$ symmetry of theorbifolds incorporates naturally anti-branes in the spectrum and leads toequivalent results as those obtained by starting from an original pair ofD-barD system on quantum torii. A specific analysis is deserved to theirrational representation of NC orbifolds and to the unstable bound statesgenerated by the condensation.
