The convergence of the derivative expansion of the exact renormalisationgroup is investigated via the computation of the beta function of masslessscalar lambda phi^4 theory. The derivative expansion of the Polchinski flowequation converges at one loop for certain fast falling smooth cutoffs.Convergence of the derivative expansion of the Legendre flow equation istrivial at one loop, but also can occur at two loops and in particularconverges for an exponential cutoff.
