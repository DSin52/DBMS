The notion of the Wick star-product is covariantly introduced for a generalsymplectic manifold equipped with two transverse polarisations. Along the linesof Fedosov method, the explicit procedure is given to construct the Wicksymbols on the manifold. The cohomological obstruction is identified to theequivalence between the Wick star-product and the Fedosov one. In particular inthe K\"ahler case, the Wick star-product is shown to be equivalent the Weylone, iff the manifold is a Calabi-Yau one.
