Title: A New Measure, Scale Invariance and See Saw Cosmology

Authors: E.I.Guendelman

Comments: Contribution to Pascos 2001

The cosmological constant problem and the possibility of obtaining a see sawcosmological effect, where the effective vacuum energy is highly suppressed bythe existence of a large scale is investigated in the context ofscale-invariant, generally covariant theory. Scale invariance is considered inthe context of a gravitational theory where the action, in the first orderformalism, is of the form $S = \int L_{1} \Phi d^4x$ + $\intL_{2}\sqrt{-g}d^4x$ where $\Phi$ is a density built out of degrees of freedomindependent of the metric.
