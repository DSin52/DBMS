A recent notion in theoretical physics is that not all quantum theories arisefrom quantising a classical system. Also, a given quantum model may possessmore than just one classical limit. These facts find strong evidence in stringduality and M-theory, and it has been suggested that they should also have acounterpart in quantum mechanics. In view of these developments we propose"dequantisation", a mechanism to render a quantum theory classical.Specifically, we present a geometric procedure to "dequantise" a given quantummechanics (regardless of its classical origin, if any) to possibly differentclassical limits, whose quantisation gives back the original quantum theory.The standard classical limit $\hbar\to 0$ arises as a particular case of ourapproach.
