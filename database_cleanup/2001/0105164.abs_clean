For any root system $\Delta$ and an irreducible representation ${\cal R}$ ofthe reflection (Weyl) group $G_\Delta$ generated by $\Delta$, a {\em spinhyperbolic, trigonometric and elliptic. For each member $\mu$ of ${\cal R}$, tobe called a "site", we associate a vector space ${\bf V}_{\mu}$ whose elementis called a "spin". Its dynamical variables are the canonical coordinates$\{q_j,p_j\}$ of a particle in ${\bf R}^r$, ($r=$ rank of $\Delta$), and spinexchange operators $\{\hat{\cal P}_\rho\}$ ($\rho\in\Delta$) which exchange thespins at the sites $\mu$ and $s_{\rho}(\mu)$. Here $s_\rho$ is the reflectiongenerated by $\rho$. For each $\Delta$ and ${\cal R}$ a {\em spin exchangemodel} can be defined. The Hamiltonian of a spin exchange model is a linearcombination of the spin exchange operators only. It is obtained by "freezing"the canonical variables at the equilibrium point of the corresponding classicalCalogero-Moser model. For $\Delta=A_r$ and ${\cal R}=$ vector representation itreduces to the well-known Haldane-Shastry model. Universal Lax pair operatorsfor both spin Calogero-Moser models and spin exchange models are presentedwhich enable us to construct as many conserved quantities as the number ofsites for {\em degenerate} potentials.
