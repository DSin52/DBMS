We propose gauge theories in which the unstable branes and the fundamentalstring are realized as classical solutions. While the former are represented bydomain wall like configurations of a scalar field coupled to the gauge field,the latter is by a confined flux tube in the bulk. It is shown that theconfined flux tube is really a source of the bulk B-field. Our model alsoprovides a natural scenario of the confinement on the brane in the context ofthe open string tachyon condensation. It is also argued that the fundamentalstring can be realized as a classical solution in a certain IIB matrix model asin our model.
