We investigated the evolution of a scalar field propagating in smallSchwarzschild Anti-de Sitter black holes. The imaginary part of the quasinormalfrequency decreases with the horizon size and the real part of the quasinormalfrequency keeps nearly as a constant. The object-picture clarified the questionon the quasinormal modes for small Anti-de Sitter black holes. Dependence ofquasinormal modes on spacetime dimensions and the multipole index for smallAnti-de Sitter black holes have also been illustrated.
