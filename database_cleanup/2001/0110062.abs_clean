The dS/CFT correspondence differs from its AdS/CFT counterpart in some ways,yet is strikingly similar to it in many others. For example, both involve CFTsdefined on connected spaces (despite the fact that the conformal boundary ofdeSitter space is not connected), and both impose constraints on scalar masses(Strominger's bound for deSitter, and the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound forAnti-deSitter). We argue that these similarities can be explored and exploitedusing a slight extension of the Euclidean approach to AdS/CFT. The methods areparticularly compatible with Hull's embedding of deSitter Space in a timelikeT-dual version of M-theory.
