We develop a formalism to carry out coarse-grainings in quantum fieldtheoretical systems by using a time-dependent projection operator in theHeisenberg picture. A systematic perturbative expansion with respect to theinteraction part of the Hamiltonian is given, and a Langevin-type equationwithout a time-convolution integral term is obtained. This method is applied toa quantum field theoretical model, and coupled transport equations are derived.
