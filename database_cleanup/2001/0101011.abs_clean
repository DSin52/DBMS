We construct and study a matrix model that describes two dimensional stringtheory in the Euclidean black hole background. A conjecture of V. Fateev, A.and Al. Zamolodchikov, relating the black hole background to condensation ofvortices (winding modes around Euclidean time) plays an important role in theconstruction. We use the matrix model to study quantum corrections to thethermodynamics of two dimensional black holes.
