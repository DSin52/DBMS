We calculate fusion rules for the admissible representations of the affinesuperalgebra sl(2|1;C) at fractional level k=-1/2 in the Ramond sector. Byrepresenting 3-point correlation functions involving a singular vector as theaction of differential operators on the sl(2|1;C) invariant 3-point function,we obtain conditions on permitted quantum numbers involved. We find that inthis case the primary fields close under fusion.
