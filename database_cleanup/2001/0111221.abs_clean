Title: An illustrated guide to D-branes in SU(3)

Authors: Sonia Stanciu

Comments: 33 pages (v2

We give a systematic account of symmetric D-branes in the Lie group SU(3). Wedetermine both the classical and quantum moduli space of (twisted) conjugacyclasses in terms of the (twisted) Stiefel diagram of the Lie group. We showthat the allowed (twisted) conjugacy classes are in one-to-one correspondencewith the integrable highest weight representations of the (twisted) affine Liealgebra. In particular, we show how the charges of these D-branes fit in thetwisted K-theory groups.
