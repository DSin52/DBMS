We analyse the Seiberg Witten curve describing the N=2 gauge theory dual tothe supergravity solution with fractional branes. Emphasis is given to thoseaspects that are related to stringy mechanism known as the enhancon. We alsocompare our results with the features of the supergravity duals, which havebeen variously interpreted in the literature. Known aspects of the N=2 gaugetheories seem to agree with the supergravity solution, whenever the twotheories can be faithfully compared.
