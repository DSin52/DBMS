Title: Effects of singular external fields and boundary condition on the vacuum

of massless fermions in QFTAuthors: Yu. A. Sitenko

Comments: 10 pages, LateX, to be published in Proceedings of the International

Conference "Quantization, Gauge Theory, and Strings" dedicated to the memoryof Professor Efim Fradkin (June 5-10, 2000, Moscow, Russia)Effects of the configuration of an external static magnetic field in the formof a singular vortex on the vacuum of a quantized massless spinor field arestudied. The most general boundary conditions at the punctured singular pointwhich make the twodimensional Dirac Hamiltonian to be self-adjoint areemployed.
