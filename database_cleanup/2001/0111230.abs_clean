We construct various boundary states in the coset conformal field theory G/H.The G/H theory admits the twisted boundary condition if the G theory has anouter automorphism of the horizontal subalgebra that induces an automorphism ofthe H theory. By introducing the notion of the brane identification and thebrane selection rule, we show that the twisted boundary states of the G/Htheory can be constructed from those of the G and the H theories. We apply ourconstruction to the su(n) diagonal cosets and the su(2)/u(1) parafermion theoryto obtain the twisted boundary states of these theories.
