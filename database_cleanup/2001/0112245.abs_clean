The character of the principal series of representations of SL(n,R) isevaluated by using Gel'fand and Naimark's definition of character. Thisrepresentation is realized in the space of functions defined on the right cosetspace of SL(n,R) with respect to the subgroup of real triangular matrices. Thisform of the representations considerably simplifies the problem ofdetermination of the integral kernel of the group ring which is fundamental inthe Gel'fand-Naimark theory of character. An important feature of the principalseries of representations is that the `elliptic' elements of SL(n,R) do notcontribute to its character.
