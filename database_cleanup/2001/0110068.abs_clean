Title: Forces from noncommutative geometry

Authors: T. Schucker

Comments: 15 p. LaTeX, talk at the annuel meeting of the French Physical

Society, Strasbourg, july 01Einstein derived general relativity from Riemannian geometry. Connes extendsthis derivation to noncommutative geometry and obtains electro-magnetic, weakand strong forces. These are pseudo forces, that accompany the gravitationalforce just as in Minkowskian geometry the magnetic force accompanies theelectric force. The main physical input of Connes' derivation is parityviolation. His main output is the Higgs boson which breaks the gauge symmetryspontaneously and gives masses to gauge and Higgs bosons.
