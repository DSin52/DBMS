We discuss the possibility of a smooth transition from the pre- to thepost-big bang regime, in the context of the lowest-order string effectiveaction (without higher-derivative corrections), taking into account with aphenomenological model of source the repulsive gravitational effects due to theback-reaction of the quantum fluctuations outside the horizon. We determine aset of necessary conditions for a successful and realistic transition, and wefind that such conditions can be satisfied (by an appropriate model of source),provided the background is higher-dimensional and anisotropic.
