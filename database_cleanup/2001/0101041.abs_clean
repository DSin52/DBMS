We consider a hybrid of nonlinear sigma models in which two complexprojective spaces are coupled with each other under a duality. We study thelarge N effective action in 1+1 dimensions. We find that some of thedynamically generated gauge bosons acquire radiatively induced masses which,however, vanish along the self-dual points where the two couplingscharacterizing each complex projective space coincide. These points correspondto the target space of the Grassmann manifold along which the gauge symmetry isenhanced, and the theory favors the non-Abelian ultraviolet fixed point.
