We investigate the large Nc limit of pure N=2 supersymmetric gauge theorywith gauge group SU(Nc) by using the exact low energy effective action. Typicalone-complex dimensional sections of the moduli space parametrized by a globalcomplex mass scale v display three qualitatively different regions depending onthe ratio between |v| and the dynamically generated scale Lambda. At large|v|/Lambda, instantons are exponentially suppressed as N goes to infinity. When|v| is of order Lambda, singularities due to massless dyons occur. They aredensely distributed in rings of calculable thicknesses in the v-plane. At small|v|/Lambda, instantons disintegrate into fractional instantons of charge1/(2N). These fractional instantons give non-trivial contributions to allorders of 1/N, unlike a planar diagrams expansion which generates a series in1/N^2, implying the presence of open strings. We have explicitly calculated thefractional instantons series in two representative examples, including the 1/Nand 1/N^2 corrections. Our most interesting finding is that the 1/N expansionbreaks down at singularities on the moduli space due to severe infrareddivergencies, a fact that has remarkable consequences.
