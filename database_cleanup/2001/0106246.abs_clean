Title: Duality in N=2 SUSY Gauge Theories

spectraComments: Lectures given at the Institut Henri Poincar\'e program ``Strings,

Supergravity and M-theory", Paris, January 2001, 47 pages, 6 eps figures,LatexAfter an introduction to N=2 susy Yang-Mills theories, I review in somedetail, for the SU(2) gauge group, how the low-energy effective action isobtained using duality and the constraints arising from the supersymmetry. ThenI discuss how knowledge of this action, duality and certain discrete symmetriesallow us to determine the spectra of stable BPS states at any point in modulispace. This is done for gauge group SU(2), without and with fundamental matterhypermultiplets which may have non-vanishing bare masses. In the latter casenon-trivial four-dimensional CFTs arise at Argyres-Douglas type points.
