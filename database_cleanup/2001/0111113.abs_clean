We study the open string extension of the mirror map for N=1 supersymmetrictype II vacua with D-branes on non-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds. Its definitionis given in terms of a system of differential equations that annihilate certainperiod and chain integrals. The solutions describe the flat coordinates on theN=1 parameter space, and the exact disc instanton corrected superpotential onthe D-brane world-volume. A gauged linear sigma model for the combinedopen-closed string system is also given. It allows to use methods of toricgeometry to describe D-brane phase transitions and the N=1 K\"ahler cone.Applications to a variety of D-brane geometries are described in some detail.
