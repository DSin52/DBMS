A recently proposed connection between closed string field and an open Wilsonline defined on an arbitrary contour is further explored here. We suggest thatreparametrization invariance of a Wilson line is the principle which determinesthe coupling of non-commutative gauge theory/matrix model to the modes of theclosed string. An analogue of the level matching condition on the gaugetheory/matrix model operators emerges quite naturally from the cyclic symmetryof the straight Wilson line. We show that the generating functional ofcorrelation functions of these operators has the space-time gauge symmetry thatone expects to find in closed string field theory. We also identify an infinitenumber of conserved operators in gauge theory/matrix model, the first of whichis known to be the conserved stress tensor.
