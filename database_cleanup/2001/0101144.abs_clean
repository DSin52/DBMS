the IXth Marcel Grossmann Meeting (Rome, July 2000)I review the relationship between AdS/CFT (anti-de Sitter / conformal fieldtheory) dualities and the general theory of unitary lowest weight (ULWR)(positive energy) representations of non-compact space-time groups andsupergroups. The ULWR's have the remarkable property that they can beconstructed by tensoring some fundamental ULWR's (singletons or doubletons).Furthermore, one can go from the manifestly unitary compact basis of the ULWR'sof the conformal group (Wigner picture) to the manifestly covariant coherentstate basis (Dirac picture) labelled by the space-time coordinates. Hence everyirreducible ULWR corresponds to a covariant field with a definite conformaldimension. These results extend to higher dimensional generalized spacetimes(superspaces) defined by Jordan (super) algebras and Jordan (super) triplesystems. In particular, they extend to the ULWR's of the M-theory symmetrysuperalgebra OSp(1/32,R).
