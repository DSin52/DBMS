Authors: Ruth Durrer

Comments: 3 pages, no figures Some typo's and a conceptial mistake corrected.

Conclusions unalteredIn this note I try to clarify the problem of perturbations in the ekpyroticuniverse. I write down the most general matching conditions and specify thechoices taken by the two debating sides. I also bring up the problem of surfacestresses which always have to be present when a transition from a collapsing toan expanding phase is made.
