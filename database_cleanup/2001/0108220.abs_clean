We examine heterotic M-theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold with anadditional parallel M5 brane. The dominant non-perturbative effect stems fromopen membrane instantons connecting the M5 with the boundaries. We derive thefour-dimensional low-energy supergravity potential for this situation includingsubleading contributions as it turns out that the leading term vanishes afterminimisation. At the minimum of the potential the M5 gets stabilised at themiddle of the orbifold interval while the vacuum energy is shown to bemanifestly positive. Moreover, induced by the non-trivial running of theCalabi-Yau volume along the orbifold which is driven by the G-fluxes, we findthat the orbifold-length and the Calabi-Yau volume modulus are stabilised atvalues which are related by the G-flux of the visible boundary. Finally wedetermine the supersymmetry-breaking scale and the gravitino mass for this openmembrane vacuum.
