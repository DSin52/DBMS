The (m^2,\Lambda) plane of spin s>1 massive fields in (A)dS backgrounds isshown to consist of separate phases, divided by lines of novel ``partiallymassless'' gauge theories that successively remove helicities, starting fromthe lowest, 0 or +/-(1/2). The norms of the excluded states flip as the gaugelines are crossed and only the region containing the massive Minkowski theoryis unitary. The partially massless gauge theories are unitary or not, dependingon the ordering of the gauge lines. This ``level splitting'' of masslessMinkowski gauge theories is specific to non-zero \Lambda.
