We construct a generalized BF theory in superspace that can embedeleven-dimensional supergravity theory. Our topological BF theory canaccommodate all the necessary Bianchi identities for teleparallel superspacesupergravity in eleven-dimensions, as the simplest but nontrivial solutions tosuperfield equations for our superspace action. This indicates that our theorymay have solutions other than eleven-dimensional supergravity, accommodatinggeneralized theories of eleven-dimensional supergravity. Therefore ourtopological theory can be a good candidate for the low energy limit ofM-theory, as an underlying fundamental theory providing a `missing link'between eleven-dimensional supergravity and M-theory.
