In this paper we make an SL(2,Z)-covariant generalisation of thenoncommutative theories, NCYM and NCOS on the D3-brane, and NCOS on theD5-brane in type IIB. Usually, the noncommutative theories are obtained bystudying perturbative F-string theory, and the parameters governing thenoncommutative theories are given by the open string data. The S-duality ofNCYM and NCOS on the D3-brane has been seen by dualising the background,keeping the F-string under study fixed. We give an SL(2,Z)-covariantgeneralisation of the open string data relevant when one instead studiesperturbative (p,q)-string theory. The S-duality of NCYM and NCOS on theD3-brane is reproduced by instead keeping the background fixed and studyingdifferent (p,q)-string theories. We also obtain new noncommutative open(p,q)-string theories on the D3-brane and the D5-brane which are S-dual toordinary NCOS. The theories are studied using the supergravity duals of theD3-brane and the D5-brane, corresponding to a probe brane in the relevantbackground.
