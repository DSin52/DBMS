We have investigated the effects of a generic bulk first-order phasetransition on thick Minkowski branes in warped geometries. As occurs inEuclidean space, when the system is brought near the phase transition aninterface separating two ordered phases splits into two interfaces with adisordered phase in between. A remarkable and distinctive feature is that thecritical temperature of the phase transition is lowered due to pure geometricaleffects. We have studied a variety of critical exponents and the evolution ofthe transverse-traceless sector of the metric fluctuations.
