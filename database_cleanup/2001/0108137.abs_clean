We study N=1 four dimensional quiver theories arising on the worldvolume ofD3-branes at del Pezzo singularities of Calabi-Yau threefolds. We argue thatunder local mirror symmetry D3-branes become D6-branes wrapped on a three torusin the mirror manifold. The type IIB (p,q) 5-brane web description of the localdel Pezzo, being closely related to the geometry of its mirror manifold,encodes the geometry of 3-cycles and is used to obtain gauge groups, quiverdiagrams and the charges of the fractional branes.
