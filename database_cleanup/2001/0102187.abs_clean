Title: Anisotropic Born-Infeld Cosmologies

Comments: 6 pages, LATEX

Anisotropic cosmological spacetimes are constructed from sphericallysymmetric solutions to Einstein's equations coupled to nonlinearelectrodynamics and a positive cosmological constant. This is accomplished byfinding solutions in which the roles of $r$ and $t$ are interchanged for all$r>0$ (i.e. $r$ becomes timelike and $t$ becomes spacelike). Constant timehypersurfaces have topology $R\times S^2$ and in all the spacetimes consideredthe radius of the two sphere vanishes as $t$ goes to zero. The scale factor ofthe other dimension diverges as $t$ goes to zero in some solutions and vanishes(or goes to a constant) in other solutions. At late times local observers wouldsee the universe to be homogeneous and isotropic.
