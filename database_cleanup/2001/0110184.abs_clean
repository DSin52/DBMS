The possibility of having discrete degrees of freedom at singularitiesassociated to `conifolds with discrete torsion' is studied. We find that thefield theory of D-brane probes near these singularities is identical toordinary conifolds, so that there are no additional discrete degrees of freedomlocated at the singularity. We shed light on how the obstructions to resolvingthe singularity are global topological issues rather that local obstrucions atthe singularity itself. We also analyze the geometric transitions and dualitycascades when one has fractional branes at the singularity and compute themoduli space of an arbitrary number of probes in the geometry. We provide someevidence for a conjecture that there are no discrete degrees of freedomlocalized at any Calabi-Yau singularity that can not be guessed fromtopological data away from the singularity.
