We consider five dimensional non-factorizable geometries where the transversedimension is bounded and the remaining (parallel) dimensions are not. We studythe construction of effective theories at distances much longer than thetransverse size. An observer unable to resolve the transverse direction canonly measure distances along the parallel dimensions, but the non-factorizablegeometry makes the length of a curve along the parallel dimension sensitive towhere on the transverse direction the curve lies. We show that long geodesicsthat differ in their endpoints only by shifts along the transverse directionall have the same length to within the observer's resolution. We argue thatthis is the correct notion of distance in the effective theory for a bulkobserver. This allows us to present a consistent interpretation of what ismeasured by observers that live either on a brane or in the bulk.
