The covariant form of the non-Abelian gauge anomaly on noncommutative R2n iscomputed for U(N) groups. Its origin and properties are analyzed. Itsconnection with the consistent form of the gauge anomaly is established. Weshow along the way that bi-fundamental $U(N)\times U(M)$ chiral matter carriesno mixed anomalies, and interpret this result as a consequence of thehalf-dipole structure which characterizes the charged non-commutative degreesof freedom.
