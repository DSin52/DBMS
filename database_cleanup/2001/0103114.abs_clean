The boundary chiral ring of a 2d gauged linear sigma model on a K\"ahlermanifold $X$ classifies the topological D-brane sectors and the massless openstrings between them. While it is determined at small volume by simple grouptheory, its continuation to generic volume provides highly non-trivialinformation about the $D$-branes on $X$, related to the derived category$D^\flat(X)$. We use this correspondence to elaborate on an extended notion ofMcKay correspondence that captures more general than orbifold singularities. Asan illustration, we work out this new notion of McKay correspondence for aclass of non-compact Calabi-Yau singularities related to Grassmannians.
