We perform the Batalin-Vilkovisky analysis of gauge-fixing for gradedChern-Simons theories. Upon constructing an appropriate gauge-fixing fermion,we implement a Landau-type constraint, finding a simple form of the gauge-fixedaction. This allows us to extract the associated Feynman rules taking intoaccount the role of ghosts and antighosts. Our gauge-fixing procedure allowsfor zero-modes, hence is not limited to the acyclic case. We also discuss thesemiclassical approximation and the effective potential for massless modes,thereby justifying some of our previous constructions in the Batalin-Vilkoviskyapproach.
