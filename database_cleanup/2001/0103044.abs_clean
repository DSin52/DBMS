We study the properties of {\bf exact} (all level $k$) quantum coherentstates in the context of string theory on a group manifold (WZWN models).positive norm, they consistently describe the very massive string states(otherwise excluded by the spin-level condition). These states can bethe creation operator on the ground state, and (ii) as eigenstates of theannhilation operator. In the $k\to\infty$ limit, all the known properties ofordinary coherent states are recovered. States (i) and (ii) (which areequivalent in the context of ordinary quantum mechanics and string theory inflat spacetime) are not equivalent in the context of WZWN models. The set (i)was constructed by these authors in a previous article. In this paper weprovide the construction of states (ii), we compare the two sets and discusstheir properties. We analyze the uncertainty relation, and show that states(ii) satisfy automatically the {\it minimal uncertainty} condition for any $k$;they are thus {\it quasiclassical}, in some sense more classical than states(i) which only satisfy it in the $k\to\infty$ limit. Modification to theHeisenberg relation is given by $2 {\cal H}/k$, where ${\cal H}$ is connectedto the string energy.
