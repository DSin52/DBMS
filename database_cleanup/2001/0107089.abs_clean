A review of computations of free energy for Gibbs states on stationary butnot static gravitational and gauge backgrounds is given. On these backgroundswave equations for free fields are reduced to eigen-value problems which dependnon-linearly on the spectral parameter. We present a method to deal with suchproblems. In particular, we demonstrate how some results of the spectral theoryof second order elliptic operators, such as heat kernel asymptotics, can beextended to a class of non-linear spectral problems. The method is used totrace down the relation between the canonical definition of the free energybased on summation over the modes and the covariant definition given inEuclidean quantum gravity. As an application, high-temperature asymptotics ofthe free energy and of the thermal part of the stress-energy tensor in thepresence of rotation are derived. We also discuss statistical mechanics in thepresence of Killing horizons where canonical and Euclidean theories are relatedin a non-trivial way.
