We apply to the XYZ model the technique of construction of integrable modelswith staggered parameters, presented recently for the XXZ case. The solution ofmodified Yang-Baxter equations is found and the corresponding integrablezig-zag ladder Hamiltonian is calculated. The result is coinciding with the XXZcase in the appropriate limit.
