We investigate the most general non(anti)commutative geometry in N=1 fourdimensional superspace. We find that a nontrivial non(anti)commutativesuperspace geometry compatible with supertranslations exists withnon(anti)commutation parameters which may depend on the spinorial coordinates.The algebra is in general nonassociative. Imposing associativity introducesadditional constraints which however allow for nontrivial commutation relationsinvolving fermionic coordinates. We define an associative *-product byextending to superspace the Kontsevich procedure. In a string theory contest wediscuss the connection between non(anti)commutative grassmannian geometry insuperspace and string propagation in curved backgrounds. Finally, N=2 euclideansuperspace is also discussed.
