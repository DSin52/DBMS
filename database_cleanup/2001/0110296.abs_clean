The Standard Model plus gravitation is produced from the Kaluza-Klein theoryof pure gravity in six dimensions with fields depending on theta and phi, twocompactified coordinates. The theory is called KK(theta, phi). When KK(theta,phi) is quantized, the Planck masses of the massive Fourier modes, representingthe dependence upon theta and phi, are quantum corrected downward toelemmentary particle masses, rendering them observable. KK(theta, phi) explainsthe origins of the elementary particles, Maxwell's equations, the Diracequation, the weak interactions and the strong interactions. Quark confinement,asymptotic freedom and chiral symmetry breaking are acheived. Ten parametersunexplained in the Standard Model are produced from KK(theta, phi). Superweakvectors with precisely determined masses are predicted. Testable predictionsthat new leptons exist are made. In KK(theta, phi), the cosmological constantvanishes naturally. KK(theta, phi) is trivially anomaly-free. The relationshipbetween quantum mechanics and general relativity is demonstrated.
