We propose a modification of special relativity in which a physical energy,which may be the Planck energy, joins the speed of light as an invariant, inspite of a complete relativity of inertial frames and agreement with Einstein'stheory at low energies. This is accomplished by a non-linear modification ofthe action of the Lorentz group on momentum space, generated by adding adilatation to each boost in such a way that the Planck energy remainsinvariant. The associated algebra has unmodified structure constants, and wehighlight the similarities between the group action found and a transformationpreviously proposed by Fock. We also discuss the resulting modifications offield theory and suggest a modification of the equivalence principle whichdetermines how the new theory is embedded in general relativity.
