Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda

Comments: 20 pages, Latex, some more discussions and new references added

The fundamental action of superon-graviton model(SGM) of Einstein-Hilberttype for space-time and matter is written down explicitly in terms of thefields of the graviton and superons by using the affine connection formalismand the spin connection formalism. Some characteristic structures includingsome hidden symmetries of the gravitational coupling of superons are manifested(in two dimensional space-time) with some details of the calculations. SGMcosmology is discussed briefly.
