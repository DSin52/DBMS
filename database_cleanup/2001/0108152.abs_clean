We discuss the discrete Z_k D-brane charges (twisted K-theory charges) infive-brane backgrounds from several different points of view. In particular, weinterpret it as a result of a standard Higgs mechanism. We show that certaindegrees of freedom (singletons) on the boundary of space can extend thecorresponding Z_k symmetry to U(1). Related ideas clarify the role of AdSsingletons in the AdS/CFT correspondence.
