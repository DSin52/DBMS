In any low energy effective supergravity theory general formulae exist whichallow one to discuss fermion masses, the scalar potential and breaking ofsymmetries in a model independent set up. A particular role in this discussionis played by Killing vectors and Killing prepotentials. We outline theserelations in general and specify then in the context of N=1 and N=2supergravities in four dimensions. Useful relations of gauged quaternionicgeometry underlying hypermultiplets dynamics are discussed.
