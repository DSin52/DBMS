The gauge invariance of cubic open superstring field theory is considered ina framework of level truncation, and applications to the tachyon condensationproblem are discussed. As it is known, in the bosonic case the Feynman-Siegelgauge is not universal within the level truncation method. We explore anothergauge that is more suitable for calculation of the tachyon potential forfermionic string at level (2,6). We show that this new gauge has norestrictions on the region of its validity at least at this level.
