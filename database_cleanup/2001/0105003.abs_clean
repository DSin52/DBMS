Tino, (AmericanInstitute of Physics, NY, 2000) p. 162The recent discoveries of new forms of quantum statistics require a closelook at the under-lying Fock space structure. This exercise becomes all themore important in order to provide a general classification scheme for variousforms of statistics, and establish interconnections among them whenever it ispossible. We formulate a theory of generalized Fock spaces, which has a threetired structure consisting of Fock space, statistics and algebra. This generalformalism unifies various forms of statistics and algebras, which were earlierconsidered to describe different systems. Besides, the formalism allows us toconstruct many new kinds of quantum statistics and the associated algebras ofstatistics or statistics of frozen order, quantum group based statistics andits many avatars, and `doubly-infinite' statistics. The emergence of new formsof quantum statistics for particles interacting with singular potential is alsohighlighted.
