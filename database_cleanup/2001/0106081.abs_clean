Curved, intersecting brane configurations satisfying the type IIAsupergravity equations of motion are found. In eleven dimensions, the modelsare interpreted in terms of orthogonally intersecting M5--branes, where theworld--volumes are curved due to the effects of one or more massless scalarfields. Duality symmetries are employed to generate further type II andheterotic solutions. Some cosmological implications are discussed.
