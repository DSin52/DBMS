We consider the brane-world in the holographic point of view. Bearing therealistic models in mind, the bulk massless scalar field is introduced. Firstof all, we find the constraint on the coupling of the scalar fields with thematter(not holographic CFT) on the brane. We show that the traceless part ofthe energy-momentum tensor of holographic CFT is a part of the bulk Weyltensor. The trace part which comes from the trace-anomaly is corresponding tothe $\rho^2$-term appeared in the generalized FRW equation in the brane-world.
