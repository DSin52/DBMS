University of North Carolina at Chapel HillWe discuss brane world sum rules for compactifications involving an arbitrarynumber of spacetime dimensions. One of the most striking results derived fromsuch consistency conditions is the necessity for negative tension branes toappear in five-dimensional scenarios. We show how this result can be evaded forbrane world models with more than five dimensions. As an example, we consider anovel realization of the Randall-Sundrum scenario in six dimensions involvingonly positive tension branes. A complete account of our results appeared inhep-th/0106140.
