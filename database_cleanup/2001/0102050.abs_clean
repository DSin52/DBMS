One of the simplest example of non-commutative (NC) spaces is the NC plane.In this article we investigate the consequences of the non-commutativity to thequantum mechanics on a plane. We derive corrections to the standard(commutative) Hamiltonian spectrum for hydrogen-like atom and isotropic linearharmonic oscillator (LHO) and formulate the problem of the potential scatteringon the NC plane. In the case of LHO we consider the noncommutativity of themomentum operators, too.
