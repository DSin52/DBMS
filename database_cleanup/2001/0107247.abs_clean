We derive a constraint (string equation) which together with the Toda Latticehierarchy determines completely the integrable structure of the compactified 2Dstring theory. The form of the constraint depends on a continuous parameter,the compactification radius R. We show how to use the string equation tocalculate the free energy and the correlation functions in the dispersionlesslimit. We sketch the phase diagram and the flow structure and point out thatthere are two UV critical points, one of which (the sine-Liouville stringtheory) describes infinitely strong vortex or tachyon perturbation.
