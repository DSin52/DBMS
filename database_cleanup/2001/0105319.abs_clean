In this short note we would like to discuss general solutions of theBerkovits superstring field theory, in particular the string field action forfluctuation around such a solution. We will find that fluctuations obey thesame equation of motion as the original field with the new BRST operator. Thenwe will argue that the superstring field theory action for fluctuation fieldhas the same form as the original one.
