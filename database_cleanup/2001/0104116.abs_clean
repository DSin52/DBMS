One discusses the issue of low-energy electron-electron bound states in theMaxwell-Chern-Simons model coupled to QED3 with spontaneous breaking of a localU(1)-symmetry. The scattering potential, in the non-relativistic limit,steaming from the electron-electron Moller scattering, mediated by theMaxwell-Chern-Simons-Proca gauge field and the Higgs scalar, might beattractive by fine-tuning properly the physical parameters of the model.
