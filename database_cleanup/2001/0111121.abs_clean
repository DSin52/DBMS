A new configuration of non-abelian D1-branes growing into D5-branes is found.This time the effect is triggered by a non-trivial electric field on theworld-volume of the D1-branes and a constant RR 4-form potential. Based on thethese configurations and other observations regarding non-abilean effectiveactions, a new action for matrix string theory in non-trivial backgrounds isconjectured. As an application we found that fundamental strings can grow intoDp-branes, in particular by placing the strings in the background of a group ofnear horizon D3-branes we found D5-branes. These types of configurations werefound from the supergravity point of view in previous works.
