We consider exact solutions of Einstein equations defining static black holesparametrized by off-diagonal metrics which by anholonomic mappings can beequivalently transformed into some diagonal metrics with coefficients beingvery similar to those from the Schwarzschild and/or Reissner-N\"ordstromsolutions with anisotropic renormalizations of constants. We emphasize thatsuch classes of solutions, for instance, with ellipsoidal symmetry of horizons,can be constructed even in general relativity theory if off-diagonal metricsand anholonomic frames are introduced into considerations. Such solutions donot violate the Israel's uniqueness theorems on static black holeconfigurations because at long radial distances one holds the usualSchwarzschild limit. We show that anisotropic deformations of theReissner-N\"ordstrom metric can be an exact solution on the brane,re-interpreted as a black hole with an effective electromagnetic like chargeanisotropically induced and polarized by higher dimension gravitationalinteractions.
