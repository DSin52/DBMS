The character of quantum corrections to the gravitational action of aconformally invariant field theory for a self-interacting scalar field on amanifold with boundary is considered at third loop-order in the perturbativeexpansion of the zero-point function. Diagramatic evaluations and higherloop-order renormalisation can be best accomplished on a Riemannian manifold ofconstant curvature accommodating a boundary of constant extrinsic curvature.The associated spherical formulation for diagramatic evaluations reveals anon-trivial effect which the topology of the manifold has on the vacuumprocesses and which ultimately dissociates the dynamical behaviour of thequantised field from its behaviour in the absence of a boundary. The firstsurface divergence is evaluated and the necessity for simultaneousrenormalisation of volume and surface divergences is shown.
