Title: Noncommutativity of Boundary Closed String Coordinates for an Open

Membrane on p-BraneAuthors: Ashok Das, J.Maharana, A. Melikyan

Comments: 5 pages, Proceedings of the International Europhysics Conference on

High Energy Physics, Budapest, 12-18 July 2001We study the dynamics of an open membrane with a cylindrical topology, in thebackground of a constant three form. We use the action, due to Bergshoeff,London and Townsend, to study the noncommutativity properties of the boundarystring coordinates. The constrained Hamiltonian formalism due to Dirac is usedto derive the noncommutativity of coordinates. The chain of constraints isfound to be finite for a suitable gauge choice.
