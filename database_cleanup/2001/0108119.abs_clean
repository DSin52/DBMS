We consider the quantization of the massless minimally coupled scalar fieldin de Sitter spacetime. The no-boundary Euclidean prescription naturally picksout the de Sitter invariant vacuum state of Kirsten and Garriga. We extendStrominger's dS/CFT correspondence to this case which allows us to interpretthe massless field in terms of a Euclidean CFT. The extension is non-trivialand requires careful treatment of the zero mode. Since the graviton ismassless, this work may also be considered a step towards a theory of gravityin de Sitter space.
