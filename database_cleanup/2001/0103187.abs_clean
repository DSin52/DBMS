We investigate the AdS/CFT correspondence for higher-derivative gravitysystems, and develop a formalism in which the generating functional of theboundary field theory is given as a functional that depends only on theboundary values of bulk fields. We also derive a Hamilton-Jacobi-like equationthat uniquely determines the generating functional, and give an algorithmcalculating the Weyl anomaly. Using the expected duality between ahigher-derivative gravity system and N=2 superconformal field theory in fourdimensions, we demonstrate that the resulting Weyl anomaly is consistent withthe field theoretic one.
