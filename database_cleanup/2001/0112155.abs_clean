Possible ways of generalization of the superembedding approach for thesupersurfaces with the number of Grassmann directions being less than the halfof that for the target superspace are considered on example of Type IIsuperstrings. Focus is on n=(1,1) superworldsheet embedded into D=10 Type IIsuperspace that is of the interest for establishing a relation with the NSRstring.
