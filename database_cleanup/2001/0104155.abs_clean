We construct the so far unknown Lagrangian of D=6, N=2 F(4) Supergravitycoupled to an arbitrary number of vector multiplets whose scalars span thecoset manifold SO(4,n)/{SO(4) x SO(n)}.This is done first in the ungauged case and then extended to the compactgauging of SU(2) x G, where SU(2) is the R-symmetry diagonal subgroup ofSU(2)_L x SU(2)_R = SO(4) and G is a compact subgroup of SO(n), n being thenumber of vector multiplets, and such that dim G = n.The knowledge of the Lagrangian allows in principle to refine the AdS_6/CFT_5correspondence already discussed, as far as supersymmetric multiplets areconcerned, in a previous related paper. With respect to the latter we also givea more exaustive treatment of the construction of the theory at the level ofsuperspace Bianchi identities and in particular of the scalar potential.
