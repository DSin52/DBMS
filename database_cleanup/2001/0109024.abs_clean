We consider brane cosmology studying the shortest null path on the brane forphotons, and in the bulk for gravitons. We derive the differential equation forthe shortest path in the bulk for a 1+4 cosmological metric. The time cost andthe redshifts for photons and gravitons after traveling their respective pathare compared. We consider some numerical solutions of the shortest pathequation, and show that there is no shortest path in the bulk for theRandall-Sundrum vacuum brane solution, the linear cosmological solution ofBin\'etruy, et al for $\omega = -1, -{2/3}$, and for some expanding braneuniverses.
