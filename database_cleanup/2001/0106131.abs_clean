The localization of metric fluctuations on scalar brane configurationsbreaking spontaneously five-dimensional Poincar\'e invariance is discussed.Assuming that the four-dimensional Planck mass is finite and that the geometryis regular, it is demonstrated that the vector and scalar fluctuations of themetric are not localized on the brane.
