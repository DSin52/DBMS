Within the framework of the q-deformed Heisenberg algebra a dynamicalequation of q-deformed quantum mechanics is discussed. The perturbative aspectsof the q-deformed Schr\"odinger equation are analyzed. General representationsof the additional momentum-dependent interaction originating from theq-deformed effects are presented in two approaches. As examples, suchadditional interactions related to the harmonic-oscillator potential and theMorse potential are demonstrated.
