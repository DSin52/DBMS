We present the maximally supersymmetric three-dimensional gaugedsupergravities. Owing to the special properties of three dimensions --especially the on-shell duality between vector and scalar fields, and thepurely topological character of (super)gravity -- they exhibit an even richerstructure than the gauged supergravities in higher dimensions. The allowedgauge groups are subgroups of the global E_8 symmetry of ungauged N=16supergravity. They include the regular series SO(p,8-p) x SO(p,8-p) for allp=0,1,...,4, the group E_8 itself, as well as various noncompact forms of theexceptional groups E_7, E_6 and F_4 x G_2. We show that all these theoriesadmit maximally supersymmetric ground states, and determine their backgroundisometries, which are superextensions of the anti-de Sitter group SO(2,2). Thevery existence of these theories is argued to point to a new supergravitybeyond the standard D=11 supergravity.
