Recently, it has been proposed that the dimension of the Hilbert space ofquantum gravity in deSitter space is finite and moreover it is expressed interms of the coupling constants by using the entropy formula. A weakerconjecture would be that the coupling constant in deSitter space should takeonly discrete values not necessarily given by the entropy formula. We discussquantization of the horizon in deSitter space by using Berezin's functorialquantization of Kahler manifolds and argue that the weak conjecture is validfor Euclidean deSitter space. Moreover it can be valid for a class of boundedcomplex symmetric spaces.
