Title: Deformation Quantization and Quantum Field Theory on Curved Spaces

Case of Two-SphereAuthors: Chengang Zhou

Comments: 23 pages

We study the scalar quantum field theory on a generic noncommutativetwo-sphere as a special case of noncommutative curved space, which is describedby the deformation quantization algebra obtained from symplectic reduction andparametrized by $H^2(S^2, \QR)$. The fuzzy sphere is included as a special caseparametrized by the integer two-cohomology class $H^2(S^2, \QZ)$, which hasfinite number of degrees of freedom and the field theory has a well definedHilbert space. When the two-cohomology class is not integer valued, the scalarsignature of the inner product on the space of functions is indefinite. Hencethe existence of deformation quantization does not guarantee a physicallyacceptable deformed geometric background. For the deformation quantization on ageneral curved space, this obstruction of unitarity can be given by an explicittopological formula.
