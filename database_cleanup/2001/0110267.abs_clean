We analyze unoriented Wess-Zumino-Witten models from a geometrical point ofview. We show that the geometric interpretation of simple current crosscapstates is as centre orientifold planes localized on conjugacy classes of thegroup manifold. We determine the locations and dimensions of these planes forarbitrary simply-connected groups and orbifolds thereof. The dimensions of theO-planes turn out to be given by the dimensions of symmetric coset manifoldsbased on regular embeddings. Furthermore, we give a geometrical interpretationof boundary conjugation in open unoriented WZW models; it yields D-branestogether with their images under the orientifold projection. To find theagreement between O-planes and crosscap states, we find explicit answers forlattice extensions of Gaussian sums. These results allow us to express themodular P-matrix, which is directly related to the crosscap coefficient, interms of characters of the horizontal subgroup of the affine Lie algebra. Acorollary of this relation is that there exists a formal linear relationbetween the modular P- and the modular S-matrix.
