We examine Dashen's phenomenon in the Leutwyler--Smilga regime of QCD withany number of colors and quarks in either the fundamental or adjointrepresentations of the gauge group. In this limit, the theories only depend onsimple combinations of quark masses, volume, chiral condensate and vacuumangle. Based upon this observation, we derive simple expressions for the chiralcondensate and the topological density and show that they are in fact related.By examining the zeros of the various partition functions, we elucidate themechanism leading to Dashen's phenomena in QCD.
