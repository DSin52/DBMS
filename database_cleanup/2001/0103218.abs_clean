MechanicsThe physical meaning, the properties and the consequences of a discretescalar field are discussed; limits for the validity of a mathematicaldescription of fundamental physics in terms of continuous fields are a naturaloutcome of discrete fields with discrete interactions. The discrete scalarfield is ultimately the gravitational field of general relativity, necessarily,and there is no place for any other fundamental scalar field, in this context.Part of the paper comprehends a more generic discussion about the nature, ifcontinuous or discrete, of fundamental interactions. There is a critical pointdefined by the equivalence between the two descriptions. Discrepancies betweenthem can be observed far away from this point as a continuous-interaction isalways stronger below it and weaker above it than a discrete one. It ispossible that some discrete-field manifestations have already been observed inthe flat rotation curves of galaxies and in the apparent anomalous accelerationof the Pioneer spacecrafts. The existence of a critical point is equivalent tothe introduction of an effective-acceleration scale which may put Milgrom'sMOND on a more solid physical basis. Contact is also made, on passing, withinflation in cosmological theories and with Tsallis generalized one-parameterstatistics which is regarded as proper for discrete-interaction systems. Thevalidity of Botzmann statistics is then reduced to idealized asymptotic stateswhich, rigorously, are reachable only after an infinite number of internalinteractions . Tsallis parameter is then a measure of how close a system isfrom its idealized asymptotic state.
