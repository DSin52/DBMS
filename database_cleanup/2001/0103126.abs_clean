Following Marleau, we study an extended version of the Skyrme model to whicha sixth order term has been added to the Lagrangian and we analyse some of itsclassical properties. We compute the multi-Skyrmion solutions numerically forup to B=5 and show that they have the same symmetries as the usual Skyrmionsolutions. We use the rational map ansatz introduced by Houghton et al. toevaluate the energy and the radius for multi-skyrmion solutions of up to B=6for both the SU(2) and SU(3) models and compare these results to the onesobtained numerically. We show that the rational map ansatz works as well forthe generalised model as for the pure Skyrme model.
