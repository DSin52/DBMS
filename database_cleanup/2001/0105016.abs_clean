A massive version of T-duality in six dimensions is given, that maps the K3compactification of Romans' theory onto the K3 compactification of Type IIBtheory. This is done by performing a (standard) Kaluza-Klein reduction onsix-dimensional massive Type IIA and a Scherk-Schwarz reduction on Type IIB,mapping both theories onto the same five-dimensional theory. We also commentshortly on the difficulties arising if one intends to construct a massivegeneralisation of the six-dimensional string-string duality.
