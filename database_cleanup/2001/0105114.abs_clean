The O(3) non-linear sigma model is investigated using multi Hamilton-Jacobiformalism. The integrability conditions are investigated and the results are inagreement with those obtained by Dirac's method. By choosing an adequateextension of phase space we describe the transformed system by a set of threeHamilton-Jacobi equations and calculate the corresponding action.
