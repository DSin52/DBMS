A modification of perturbation theory, known as delta-expansion(variationally improved perturbation), gave rigorously convergent series insome D=1 models (oscillator energy levels) with factorially divergent ordinaryperturbative expansions. In a generalization of variationally improvedperturbation appropriate to renormalizable asymptotically free theories, weshow that the large expansion orders of certain physical quantities aresimilarly improved, and prove the Borel convergence of the corresponding seriesfor $m_v \lsim 0$, with $m_v$ the new (arbitrary) mass perturbation parameter.We argue that non-ambiguous estimates of quantities relevant to dynamical(chiral) symmetry breaking in QCD, are possible in this resummation framework.
