We derive the partition function of {\cal N}=4 supersymmetric Yang-Millstheory on orbifold-T^4/{\bf Z}_2 for gauge group SU(N). We generalize themethod of our previous work for the SU(2) case to the SU(N) case. The resultingpartition function is represented as the sum of the product of G\"ottcheformula of singular quotient space $T^4/{\bf Z}_2 $ and of blow-up formulasincluding A_{N-1} theta series with level N.
