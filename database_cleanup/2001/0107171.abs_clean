Authors: J.S.Dowker

Comments: Talk presented at the International Meeting on ``Quantum Gravity and

Spectral Geometry'', Naples July 2-7, 2001. 4 pages, LaTeX1.An expression for the smoothed counting function in terms of the fractionalderivatives of the delta-function is presented. 2. The Neumann-Dirichlet (ND)boundary problem is introduced via some elementary examples based on afunctorial relation between the ND, DD, NN and periodic boundary conditions.
