Title: Notes about equivalence between Sine-Gordon theory (free fermion point)

and the free fermion theoryAuthors: S.V.Kryukov

Comments: 7 pages, 3 figures

The space of local integrals of motion for the Sine-Gordon theory (the freefermion point) and the theory of free fermions in the light cone coordinates isinvestigated. Some important differences between the spaces of local integralsof motion of these theories are obtained. The equivalence is broken on thelevel of the integrals of motion between bosonic and fermionic theories (in thefree fermion point). The integrals of motion are constracted without QuantumInverse Scattering Method (QISM)and the additional quantum integrals of motionare obtaned. So the QISM is not absolutely complete.
