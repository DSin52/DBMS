We describe how the D-brane spectra of the various ten-dimensional stringtheories can be related to general properties of the open-closed duality,encoded in the $S$ and $P$ matrices of the conformal field theory. We alsocomplete the classification and the description of non-BPS branes in thesestring theories, elucidating their non-Abelian structures and the nature of thecorresponding super-Higgs mechanisms. We find that the type 0 theories andtheir orientifolds have two types of uncharged branes, distinguished by theircouplings to the closed string tachyon. We also find that the 0A orientifoldhas the unusual feature of having charged and uncharged branes with identicalworld-volume dimensions. We conclude with some comments on fractional branes,elucidating their role in connection with the boundary states of $D_{odd}$SU(2) WZW models.
