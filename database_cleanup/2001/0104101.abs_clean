The stability analysis of an anisotropic inflationary universe of the fourdimensional Neveu-Schwarz--Neveu-Schwarz string model with a nonvanishingcosmological constant is discussed in this paper. The accelerating expansionsolution found earlier is shown to be stable against the perturbations withrespect to the dilaton and axion fields once the dilaton field falls close tothe local minimum of the symmetry-breaking potential. This indicates that theBianchi I space tends to evolve to an isotropic flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walkerspace. This expanding solution is also shown to be stable against theperturbation with respect to anisotropic spatial directions.
