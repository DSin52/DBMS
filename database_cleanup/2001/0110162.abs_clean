Large extra dimensions provide interesting extensions of our parameter spacefor gravitational theories. There exist now brane models which can perfectlyreproduce standard four-dimensional Friedmann cosmology. These models are notmotivated by observations, but they can be helpful in developing new approachesto the dimensionality problem in string theory.I describe the embedding of standard Friedmann cosmology in the DGP model,and in particular the realization of our current (dust+Lambda)-dominateduniverse in this model.
