We present a general method of deriving the effective action for conformalanomalies in any even dimension, which satisfies the Wess-Zumino consistencycondition by construction. The method relies on defining the coboundaryoperator of the local Weyl group, and giving a cohomological interpretation tocounterterms in the effective action in dimensional regularization with respectto this group. Non-trivial cocycles of the Weyl group arise from localfunctionals that are Weyl invariant in and only in the physical even integerdimension. In the physical dimension the non-trivial cocycles generatecovariant non-local action functionals characterized by sensitivity to globalWeyl rescalings. The non-local action so obtained is unique up to the additionof trivial cocycles and Weyl invariant terms, both of which are insensitive toglobal Weyl rescalings. These distinct behaviors under rigid dilations can beused to distinguish between infrared relevant and irrelevant operators in agenerally covariant manner. Variation of the $d=4$ non-local effective actionyields two new conserved geometric stress tensors with local traces. The methodmay be extended to any even dimension by making use of the general constructionof conformal invariants given by Fefferman and Graham. As a corollary,conformal field theory behavior of correlators at the asymptotic infinity ofeither anti-de Sitter or de Sitter spacetimes follows, i.e. AdS$_{d+1}$ ordeS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_d$ correspondence. The same construction naturally selects allinfrared relevant terms (and only those terms) in the low energy effectiveaction of gravity in any even integer dimension. The infrared relevant termsarising from the known anomalies in d=4 imply that the classical Einsteintheory is modified at large distances.
