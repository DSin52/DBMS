We comment on the recent papers by Costa et al and Emparan, which show howone might generate supergravity solutions describing certain dielectric branesin ten dimensions. The ``basic'' such solutions describe either N fundamentalstrings or N D4-branes expanding into a D6-brane, with topology M^2 x S^5 orM^5 x S^2 respectively. Treating these solutions in a unified way, we note thatthey allow for precisely two values of the radius of the relevant sphere, andthat the solution with the smaller value of the radius has the lower energy.Moreover, the possible radii in both cases agree up to numerical factors withthe corresponding solutions of the D6-brane worldvolume theory. We thus arguethat these supergravity solutions are the correct gravitational description ofthe dielectric branes of Emparan and Myers.
