Starting from a recently proposed Abelian topological model in (2+1)dimensions, which involve the Kalb-Ramond two form field, we study anon-Abelian generalization of the model. An obstruction for generalization isdetected. However we show that the goal is achieved if we introduce a vectorialauxiliary field. Consequently, a model is proposed, exhibiting a non-Abeliantopological mass generation mechanism in D=3, that provides mass for theKalb-Ramond field. The covariant quantization of this model requires ghosts forghosts. Therefore in order to quantize the theory we construct a complete setof BRST and anti-BRST equations using the horizontality condition.
