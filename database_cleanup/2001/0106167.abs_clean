We develop a systematic DLCQ perturbation theory and show that DLCQ S-matrixdoes not have a covariant continuum limit for processes with $p^+=0$ exchange.This implies that the role of the zero mode is more subtle than ever consideredin DLCQ and hence must be treated with great care also in non-perturbativeapproach. We also make a brief comment on DLCQ in string theory.
