We report on progress made in the construction of higher-derivativesuperinvariants for type-II theories in ten dimensions. The string amplitudecalculations required for this analysis exhibit interesting features which havereceived little attention in the literature so far. We discuss two examplesand the fermionic completion of the \epsilon\epsilon R^4 terms. We show that acorrect answer requires very careful treatment of the chiral splitting theorem,implies unexpected new relations between fermionic correlators, and mostinterestingly, necessitates the use of worldsheet gravitino zero modes in thestring vertex operators. In addition, we discuss the relation of our results tothe predictions of the linear scalar superfield of the type-IIB theory and find(and explain) an interesting discrepancy.
