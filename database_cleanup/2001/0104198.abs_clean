A uniformly acclerated observer in anti-deSitter space-time is known todetect thermal radiation when the acceleration exceeds a critical value. Weinvestigate the holographic interpretation of this phenomenon. For uniformlyaccelerated trajectories transverse to the boundary of the AdS space, thehologram is a blob which expands along the boundary. Observers on the boundaryco-moving with the hologram become observers in cosmological space-times. Forsupercritical accelerations one gets a Milne universe when the holographicscreen is the boundary in Poincare coordinates, while for the boundary inhyperspherical coordinates one gets deSitter spacetimes. The presence orabsence of thermality is then interpreted in terms of specific classes ofobservers in these cosmologies.
