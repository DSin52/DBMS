The ultra-violet behavior of Kaluza-Klein theories on a one dimensionalorbifold is discussed. An extension of dimensional regularization that can beapplied to a compact dimension is presented. Using this, the FI-tadpole iscalculated in the effective KK theory resulting from compactifyingsupersymmetric theories in 5 dimensions.
