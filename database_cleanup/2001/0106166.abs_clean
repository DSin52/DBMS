Title: Integrability in Fluid Dynamics

Authors: Subir Ghosh

Comments: The paper is rewritten with generalizations of previous results

Systems; Fluid Dynamics3+1-dimensional free inviscid fluid dynamics is shown to satisfy the criteriafor exact integrability, i.e. having an infinite set of independent, conservedquantities in involution, with the Hamiltonian being one of them. With (densitydependent) interaction present, distinct infinite serieses of conservedquantities in involution are discovered. Clebsch parametrization of thevelocity field is used in the the latter analysis. Relativistic generalizationof the free system is also shown to be integrable.
