The effective action for five-dimensional heterotic M-theory in the presenceof five-branes is systematically derived from Horava-Witten theory coupled toan M5-brane world-volume theory. This leads to a five-dimensional N=1 gaugedsupergravity theory on S^1/Z_2 coupled to four-dimensional N=1 theoriesresiding on the two orbifold fixed planes and an additional bulk three-brane.We analyse the properties of this action, particularly the four-dimensionaleffective theory associated with the domain-wall vacuum state. The moduliKahler potential and the gauge-kinetic functions are determined along with theexplicit relations between four-dimensional superfields and five-dimensionalcomponent fields.
