Title: Is particle creation by the gravitational field consistent with energy

conservation?Authors: H. Nikolic

Comments: 7 pages

If particle creation is described by a Bogoliubov transformation, then, inthe Heisenberg picture, the raising and lowering operators are time dependent.On the other hand, this time dependence is not consistent with field equationsand the conservation of the stress-energy tensor. Possible physicalinterpretations and resolutions of this inconsistency are discussed.
