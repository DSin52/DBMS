We study the non-commutative instanton solution proposed in hep-th/0009142and obtain the spectrum of small oscillations. The spectrum thus obtained is inexact agreement with the spectrum of stringy excitations in a configuration ofpoint like D0 branes sitting on top of D4-branes with a uniform magnetic fieldturned on in the world-volume of the D4-branes in the Seiberg-Witten decouplinglimit. This provides further evidence for the solution of hep-th/0009142 andalso enables us recover the ADHM data from the 0-4 string spectrum.Generalizations to higher co-dimension solitons are also discussed.
