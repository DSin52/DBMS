We establish general properties of supersymmetric flow equations and of thesuperpotential of five-dimensional N = 2 gauged supergravity coupled to vectorand hypermultiplets. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for BPSdomain walls and find a set of algebraic attractor equations for N = 2 criticalpoints.As an example we describe in detail the gauging of the universalhypermultiplet and a vector multiplet. We study a two-parameter family ofsuperpotentials with supersymmetric AdS critical points and we find, inparticular, an N = 2 embedding for the UV-IR solution of Freedman, Gubser,Pilch and Warner of the N = 8 theory. We comment on the relevance of theseresults for brane world constructions.
