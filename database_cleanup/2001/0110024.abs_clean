Using the AdS/CFT correspondence in a confining backgroundand the worldlineformalism of gauge field theories,we compute scattering amplitudes with anexchange of quark andantiquark in the $t$-channel corresponding to Reggeonexchange. Itrequires going beyond the eikonal approximation, which was usedwhen studying Pomeron exchange. The wordline path integral is evaluated throughthe determination of minimal surfaces and their boundaries by the saddle-pointmethod at large gauge coupling g^2N_c. We find a Regge behaviour with linearRegge trajectories. The slope is related to the $q\bar q$ static potential andis four times the Pomeronslope obtained in the same framework. A contributionto the intercept, related to the L\"uscher term, comes from the fluctuationsaround the minimal surface.
