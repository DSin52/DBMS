We construct boundary states for the AdS_2 D-branes in AdS_3. We show that,in the semi-classical limit, the boundary states correctly reproduce geometricconfigurations of these branes. We use the boundary states to compute the oneloop free energy of open string stretched between the branes. The result agreesprecisely with the open string computation in hep-th/0106129.
