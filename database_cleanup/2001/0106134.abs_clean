Title: Higher Dimensional Operators or Large Extra Dimensions?

Authors: Bayram Tekin

Comments: 9 pages, 3 more references added, the reason why we disregard all but

the linear and the quadratic terms is statedWe deform gravity with higher curvature terms in four dimensions and arguethat the non-relativistic limit is of the same form as the non-relativisticlimit of the theories with large extra dimensions. Therefore the experimentsthat perform sub-millimeter tests of inverse-square law cannot distinguish theeffects of large extra dimensions from the effects of higher dimensionaloperators. In other words instead of detecting the presence of sub-millimeterdimensions; the experiments could be detecting the existence of massive modesof gravity with large masses ($\ge 10^{-3}$ eV)
