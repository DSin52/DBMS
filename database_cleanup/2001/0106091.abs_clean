We analyse the algebras generated by free component quantum fields togetherwith the susy generators $Q,\bar Q$. Restricting to hermitian fields we firstconstruct the scalar field algebra from which various scalar superfields can beobtained by exponentiation. Then we study the vector algebra and use it toconstruct the vector superfield. Surprisingly enough, the result is totallydifferent from the vector multiplet in the literature. It contains twohermitian four-vector components instead of one and a spin-3/2 field similar tothe gravitino in supergravity.
