We study the geometry of orientifolds in the SU(2) WZW model. They correspondto the two inequivalent, orientation-reversing involutions of $S^3$, whose(O2). We show how the geometric action of these involutions leads unambiguouslyto the previously obtained algebraic results for the Klein bottle and Moebiusamplitudes. We give a semiclassical derivation of the selection rules and signsin the crosscap couplings, paying particular attention to discrete B-fluxes.A novel observation, which does not follow from consistency of the one-loopvacuum diagrams, is that in the case of the O0 orientifolds only integer- oronly half-integer-spin Cardy states may coexist.
