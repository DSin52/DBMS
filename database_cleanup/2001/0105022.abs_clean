In this work we present a possible way to relate the method of covariantizingthe gauge dependent pole and the negative dimensional integration method forcomputing Feynman integrals pertinent to the light-cone gauge fields. Bothtechniques are applicable to the algebraic light-cone gauge and dispense withprescriptions to treat the characteristic poles.
