We discuss the radiation reaction problem for an electric charge moving inflat space-time of arbitrary dimensions. It is shown that four is the uniquedimension where a local differential equation exists accounting for theradiation reaction and admitting a consistent mass-renormalization (theDirac-Lorentz equation). In odd dimensions the Huygens principle does not hold;as a result, the radiation reaction force depends on the whole past history ofa charge (radiative tail). We show that the divergence in the tail integral canbe removed by the mass renormalization only in the 2+1 theory. In evendimensions higher than four, divergences can not be removed by arenormalization.
