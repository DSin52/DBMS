A mechanism to find different Weyl invariant p-branes and Dp-branes actionsis explained. Our procedure clarifies the Weyl invariance for such systems.Besides, by considering gravity-dilaton effective action in higher dimensionswe also derive a Weyl invariant action for p-branes. We argue that thisderivation provides a geometrical scenario for the Weyl invariance of p-branes.Our considerations can be extended to the case of super-p-branes.
