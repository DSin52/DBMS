A new basis of states for highest-weight modules in $\ZZ_k$ parafermionicconformal theories is displayed. It is formulated in terms of an effectiveexclusion principle constraining strings of $k$ fundamental parafermionicmodes. The states of a module are then built by a simple filling process, withno singular-vector subtractions. That results in fermionic-sum representationsof the characters, which are exactly the Lepowsky-Primc expressions. We alsostress that the underlying combinatorics -- which is the one pertaining to theAndrews-Gordon identities -- has a remarkably natural parafermionicinterpretation.
