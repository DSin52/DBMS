We explicitly construct noncommutative * products on circularly symmetric twodimensional space by using the technique of Fedosov's deformation quantization.Especially, on constant curvature spaces i.e., S^2 and H^2, we get su(2) andsu(1,1) algebra respectively. These are candidates of * products applicable tononcommutative field theories or noncommutative gauge theories on spaces withnontrivial symplectic structure.
