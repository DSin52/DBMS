We investigate supersymmetric tubular configurations in the matrix theory. Weconstruct a host of BPS configurations of eight supersymmetries. They can beregarded as cylindrical D2 branes carrying nonvanishing angular momentum. Forthe simplest tube, the world volume can be described as noncommutative tube andthe world volume dynamics can be identified as a noncommutative gauge theory.Among the BPS configurations, some describe excitations on the tube and othersdescribe many parallel tubes of different size and center.
