Three-point functions of Wess-Zumino-Witten models are investigated. Inparticular, we study the level-dependence of three-point functions in themodels based on algebras $su(3)$ and $su(4)$. We find a correspondence withBerenstein-Zelevinsky triangles. Using previous work connecting those trianglesto the fusion multiplicities, and the Gepner-Witten depth rule, we explain howto construct the full three-point functions. We show how their level-dependenceis similar to that of the related fusion multiplicity. For example, the conceptof threshold level plays a prominent role, as it does for fusion.
