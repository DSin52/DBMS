We study classical N=2 string within the framework of the N=4 topologicalformalism by Berkovits and Vafa. Special emphasis is put on the demonstrationof a classical equivalence of the theories and the construction of an actionfor the N=4 topological string. The SO(2,2) Lorentz invariance missing in theconventional Brink--Schwarz action for the N=2 string is restored in the N=4topological action.
