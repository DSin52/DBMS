perturbative solutions of left-unilateral matrix equations. These are algebraicequations where the coefficients and the unknown are square matrices of thesame order, or, more abstractly, elements of an associative, but possiblynoncommutative algebra, and all coefficients are on the left. Recently suchequations have appeared in a discussion of generalized Born-Infeld theories. Inparticular, two equations, their perturbative solutions and the relationbetween them are studied, applying a unified approach based on the generalizedBezout theorem for matrix polynomials.
