We investigate static axially symmetric monopole and black hole solutionswith magnetic charge n > 1 in Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. For vanishingand small Higgs selfcoupling, multimonopole solutions are gravitationallybound. Their mass per unit charge is lower than the mass of the n=1 monopole.For large Higgs selfcoupling only a repulsive phase exists. The static axiallysymmetric hairy black hole solutions possess a deformed horizon with constantsurface gravity. We consider their properties in the isolated horizonframework, interpreting them as bound states of monopoles and black holes.Representing counterexamples to the ``no-hair'' conjecture, these black holesare neither uniquely characterized by their horizon area and horizon charge.
