We consider the cosmological evolution of a bulk scalar field and ordinarymatter living on the brane world in the light of the constraints imposed by thematter dominated cosmological evolution and a small cosmological constant now.We rule out models with a self-tuned minimum of the four dimensional potentialas they would lead to rapid oscillations of the Hubble parameter now. A morenatural framework is provided by supergravity in singular spaces where thebrane coupling and the bulk potential are related by supersymmetry leading to afour dimensional run-away potential. For late times we obtain an acceleratinguniverse due to the breaking of supersymmetry on the brane with an accelerationparameter of q_0=-4/7 and associated equation of state omega=-5/7.
