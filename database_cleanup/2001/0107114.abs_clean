Variation of coupling constants of integrable system can be considered ascanonical transformation or, infinitesimally, a Hamiltonian flow in the spaceof such systems. Any function $T(\vec p, \vec q)$ generates a one-parametricof how many integrable systems there are in the space of coupling constants.Inverse flow is generated by a dual "Hamiltonian", $\widetilde T(\vec p, \vecq)$ associated with the dual integrable system. In vicinity of a self-dualpoint the duality transformation just interchanges momenta and coordinates inintegrable system with several coupling constants the corresponding"Hamiltonians" $T_i(\vec p, \vec q)$ satisfy Whitham equations and afterquantization (of the original system) become operators satisfying theT_a(p,q), d/dg_b - T_b(p,q) ] = 0. Some explicit formulas are given forharmonic oscillator and for Calogero-Ruijsenaars-Dell system.
