Title: Wilson Action of Lattice Gauge Fields with An Additional Term from

Noncommutative GeometryAuthors: Jian Dai, Xing-Chang Song (Theoretical Group, Department of Physics,

Differential structure of lattices can be defined if the lattices are treatedas models of noncommutative geometry. The detailed construction consists ofspecifying a generalized Dirac operator and a wedge product. Gauge potentialand field strength tensor can be defined based on this differential structure.When an inner product is specified for differential forms, classical action canbe deduced for lattice gauge fields. Besides the familiar Wilson action beingrecovered, an additional term, related to the non-unitarity of link variablesand loops spanning no area, emerges.
