We study quantum mechanics of a massive superparticle in d=4 which preserves1/4 of the target space supersymmetry with eight supercharges, and socorresponds to the partial breaking N=8 down to N=2. Its worldline actioncontains a Wess-Zumino term, explicitly breaks d=4 Lorentz symmetry andexhibits one complex fermionic kappa-symmetry. We perform the Hamiltoniananalysis of the model and quantize it in two different ways, with gauge-fixedkappa-symmetry and in the Gupta-Bleuler formalism. Both approaches give rise tothe same supermultiplet structure of the space of states. It contains threeirreducible N=2 multiplets with the total number of (4+4) complex on-shellcomponents. These states prove to be in one-to-one correspondence with the deRham complex of p-forms on a three-dimensional subspace of the targetx-manifold. We analyze the vacuum structure of the model and find that thenon-trivial vacua are given by the exact harmonic one- and two-forms. Despitethe explicit breaking of the d=4 Lorentz symmetry in the fermionic sector, thed=4 mass-shell condition is still valid in the model.
