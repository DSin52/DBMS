We provide a complete algebraic description of BPS states in M-theory interms of primary constituents that we call BPS preons. We argue that any BPSstate preserving $k$ of the 32 supersymmetries is a composite of (32-k) BPSpreons. In particular, the BPS states corresponding to the basic M2 and M5branes are composed of 16 BPS preons. By extending the M-algebra to ageneralized D=11 conformal superalgebra $osp(1|64)$ we relate the BPS preonswith its fundamental representation, the D=11 supertwistors.
