We present special classes of orientifold models involving supersymmetrybreaking via branes at angles. Type II superstring theories are compactified ona two torus times a four-dimensional orbifold. Combining worldsheet parity witha reflection of half of the compact coordinates leads to D6-branes at angleswhich are mapped onto each other by the orbifold group, while applying thegeometric action only along one coordinate leads to intersecting D8-branes withnon-trivial transformation properties under the orbifold group. The modelsdiffer in the gauge groups and matter content.
