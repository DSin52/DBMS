Kaluza-Klein theory in which the geometry of an additional dimension isfractal has been considered. In such a theory the mass of an elementaryelectric charge appears to be many orders of magnitude smaller than the Planckmass, and the "tower" of masses which correspond to higher integer chargesbecomes aperiodic.
