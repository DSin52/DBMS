Title: String Theory and the Size of Hadrons

Authors: Joseph Polchinski and Leonard Susskind

Comments: 15 pages

We begin by outlining the ancient puzzle of off shell currents and infinitesize particles in a string theory of hadrons. We then consider the problem fromthe modern AdS/CFT perspective. We argue that although hadrons should bethought of as ideal thin strings from the 5-dimensional bulk point of view, the4-dimensional strings are a superposition of "fat" strings of differentthickness.We also find that the warped nature of the target geometry provides amechanism for taming the infinite zero point fluctuations which apparentlyproduce a divergent result for hadronic radii.Finally a calculation of the large momentum behavior of the form factor isgiven in the limit of strong 't Hooft parameter where the classical gravitylimit is appropriate. We find agreement with parton model expectations.
