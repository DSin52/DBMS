We investigate several models described by real scalar fields, searching fortopological defects, and investigating their linear stability. We also findbosonic zero modes and examine the thermal corrections at the one-loop level.The classical investigations may be of interest to high energy physics andapplications to nonlinear science. The semiclassical investigations show thatthe finite temperature corrections that appear in a specific model do notsuffice to fully restore the symmetry at high temperature.
