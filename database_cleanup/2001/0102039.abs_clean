A new family of A_N-type Dunkl operators preserving a polynomial subspace offinite dimension is constructed. Using a general quadratic combination of theseoperators and the usual Dunkl operators, several new families of exactly andquasi-exactly solvable quantum spin Calogero-Sutherland models are obtained.These include, in particular, three families of quasi-exactly solvable ellipticspin Hamiltonians.
