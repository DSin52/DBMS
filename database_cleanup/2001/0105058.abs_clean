A sliver state is a classical solution of the string field theory of thetachyon vacuum that represents a background with a single D25-brane. We showthat the sliver wavefunctional factors into functionals of the left and righthalves of the string, and hence can be naturally regarded as a rank-oneprojector in a space of half-string functionals. By developing an algebraicoscillator approach we are able construct higher rank projectors that describeconfigurations of multiple D-branes of various dimensionalities and located atarbitrary positions. The results bear remarkable similarities withnon-commutative solitons.
