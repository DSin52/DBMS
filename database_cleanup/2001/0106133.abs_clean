Homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies of the Planck era before the classicalEinstein equations become valid are studied taking quantum gravitationaleffects into account. The cosmological evolution equations are renormalizationgroup improved by including the scale dependence of Newton's constant and ofthe cosmological constant as it is given by the flow equation of the effectiveaverage action for gravity. It is argued that the Planck regime can be treatedreliably in this framework because gravity is found to become asymptoticallyfree at short distances. The epoch immediately after the initial singularity ofthe Universe is described by an attractor solution of the improved equationswhich is a direct manifestation of an ultraviolet attractive renormalizationgroup fixed point. It is shown that quantum gravity effects in the very earlyUniverse might provide a resolution to the horizon and flatness problem ofstandard cosmology, and could generate a scale-free spectrum of primordialdensity fluctuations.
