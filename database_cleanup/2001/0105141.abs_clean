The four dimensional O(3) non-linear sigma model introduced by Faddeev andNiemi, with a Skyrme-like higher order term to stabilise static knot solutionsclassified by the Hopf invariant, can be rewritten in terms of the complextwo-component CP1 variables. A further rewriting of these variables in terms ofSU(2) curvature free gauge fields is performed. This leads us to interpretSU(2) pure gauge vacuum configurations, in a particular maximal abelian gauge,in terms of knots with the Hopf invariant equal to the winding number of thegauge configuration.
