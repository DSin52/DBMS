We write the recently conjectured action for transformation of the ordinaryBorn-Infeld action under the Seiberg-Witten map with one open Wilson contour ina manifestly non-commutative gauge invariant form. This action contains thenon-constant closed string fields, higher order derivatives of thenon-commutative gauge fields through the $*_N$-product, and a Wilson operator.We extend this non-commutative $D_9$-brane action to the action for $D_p$-braneby transforming it under T-duality. Using this non-commutative $D_p$-braneaction we then evaluate the linear couplings of the graviton and dilaton to thebrane for arbitrary non-commutative parameters. By taking the Seiberg-Wittenlimit we show that they reduce exactly to the known results of theenergy-momentum tensor of the non-commutative super Yang-Mills theory. We takethis as an evidence that the non-commutative action in the Seiberg-Witten limitincludes properly all derivative correction terms.
