We extend some aspects of vacuum string field theory to superstring fieldtheory in Berkovits' formulation, and we study the star algebra in thefermionic matter sector. After clarifying the structure of the interactionvertex in the operator formalism of Gross and Jevicki, we provide an algebraicconstruction of the supersliver state in terms of infinite-dimensionalmatrices. This state is an idempotent string field and solves the matter partof the equation of motion of superstring field theory with a pure ghost BRSToperator. We determine the spectrum of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of theinfinite-dimensional matrices of Neumann coefficients in the fermionic mattersector. We then analyze coherent states based on the supersliver and use themin order to construct higher-rank projector solutions, as well as to constructclosed subalgebras of the star algebra in the fermionic matter sector. Finally,we show that the geometric supersliver is a solution to the superstring fieldtheory equations of motion, including the (super)ghost sector, with thecanonical choice of vacuum BRST operator recently proposed by Gaiotto,Rastelli, Sen and Zwiebach.
