We propose a model for noncommutative quantum cosmology by means of adeformation of minisuperspace. For the Kantowski-Sachs metric we are able tofind the exact wave function. We construct wave packets and show that newquantum states that ``compete'' to be the most probable state appear, in clearcontrast with the commutative case. A tunneling process could be possible amongthese states.
