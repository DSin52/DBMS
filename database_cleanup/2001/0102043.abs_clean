We discuss spectra of $AdS_3$ supergravities, arising in the near horizongeometry of D1/D5 systems in orbifolds/orientifolds of type IIB theory with 16supercharges. These include models studied in a recent paper (hep-th/0012118),where the group action involves also a shift along a transversal circle, aswell as IIB/$\Omega I_4$, which is dual to IIB on $K3$. After appropriateassignements of the orbifold group eigenvalues and degrees to the supergravitysingle particle spectrum, we compute the supergravity elliptic genus and findagreement, in the expected regime of validity, with the elliptic genus obtainedusing U-duality map from (4,4) CFTs of U-dual backgrounds. Since this U-dualityinvolves the exchange of KK momentum $P$ and D1 charge $N$, it allows us totest the (4,4) CFTs in the $P < N/4$ and $N < P/4$ regimes by two differentsupergravity duals.
