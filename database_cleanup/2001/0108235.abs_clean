Representations of four dimensional superconformal groups are constructed asfields on many different superspaces, including super Minkowski space, chiralsuperspace, harmonic superspace and analytic superspace. Any unitaryirreducible representation can be given as a field on any one of these spacesif we include fields which transform under supergroups. In particular, onanalytic superspaces, the fields are unconstrained. One can obtain allrepresentations of the N=4 complex superconformal group $PSL(4|4)$ with integerdilation weight from copies of the Maxwell multiplet on $(4,2,2)$ analyticsuperspace. This construction is compared with the oscillator construction andit is shown that there is a natural correspondence between the oscillatorconstruction of superconformal representations and those carried by superfieldson analytic superspace.
