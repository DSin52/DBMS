changesCritical String Theory is by definition an $S$-matrix theory. In this sense,(quantum) gravity situations where a unitary $S$-matrix may not be awell-defined concept, as a consequence of the existence of macroscopic (global)or microscopic (local) gravitational fluctuations with event horizons, presenta challenge to string theory. In this article, we take some modest steps insuggesting alternative treatments of such cases via non-critical (Liouville)strings,which do not have a well-defined S matrix, but for which asuperscattering \$ matrix is mathematically consistent. After a brief review ofthe underlying mathematical formalism, we consider a specific stringy model ofinduced non-criticality, with dynamical formation of horizons, associated withthe recoil of a D-particle defect, embedded in our four-dimensional space time,during its scattering with a (macroscopic) number of closed string states. Westudy in detail the associated spacetime distortion in the neighbourhood of thedefect, which has the form of a finite-radius curved `bubble', matched with aMinkowskian space-time in the exterior. As a consequence of the non-criticalityof the underlying sigma-model, the space time is unstable, and has non-trivialnature'', and entropy growth for an asymptotic observer, associated withinformation being carried away by the `recoil' degrees of freedom. We alsodiscuss phenomenological (and cosmological) constraints on the model.
