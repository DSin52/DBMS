Comments: 12 pages, 2 figures

We discuss the concept of composite fields in flat CFT as well as in thecontext of AdS/CFT. Furthermore we show how to represent Green functions usinggeneralized hypergeometric functions and apply these techniques to four-pointfunctions. Finally we prove an identity of $U(1)_Y$ symmetry for four-pointfunctions.
