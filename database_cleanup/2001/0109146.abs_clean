We implement the Hamiltonian treatment of a nonAbelian noncommutative gaugetheory, considering with some detail the algebraic structure of thenoncommutative symmetry group. The first class constraints and Hamiltonian areobtained and their algebra derived, as well as the form of the gauge invariancethey impose on the first order action.
