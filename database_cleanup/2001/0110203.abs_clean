We consider the noncommutative hypermultiplet model within harmonicsuperspace approach. The 1-loop four-point contributions to the effectiveaction of selfinteracting q-hypermultiplet are computed. This model has twocoupling constants instead of a single one in commutative case. It is shownthat both these coupling constants are generated by 1-loop quantum correctionsin the model of q-hypermultiplet interacting with vector multiplet. Theholomorphic effective action of q-hypermultiplet in external gauge superfieldis calculated. For the fundamental representation there is no UV/IR-mixing andthe holomorphic potential is a star-product generalization of a standardcommutative one. For the adjoint representation of U(N) gauge group the leadingcontributions to the holomorphic effective action are given by the termsrespecting for the UV/IR-mixing which are related to U(1) phase of U(N) group.
