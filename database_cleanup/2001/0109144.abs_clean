Title: Monte-Carlo Simulation of Domain-Wall Network in Two-dimensional

Extended Supersymmetric TheoryAuthors: Nobuyuki Motoyui, Shogo Tominaga and Mitsuru Yamada

Comments: Talk given at International Symposium on Non-Equilibrium and

Nonlinear Dynamics in Nuclear and Other Finite Systems held at May 21-25,2001 in Beijing. 7 pages, 4 figuresWe will show that 2-dimensional N=2-extended supersymmetric theory can havesolitonic solution using the Hamilton-Jacobi method of classical mechanics.Then it is shown that the Bogomol'nyi mass bound is saturated by thesesolutions and triangular mass inequality is satisfied. At the end, we willmention domain-wall structure in 3-dimensional spacetime.
