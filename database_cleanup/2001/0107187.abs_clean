The Faddeev-Skyrme model, a modified O(3) nonlinear sigma model in threespace dimensions, is known to admit topological solitons that are stabilized bythe Hopf charge. The Faddeev-Skyrme model is also related to the low-energylimits of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. Here, the model is reformulated into itsgauge-equivalent expression, which turns out to be Skyrme-like. The solitonicsolutions of this Skyrme-like model are analyzed by the rational map ansatz.The energy function and the Bogomolny-type lower bound of the energy areestablished. The generalized Faddeev-Skyrme model that originates from theinfrared limits of SU(N) Yang-Mills theory is presented.
