Spontaneous symmetry breaking in (1+1)-dimensional $\phi^{4}$ theory isstudied with discretized light-front quantization. Taking effects ofnon-diagonal interactions into account, the first few terms of the commutationrelations $[a_{0},a_{n}]$ are recalculated in the $\hbar$ expansion. Our resultof the critical coupling is still consistent with the equal-time result$22\mu^{2}/\hbar \le \lambda_{\rm{cr}} \le 55.5\mu^{2}/\hbar$. We also haveexamined effects of regarding the ratio of the bare coupling constant to arenormalized mass as an independent parameter in the $\hbar$ expansion.
