Two-body and three-body systems of scalar bosons are considered in theframework of covariant constraint dynamics. The reduced equation obtained aftereliminating redundant degrees of freedom can be viewed as an eigenvalueequation for an observable which is intimately related with the relativemotion. We display the connection of this observable with binding energy.
