The status of exponential scalar potentials in supergravity is reviewed, andupdated. One version of N=8 D=4 supergravity with a positive exponentialpotential, obtainable from a `non-compactification' of M-theory, is shown tohave an accelerating cosmological solution that realizes `eternalquintessence'. Some implications for a de Sitter version of the domain wall/QFTcorrespondence are discussed.
