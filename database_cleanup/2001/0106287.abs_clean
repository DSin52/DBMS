Affine su(3) and su(4) fusion multiplicities are characterised as discretisedvolumes of certain convex polytopes. The volumes are measured explicitly,resulting in multiple sum formulas. These are the first polytope-volumeformulas for higher-rank fusion multiplicities. The associated threshold levelsare also discussed. For any simple Lie algebra we derive an upper bound on thethreshold levels using a refined version of the Gepner-Witten depth rule.
