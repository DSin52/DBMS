Title: On the Generation of a Scale-Invariant Spectrum of Adiabatic

Fluctuations in Cosmological Models with a Contracting PhaseAuthors: Fabio Finelli, Robert Brandenberger

Comments: 8 pages, revised version without the section on perturbations,

matching the version published on Phys. Rev. D. For cosmologicalperturbations in the two field model see astro-ph/0211276In Pre-Big-Bang and in Ekpyrotic Cosmology, perturbations on cosmologicalscales today are generated from quantum vacuum fluctuations during a phase whenthe Universe is contracting (viewed in the Einstein frame). The backgroundsstudied to date do not yield a scale invariant spectrum of adiabaticfluctuations. Here, we present a new contracting background model (neither ofPre-Big-Bang nor of the Ekpyrotic form) involving a single scalar field coupledto gravity in which a scale-invariant spectrum of curvature fluctuations andgravitational waves results. The equation of state of this scalar fieldcorresponds to cold matter. We demonstrate that if this contracting phase canbe matched via a nonsingular bounce to an expanding Friedmann cosmology, thescale-invariance of the curvature fluctuations is maintained. We also find newbackground solutions for Pre-Big-Bang and for Ekpyrotic cosmology, whichinvolve two scalar fields with exponential potentials with background valueswhich are evolving in time. We comment on the difficulty of obtaining ascale-invariant spectrum of adiabatic fluctuations with background solutionswhich have been studied in the past.
