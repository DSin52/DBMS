Title: Radially infalling brane and moving domain wall in the brane cosmology

Comments: 9 pages, REVTEX

We discuss the brane cosmology in the 5D anti de Sitter Schwarzschild(AdSS$_5$) spacetime. A brane with the tension $\sigma$ is defined as the edgeof an AdSS$_5$ space. We point out that the location of the horizon is anapparently, singular point at where we may not define an embedding of theAdSS$_5$ spacetime into the moving domain wall (MDW). We resolve this problemby introducing a radially infalling brane (RIB) in AdSS$_5$ space, where anapparent singularity turns out to be a coordinate one. Hence theCFT/FRW-cosmology is well-defined at the horizon. As an example, an universalCardy formula for the entropy of the CFT can be given by the Friedmann equationat the horizon.
