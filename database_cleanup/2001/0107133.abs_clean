Following Osipov and Hiller, a generalized heat kernel expansion isconsidered for the effective action of bosonic operators. In thisgeneralization, the standard heat kernel expansion, which counts inverse powersof a c-number mass parameter, is extended by allowing the mass to be a matrixin flavor space. We show that the generalized heat kernel coefficients can berelated to the standard ones in a simple way. This holds with or without traceand integration over spacetime, to all orders and for general flavor spaces.Gauge invariance is manifest.
