The exact solutions of the wave equation for arbitrary spin particles withelectric dipole and magnetic moments in the constant and uniformelectromagnetic field were found. The differential probability of pairproduction of particles by an external electromagnetic field has beencalculated on the basis of the exact solutions. We have also estimated theimaginary part of the constant and uniform electromagnetic field. The nonlinearcorrections to the Maxwell Lagrangian have been calculated taking into accountthe vacuum polarization of arbitrary spin particles. The role of electricdipole and magnetic moments of arbitrary spin particles in instability of thevacuum is discussed.
