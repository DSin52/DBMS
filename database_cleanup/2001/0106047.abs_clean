With the help of the Seiberg-Witten map, one can obtain an effective actionof a deformed QED from a noncommutative QED. Starting from the deformed QED, weinvestigate the propagation of photons in the background of electromagneticfield, up to the leading order of the noncommutativity parameter. In oursetting (both the electric and magnetic fields are parallel to the coordinateaxis $x^1$ and the nonvanishing component of the noncommutativity parameter is$\theta^{23}$), we find that the electric field has no effect on thepropagation of photons, but the velocity of photons can be larger than thespeed of light ($c=1$) when the propagating direction of photons isperpendicular to the direction of background magnetic field, while thelight-cone condition does not change when the propagating direction is parallelto the background magnetic field. The causality associated with thesuperluminal photons is discussed briefly.
