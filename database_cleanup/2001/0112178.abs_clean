We exhibit a simple class of exactly marginal "double-trace" deformations oftwo dimensional CFTs which have AdS_3 duals, in which the deformation is givenby a product of left and right-moving U(1) currents. In this special case thedeformation on AdS_3 is generated by a local boundary term in three dimensions,which changes the physics also in the bulk via bulk-boundary propagators.However, the deformation is non-local in six dimensions and on the stringworldsheet, like generic non-local string theories (NLSTs). Due to thesimplicity of the deformation we can explicitly make computations in thenon-local string theory and compare them to CFT computations, and we obtainprecise agreement. We discuss the effect of the deformation on closed stringsand on D-branes. The examples we analyze include a supersymmetry-breaking butexactly marginal "double-trace" deformation, which is dual to a string theoryin which no destabilizing tadpoles are generated for moduli nonperturbativelyin all couplings, despite the absence of supersymmetry. We explain how thiscancellation works on the gravity side in string perturbation theory, and alsonon-perturbatively at leading order in the deformation parameter. We alsodiscuss possible flat space limits of our construction.
