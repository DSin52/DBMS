We analyze the vacuum structure of spontaneously broken N=2 supersymmetricgauge theory with the Fayet-Iliopoulos term. Our theory is based on the gaugegroup SU(2) \times U(1) with N_f=2 massless quark hypermultiplets having thesame U(1) charges. In the classical potential, there are degenerate vacua evenin the absence of supersymmetry. It is shown that this vacuum degeneracy issmoothed out, once quantum corrections are taken into account. While there isthe runaway direction in the effective potential, we found the promisingpossibility that there appears the local minimum with broken supersymmetry atthe degenerate dyon point.
