It has been shown that D0-D$p$ $(p=2, 4, 6, 8)$ systems can be BPS in thepresence of $B$-field even if they are not otherwise. We review the number ofremaining supersymmetries, the open string ground state spectrum and theconstruction of the D0-D$p$ systems as solitonic solutions in thenoncommutative super Yang-Mills theory. We derive the complete mass spectrum ofthe fluctuations to discuss the stability of the systems. The results are foundto agree with the analysis in the string picture. In particular, we show thatsupersymmetry is enhanced in D0-D8 depending on the $B$-fields and it isconsistent with the degeneracy of mass spectrum. We also derive potentials anddiscuss their implications for these systems.
