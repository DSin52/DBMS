Based on concepts drawn from the ekpyrotic scenario and M-theory, weelaborate our recent proposal of a cyclic model of the Universe. In this model,the Universe undergoes an endless sequence of cosmic epochs which begin withthe Universe expanding from a `big bang' and end with the Universe contractingto a `big crunch.'Matching from `big crunch' to `big bang' is performed according to theprescription recently proposed with Khoury, Ovrut and Seiberg. The expansionpart of the cycle includes a period of radiation and matter domination followedby an extended period of cosmic acceleration at low energies. The cosmicacceleration is crucial in establishing the flat and vacuous initial conditionsrequired for ekpyrosis and for removing the entropy, black holes, and otherdebris produced in the preceding cycle. By restoring the Universe to the samevacuum state before each big crunch, the acceleration insures that the cyclecan repeat and that the cyclic solution is an attractor.
