The Lagrangian Sp(3) BRST symmetry for irreducible gauge theories isconstructed in the framework of homological perturbation theory. The canonicalgenerator of this extended symmetry is shown to exist. A gauge-fixing procedurespecific to the standard antibracket-antifield formalism, that leads to aneffective action, which is invariant under all the three differentials of theSp(3) algebra, is given.
