We consider a class of domain-wall black hole solutions in the dilatongravity with a Liouville-type dilaton potential. Using the surface countertermapproach we calculate the stress-energy tensor of quantum field theory (QFT)corresponding to the domain-wall black hole in the domain-wall/QFTcorrespondence. A brane universe is investigated in the domain-wall black holebackground. When the tension term of the brane is equal to the surfacecounterterm, we find that the equation of motion of the brane can be mapped tothe standard form of FRW equations, but with a varying gravitational constanton the brane. A Cardy-Verlinde-like formula is found, which relates the entropydensity of the QFT to its energy density. At the moment when the brane crossesthe black hole horizon of the background, the Cardy-Verlinde-like formulacoincides with the Friedmann equation of the brane universe, and the Hubbleentropy bound is saturated by the entropy of domain-wall black holes.
