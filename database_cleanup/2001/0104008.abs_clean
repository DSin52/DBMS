Riemann zeta function is an important object of number theory. It was alsoused for description of disordered systems in statistical mechanics. We showthat Riemann zeta function is also useful for the description of integrablemodel. We study XXX Heisenberg spin 1/2 anti-ferromagnet. We evaluate aprobability of formation of a ferromagnetic string in the anti-ferromagneticground state in thermodynamics limit. We prove that for short strings theprobability can be expressed in terms of Riemann zeta function with oddarguments.
