One shows here the existence of solutions to the Callan-Symanzik equation forthe non-Abelian SU(2) Chern-Simons-matter model which exhibits asymptoticconformal invariance to every order in perturbative theory. The conformalsymmetry in the classical domain is shown to hold by means of a local criteriabased on the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. By using the recentlyexhibited regimes for the dependence between the several couplings in which theset of $\beta$-functions vanish, the asymptotic conformal invariance of themodel appears to be valid in the quantum domain. By considering the SU(n) casethe possible non validity of the proof for a particular n would be merelyaccidental.
