It was shown by Weyl that the general static axisymmetric solution of thevacuum Einstein equations in four dimensions is given in terms of a singleaxisymmetric solution of the Laplace equation in three-dimensional flat space.Weyl's construction is generalized here to arbitrary dimension $D\ge 4$. Thegeneral solution of the D-dimensional vacuum Einstein equations that admits D-2orthogonal commuting non-null Killing vector fields is given either in terms ofD-3 independent axisymmetric solutions of Laplace's equation inthree-dimensional flat space or by D-4 independent solutions of Laplace'sequation in two-dimensional flat space. Explicit examples of new solutions aregiven. These include a five-dimensional asymptotically flat ``black ring'' withan event horizon of topology S^1 x S^2 held in equilibrium by a conicalsingularity in the form of a disc.
