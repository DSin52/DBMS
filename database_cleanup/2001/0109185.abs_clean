A recent analytic test of the instanton method performed by comparing theexact spectrum of the Lam${\acute e}$ potential (derived from representationsof a finite dimensional matrix expressed in terms of $su(2)$ generators) withthe results of the tight--binding and instanton approximations as well as thestandard WKB approximation is commented upon. It is pointed out that in thecase of the Lam${\acute e}$ potential as well as others the WKB--related methodof matched asymptotic expansions yields the exact instanton result as a resultof boundary conditions imposed on wave functions which are matched in domainsof overlap.
