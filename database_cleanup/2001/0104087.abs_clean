In this paper we study in detail the equivalence of the recently introducedBorn-Infeld self dual model to the Abelian Born-Infeld-Chern-Simons model in2+1 dimensions. We first apply the improved Batalin, Fradkin and Tyutin scheme,to embed the Born-Infeld Self dual model to a gauge system and show that theembedded model is equivalent to Abelian Born-Infeld-Chern-Simons theory. Next,using Buscher's duality procedure, we demonstrate this equivalence in acovariant Lagrangian formulation and also derive the mapping between then-point correlators of the (dual) field strength in Born-Infeld Chern-Simonstheory and of basic field in Born-Infeld Self dual model. Using thisequivalence, the bosonization of a massive Dirac theory with a non-polynomialThirring type current-current coupling, to leading order in (inverse) fermionmass is also discussed. We also re-derive it using a master Lagrangian.Finally, the operator equivalence between the fermionic current and (dual)field strength of Born-Infeld Chern-Simons theory is deduced at the level ofcorrelators and using this the current-current commutators are obtained.
