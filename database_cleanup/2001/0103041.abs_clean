We investigate bosonic sectors of supersymmetric field theories. We considersuperpotentials described by one and by two real scalar fields, and we show howthe equations of motion can be factorized into a family of first orderBogomol'nyi equations, so that all the topological defects are of theBogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield type. We examine explicit models, that engenderthe Z_N symmetry, and we identify all the topological sectors, illustratingtheir integrability.
