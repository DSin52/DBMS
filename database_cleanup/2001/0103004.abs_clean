Research Workshop, Kiev, September 2000We discuss geometrical aspects of different dualities in the integrablesystems of the Hitchin type and its various generalizations. It is shown that Tduality known in the string theory context is related to the separation ofvariables procedure in dynamical system. We argue that there are analogues of Sduality as well as mirror symmetry in the many-body systems of Hitchin type.The different approaches to the double elliptic systems are unified using thegeometry behind the Mukai-Odesskii algebra.
