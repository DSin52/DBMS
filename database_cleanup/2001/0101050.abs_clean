We discuss a general feature of Freund Rubin compactifications that waspreviously overlooked. It consist in a curious pairing, which we call a shadowrelation, of completely different (in terms of spin and mass) fields of thedimensionally reduced theory. Particularly interesting is the case where thecompactification preserves a certain amount of supersymmetry, giving rise to ashadowing phenomenon between whole supermultiplets of fields. In particular,there are strong suggestions about the consistency of a massive truncation of11D supergravity to the massless modes of the graviton supermultiplet plus themassive modes of its shadow partner. This fact has important consequences inthe ${\cal N}=2$ and ${\cal N}=3$ cases, which seem to realize respectively aHiggs or a superHiggs phenomenon. In other words, we are led to reinterpret thedimensionally reduced theory as a spontaneously broken phase of some higher(super)symmetric theory.
