We study anisotropic reheating (entropy production) on 3D brane from adecaying bulk scalar field in the brane-world picture of the Universe byconsidering off-diagonal metrics and anholonomic frames. We show that asignificant amount of, in general, anisotropic dark radiation is produced inthis process unless only the modes which satisfy a specific relation areexcited. We conclude that subsequent entropy production within the brane isrequired in general before primordial nucleosynthesis and that the presence ofoff-diagonal components (like in the Salam, Strathee and Petracci works) of thebulk metric modifies the processes of entropy production which couldsubstantially change the brane-world picture of the Universe.
