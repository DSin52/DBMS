A simple five-dimensional brane world model is proposed, motivated byM-theory compactified on a six-dimensional manifold of small radius and an$S^1/Z_2$ of large radius. We include a leading-order higher curvaturecorrection to the tree-level bulk action since in brane world scenarios thecurvature scale in the bulk may be comparable to the five-dimensional Planckscale and, thus, higher curvature corrections may become important. As atractable model of the bulk theory we consider pure gravity including a$(Ricci-scalar)^4$-correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action. In this modeltheory, after a conformal transformation to the Einstein frame, we numericallyobtain static solutions, each of which consists of a positive tension brane anda negative tension brane. For these solutions, we obtain two relations betweenthe warp factor and the brane tensions. The existence of these relationsimplies that, contrary to the original Randall-Sundrum model, the so calledradion is no longer a zero mode. We conclude that the tension of our braneshould be negative and that fine-tuning of the tension of both branes isnecessary for a large warp factor to explain the large hierarchy between thePlanck scale and the electroweak scale.
