Title: Quantum electrodynamics in the squeezed vacuum state

shiftAuthors: Volkmar Putz and Karl Svozil

Comments: 6 pages, minor corrections

Due to the nonvanishing average photon population of the squeezed vacuumstate, finite corrections to the scattering matrix are obtained. The lowestorder contribution to the electron mass shift for a one mode squeezed vacuumstate is given by $\delta m(\Omega, s)/m=\alpha (2/\pi)(\Omega/m)^2\sinh^2(s)$, where $\Omega$ and $s$ stand for the mode frequency and thesqueeze parameter and $\alpha$ for the fine structure constant, respectively.
