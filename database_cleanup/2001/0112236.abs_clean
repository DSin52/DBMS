We discuss various aspects of gauge theories realized on the world-volume ofwrapped branes. In particular we analyze the coupling of SYM operators tospace-time fields both in N=1 and N=2 models and give a description of thegluino condensate in the Maldacena-Nunez N=1 solution. We also explore theseven dimensional BPS equations relevant for these solutions and theirgeneralizations.
