Title: Boson-Fermion Confusion

Comments: 9 pages, Macros included. Contribution to ``30 Years of

Supersymmetry", University of MinnesotaJournal-ref: Nucl.Phys.Proc.Suppl. 101 (2001) 45-53

Reminiscences on the String origins of Supersymmetry are followed by adiscussion of the importance of confusing bosons with fermions in buildingsuperstring theories in 9+1 dimensions. In eleven dimensions, the kinshipbetween bosons and fermions is more subtle, and may involve the exceptionalgroup $F_4$.
