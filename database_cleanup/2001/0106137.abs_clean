The field-dependent invariant representation (the "dynamical" representation)of the Poincar\'e algebra is considered as a dynamical principle in order toget the corresponding "dynamical" electromagnetic coupling for higher spins($s\geq 1$). If in lower-spin ($s=0,1/2$) cases the "dynamical" coupling istaken to coincide with the minimal electromagnetic coupling the higher-spincoupling is inevitably non-minimal, containing a term linear in the fieldstrength tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$. This term leads to $g=2$.
