We propose a consistent string theory framework for embedding brane worldscenarios with infinite-volume extra dimensions. In this framework the StandardModel fields are localized on D3-branes sitting on top of an orientifold3-plane. The transverse 6-dimensional space is a non-compact orbifold or a moregeneral conifold. The 4-dimensional gravity on D3-branes is reproduced due tothe 4-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert term induced at the quantum level. Theorientifold 3-plane plays a crucial role, in particular, without it theD3-brane world-volume theories would be conformal due to the tadpolecancellation. We point out that in some cases the 4-dimensional Planck scale iscontrolled by the size of certain relevant (as opposed to marginal) orbifoldblow-ups. We can then have a scenario with the desirable 4-dimensional Planckscale, the string scale of order TeV, and the cross-over to 10-dimensionalgravity around the present Hubble size. We discuss some general features aswell as concrete models in this ``Orientiworld'' framework, including thosewith D7-branes. We point out that the D7-brane gauge symmetry at the quantumlevel becomes part of the 4-dimensional gauge symmetry. We present an N=1supersymmetric model with 3 chiral generations of quarks and leptons, where theoriginal gauge group (which contains an SU(6) subgroup) can be Higgsed toobtain a Pati-Salam model with 3 chiral generations, the Pati-Salam Higgsfields required to break the gauge group further to that of the Standard Model,as well as the desired electroweak Higgs doublets. The superpotential in thismodel is such that we have precisely one heavy (top-like) generation.
