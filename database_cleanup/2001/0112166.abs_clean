We show that standard Einstein gravity coupled to a free conformal fieldtheory (CFT) in Anti de Sitter space can undergo a Higgs phenomenon whereby thegraviton acquires a nonzero mass (and three extra polarizations). We show thatthe essential ingredients of this mechanism are the discreteness of the energyspectrum in AdS space, and unusual boundary conditions on the elementary fieldsof the CFT. These boundary conditions can be interpreted as implying theexistence of a 3-d defect CFT living at the boundary of the AdS space. Ourfree-field computation sheds light on the essential, model-independent featuresof AdS that give rise to massive gravity.
