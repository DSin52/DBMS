We develop the basis of the two dimensional generalized quantum statisticalsystems by using results on $r$-generalized Fibonacci sequences. According tothe spin value $s$ of the 2d-quasiparticles, we distinguish four classes of$\rho_M$ are given by the integer hierarchies of Fibonacci sequences. This is aremarkable result which envelopes naturally the Fermi and Bose statistics andmay be thought of as an alternative way to the Haldane interpolatingstatistical method.
