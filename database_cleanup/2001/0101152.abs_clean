Liouville field theory is considered with boundary conditions correspondingto a quantization of the classical Lobachevskiy plane (i.e. euclidean versionof $AdS_2$). We solve the bootstrap equations for the out-vacuum wave functionand find an infinite set of solutions. This solutions are in one to onecorrespondence with the degenerate representations of the Virasoro algebra.Consistency of these solutions is verified by both boundary and modularbootstrap techniques. Perturbative calculations lead to the conclusion thatonly the ``basic'' solution corresponding to the identity operator provides a``natural'' quantization of the Lobachevskiy plane.
