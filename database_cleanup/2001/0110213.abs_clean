We study the properties of an exact multi-membrane solution inseven-dimensional maximal SO(5)-gauged supergravity. Unlike previously knownmulti-centered solutions, the present one is asymptotically anti-de Sitter. Weshow that this multi-membrane configuration preserves only a quarter of thesupersymmetries. When lifted to eleven dimensions, this solution is interpretedas a set of open membranes ending on self-dual strings on a stack of M5-branes,in the near M5 limit.
