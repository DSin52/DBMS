Gauge symmetry breaking by boundary conditions on a manifold is known to beequivalent to Wilson-line breaking through a background gauge field, and istherefore spontaneous. These equivalent pictures are related by a non-periodicgauge transformation. However, we find that boundary condition gauge symmetrybreaking on orbifolds is explicit; there is no gauge where all the breaking canbe attributed to a background gauge field. In the case of a five-dimensionalSU(5) grand unified theory on S^1/Z_2, the vacuum with gauge symmetry broken tothere is no physical process which causes tunneling between the two. Thisallows a certain localized explicit breaking of SU(5) on one of the orbifoldfixed points in the theory with SU(5) breaking. Split multiplets on this fixedpoint are shown not to induce violations of unitarity in scattering amplitudes.
