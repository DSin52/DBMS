Title: BPS D3-branes on smooth ALE manifolds

Authors: Pietro Fre'

Comments: Talk given at the Conference "New Trends in Particle Physics",

September 2001, Yalta, UkrainaIn this talk I review the recent construction of a new family of classicalBPS solutions of type IIB supergravity describing 3-branes transverse to a6-dimensional space with topology $\mathbb{R}^{2}\times$ALE. They arecharacterized by a non-trivial flux of the supergravity 2-forms through thehomology 2-cycles of a generic smooth ALE manifold. These solutions have twoKilling spinors and thus preserve $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry. They areexpressed in terms of a quasi harmonic function $H$ (the ``warp factor''),whose properties was studied in detail in the case of the simplest ALE, namelythe Eguchi-Hanson manifold. The equation for $H$ was identified as an instanceof the confluent Heun equation.
