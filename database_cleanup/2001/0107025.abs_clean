Three types of thick branes, i.e., Poincar\'{e}, de Sitter and Anti-de Sitterbrane are considered. They are realized as the non-singular solutions of theEinstein equations with the non-trivial dilatons and the potentials. The scalarperturbations of these systems are also investigated. We find that theeffective potentials of the master equations of the scalar perturbations arepositive definite and consequently these systems are stable under the smallperturbations.
