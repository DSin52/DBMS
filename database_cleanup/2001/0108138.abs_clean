We perform a path-integral analysis of the string representation of the dualAbelian Higgs (DAH) model beyond the London limit, where the string describingthe vortex of a flux tube has a finite thickness. We show that besides anadditional vortex core contribution to the string tension, a modified Yukawainteraction appears as a boundary contribution in the type-II dualsuperconducting vacuum. In the London limit, the modified Yukawa interaction isreduced to the Yukawa one.
