The noncommutative string theory is described by embedding open string theoryin a constant second rank antisymmetric $B_{\mu\nu}$ field and thenoncommutative gauge theory is defined by a deformed $\star$ product. As acheck, study of various scattering amplitudes in both noncommutative string andnoncommutative gauge theory confirm that in the $\alpha^{'}\to 0$ limit, thenoncommutative string theoretic amplitude goes over to the noncommutative gaugetheoretic amplitude, and the couplings are related as$g_{YM}=G_0\sqrt{\frac{1}{2\alpha^{'}}}$. Furthermore we show that in thislimit there will not be any correction to the gauge theoretic action because ofabsence of massive modes. We get sin/cos factors in the scattering amplitudesdepending on the odd/even number of external photons.
