We consider a D-brane probe in unstable string background associated withflux branes. The twist in spacetime metric reponsible for the supersymmetrybreaking is shown to manifest itself in mixing of open Wilson lines with thephases of some adjoint matter fields, resulting in a nonlocal andnonsupersymmetric form of Yang-Mills theory as the probe dynamics. Thisprovides a setup where one can study fate of a large class of unstable closedstring theories that include as a limit type 0 theories and various orbifoldsof type II and type 0 theories. We discuss the limit of ${\bf C}/Z_n$ orbifoldin some detail and speculate on couplings with closed string tachyons.
