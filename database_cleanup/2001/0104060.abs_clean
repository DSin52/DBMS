We find that with uniform mesh, the numerical schemes derived from finiteelement method can keep a preserved symplectic structure in one-dimensionalcase and a preserved multisymplectic structure in two-dimentional case incertain discrete version respectively. These results are in fact the intrinsicreason that the numerical experiments indicate that such finite elementalgorithms are accurate in practice.
