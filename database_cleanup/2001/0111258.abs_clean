Topological field theories of Schwarz-type generally admit symmetries whosealgebra does not close off-shell, e.g. the basic symmetries of BF models orvector supersymmetry of the gauge-fixed action for Chern-Simons theory (thissymmetry being at the origin of the perturbative finiteness of the theory). Wepresent a detailed discussion of all these symmetries within the algebraicapproach to the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. Moreover, we discuss the generalalgebraic construction of topological models of both Schwarz- and Witten-type.
