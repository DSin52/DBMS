Title: Issues on Radiatively Induced Lorentz and CPT Violation in Quantum

ElectrodynamicsAuthors: W.F. Chen

Comments: 12 pages, Rinton-P10x7 LaTex style; A combined version of talks given

in PASCOS 2001 and MRST 2001Various ambiguous results on radiatively induced Lorentz and CPT violation inquantum electrodynamics with a modified fermionic sector are reviewed andpossible explanations for this ambiguity appearing in the literature arecommentated. Furthermore, joint between stringent limit from astrophysicalobservation and theoretical prediction on Lorenz and CPT violation isdiscussed.
