Gregory and Laflamme showed that certain nonextremal black strings (andp-branes) are unstable to linearized perturbations. It is widely believed thatthis instability will cause the black string horizon to classically pinch offand then quantum mechanically separate, resulting in higher dimensional blackholes. We argue that this cannot happen. Under very mild assumptions, classicalevent horizons cannot pinch off. Instead, they settle down to new static blackstring solutions which are not translationally invariant along the string.
