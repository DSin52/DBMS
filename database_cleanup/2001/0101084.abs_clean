Workshop of the Hellenic Society for the Study of High Energy Physics at theUniversity of Ioannina. References added, minor correctionsWe simulate a supersymmetric matrix model obtained from dimensional reductionof 4d SU(N) super Yang-Mills theory. The model is well defined for finite N andit is found that the large N limit obtained by keeping g^2 N fixed gives riseto well defined operators which represent string amplitudes. The space-timestructure which arises dynamically from the eigenvalues of the bosonic matricesis discussed, as well as the effect of supersymmetry on the dynamicalproperties of the model. Eguchi-Kawai equivalence of this model to ordinarygauge theory does hold within a finite range of scale. We report on newsimulations of the bosonic model for N up to 768 that confirm this property,which comes as a surprise since no quenching or twist is introduced.
