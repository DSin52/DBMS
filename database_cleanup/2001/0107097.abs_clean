We have constructed a bulk & brane action of IIA theory which describes apair of BPS domain walls on S_1/Z_2, with strings attached. The walls are givenby two orientifold O8-planes with coincident D8-branes and `F1-D0'-strings arestretched between the walls. This static configuration satisfies all matchingconditions for the string and domain wall sources and has 1/4 of unbrokensupersymmetry.
