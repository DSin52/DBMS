We consider the brane universe in the bulk background of the chargedtopological AdS black holes. The evolution of the brane universe is describedby the Friedmann equations for a flat or an open FRW-universe containingradiation and stiff matter. We find that the temperature and entropy of thedual CFT are simply expressed in terms of the Hubble parameter and its timederivative, and the Friedmann equations coincide with thermodynamic formulas ofthe dual CFT at the moment when the brane crosses the black hole horizon. Weobtain the generalized Cardy-Verlinde formula for the CFT with an R-charge, forany values of the curvature parameter k in the Friedmann equations.
