We discuss an N=2 quantum mechanics with or without a central charge. Arepresentation is constructed with the number of bosonic degrees of freedomless that one half of the fermionic degrees of freedom. We suggest a systematicmethod of reducing the bosonic degrees of freedom called ``dynamicalreduction."Our consideration opens a problem of a general classification of nonstandardrepresentations of N=2$ superalgebra.
