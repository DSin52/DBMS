One of the central points of the ekpyrotic cosmological scenario based onHorava-Witten theory is that we live on a negative tension brane. However, thetension of the visible brane is positive in the usual HW phenomenology withstronger coupling on the hidden brane, both for standard and non-standardembedding. To make ekpyrotic scenario realistic one must solve the problem ofthe negative cosmological constant on the visible brane and fine-tune the bulkbrane potential with an accuracy of $10^{-50}$. In terms of a canonicallynormalized scalar field $\phi$ describing the position of the brane, thispotential must take a very unusual form $V(\phi)\sim e^{-{5000 \phi\overM_p}}$. We describe the problems which appear when one attempts to obtain thispotential in string theory. The mechanism for the generation of densityperturbations in this scenario is not brane-specific; it is a particularlimiting case of the mechanism of tachyonic preheating. Unlike inflation, thismechanism exponentially amplifies not only quantum fluctuations, but alsoinitial inhomogeneities. As a result, to solve the homogeneity problem in thisscenario, one would need the branes to be parallel to each other with anaccuracy better than $10^{-60}$ on a scale $10^{30}$ times greater than thedistance between the branes. Thus, at present, inflation remains the onlyrobust mechanism that produces density perturbations with a flat spectrum andsimultaneously solves all major cosmological problems.
