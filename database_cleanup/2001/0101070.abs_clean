We consider the reduced, quenched version of a generalized Yang-Mills actionin 4k-dimensional spacetime. This is a new kind of matrix theory which ismapped through the Weyl-Wigner-Moyal correspondence into a field theory over anon-commutative phase space. We show that the ``classical'' limit of this fieldtheory is encoded into the effective action of an open, (4k-1)-dimensional,bulk brane enclosed by a dynamical, Chern-Simons type, (4k-2)-dimensional,boundary brane. The bulk action is a pure volume term, while the boundaryaction carries all the dynamical degrees of freedom.
