Pelster, H.J. Schmidt and M. Bachmann, (World Scientific, Singapore 2000)We suggest a simple modification of the usual procedures of analysis for thehigh-temperature (strong-coupling or hopping-parameter) expansions of therenormalized four-point coupling constant in the fourdimensional phi^4 latticescalar field theory. As a result we can more convincingly validate numericallythe triviality of the continuum limit taken from the high temperature phase.
