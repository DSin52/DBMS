Title: A Varying-alpha Brane World Cosmology

Comments: 12 pages, LaTeX, reference added

We study the brane world cosmology in the RS2 model where the electric chargevaries with time in the manner described by the varying fine-structure constanttheory of Bekenstein. We map such varying electric charge cosmology to the dualvariable-speed-of-light cosmology by changing system of units. We comment oncosmological implications for such cosmological models.
