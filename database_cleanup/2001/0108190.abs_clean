We show how a radiation dominated universe subject to space-time quantizationmay give rise to inflation as the radiation temperature exceeds the Plancktemperature. We consider dispersion relations with a maximal momentum (i.e. amimimum Compton wavelength, or quantum of space), noting that some of theselead to a trans-Planckian branch where energy increases with decreasingmomenta. This feature translates into negative radiation pressure and, inwell-defined circumstances, into an inflationary equation of state. We thusrealize the inflationary scenario without the aid of an inflaton field. As theradiation cools down below the Planck temperature, inflation gracefully exitsinto a standard Big Bang universe, dispensing with a period of reheating.Thermal fluctuations in the radiation bath will in this case generate curvaturefluctuations on cosmological scales whose amplitude and spectrum can be tunedto agree with observations.
