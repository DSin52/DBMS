We analyze the unitarity of a non-relativistic non-commutative scalar fieldtheory. We show that electric backgrounds spoil unitarity while magnetic onesdo not. Furthermore, unlike its relativistic counterparts, unitarity can not berestored (at least at the level of one-to-one scattering amplitude) by addingnew states to the theory. This is a signal that the model cannot be embedded ina natural way in string theory.
