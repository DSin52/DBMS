We consider Yang-Mills theory in Euclidean space time R4 and construct itsconfiguration space. The orbits are first shown to form a congruence set. Thenwe show that in spite of the fact that there can be no orthogonal gauge in thenon-Abelian theory, the submanifolds defined by the non-linear gauge previouslyproposed by the author are shown to foliate the configuration space. This wasaccomplished by making use of the form version of Frobenius theorem.
