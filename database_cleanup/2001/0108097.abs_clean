Quantum Yang-Mills theory can be rewritten in terms of gauge-invariant`aether' term. The BF gravity based on the gauge group SU(N) is actually atheory of high spin fields (up to J=N) with high local symmetry mixing upfields with different spins -- like in supergravity but without fermions. At Ngoing to infinity one gets a theory with an infinite tower of spins related bylocal symmetry, similar to what one has in string theory. We, thus, outline away to derive string theory from a local Yang-Mills theory in the large Nlimit.
