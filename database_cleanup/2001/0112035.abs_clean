We study supersymmetric vortex solutions in three-dimensional abelian gaugedsupergravity. First, we construct the general U(1)-gauged D=3, N=2 supergravitywhose scalar sector is an arbitrary Kahler manifold with U(1) isometry. Thisconstruction clarifies the connection between local supersymmetry and thespecific forms of some scalar potentials previously found in the literature --in particular, it provides the locally supersymmetric embedding of the abelianChern-Simons Higgs model. We show that the Killing spinor equations admitrotationally symmetric vortex solutions with asymptotically conical geometrywhich preserve half of the supersymmetry.
