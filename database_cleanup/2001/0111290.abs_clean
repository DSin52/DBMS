We further analyze a recent perturbative two-loop calculation of theexpectation value of two axi-symmetric circular Maldacena-Wilson loops in N=4gauge theory. Firstly, it is demonstrated how to adapt the previous calculationof anti-symmetrically oriented circles to the symmetric case. By shrinking oneof the circles to zero size we then explicitly work out the first few terms ofthe local operator expansion of the loop. Our calculations explicitlydemonstrate that circular Maldacena-Wilson loops are non-BPS observablesprecisely due to the appearance of unprotected local operators. The latterreceive anomalous scaling dimensions from non-ladder diagrams. Finally, wepresent new insights into a recent conjecture claiming that coincident circularMaldacena-Wilson loops are described by a Gaussian matrix model. We report on anovel, supporting two-loop test, but also explain and illustrate why theexisting arguments in favor of the conjecture are flawed.
