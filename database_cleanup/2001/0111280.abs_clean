We report a simplification in the large N matrix mechanics of light-conematrix field theories. The absence of pure creation or pure annihilation termsin the Hamiltonian formulation of these theories allows us to find theirreduced large N Hamiltonians as explicit functions of the generators of theCuntz algebra. This opens up a free-algebraic playground of new reduced modelswhose eigenvalue problems are surprisingly simple. The basic tool we developfor the study of these models is the infinite dimensional algebra of allnormal-ordered products of Cuntz operators, and this algebra also leads us to aspecial number-conserving subset of these models, each of which exhibits aninfinite number of new hidden conserved quantities at large N.
