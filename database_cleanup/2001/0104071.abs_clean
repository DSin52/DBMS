It is argued that many non-extremal black branes exhibit a classicalGregory-Laflamme instability if, and only if, they are locallythermodynamically unstable. For some black branes, the Gregory-Laflammeinstability must therefore disappear near extremality. For the black $p$-branesof the type II supergravity theories, the Gregory-Laflamme instabilitydisappears near extremality for $p=1,2,4$ but persists all the way down toextremality for $p=5,6$ (the black D3-brane is not covered by the analysis ofthis paper). This implies that the instability also vanishes for thenear-extremal black M2 and M5-brane solutions.
