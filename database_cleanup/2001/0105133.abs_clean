Title: Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking, Non-minimal Coupling, and Cosmological

Constant ProblemAuthors: Je-An Gu and W-Y. P. Hwang

Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX

Treating the gravitational field as a dynamical field, we study thespontaneous symmetry breaking induced by a scalar field under itsself-interaction and non-minimal interaction with gravity in four dimensionalspace-time. In particular, we explore the feasibility of inducing spontaneoussymmetry breaking after introducing the non-minimal coupling, and discussbriefly the cosmological constant problem corresponding to the phase transitionassociated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking.
