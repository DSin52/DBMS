The partition function of QCD is analyzed for an arbitrary number of flavors,N_f, and arbitrary quark masses including the contributions from alltopological sectors in the Leutwyler--Smilga regime. For given N_f andarbitrary vacuum angle, \theta, the partition function can be reduced to N_f-2angular integrations of single Bessel functions. For two and three flavors, the\theta dependence of the QCD vacuum is studied in detail. For N_f= 2 and 3, thechiral condensate decreases monotonically as \theta increases from zero to \piand the chiral condensate develops a cusp at \theta=\pi for degenerate quarkmasses in the macroscopic limit. We find a discontinuity at \theta=\pi in thefirst derivative of the energy density with respect to \theta for degeneratequark masses. This corresponds to the first--order phase transition in which CPis spontaneously broken, known as Dashen's phenomena.
