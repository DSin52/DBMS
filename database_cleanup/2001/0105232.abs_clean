One of the most intriguing aspects of Chern-Simons-type topological models isthe fractional statistics of point particles which has been shown essential forour understanding of the fractional quantum Hall effects. Furthermore theseideas are applied to the study of high Tc superconductivity. We present here anrecently proposed model for fractional spin with the Pauli term. On the otherhand, in D=4 space-time, a Schwarz-type topological gauge theory withantisymmetric tensor gauge field, namely BF model, is reviewed. Antisymmetrictensor fields are conjectured as mediator of string interaction. A dimensionalreduction of the previous model provides a (2+1) dimensional topologicaltheory, which involves a 2-form B and a 0-form $\phi$. Some recent results onthis model are reported. Recently, there have been thoughts of generalizingunusual statistics to extended objects in others space-time dimensions, and inparticular to the case of strings in four dimensions. In this context,discussions about fractional spin and antisymmetric tensor field are presented.
