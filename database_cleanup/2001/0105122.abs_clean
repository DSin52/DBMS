approximations made. No essential changes in resultsA variant of an earlier proposal by the author and SenGupta, to describe fourdimensional Maxwell electrodynamics in Einstein-Cartan spacetimes through aKalb-Ramond field as an intermediary, is shown to lead to a newMaxwell-Kalb-Ramond coupling that violates spatial parity, even when the KRgauge field has its standard parity assignment. One consequence of thiscoupling seems to be a modulation, independent of wavelength but dependent onthe KR field strength, of the intensity of synchrotron radiation observed fromdistant galactic sources.
