d5 higher derivative gravity on the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) black holebackground is considered. Two horizons SdS BHs are not in thermal equilibriumand Hawking-Page phase transitions are not expected there, unlike to the caseof AdS BHs. It is demonstrated that there exists the regime of d5 theory whereNariai BH which is extremal limit of SdS BH is stable. It is in the contrastwith Einstein gravity on such backgroundwhere only pure de Sitter space isalways stable. Speculating on the applications in proposed dS/CFTcorrespondence, these two (de Sitter and Nariai) stable spaces may correspondto confining-deconfining phases in dual CFT.
