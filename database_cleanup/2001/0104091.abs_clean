We show that the renormalized U(N) noncommutative Chern-Simons theory can bedefined in perturbation theory so that there are no loop corrections to the 1PIfunctional of the theory in an arbitrary homogeneous axial (time-like,light-like or space-like) gauge. We define the free propagators of the fieldsof the theory by using the Leibbrandt-Mandelstam prescription --which allowsWick rotation and is consistent with power-counting-- and regularize its Greenfunctions with the help of a family of regulators which explicitly preserve theinfinitesimal vector Grassmann symmetry of the theory. We also show that inperturbation theory the nonvanishing Green functions of the elementary fieldsof the theory are products of the free propagators.
