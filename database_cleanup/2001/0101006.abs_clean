We compute the quark-antiquark potential employing the continuum action forQCD-like random lattice strings proposed by Siegel. The model leads to apotential similar to those obtained from Nambu-Goto string theory but has somemodifications which we interpret as velocity dependent contributions. We alsopropose to add extra terms in the action which lead to physically interestingpropagators for partons for the infrared region.
