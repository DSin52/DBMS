Title: Quantum Energies of Solitons

Comments: 6 pages LaTeX with ws-p8-50x6-00.cls (included). To appear in the

proceedings of the 6th workshop on non-perturbative QCD, Paris, June 2001For renormalizable models a method is presented to unambiguously compute theenergy that is carried by localized field configurations (solitons). Avariational approach for the total energy is utilized to search for solitonconfigurations. As an example a 1+1 dimensional model is considered. Thequantum energy of configurations that are translationally invariant for asubset of coordinates is discussed.
