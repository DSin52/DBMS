We consider the isotropic two-dimensional abelian sandpile model from aperspective based on two-dimensional (conformal) field theory. We computelattice correlation functions for various cluster variables (at and offcriticality), from which we infer the field-theoretic description in thescaling limit. We find a perfect agreement with the predictions of a c=-2conformal field theory and its massive perturbation, thereby providing directevidence for conformal invariance and more generally for a description in termsof a local field theory. The question of the height 2 variable is alsoaddressed, with however no definite conclusion yet.
