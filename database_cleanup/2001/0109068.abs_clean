Title: Topological Solitons from DeConstructed Extra Dimensions

Authors: Christopher T. Hill

Comments: A few minor corrections are implemented. The Chern-Simons charge of

the monopole is consistent with Goldstone and Wilczek's fractional fermionnumberJournal-ref: Phys.Rev.Lett. 88 (2002) 041601

A topological monopole-like field configuration exists for Yang-Mills gaugefields in a 4+1 dimensions. When the extra dimension is compactified to 3+1dimensions with periodic lattice boundary conditions, these objects reappear inthe low energy effective theory as a novel solution, a gauged-bosonic Skyrmion.When the low energy theory spontaneously breaks, the Nambu-Goldstone modedevelops a VEV, and the gauged-bosonic Skyrmion morphs into a `tHooft--Polyakov monopole.
