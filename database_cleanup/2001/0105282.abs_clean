We study the creation of massless scalar particles from the quantum vacuumdue to the dynamical Casimir effect by spherical shell with oscillating radius.In the case of a small amplitude of the oscillation, to solve the infinite setof coupled differential equations for the instantaneous basis expansioncoefficients we use the method based on the time-dependent perturbation theoryof the quantum mechanics. To the first order of the amplitude we derive theexpressions for the number of the created particles for both parametricresonance and non-resonance cases.
