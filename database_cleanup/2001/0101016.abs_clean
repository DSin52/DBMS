We discuss the supergravity couplings of noncommutative D-branes byconsidering the disk amplitudes with one closed string insertion. The resultconfirms a recent proposal for the general form of the noncommutativeYang-Mills operators coupling to the massless closed string modes. Theconstruction involves smearing Yang-Mills field variables along an open Wilsonline. For multiple D-branes interacting with background supergravity fields,this prescription reduces, in the B=0 limit, to the ``symmetrized trace''prescription, and the supergravity fields are seen to be functionals of thenonabelian scalar fields on the branes.
