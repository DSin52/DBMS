We show that generically the initial singularity is isotropic in spatiallyhomogeneous cosmological models in the brane-world scenario. We then argue thatit is plausible that the initial singularity is isotropic in typical braneworld cosmological models. Therefore, brane cosmology naturally gives rise to aset of initial data that provide the conditions for inflation to subsequentlytake place, thereby solving the initial conditions problem and leading to aself--consistent and viable cosmology.
