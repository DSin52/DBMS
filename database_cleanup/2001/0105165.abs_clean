We numerically construct static and spherically symmetric electricallycharged black hole solutions in Einstein-Born-Infeld gravity with massivedilaton. The numerical solutions show that the dilaton potential allows manymore black hole causal structures than the massless dilaton. We find thatdepending on the black hole mass and charge and the dilaton mass the blackholes can have either one, two, or three horizons. The extremal solutions arealso found out. As an interesting peculiarity we note that there are extremalblack holes with an inner horizon and with triply degenerated horizon.
