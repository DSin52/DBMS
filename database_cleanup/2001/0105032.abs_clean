We demonstrate that the initial conditions for inflation are met when D5 and\bar{D}5 branes annihilate. This scenario uses Sen's conjecture that aco-dimension two vortex forms on the worldvolume of the annihilated 5-branesystem. Analogous to a "Big Bang", when the five branes annihilate, a vortexlocalized on a 3-brane forms and its false vacuum energy generates aninflationy space-time. We also provide a natural mechanism for ending inflationvia the motion of the vortex in the bulk due to its extrinsic curvature. Wealso suggest a consistent way to end inflation and localize matter on ourspace-time.
