We investigate the limit of minimal model conformal field theories where thecentral charge approaches one. We conjecture that this limit is described by anon-rational CFT of central charge one. The limiting theory is different fromthe free boson but bears some resemblance to Liouville theory. Explicitexpressions for the three point functions of bulk fields are presented, as wellas a set of conformal boundary states. We provide analytic and numericalarguments in support of the claim that this data forms a consistent CFT.
