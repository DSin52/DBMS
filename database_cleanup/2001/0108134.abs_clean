This is a short guide to some uses of the zeta-function regularizationprocedure as a a basic mathematical tool for quantum field theory in curvedspace-time (as is the case of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio models), in quantum gravitymodels (in different dimensions), and also in cosmology, where it appears e.g.in the calculation of possible `contributions' to the cosmological constantcoming through manifestations of the vacuum energy density. Part of thisresearch was carried out in fruitful and enjoyable collaboration with peoplefrom Tomsk State Pedagogical University.
