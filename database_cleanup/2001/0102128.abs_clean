We construct four-dimensional domain wall solutions of N=2 gaugedsupergravity coupled to vector and to hypermultiplets. The gauged supergravitytheories that we consider are obtained by performing two types of Abeliangauging. In both cases we find that the behaviour of the scalar fieldsbelonging to the vector multiplets is governed by the so-called attractorequations known from the study of BPS black hole solutions in ungauged N=2supergravity theories. The scalar fields belonging to the hypermultiplets, onthe other hand, are either constant or exhibit a run-away behaviour. Thesedomain wall solutions preserve 1/2 of supersymmetry and they are, in general,curved. We briefly comment on the amount of supersymmetry preserved by domainwall solutions in gauged supergravity theories obtained by more generalgaugings.
