An integrable structure behind Witten--Dijkgraaf--Verlinde--Verlinde (WDVV)equations is identified with reduction of a Riemann-Hilbert problem for ahomogeneous GL(N, C) loop group. Reduction requires the dressing matrices to befixed points of a loop group automorphism of order two resulting in asub-hierarchy of gl(N,C) hierarchy containing only odd symmetry flows. Themodel possesses Virasoro symmetry and imposing Virasoro constraints ensureshomogeneity property of the Darboux-Egoroff structure. Dressing matrices of thereduced model provide solutions of the WDVV equations.
