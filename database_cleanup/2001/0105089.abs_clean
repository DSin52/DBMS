We show that the matrix formulation of non-commutative field theories isequivalent, in the continuum, to a formulation in a mixedconfiguration-momentum space. In this formulation, the non-locality of theinteractions, that leads to the IR/UV mixing, becomes transparent. We clarifythe relation between long range effects (and IR divergences) and thenon-planarity of the corresponding Feynman diagrams.
