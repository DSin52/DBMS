Comments: 15 pp., latex, aipproc

In these two lectures, delivered at the XXXVII Karpacz Winter School,February 2001, I review some applications of superspace in various topicsrelated to string theory and M-theory. The first lecture is mainly devoted todescriptions of brane dynamics formulated in supergravity backgrounds. Thesecond lecture concerns the use of superspace techniques for determiningconsistent interactions in supersymmetric gauge theory and supergravity, e.g.alpha'-corrections from string/M-theory.
