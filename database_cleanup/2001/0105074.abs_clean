Title: Instability of breathers in the topological discrete sine-Gordon system

Authors: J.M. Speight

Comments: 7 pages

It is demonstrated that the breather solutions recently discovered in theweakly coupled topological discrete sine-Gordon system are spectrally unstable.This is in contrast with more conventional spatially discrete systems, whosebreathers are always spectrally stable at sufficiently weak coupling.
