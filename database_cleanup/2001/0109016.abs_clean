Title: Large N planar or bare vertex approximation and critical behavior of a

SU(N) invariant four-fermion model in 2+1 dimensionsComments: 19 pp. 7 figs (REVTeX). Revised version with extended discussion and

additional refsA four-fermion model in 2+1 dimensions describing N Dirac fermionsinteracting via SU(N) invariant N^2-1 four-fermion interactions is solved inthe leading order of the 1/N expansion. The 1/N expansion corresponds to 'tHoofts topological 1/N expansion in which planar Feynman diagrams prevail. Forthe symmetric phase of this model, it is argued that the planar expansioncorresponds to the ladder approximation. A truncated set of Schwinger-Dysonequations for the fermion propagator and composite boson propagatorrepresenting the relevant planar diagrams is solved analytically. The criticalfour-fermion coupling and various critical exponents are determined asfunctions of N. The universality class of this model turns out to be quitedistinct from the Gross-Neveu model in the large N limit.
