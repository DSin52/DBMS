We establish T-duality between NS5 branes stuck on an orientifold 8-plane intype I' and an orientifold construction in type IIB with D7 branes intersectingat angles. Two applications are discussed. For one we obtain new braneconstructions, realizing field theories with gauge group a product ofsymplectic factors, giving rise to a large new class of conformal N=1 theoriesembedded in string theory. Second, by studying a D2 brane probe in the type I'background, we get some information on the still elusive (0,4) linear sigmamodel describing a perturbative heterotic string on an ADE singularity.
