QCD(1+1) in the limit of a large number of flavours N_F and a large number ofcolours N_C is examined in the small N_F/N_C regime. Using perturbation theoryin N_F/N_C, stringent results for the leading behaviour of the spectrumdeparting from N_F/N_C = 0 are obtained. These results provide benchmarks inthe light of which previous truncated treatments of QCD(1+1) at large N_F andN_C are critically reconsidered.
