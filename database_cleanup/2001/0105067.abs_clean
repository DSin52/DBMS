A model considered in the paper generalizes membrane theory to the case ofdelocalized membranes. The model admits covariant formulation, which involvesno constraints. It generalizes the notion of membrane to the case of smoothdistribution of non-intersecting membranes. A generalization of p-branesolution with delocalized membranes is presented.
