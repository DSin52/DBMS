Title: BF Theory On A Brane

Comments: 11 pages, Latex, no figures

An alternative approach to introducing gravitational dynamics on a braneembedded in a higher dimensional spacetime is presented. The brane is treatedas a boundary of a higher dimensional manifold in which the bulk action isdescribed by a metric independent topological quantum field theory. The exampleof a five dimensional non-Abelian BF theory with a boundary brane isconsidered. A natural boundary condition is adopted chosen for consistency ofthe topological action despite the presence of a boundary. The resultingeffective action on the brane is the action of general relativity in firstorder form plus terms involving the extrinsic curvature of the brane.
