We give an explicit quantum super field construction of the N=2 super CasimirWA(n)-algebras, which is obtained from supersymmetric Miura transformation forthe Lie superalgebra A(n,n-1). And also we give an extension of this algebraincluding a super vertex operator which depends on simple root system ofA(n,n-1).
