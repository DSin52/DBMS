The commutation relations of the composite fields are studied in the 3, 2 and1 space dimensions. It is shown that the field of an atom consisting of anucleus and an electron fields satisfies, in the space-like asymptotic limit,the canonical commutation relations within the sub-Fock-space of the atom. Thefield-particle duality in the bound state is discussed from the statisticspoint of view. Then, the commutation relations of the scalar object in theSchwinger(Thirring) model are mentioned briefly and are shown consistent withits interpretation as the Nambu-Goldstone boson.The composite anyon fields are shown to satisfy the proper anyoniccommutation relations with the additive phase exponents. Then, quasiparticlepicture of the anyons is clarified under the restriction of this additibity.The difference between field and particle aspects becomes more prominent in the2 space dimension. It is argued that the hierarchy of the fractional quantumHall effect is rather simply understood by utilizing the quasiparticlecharactors of the anyons when the background-boson gauge is assumed. Incontrast to it, the coposite fermion theories are critically reviewed
