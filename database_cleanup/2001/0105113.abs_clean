We investigate the dynamics of dilatonic D-dimensional 0-branes in thedilaton gravity and nonlinear sigma model. Using asymptotic symmetries, dualityrelations, and sigma model techniques we find that the theory has threeconformal points which correspond to (a) the asymptotic (Anti-de Sitter) regionof the two-dimensional spacetime, (b) the horizon of the black hole, and (c)the infinite limit of the coupling parameter. We show that the conformalsymmetry is perturbatively preserved at one-loop, identify the correspondingconformal field theories, and calculate the associated central charges.Finally, we use the conformal field theories to explain the thermodynamicalproperties of the two-dimensional black holes.
