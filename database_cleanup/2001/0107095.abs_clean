Title: Gauge-fixing Independence of Test Fields in Yang-Mills Theories

Authors: Sergio M. Iguri and Francisco D. Mazzitelli

Comments: 9 pages, Latex, no figures

We derive a generalized Nielsen identity for the case of Yang-Mills theoriesthat include some classical fields. We discuss under which circumstances theeffective action of the classical fields (i.e., after integration of quantumfields) becomes gauge fixing independent. We conclude that classical testfields provide a physical insight into the problem of the gauge-fixingdependence of the quantum effective action.
