We elucidate the properties of a gas of free closed bosonic strings inthermal equilibrium. Our starting point is the intensive generating functionalof connected one-loop closed vacuum string graphs given by the Polyakov pathintegral. Invariance of the path integral under modular transformations gives athermal duality invariant expression for the free energy of free closed stringsat finite temperature. The free bosonic string gas exhibits a self-dualKosterlitz-Thouless phase transition. The thermodynamic potentials of the gasof free bosonic closed strings are shown to exhibit an infinite hierarchy ofthermal self-duality relations.
