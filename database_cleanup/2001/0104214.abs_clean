Title: An Exact Solution to a Three Dimensional Ising Model and Dimensional

ReductionsAuthors: Z. Nussinov

A high temperature expansion is employed to map some complex anisotropicnonhermitian three and four dimensional Ising models with algebraic long rangeinteractions into a solvable two dimensional variant. We also address thedimensional reductions for anisotropic two dimensional XY and other models. Forthe latter and related systems it is possible to have an effective reduction inthe dimension without the need of compactifying some dimensions. Some solutionsare presented. This framework further allows for some very simple generalobservations. It will be seen that the absence of a ``phase interference''effect plays an important role in high dimensional problems. A very forbiddingpurely algebraic recursive series solution to the three dimensional nearestneighbor Ising model will be given. In the aftermath, the full-blown threedimensional nearest neighbor Ising model is exactly mapped onto a single spin1/2 particle with nontrivial dynamics. All this allows for a formal highdimensional Bosonization.
