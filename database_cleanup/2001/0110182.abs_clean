Title: How to deal with the arrow of time in quantum field theory

Comments: 16 pages, Latex, Talk delivered at the XXIV International Workshop on

Fundamental Problems of High Energy Physics and Field Theory, Protvino, JuneThe formalism of Quantum Mechanics is based by definition on conservingprobabilities and thus there is no room for the description of dissipativesystems in Quantum Mechanics. The treatment of time-irreversible evolution (thearrow of time) is therefore ruled out by definition in Quantum Mechanics. InQuantum Field Theory it is, however, possible to describe time-irreversibleevolution by resorting to the existence of infinitely many unitarilyinequivalent representations of the canonical commutation relations (ccr). Inthis paper I review such a result by discussing the canonical quantization ofthe damped harmonic oscillator (dho), a prototype of dissipative systems. Theirreversibility of time evolution is expressed as tunneling among the unitarilyinequivalent representations. The exact action for the dho is derived in thepath integral formalism of the quantum Brownian motion developed by Schwingerand by Feynman and Vernon. The doubling of the phase-space degrees of freedomfor dissipative systems is related to quantum noise effects. Finally, the roleof dissipation in the quantum model of the brain and the occurrence that thecosmological arrow of time, the thermodynamical one and the biological onepoint into the same direction are shortly mentioned.
