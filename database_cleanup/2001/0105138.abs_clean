We present an extended study of our previous work on an alternativefive-dimensional N=2 supergravity theory that has a single antisymmetric tensorand a dilaton as a part of supergravity multiplet. The new fields are naturalNeveu-Schwarz massless fields in superstring theory. Our total mattermultiplets include n copies of vector multiplets forming the sigma-model cosetspace SO(n,1) / SO(n), and n' copies of hypermultiplets forming thequaternionic K\"ahler manifold Sp(n',1) / Sp(n') X Sp(1). We complete thecouplings of matter multiplets to supergravity with the gauged group of thetype SO(2) X Sp(n') X Sp(1) X H X [ U(1) ]^{n-p+1} for an arbitrary gauge groupH with p = dim H + 1, and the isotropy group Sp(n') X Sp(1) of the cosetSp(n',1) / Sp(n') X Sp(1) formed by the hypermultiplets. We also describe thegeneralization to singular 5D space-time as in the conventional formulation
