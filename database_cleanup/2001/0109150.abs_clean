We investigate the relation between the algebraic construction of boundarystates in AdS_3 and the target space analysis of D-branes and show theconsistency of the two descriptions. We compute, in the semiclassical regime,the overlap of a localized closed string state with boundary states andidentify the latter with D-branes wrapping conjugacy classes in AdS_3. Thestring partition function on the disk is shown to reproduce the spacetime DBIaction. Other consistency checks are performed. We also comment on the role ofthe spectral flow symmetry of the underlying SL(2,R)/U(1) coset model inconstructing D-branes that correspond to degenerate representations of SL(2,R).
