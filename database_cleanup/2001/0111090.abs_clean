We study the spectrum of the confining strings in four-dimensional SU(N)gauge theories. We compute, for the SU(4) and SU(6) gauge theories formulatedon a lattice, the string tensions sigma_k related to sources with Z_N charge k,using Monte Carlo simulations. Our results are consistent with the sine formulasigma_k/sigma = sin k pi/N / sin pi/N for the ratio between sigma_k and thestandard string tension sigma.For the SU(4) and SU(6) cases the accuracy is approximately 1% and 2%,respectively. The sine formula is known to emerge in various realizations ofsupersymmetric SU(N) gauge theories. On the other hand, our results showdeviations from Casimir scaling. We also discuss an analogous behaviorexhibited by two-dimensional SU(N) x SU(N) chiral models.
