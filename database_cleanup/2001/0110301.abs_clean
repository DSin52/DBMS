The N_c to infinity limit of a matrix quantum field theory is equivalent tosumming only planar Feynman diagrams. The possibility of interpreting this sumas some kind world-sheet theory has been in the air ever since 't Hooft'soriginal paper. We establish here just such a world sheet description for ascalar quantum field with interaction term g\Tr\phi^3, and we indicate how theapproach might be extended to more general field theories.
