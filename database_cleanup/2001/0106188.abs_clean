Noncommutative versions of theories with a gauge freedom define (when theyexist) consistent deformations of their commutative counterparts. Generalaspects of Seiberg-Witten maps are discussed from this point of view. Inparticular, the existence of the Seiberg-Witten maps for various noncommutativetheories is related to known cohomological theorems on the rigidity of thegauge symmetries of the commutative versions. In technical terms, theSeiberg-Witten maps define canonical transformations in the antibracket thatmake the solutions of the master equation for the commutative andnoncommutative versions coincide in their antifield-dependent terms. As anillustration, the on-shell reducible noncommutative Freedman-Townsend theory isconsidered.
