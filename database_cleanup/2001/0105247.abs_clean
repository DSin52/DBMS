Title: Some computation on g Function and Disc Partition Function and Boundary

String Field TheoryAuthors: A. Fujii, H. Itoyama

Comments: 9 pages, references added

Quadratic tachyon profile has been discussed in the boundary string fieldtheory. We here compute the g-function by factorizing the cylinder amplitude.The answer is compared with the disc partition function. The boundary state isconstructed. We extend these computations to those of the boundary sine-Gordonmodel at the free fermion point.
