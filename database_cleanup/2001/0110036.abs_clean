In previous work we considered M-theory five branes wrapped on ellipticCalabi-Yau threefold near the smooth part of the discriminant curve. In thispaper, we extend that work to compute the light states on the worldvolume offive-branes wrapped on fibers near certain singular loci of the discriminant.We regulate the singular behavior near these loci by deforming the discriminantcurve and expressing the singularity in terms of knots and their associatedbraids. There braids allow us to compute the appropriate string junctionlattice for the singularity and,hence to determine the spectrum of light BPSstates. We find that these techniques are valid near singular points with N=2supersymmetry.
