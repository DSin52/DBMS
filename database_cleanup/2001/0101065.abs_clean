The geometric models of N=4 supersymmetric mechanics with$(2d.2d)_{\DC}$-dimensional phase space are proposed, which can be viewed asone-dimensional counterparts of two-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric sigma-modelsby Alvarez-Gaum\'e and Freedman. The related construction of supersymmetricmechanics whose phase space is a K\"ahler supermanifold is considered. Also,its relation with antisymplectic geometry is discussed.
