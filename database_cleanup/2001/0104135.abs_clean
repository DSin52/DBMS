Phase-space and its relativistic extension is a natural space for realizingSp(2,R) symmetry through canonical transformations. On a Dx2 dimensionalcovariant phase-space, we formulate noncommutative field theories, whereSp(2,R) plays a role as either a global or a gauge symmetry group. In bothcases these field theories have potential applications, including certainaspects of string theories, M-theory, as well as quantum field theories. Ifinterpreted as living in lower dimensions, these theories realize Poincare'symmetry linearly in a way consistent with causality and unitarity. In caseSp(2,R) is a gauge symmetry, we show that the spacetime signature is determineddynamically as (D-2,2). The resulting noncommutative Sp(2,R) gauge theory isfield dynamics contains all known results of `two-time physics', including thereduction of physical spacetime from D to (D-2) dimensions, with the associated`holography' and `duality' properties. In particular, we show that the solutionspace of classical noncommutative field equations put all massless scalar,gauge, gravitational, and higher-spin fields in (D-2) dimensions onequal-footing, reminiscent of string excitations at zero and infinite tensionlimits.
