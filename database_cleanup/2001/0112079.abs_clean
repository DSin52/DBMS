We continue our study of codimension two solutions of warped space-timevarying compactifications of string theory. In this letter we discuss anon-supersymmetric solution of the classical type IIB string theory with deSitter gravity on a codimension two uncompactified part of spacetime. Anon-zero positive value of the cosmological constant is induced by the presenceof non-trivial stringy moduli, such as the axion-dilaton system for the typeIIB string theory. Furthermore, the naked singularity of the codimension twosolution is resolved by the presence of a small but non-zero cosmologicalconstant.
