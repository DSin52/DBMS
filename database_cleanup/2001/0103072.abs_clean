We have used a two-dimensional analog of the Hadamard state-condition tostudy the local constraints on the two-point function of a linear quantum fieldconformally coupled to a two-dimensional gravitational background. We develop adynamical model in which the determination of the state of the quantum field isessentially related to the determination of a conformal frame. A particularconformal frame is then introduced in which a two-dimensional gravitationalequation is established.
