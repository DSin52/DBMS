We investigate the W-algebras generated by the integer dimension chiralprimary operators of the SU(2)_0 WZNW model. These have a form almost identicalto that found in the c=-2 model but have, in addition, an extended Kac-Moodystructure. Moreover on Hamiltonian reduction these SU(2)_0 W-algebras exactlyreduce to those found in c=-2. We explicitly find the free fieldrepresentations for the chiral j=2 and j=3 operators which have respectively afermionic doublet and bosonic triplet nature. The correlation functions ofthese operators accounts for the rational solutions of theKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation that we find. We explicitly compute the fullalgebra of the j=2 operators and find that the associativity of the algebra isonly guaranteed if certain null vectors decouple from the theory. We conjecturethat these algebras may produce a quasi-rational conformal field theory.
