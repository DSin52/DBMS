We consider the CPT anomaly of two-dimensional chiral U(1) gauge theory on atorus with topologically nontrivial zweibeins corresponding to the presence ofspacetime torsion. The resulting chiral determinant can be expressed in termsof the standard chiral determinant without torsion, but with modified spinorboundary conditions. This implies that the two-dimensional CPT anomaly can bemoved from one spin structure to another by choosing appropriate zweibeins.Similar results apply to higher-dimensional chiral gauge theories.
