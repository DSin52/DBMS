We analyze the expansion of the fuzzy sphere non-commutative product inpowers of the non-commutativity parameter. To analyze this expansion we developa graphical technique that uses spin networks. This technique is potentiallyinteresting in its own right as introducing spin networks of Penrose intonon-commutative geometry. Our analysis leads to a clarification of the linkbetween the fuzzy sphere non-commutative product and the usual deformationquantization of the sphere in terms of the star-product.
