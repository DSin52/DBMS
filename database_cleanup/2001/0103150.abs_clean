We study electric-magnetic duality rotations for noncommutativeelectromagnetism (NCEM). We express NCEM as a nonlinear commutative U(1) gaugetheory and show that it is self-dual when the noncommutativity parameter \thetais light-like (e.g. \theta^{0i}=\theta^{1i}). This implies, in the slowlyvarying field approximation, self-duality of NCEM to all orders in \theta.
