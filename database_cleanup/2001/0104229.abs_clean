We study soliton solutions in scalar field theory with a variety of unboundedpotentials. A subset of these potentials have Gaussian lump solutions and theirfluctuation spectrum is governed by the harmonic oscillator problem. Theselumps are unstable with one tachyonic mode. Soliton solutions in several otherclasses of potentials are stable and are of kink type. The problem of thestability of these solutions is related to a supersymmetric quantum mechanicsproblem. The fluctuation spectrum is not equispaced and does not contain anytachyonic mode. The lowest energy mode is the massless Goldstone mode whichrestores broken translation invariance.
