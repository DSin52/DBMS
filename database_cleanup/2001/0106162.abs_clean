Recently, a new example of a complete non-compact Ricci-flat metric of G_2holonomy was constructed, which has an asymptotically locally conical structureat infinity with a circular direction whose radius stabilises. In this paper wefind a regular harmonic 3-form in this metric, which we then use in order toobtain an explicit solution for a fractional D2-brane configuration. Byperforming a T-duality transformation on the stabilised circle, we obtain thetype IIB description of the fractional brane, which now corresponds to D3-branewith one of its world-volume directions wrapped around the circle.
