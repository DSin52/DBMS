We present a simple four-dimensional model in which anomaly mediatedsupersymmetry breaking naturally dominates. The central ingredient is that thehidden sector is near a strongly-coupled infrared fixed-point for severaldecades of energy below the Planck scale. Strong renormalization effects thensequester the hidden sector from the visible sector. Supersymmetry is brokendynamically and requires no small input parameters. The model provides anatural and economical explanation of the hierarchy between thesupersymmetry-breaking scale and the Planck scale, while allowing anomalymediation to address the phenomenological challenges posed by weak scalesupersymmetry. In particular, flavor-changing neutral currents are naturallynear their experimental limits.
