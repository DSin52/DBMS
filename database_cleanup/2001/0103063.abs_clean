The Moyal-Lax representation and the Moyal momentum algebra are introducedand systematically investigated. It is shown that the Moyal-Lax equation can beinterpreted as a Hamiltonian equation and can be derived from an action. Weshow that the parameter of non-commutativity, in this case, is related to thecentral charge of the second Hamiltonian structure of the system. The Moyal-Laxdescription leads in a natural manner to the dispersionless limit and providesthe second Hamiltonian structure of dispersionless integrable models, which hasbeen an open question for sometime.
