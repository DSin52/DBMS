We describe a class of asymptotically AdS scalar field spacetimes, andcalculate the associated conserved charges for three, four and five spacetimedimensions using the conformal and counter-term prescriptions. The energyassociated with the solutions in each case is proportional to $\sqrt{M^2 -k^2}$, where $M$ is a constant and $k$ is a scalar charge. In five spacetimedimensions, the counter-term prescription gives an additional vacuum (Casimir)energy, which agrees with that found in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence.solution $M=k$ equals the energy of pure AdS. This result is discussed in lightof the AdS/CFT conjecture.
