We extend the Vecchia-Veneziano-Witten (VVW) model of QCD in the chiral limitand for large colour number $N_c$, by introducing an effective dilaton-gluoncoupling from which we derive both the axion and dilaton potentials.Furthermore, using a string inspired model, we determine a new interquarkpotential as a perturbative series in terms of the interquark distance $r$. Ourpotential goes beyond Dick one obtained in [8] and shares the same features asthe Bian-Huang-Shen potential $V_{BHS}$ which depends only on odd powers of $r$[22].
