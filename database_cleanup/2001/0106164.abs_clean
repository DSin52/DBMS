Title: Classical string propagation in gravitational fields

Authors: H. K. Jassal (HRI, Allahabad, India) and A. Mukherjee (Univ. of Delhi,

India)Comments: 13 pages, Revtex, To appear in the Indian Journal of Physics (special

75th anniversary issue on High Energy Physics). Minor changes and morereferences addedThe motion of a string in curved spacetime is discussed in detail. The basicformalism for string motion in Minkowski spacetime and in curved spacetime ispresented. The description applies to cosmic strings as well as to fundamentalstrings. Major ansatze for solving the string equations of motion are reviewed.In particular, the ``null string ansatz'', which is relevant to strings instrong gravitational fields, is emphasised. The formalism is applied to themotion of strings in 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein black hole backgrounds withelectric and magnetic charge. Such background spacetimes have been of interestlately, particularly from the point of view of fundamental string theory. It isshown that interesting results, relating to the extra dimension as seen by thestring, are obtained even at the classical level.
