We construct a new class of scalar noncommutative multi-solitons on anarbitrary Kahler manifold by using Berezin's geometric approach to quantizationand its generalization to deformation quantization. We analyze the stabilitycondition which arises from the leading 1/hbar correction to the soliton energyand for homogeneous Kahler manifolds obtain that the stable solitons are givenin terms of generalized coherent states. We apply this general formalism to anumber of examples, which include the sphere, hyperbolic plane, torus andgeneral symmetric bounded domains. As a general feature we notice that onhomogeneous manifolds of positive curvature, solitons tend to attract eachother, while if the curvature is negative they will repel each other.Applications of these results are discussed.
