This paper investigates the non-commutative version of the Abelian Higgsmodel at the one loop level. We find that the BRST invariance of the theory ismaintained at this order in perturbation theory, rendering the theory one-looprenormalizable. Upon removing the gauge field from the theory we also obtain aconsistent continuum renormalization of the broken O(2) linear sigma model,contradicting results found in the literature. The beta functions for thevarious couplings of the gauged U(1) theory are presented, as are the divergentcontributions to every one particle irreducible (1PI) function. We find thatall physical couplings and masses are gauge independent. A brief discussionconcerning the symmetries $P$, $C$, and $T$ in this theory is also given.
