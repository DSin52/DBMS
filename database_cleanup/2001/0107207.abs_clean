We clarify the relation between the Dixmier-Douady class on the space of selfadjoint Fredholm operators (`universal B-field') and the curvature ofdeterminant bundles over infinite-dimensional Grassmannians. In particular, inthe case of Dirac type operators on a three dimensional compact manifold weobtain a simple and explicit expression for both forms.
