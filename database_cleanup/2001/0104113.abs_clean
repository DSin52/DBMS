We construct the Weyl multiplets of N=2 conformal supergravity in fivedimensions. We show that there exist two different versions of the Weylmultiplet, which contain the same gauge fields but differ in the matter fieldlinearized level we obtain the transformation rules for the Dilaton Weylmultiplet by coupling it to the multiplet of currents corresponding to anon-shell vector multiplet. We construct the full non-linear transformationrules for both multiplets by gauging the D=5 superconformal algebra F^2(4). Weshow that the Dilaton Weyl multiplet can also be obtained by solving theequations of motion for an improved vector multiplet coupled to the StandardWeyl multiplet.
