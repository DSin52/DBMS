In this work we prove in a precise way that the soldering formalism can beapplied to the Srivastava chiral boson (SCB), in contradiction with someresults appearing in the literature. We have promoted a canonicaltransformation that shows directly that the SCB is composed of twoFloreanini-Jackiw's particles with the same chirality which spectrum is avacuum-like one. As another conflictive result we have proved that aWess-Zumino term used in the literature consists of the scalar field, onceagain denying the assertion that the WZ term adds a new degree of freedom tothe SCB theory in order to modify the physics of the system.
