We discuss the asymptotic dynamical evolution of spatially homogeneousbrane-world cosmological models close to the initial singularity. We find thatgenerically the cosmological singularity is isotropic in Bianchi type IXbrane-world models and consequently these models do not exhibit Mixmaster orchaotic-like behaviour close to the initial singularity. We argue that this istypical of more general cosmological models in the brane-world scenario. Inparticular, we show that an isotropic singularity is a past-attractor in allorthogonal Bianchi models and is a local past-attractor in a class ofinhomogeneous brane-world models.
