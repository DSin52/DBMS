The interaction of an electron with a polar molecule is shown to be thesimplest realization of a quantum anomaly in a physical system. The existenceof a critical dipole moment for electron capture and formation of anions, whichhas been confirmed experimentally and numerically, is derived. This phenomenonis a manifestation of the anomaly associated with quantum symmetry breaking ofthe classical scale invariance exhibited by the point-dipole interaction.Finally, analysis of symmetry breaking for this system is implemented withinsubject to explicit symmetry breaking.
