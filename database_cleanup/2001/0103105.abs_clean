The purpose of this article is to initiate a study of a class of Lorentzinvariant, yet tractable, Lagrangian Field Theories which may be viewed as anextension of the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian to many scalar fields in a novelmanner. These Lagrangians are quadratic in the Jacobians of the participatingfields with respect to the base space co-ordinates. In the case of two fields,real valued solutions of the equations of motion are found and a phenomenonreminiscent of instanton behaviour is uncovered; an ansatz for a subsidiaryequation which implies a solution of the full equations yields real solutionsin three-dimensional Euclidean space. Each of these is associated with aspherical harmonic function.
