We propose a closed string tachyon action including kinetic and potentialterms for non-supersymmetric orbifolds. The action is given in terms ofsolutions to $tt^*$ equations which captures the geometry of vacua of thecorresponding N=2 worldsheet theory. In certain cases the solutions are wellstudied. In case of tachyons of ${\bf C}/Z_n$, solutions to affine todaequations determine the action. We study the particular case of ${\bf C}/Z_3\to{\bf C}$ in detail and find that the Tachyon action is determined in terms of asolution to Painleve III equation.
