Title: A Canonical Hamiltonian Derivation of Hawking Radiation

Authors: Kirill Melnikov, Marvin Weinstein

Comments: 5 pages, revtex

We present a derivation of Hawking radiation based on canonical quantizationof a massless scalar field in the background of a Schwarzschild black holeusing Lemaitre coordinates and show that in these coordinates the Hamiltonianof the massless field is time-dependent. This result exhibits the non-staticnature of the problem and shows it is better to talk about the time dependenceof physical quantities rather than the existence of a time-independent vacuumstate for the massless field. We then demonstrate the existence of Hawkingradiation and show that despite the fact that the flux looks thermal to anoutside observer, the time evolution of the massless field is unitary.
