We consider a brane universe in a Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter backgroundspacetime of arbitrary dimensionality. It is shown that the brane evolution isdescribed by generalized Friedmann equations for radiative matter along with astiff-matter contribution. On the basis of the (conjectured) dS/CFTcorrespondence, we identify various thermodynamic properties of the brane. Itis then demonstrated that, when the brane crosses the de Sitter cosmologicalhorizon, the CFT thermodynamics and Friedmann-like equations coincide.Moreover, the CFT entropy is shown to be expressible in a generalizedCardy-Verlinde form. Finally, we consider the holographic entropy bounds inthis scenario.
