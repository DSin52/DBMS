We study supersymmetric charged rotating black holes in AdS$_5$, and showthat closed timelike curves occur outside the event horizon. Also upon liftingto rotating D3 brane solutions of type IIB supergravity in ten dimensions,closed timelike curves are still present. We believe that these causalanomalies correspond to loss of unitarity in the dual ${\cal N}=4$, D=4 superYang-Mills theory, i.e. the chronology protection conjecture in the AdS bulk isrelated to unitarity bounds in the boundary CFT. We show that no charged oruncharged geodesic can penetrate the horizon, so that the exterior region isgeodesically complete. These results still hold true in the quantum case,i.~e.~the total absorption cross section for Klein-Gordon scalars propagatingin the black hole background is zero. This suggests that the effectivetemperature is zero instead of assuming the naively found imaginary value.
