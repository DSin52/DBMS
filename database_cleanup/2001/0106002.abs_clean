Title: Boundary String Field Theory Approach to High-Temperature Tachyon

PotentialAuthors: Wung-Hong Huang

Comments: 20 pages, add discussions about boundary action

The boundary string field theory approach is used to evaluate the one-looptachyon potential. We first discuss the boundary condition at the twoboundaries on annulus diagram and then the exact form of corrected potentialsat zero and high temperature are obtained. The profile of the tachyon potentialis found to be temperature independent and tachyon will condense at hightemperature. Our investigations also provide an easy way to prove theuniversality of the tachyon potential, even if the string is in the thermalbackground.
