We study a bound state of fractional D3/D7-branes in the ten-dimensionalspace R^{1,5}*R^{4}/Z_2 using the boundary state formalism. We construct theboundary actions for this system and show that higher order terms in thetwisted fields are needed in order to satisfy the zero-force condition. We thenfind the classical background associated to the bound state and show that thegauge theory living on a probe fractional D3-brane correctly reproduces theperturbative behavior of a four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric gauge theorywith fundamental matter.
