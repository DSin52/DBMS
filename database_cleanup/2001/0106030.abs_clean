We give a simple proof of why there is a Matrix theory approximation for amembrane shaped like an arbitrary Riemann surface. As corollaries, we show thatnoncompact membranes cannot be approximated by matrices and that the Poissonalgebra on any compact phase space is U(infinity). The matrix approximationdoes not appear to work properly in theories such as IIB string theory orbosonic membrane theory where there is no conserved 3-form charge to which themembranes couple.
