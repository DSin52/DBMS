These brief notes record our puzzles and findings surrounding Givental'srecent conjecture which expresses higher genus Gromov-Witten invariants interms of the genus-0 data. We limit our considerations to the case of aprojective line, whose Gromov-Witten invariants are well-known and easy tocompute. We make some simple checks supporting his conjecture.
