Henri Poincar\'e Title change. New presentation. SeeThe Complex Angular Momentum (CAM) representation of (scalar) four-pointfunctions has been previously established starting from the general principlesof local relativistic Quantum Field Theory (QFT). Here, we carry out thediagonalization of the general $t$-channel Bethe--Salpeter (BS) structure offour point functions in the corresponding CAM variable $\lambda_{t},$ for allnegative values of the squared-energy variable $t$. This diagonalization isclosely related to the existence of BS-equations for the absorptive parts inthe crossed channels, interpreted as convolution equations with spectralproperties. The production of Regge poles equipped with factorized residuesinvolving Euclidean three-point functions appears as conceptually built-in inthe analytic axiomatic framework of QFT. The existence of leading Reggeon termsgoverning the asymptotic behaviour of the four-point function at fixed $t$ isstrictly conditioned by the asymptotic behaviour of a global Bethe-Salpeterkernel of the theory.
