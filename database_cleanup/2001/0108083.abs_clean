Title: Ward Identities and Renormalization of General Gauge Theories

Authors: Dan Radu Grigore

Comments: 38 pages, LATEX2E

We introduce the concept of general gauge theory which includes Yang-Millsmodels. In the framework of the causal approach and show that the anomalies canappear only in the vacuum sector of the identities obtained from the gaugeinvariance condition by applying derivatives with respect to the basic fields.Then we provide a general result about the absence of anomalies in higherorders of perturbation theory. This result reduces the renormalizability proofto the study of lower orders of perturbation theory. For the Yang-Mills modelone can perform this computation explicitly and obtains its renormalizabilityin all orders.
