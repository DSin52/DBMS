In a previous work, we computed the fully off-shell effective action $\Gamma$and the corresponding quantum-corrected supersymmetry (SUSY) transformationoperator $\delta_\epsilon$ for the so-called source-probe configuration inMatrix theory at one loop at order 4 in the derivative expansion, and showedthat they satisfy the SUSY Ward identity $\delta_\epsilon \Gamma=0$. In thisarticle, starting from the most general form of $\Gamma$, we demonstrate that,conversely, given such $\delta_\epsilon$ the SUSY Ward identity determines$\Gamma$ uniquely to the order specified above. Our demonstration does notrequire the explicit knowledge of the quantum-corrected supersymmetrytransformation and hence strongly suggests that the uniqueness property wouldpersist to all orders in perturbation theory.
