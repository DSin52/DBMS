We show the existence of non-threshold bound states of (p, q) string networksand D3-branes, preserving 1/4 of the full type IIB supersymmetry, interpretedas string networks dissolved in D3-branes. We also write down the expressionfor the mass density of the system and discuss the extension of theconstruction to other Dp-branes. Differences in our construction of stringnetworks with the ones interpreted as dyons in N=4 gauge theories are alsopointed out.
