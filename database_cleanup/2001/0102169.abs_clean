We derive the central charge and BPS equations from the low-energy effectiveaction for N=2 SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in the Coulomb phase, using asystematic, canonical procedure. We then obtain solutions for monopole and dyonBPS states, whose core structure is described by a dual Lagrangian containingthe monopole or dyon as a fundamental field. Spherically symmetric statespossess a shell of charge at a characteristic radius.
