We investigate the charged Schwarzschild-Anti-deSitter (SAdS) BHthermodynamics in 5d Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with electromagnetic field.The Hawking-Page phase transitions between SAdS BH and pure AdS space arestudied. The corresponding phase diagrams (with critical line defined by GBterm coefficient and electric charge) are drawn. The possibility to account forhigher derivative Maxwell terms is mentioned.In frames of proposed dS/CFT correspondence it is demonstrated that branegravity maybe localized similarly to AdS/CFT.SdS BH thermodynamics in 5d Einstein and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity isconsidered. The corresponding (complicated) surface counterterms are found andused to get the conserved BH mass, free energy and entropy. The interestingfeature of of higher derivative gravity is the possibility for negative (orzero) SdS (or SAdS) BH entropy which depends on the parameters of higherderivative terms. We speculate that the appearence of negative entropy mayindicate a new type instability where a transition between SdS (SAdS) BH withnegative entropy to SAdS (SdS) BH with positive entropy would occur.
