We review four basic examples where string theory and/or field theorydualities predict the existence of soliton bound-states. These include theexistence of threshold bound-states of D0 branes required by IIA/M duality andthe closely-related bound-states of instantons in the maximally supersymmetricfive dimensional gauge theory. In the IIB theory we discuss (p,q)-strings asbound-states of D and F strings, as well as the corresponding bound-states ofmonopoles and dyons in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory whose existence waspredicted by Sen. In particular we consider the L^2-index theory relevant forcounting these states. In each case we show that the bulk contribution to theindex can be evaluated by relating it to an instanton effect in thecorresponding theory with a compact Euclidean time dimension. The boundarycontribution to the index can be determined by considering the asymptoticregions of the relevant moduli space.
