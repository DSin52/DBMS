We study the effect of noncommutativity of space on the physics of a quantuminterferometer located in a rotating disk in a gauge field background. To thisend, we develop a path-integral approach which allows defining an effectiveaction from which relevant physical quantities can be computed as in the usualcommutative case. For the specific case of a constant magnetic field, we areable to compute, exactly, the noncommutative Lagrangian and the associatedshift on the interference pattern for any value of $\theta$.
