It is shown that the $F_4$ rational and trigonometric integrable systems areexactly-solvable for {\it arbitrary} values of the coupling constants. Theirspectra are found explicitly while eigenfunctions by pure algebraic means. Forboth systems new variables are introduced in which the Hamiltonian has analgebraic form being also (block)-triangular. These variables are invariantwith respect to the Weyl group of $F_4$ root system and can be obtained byaveraging over an orbit of the Weyl group. Alternative way of finding thesevariables exploiting a property of duality of the $F_4$ model is presented. Itis demonstrated that in these variables the Hamiltonian of each model can beexpressed as a quadratic polynomial in the generators of someinfinite-dimensional Lie algebra of differential operators in afinite-dimensional representation. Both Hamiltonians preserve the same flag ofpolynomials and each subspace of the flag coincides with the finite-dimensionalrepresentation space of this algebra. Quasi-exactly-solvable generalization ofthe rational $F_4$ model depending on two continuous and one discreteparameters is found.
