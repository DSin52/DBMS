We introduce a novel decomposition of the four dimensional SU(2) gauge field.This decomposition realizes explicitely a symmetry between electric andmagnetic variables, suggesting a duality picture between the correspondingphases. It also indicates that at large distances the Yang-Mills theoryinvolves a three component unit vector field, a massive Lorentz vector field,and a neutral scalar field that condenses which yields the mass scale. Ourresults are consistent with the proposal that the physical spectrum of thetheory contains confining strings which are tied into stable knotted solitons.
