Over the past decade there has been an increasing interest in the study ofblack holes, and related objects, in higher (and lower) dimensions, motivatedto a large extent by developments in string theory. The aim of the presentpaper is to obtain higher dimensional analogues of some well known results forblack holes in 3+1 dimensions. More precisely, we obtain extensions to higherdimensions of Hawking's black hole topology theorem for asymptotically flat($\Lambda=0$) black hole spacetimes, and Gibbons' and Woolgar's genusdependent, lower entropy bound for topological black holes in asymptoticallylocally anti-de Sitter ($\Lambda<0$) spacetimes. In higher dimensions the genusis replaced by the so-called $\sigma$-constant, or Yamabe invariant, which is afundamental topological invariant of smooth compact manifolds.
