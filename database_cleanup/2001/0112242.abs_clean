We review the implementation, in a temporal-gauge formulation of QCD, of thenon-Abelian Gauss's law and the construction of gauge-invariant gauge andmatter fields. We then express the QCD Hamiltonian in terms of thesegauge-invariant operator-valued fields, and discuss the relation of thisHamiltonian and the gauge-invariant fields to the corresponding quantities in aCoulomb gauge formulation of QCD. We argue that a representation of QCD interms of gauge-invariant quantities could be particularly useful forunderstanding low-energy phenomenology. We present the results of aninvestigation into the topological properties of the gauge-invariant fields,and show that there are Gribov copies of these gauge-invariant gauge fields,which are constructed in the temporal gauge, even though the conditions thatgive rise to Gribov copies do not obtain for the gauge-dependent temporal-gaugefields.
