A treatment of linearized gravity with the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet interactionterms in $D\geq$ 5 is given in the Randall-Sundrum brane background. ThisLetter has outlined some interesting features of the brane world gravity andNewtonian potential correction with the GB interaction term. We find that theGB coupling $\alpha$ renormalizes the effective four-dimensional Newtonconstant on the brane, and also additionally contributes to the correction termof the Newtonian potential. Indeed, the GB term does not affect the masslessgraviton mode and the Einstein gravity on the brane, and quite interestingly,such term in $D\geq 5$ appears to give more information about the necessaryboundary condition(s) to be satisfied by the zero mode wavefunction on thebrane(s). small (and preferably positive) GB coupling $\alpha$.
