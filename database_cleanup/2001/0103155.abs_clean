We construct new explicit metrics on complete non-compact Riemannian8-manifolds with holonomy Spin(7). One manifold, which we denote by A_8, istopologically R^8 and another, which we denote by B_8, is the bundle ofchiral spinors over $S^4$. Unlike the previously-known complete non-compactmetric of Spin(7) holonomy, which was also defined on the bundle of chiralnear infinity they approach a circle bundle with fibres of constant length overa cone whose base is the squashed Einstein metric on CP^3. We construct thecovariantly-constant spinor and calibrating 4-form. We also obtain anL^2-normalisable harmonic 4-form for the A_8 manifold, and two such4-forms (of opposite dualities) for the B_8 manifold. We use the metrics toconstruct new supersymmetric brane solutions in M-theory and string theory. Inparticular, we construct resolved fractional M2-branes involving the use of theL^2 harmonic 4-forms, and show that for each manifold there is asupersymmetric example. An intriguing feature of the new A_8 and B_8Spin(7) metrics is that they are actually the same local solution, withthe two different complete manifolds corresponding to taking the radialcoordinate to be either positive or negative. We make a comparison with theTaub-NUT and Taub-BOLT metrics, which by contrast do not have special holonomy.In an appendix we construct the general solution of our first-order equationsfor Spin(7) holonomy, and obtain further regular metrics that are complete onmanifolds B^+_8 and B^-_8 similar to B_8.
