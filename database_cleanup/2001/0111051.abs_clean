We study closed string tachyon condensation using the RG flow of theworldsheet theory. In many cases the worldsheet theory enjoys N=2supersymmetry, which provides analytic control over the flow, due tonon-renormalization theorems. Moreover, Mirror symmetry sheds light on the RGflow in such cases.We discuss the relevant tachyon condensation in the context of both compactand non-compact situations which lead to very different conclusions.Furthermore, the tachyon condensation leads to non-trivial dualities fornon-supersymmetric probe theories.
