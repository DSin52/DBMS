We propose the exact boundary S matrix for breathers of the N=2supersymmetric sine-Gordon model. We argue that this S matrix has threeindependent parameters, in agreement with a recently-proposed action. We alsoshow, contrary to a previous claim, that the ``universal'' supersymmetricboundary S matrix commutes with two supersymmetry charges. General N=2supersymmetric boundary integrable models are expected to have boundary Smatrices with a similar structure.
