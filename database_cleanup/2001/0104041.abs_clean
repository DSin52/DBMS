We explore the effects of non-abelian dynamics of D-branes on their stabilityand introduce Hitchin-like modifications to previously-known stabilityconditions. The relation to brane-antibrane systems is used in order to rewritethe equations in terms of superconnections and arrive at deformed vortexequations.
