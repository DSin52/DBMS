We show that the topological massive BF theories can be written as a pure BFterm through field redefinitions. The fields are rewritten as power expansionseries in the inverse of the mass parameter $m$. We also give a cohomologicaljustification of this expansion through BRST framework. In this approach the BFterm can be seen as a topological generator for massive BF theories.
