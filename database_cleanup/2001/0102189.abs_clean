Abelian and nonabelian gauge invariant states are directly compared torevisit how the unconfined abelian theory is expressed. It is argued that theYang-Mills equations have no obvious physical content apart from their relationto underlying physical states. The main observation is that the physical statesof electrostatics can be regarded as point charges connected by a uniformsuperposition of all possible Faraday lines. These states are gauge invariantonly in the abelian case.
