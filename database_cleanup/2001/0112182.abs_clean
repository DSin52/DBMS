We examine the causality and degrees of freedom (DoF) problems encountered bycharged, gravitating, massive higher spin fields. For spin s=3/2, making themetric dynamical yields improved causality bounds. These involve only the mass,the product eM_P of the charge and Planck mass and the cosmological constant\Lambda. The bounds are themselves related to a gauge invariance of thetimelike component of the field equation at the onset of acausality. Whilepropagation is causal in arbitrary E/M backgrounds, the allowed mass ranges ofparameters are of Planck order. Generically, interacting spins s>3/2 aresubject to DoF violations as well as to acausality; the former must be overcomebefore analysis of the latter can even begin. Here we review both difficultiesfor charged s=2 and show that while a g-factor of 1/2 solves the DoF problem,acausality persists for any g. Separately we establish that no s=2 theory --DoFpreserving or otherwise -- can be tree unitary.
