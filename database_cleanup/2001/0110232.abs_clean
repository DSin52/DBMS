We present the construction of exactly solvable superconformal field theoriesdescribing Type II string models compactified on compact G_2 manifolds. Thesemodels are defined by anti-holomorphic quotients of the form (CY*S^1)/Z_2,where we realize the Calabi-Yau as a Gepner model. In the superconformal fieldtheory the Z_2 acts as charge conjugation implying that the representationtheory of a W(2,4,6,8,10) algebra plays an important role in the constructionof these models. Intriguingly, in all three examples we study, including thequintic, the massless spectrum in the Z_2 twisted sector of the superconformalfield theory differs from what one expects from the supergravity computation.This discrepancy is explained by the presence of a discrete NS-NS backgroundtwo-form flux in the Gepner model.
