A lattice regularization of the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model is studiedby using Ginsparg-Wilson operators. We recognize a certain conflict between thelattice chiral symmetry and the Majorana condition for Yukawa couplings, or inWeyl representation a conflict between the lattice chiral symmetry and Yukawacouplings. This conflict is also related, though not directly, to the fact thatthe kinetic (K\"{a}hler) term and the superpotential term are clearlydistinguished in the continuum Wess-Zumino model, whereas these two terms aremixed in the Ginsparg-Wilson operators. We illustrate a case where latticechiral symmetry together with naive Bose-Fermi symmetry is imposed bypreserving a SUSY-like symmetry in the free part of the Lagrangian; one-looplevel non-renormalization of the superpotential is then maintained for finitelattice spacing, though the finite parts of wave function renormalizationdeviate from the supersymmetric value. All these properties hold for thegeneral Ginsparg-Wilson algebra independently of the detailed construction oflattice Dirac operators.
