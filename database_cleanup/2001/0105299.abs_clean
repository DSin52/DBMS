We propose a vacuum condensate of mass dimension 2 consisting of gluons andghosts in the framework of the manifestly covariant gauge fixing of the SU(N)Yang-Mills theory. This quantity is both BRST and anti-BRST invariant for anygauge. It includes the ghost condensation $C^a \bar{C}^a$ proposed first in themodified Maximal Abelian gauge and reduces to the gluon condensates$(\mathscr{A}_\mu)^2$ of mass dimension 2 proposed recently in the Landau gaugeof the Lorentz gauge fixing. The vacuum condensate of dimensions 2 can providethe effective mass for gluons and ghosts. The possible existence of suchcondensations is demonstrated by calculating the operator product expansion ofthe gluon and ghost propagators in both gauges. Its implications to quarkconfinement are also discussed in consistent with the previous works.
