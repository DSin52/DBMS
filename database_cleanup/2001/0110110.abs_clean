thesis (dated September 2000) is atversion, discussion updated to reflect revised results of Khalil et alJournal-ref: Nucl.Phys. B623 (2002) 73-96; Erratum-ibid. B629 (2002) 493

We consider the stabilization of string moduli and resulting softsupersymmetry-breaking terms in heterotic string orbifolds. Among the resultsintegrating out the hidden sector gaugino condensate, which reduce to standardexpressions in the usual "truncated" limit; an expression for the modulartransformation of A-terms; a study of the minima of the scalar potential in theKaehler modulus direction; and a discussion of the implications for CPviolation phenomenology.Some closely related results have appeared in a recent paper of Khalil,Lebedev and Morris, namely the exact modular invariance of A-terms up tounitary mixing, and the existence of certain complex minima for the moduli.
