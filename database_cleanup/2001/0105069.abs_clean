Title: Note on Quantum Diffeomorphism Invariance, Physical States and Unitarity

Comments: Latex file, 12 pages

Recently, using a local action satisfying the Wess-Zumino condition as akinetic term of the conformal mode, we formulated a four-dimensional quantumgeometry (4DQG). The conformal mode can be treated exactly, and it was shownthat the part of the effective action related to this mode is given by thescale-invariant non-local Riegert action. As for the traceless mode, weintroduce dimensionless coupling, which is a unique gravitational coupling ofthis theory satisfying the conditions of renormalizability and asymptoticfreedom. Although this theory is asymptotically free, the physical states arenon-trivial, which should be described as composite fields, like the spectrumof 2DQG. The possibility that the physical state conditions representingbackground-metric independence conceal ghosts is pointed out. The usualgraviton state would be realized when the physical state condition breaks downdynamically.
