In this paper we display a direct and physically attractive derivation of thescreening contribution to the interaction potential in the Chiral Schwingermodel and generalized Maxwell-Chern-Simons gauge theory. It is shown that theseresults emerge naturally when a correct separation between gauge-invariant andgauge degrees of freedom is made. Explicit expressions for gauge-invariantfields are found.
