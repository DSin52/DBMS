Recently a brane world perspective on the cosmological constant and thehierarchy problems was presented. Here, we elaborate on some aspects of thatparticular scenario and discuss the stability of the stationary brane solutionand the dynamics of a probe brane. Even though the brane is unstable under asmall perturbation from its stationary position, such instability is harmlesswhen the 4-D cosmological constant is very small, as is the case of ouruniverse. One may also introduce radion stabilizing potentials in a morerealistic scenario.
