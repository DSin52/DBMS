Title: Gravity on $AdS_3$ and flat connections in the boundary CFT

Comments: 35 pages, harvmac, references added

We consider the CFT that arises from the D1-D5 system in the presence of aconstant background gauge potential which couples to the R-charge of theBy the AdS/CFT correspondence, the effect of this connnection should beobtained by finding a smooth solution to the vector field in AdS space whichcouples to the constant mode of the R-current in the CFT. We investigate suchsolutions for small values of the connection, and contrast these withspacetimes which have `Wilson lines for the bulk ' -- spacetimes that arelocally AdS times a sphere but have a global deformation. The latter class arein general singular spacetimes. We comment on some aspects of the recentlyfound geometries corresponding to the D1-D5 state with angular momentum,observing relations between scales in the microscopic theory and scales in thegeometry.
