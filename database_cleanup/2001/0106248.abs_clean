two-dimensional \phi^4 theoryAuthors: A. Harindranath, L. Martinovic and J. P. Vary

Comments: title changed, clarifying statements added

We study the S-matrix of two-dimensional \lambda\phi^4 theory in DiscretizedLight Cone Quantization and show how the correct continuum limit is reached forvarious processes in lowest order perturbation theory.
