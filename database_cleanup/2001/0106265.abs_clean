We examine the stability of ${\rm AdS}_p \times {\rm S}^n \times {\rmS}^{q-n}$. The initial data constructed by De Wolfe et al \cite{Gary} has beencarefully analyised and we have confirmed that there is no lower bound for thetotal mass for $q< 9$. The effective action on ${\rm AdS}_p$ has been derivedfor dilatonic compactification of the system to describe the non-linearfluctuation of the background space-time. The stability is discussed applyingthe positive energy theorem to the effective theory on AdS, which again showsthe stability for $q \geq 9$.
