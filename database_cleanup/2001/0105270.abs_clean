We consider the holographic duality for a generic bulk theory of scalarscoupled to gravity. By studying the fluctuations around Poincare invariantbackgrounds with non-vanishing scalars, with the scalar and metric boundaryconditions considered as being independent, we obtain all one- and two-pointfunctions in the dual renormalization group flows of the boundary field theory.Operator and vev flows are explicitly distinguished by means of the physicalcondensates. The method is applied to the GPPZ and Coulomb branch flows, andfield theoretical expectations are confirmed.
