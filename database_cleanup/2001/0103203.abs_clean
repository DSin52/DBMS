We analyze certain brane bound states in M-theory and their descendants intype IIA string theory, all involving 3-form or 2-form background fluxes. Amongthem are configurations which represent NCYM, NCOS and ODp-theories in thescaling limit of OM-theory. In particular, we show how the conditions for theembedding to preserve supersymmetry are modified by the presence of the fluxand discuss their relations for the various different bound states. Via theformalism of geometric quantization such a deformation of a supersymmetriccycle is related to a non-commutativity of its coordinates. We also studypossible non-commutative deformations of the Seiberg-Witten curve of N=2supersymmetric gauge theories due to non-trivial H-flux.
