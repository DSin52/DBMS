We investigate the applicability of the moduli space approximation intheories with unbroken non-Abelian gauge symmetries. Such theories havemassless magnetic monopoles that are manifested at the classical level asclouds of non-Abelian field surrounding one or more massive monopoles. Using anSO(5) example with one massive and one massless monopole, we compare thepredictions of the moduli space approximation with the results of a numericalsolution of the full field equations. We find that the two diverge when thecloud velocity becomes of order unity. After this time the cloud profileapproximates a spherical wavefront moving at the speed of light. In the regionwell behind this wavefront the moduli space approximation continues to give agood approximation to the fields. We therefore expect it to provide a gooddescription of the motion of the massive monopoles and of the transfer ofenergy between the massive and massless monopoles.
