We consider quantum electrodynamics with an additional Lorentz- andCPT-violating axial-vector term in the fermionic sector and discuss thepossibility that radiative corrections induce a Lorentz- and CPT-violatingChern-Simons-like term for the gauge field. From the requirement of causalityand the assumed validity of perturbation theory, we conclude that the inducedChern-Simons-like term must be absent in the full quantum field theory.
