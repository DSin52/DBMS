We explain how perturbative string theory can be viewed as an exactlyrenormalizable Weyl invariant quantum mechanics in the worldsheetrepresentation clarifying why string scattering amplitudes are both finite andunambiguously normalized and explaining the origin of UV-IR relations inspacetime. As applications we examine the worldsheet representation ofnonperturbative type IB states and of string solitons. We conclude with ananalysis of the thermodynamics of a free closed string gas establishing theabsence of the Hagedorn phase transition. We show that the 10D heteroticstrings share a stable finite temperature ground state with gauge groupSO(16)xSO(16). The free energy at the self-dual Kosterlitz-Thouless phasetransition is minimized with finite entropy and positive specific heat. Theopen and closed string gas transitions to a confining long string phase at atemperature at or below the string scale in the presence of an externalelectric field.
