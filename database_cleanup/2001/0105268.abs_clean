We have constructed the most general gauge fixing term for the SU(2)Yang-Mills theory, which leaves the global U(1) gauge symmetry intact (i.e.,the most general Maximal Abelian gauge). From the viewpoint ofrenormalizability, we point out the importance of an additional gauge fixingparameter that is not included in the ordinary gauge fixing term with theglobal SU(2) gauge symmetry. By requiring a number of symmetries withoutspoiling the renormalizability, we restrict the most general gauge to a minimumgauge which is considered to be the essential part of the maximal Abeliangauge. Then we demonstrate that a new parameter $\kappa$ introduced in thisgauge is very efficient in order to examine the renormalizability. In fact, weconfirm the renormalizability of this gauge together with a new parameter$\kappa$ by calculating explicitly the anomalous dimensions of all theparameters at one loop order.
