A flow invariant is a quantity depending only on the UV and IR conformalfixed points and not on the flow connecting them. Typically, its value isrelated to the central charges a and c. In classically-conformal fieldtheories, scale invariance is broken by quantum effects and the flow invarianta_{UV}-a_{IR} is measured by the area of the graph of the beta function betweenthe fixed points. There exists a theoretical explanation of this fact. On theother hand, when scale invariance is broken at the classical level, it isempirically known that the flow invariant equals c_{UV}-c_{IR} in massivefree-field theories, but a theoretical argument explaining why it is so isstill missing. A number of related open questions are answered here. A generalformula of the flow invariant is found, which holds also when the stress tensorhas improvement terms. The conditions under which the flow invariant equalsc_{UV}-c_{IR} are identified. Several non-unitary theories are used as alaboratory, but the conclusions are general and an application to the StandardModel is addressed. The analysis of the results suggests some new minimumprinciples, which might point towards a better understanding of quantum fieldtheory.
