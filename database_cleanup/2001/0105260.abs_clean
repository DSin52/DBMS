We discuss the origin of the associativity (WDVV) equations in the context ofquasiclassical or Whitham hierarchies. The associativity equations are shown tobe encoded in the dispersionless limit of the Hirota equations for KP and Todahierarchies. We show, therefore, that any tau-function of dispersionless KP orToda hierarchy provides a solution to associativity equations. In general, theydepend on infinitely many variables. We also discuss the particular solution tothe dispersionless Toda hierarchy that describes conformal mappings andconstruct a family of new solutions to the WDVV equations depending on finitenumber of variables.
