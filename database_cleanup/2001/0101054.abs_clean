Title: Unruh effect in storage rings

Authors: Jon Magne Leinaas

Comments: 17 pages, 4 figures, conference talk

A uniformly accelerated system will get thermally excited due to interactionswith the vacuum fluctuations of the quantum fields. This is the Unruh effect.Also a system accelerated in a circular orbit will be heated, but in this casecomplications arise relative to the linear case. An interesting question is inwhat sense the real quantum effects for orbital and spin motion of acirculating electron can be viewed as a demonstration of the Unruh effect. Thisquestion has been studied and debated. I review some of the basic pointsconcerning the relation to the Unruh effect, and in particular look at how theelectron can be viewed as a thermometer or detector that probes thermal andother properties of the vacuum state in the accelerated frame.
