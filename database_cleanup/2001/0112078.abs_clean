Gluing conditions are proposed to characterize the D-branes in gauged WZWmodels. From them the boundary conditions for the group-valued and thesubgroup-valued fields are determined. We construct a gauged WZW action foropen strings that coincides classically with those written previously, when thegluing conditions are imposed.
