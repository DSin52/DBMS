426-441The elliptic Gaudin model was obtained as the Hitchin system on an ellipticcurve with two fixed points. In the present paper the algebraic-geometricalstructure of the system with two fixed points is clarified. We identify thissystem with poles dynamics of the finite gap solutions of Davey-Stewartsonequation. The solutions of this system in terms of theta-functions and theaction-angle variables are constructed. We also discuss the geometry of itsdegenerations.
