A new formula relating the analytic continuation of the Hurwitz zeta functionto the Euler gamma function and a polylogarithmic function is presented. Inparticular, the values of the first derivative of the real part of the analyticcontinuation of the Hurwitz zeta function for even negative integers and theimaginary one for odd negative integers are explicitly given. The result can beof interest both on mathematical and physical side, because we are able toapply our new formulas in the context of the Spectral Zeta Functionregularization, computing the exact pair production rate per space-time unit ofmassive Dirac particles interacting with a purely electric background field.
