It has been conjectured that the bosonic open string theory around thenon-perturbative tachyon vacuum has no open string dynamics at all. We explore,in the cubic open string field theory with level truncation approximation, thepossibility that this conjecture is realized by the absence of kinetic terms ofthe string field fluctuations. We study the kinetic terms with two and fourderivatives for the lower level scalar modes as well as their BRSTtransformation properties. The behavior of the coefficients of the kineticterms in the neighborhood of the non-perturbative vacuum supports ourexpectation that the BRST invariant scalar component lacks its kinetic term.
