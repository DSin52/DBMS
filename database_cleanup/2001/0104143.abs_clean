We construct the exact noncommutative solutions on tori. This gives an exactdescription of tachyon condensation on bosonic D-branes, non-BPS D-branes andbrane-antibrane systems. We obtain various bound states of D-branes after thetachyon condensation. Our results show that these solutions can be generated byapplying the gauge Morita equivalence between the constant curvature projectivemodules. We argue that there is a general framework of the noncommutativegeometry based on the notion of Morita equivalence which underlies thisspecific example.
