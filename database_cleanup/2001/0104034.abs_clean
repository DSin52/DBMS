We present a generalization of the infinitesimal gauge transformation fornonabelian fields on the stack of branes up to the third order in $\Phi$. Wetest the gauge invariance of the action up to the fifth order in $\Phi$ for$D$-instantons. This substantiates the Myers formula for the Chern-Simons termin action, which describes interaction with the RR fields of $N$ coincident$\Dp$ branes.
