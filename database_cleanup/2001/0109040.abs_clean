We explore the diversity of warped metric function in five-dimensionalgravity including a scalar field and a 3-brane.We point out that the form of the function is determined by a parameterintroduced here.For a particular value of the parameter, the warped metric function is smoothwithout having a singularity, and we show that the bulk cosmological constanthave a upper bound and must be positive and that the lower bound offive-dimensional fundamental scale is controlled by both the brane tension andfour-dimensional effective Planck scale.The general warp factor obtained here may relate to models inspired by SUGRAor M-theory.
