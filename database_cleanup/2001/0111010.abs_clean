Title: Partition function zeros in QCD

Authors: Michaela Oswald

Comments: Contribution to STATISTICAL QCD, Bielefeld, 2001, 2 pages

We find a relationship between the partition function mass zeros and thespectral properties of the QCD Dirac operator in the context of chiral RandomMatrix Theory. Introducing the concept of normal modes we see that certainfeatures of the QCD partition function are universal.
