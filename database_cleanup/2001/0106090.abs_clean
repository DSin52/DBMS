We construct quantized free superfields and represent them as operator-valueddistributions in Fock space starting with Majorana fields. The perturbativeconstruction of the S-matrix for interacting theories is carried through byextending the causal method of Epstein and Glaser to superspace. We propose ascaling and singular order of distributions in superspace by a procedure whichscales both commutative and non-commutative variables. Using this singularorder the chiral (Wess-Zumino) model appears to be super-renormalizable.
