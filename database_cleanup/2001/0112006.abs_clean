corrected; final version to be published (Proc. of the Workshop on"Mathematical Aspects of Orbifold String Theory", Madison, Wisconsin, May4-8, 2001)We discuss geometric aspects of orbifold conformal field theories in themoduli space of N=(4,4) superconformal field theories with central charge c=6.Part of this note consists of a summary of our earlier results on the locationof these theories within the moduli space [NW01,Wen] and the action of aspecific version of mirror symmetry on them [NW]. We argue that these resultsallow for a direct translation from geometric to conformal field theoreticdata. Additionally, this work contains a detailed discussion of an examplewhich allows the application of various versions of mirror symmetry on K3. Weshow that all of them agree in that point of the moduli space.
