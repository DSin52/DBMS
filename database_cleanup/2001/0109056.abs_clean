Title: Holography and two phases of the QCD vacuum

non-perturbative QCD, 5-9 June 2001, American University of ParisThe holographic principle is often (and hastily) attributed to quantumgravity and domains of the Planck size. Meanwhile it can be usefully applied toproblems where gravitation effects are negligible and domains of less exoticsize. The essence of this principle is that any physical system can be taken tobe either classical, placed in a D+1-dimensional spacetime, orquantum-mechanical, located in its D-dimensional boundary. For example, onebelieves that a hydrogen atom is a typical quantum system living in afour-dimensional spacetime, but it can also be conceived as a classical systemliving in a five-dimensional embracing spacetime. The subnuclear realm is moreintricate since the gluon vacuum reveals two phases, the hadronic and plasmaphases. They differ in energetics and symmetry. Moreover, the classicalfour-dimensional picture is pertinent to the behavior of constituent quarkswhile the plasma phase is expected to be grasped by standard four-dimensionalQCD. The relation between the holographic standpoint and the symmetry treatmentof these two phases is outlined. Exact retarded solutions to the classicalSU(N) four-dimensional Yang-Mills equations with the source composed of severalpoint-like colored particles is considered. Features of these solutions in thelarge-N limit provide insight into the gauge symmetries of two gluon vacua.
