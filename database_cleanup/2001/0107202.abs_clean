We present the locally supersymmetric formulation of unimodular gravitytheory in D (1\le D \le 11) dimensions, namely supergravity theory with themetric tensor whose determinant is constrained to be unity. In such aformulation, the usual fine-tuning of cosmological constant is no longerneeded, but its value is understood as an initial condition. Moreover, thezero-ness of the cosmological constant is concluded as the most probableconfiguration, based on the effective vacuum functional. We also show that theclosure of supersymmetry gauge algebra is consistent with the unimodularcondition on the metric.
