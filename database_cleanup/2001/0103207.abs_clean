Conference on Particle Physics (COSMO 2000), Cheju Island, Korea, 4-8 Sep2000We consider a brane world residing in the interior region inside the horizonof extreme black branes. In this picture, the size of the horizon can beinterpreted as the compactification size. The large mass hierarchy is simplytranslated into the large horizon size, which is provided by the magnitude ofcharges carried by the black branes. Hence, the macroscopic compactificationsize is a quantity calculable from the microscopic theory which has only onephysical scale, and its stabilization is guaranteed from the chargeconservation.
