We study the SU(2) electroweak model in which the standard Yang-Millscoupling is supplemented by a Born-Infeld term. The deformation of thesphaleron and bisphaleron solutions due to the Born-Infeld term is investigatedand new branches of solutions are exhibited. Especially, we find a new branchof solutions connecting the Born-Infeld sphaleron to the first solution of theKerner-Gal'tsov series.
