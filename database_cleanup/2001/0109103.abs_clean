In this paper we analyze two local extensions of a model introduced some timeago to obtain a path integral formalism for Classical Mechanics. In particular,we show that these extensions exhibit a nonrelativistic local symmetry which isvery similar to the well known kappa-symmetry introduced in the literaturealmost 20 years ago. Differently from the latter, this nonrelativistic localsymmetry gives no problem in separating 1st from 2nd-class constraints.
