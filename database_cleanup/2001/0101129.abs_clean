Fibrewise T-duality (Fourier-Mukai transform) for D-branes on an ellipticCalabi-Yau $X$ is shown to require naturally an appropriate twisting of theoperation respectively a twisted charge. The fibrewise T-duality is furthermoreexpressed through known monodromies in the context of Kontsevich'sinterpretation of mirror symmetry.
