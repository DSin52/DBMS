We present a new class of quantum field theories which are exactly solvable.The theories are generated by introducing Pauli-Villars fermionic and bosonicfields with masses degenerate with the physical positive metric fields. Analgorithm is given to compute the spectrum and corresponding eigensolutions. Wealso give the operator solution for a particular case and use it to illustratesome of the tenets of light-cone quantization. Since the solutions of thesolvable theory contain ghost quanta, these theories are unphysical. However,we also discuss how perturbation theory in the difference between the masses ofthe physical and Pauli-Villars particles could be developed, thus generatingphysical theories. The existence of explicit solutions of the solvable theoryalso allows one to study the relationship between the equal-time and light-conevacua and eigensolutions.
