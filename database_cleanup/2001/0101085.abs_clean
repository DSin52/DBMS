ITALY, July 2-8, 2000Some examples of Type-I vacua related to non geometric orbifolds are shown.In particular, the open descendants of the diagonal $Z_3$ orbifold are comparedwith the geometric ones. Although not chiral, these models exhibit someinteresting properties, like twisted sectors in the open-string spectra and thepresence of ``quantized'' geometric moduli, a key ingredient to ensure theirperturbative consistency and to explain the rank reduction of their Chan-Patongroups.
