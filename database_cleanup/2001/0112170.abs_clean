Following the symplectic approach we show how to embed the Abelian Procamodel into a first-class system by extending the configuration space to includean additional pair of scalar fields, and compare it with the improved Diracscheme. We obtain in this way the desired Wess-Zumino and gauge fixing terms ofBRST invariant Lagrangian. Furthermore, the integrability properties of thesecond-class system described by the Abelian Proca model are investigated usingthe Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, where we construct the closed Lie algebra byintroducing operators associated with the generalized Poisson brackets.
