The study of noncommutative solitons is greatly facilitated if the fieldequations are integrable, i.e. result from a linear system. For the example ofa modified but integrable $U(n)$ sigma model in $2{+}1$ dimensions we employthe dressing method to construct explicit multi-soliton configurations onnoncommutative~$\R^{2,1}$. These solutions, abelian and nonabelian, featureexact time-dependence for any value of the noncommutativity parameter~$\th$ anddescribe various lumps of finite energy in relative motion. We discuss theirscattering properties and prove asymptotic factorization for large times.
