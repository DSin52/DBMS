Title: Spectral Properties of Yang-Mills Theory

Comments: 14 pages, plain Tex. In the revised version, section 3 is completely

re-writtenYang--Mills theory in four dimensions is studied by using the Coulomb gauge.The Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian involves integration of matrix elements of anoperator P built from the Laplacian and from a first-order differentialoperator. The operator P is studied from the point of view of spectral theoryof pseudo-differential operators on compact Riemannian manifolds, both whenself-adjointness holds and when it is not fulfilled. In both cases,well-defined matrix elements of P are evaluated as a first step towards themore difficult problems of quantized Yang--Mills theory.
