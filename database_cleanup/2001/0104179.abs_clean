We construct the manifestly gauge invariant effective Lagrangian in 3+1dimensions describing the Standard Model in 4+1 dimensions, following thetransverse lattice technique. We incorporate split generation fermions and weto each transverse brane, and a local Higgs VEV centered on a single brane withdiscrete exponential attenuation to other branes, emulating thesplit-generation model. Extra dimensions, with explicit Higgs, do notameliorate the naturalness problem.
