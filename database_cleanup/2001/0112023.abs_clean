We consider the sine-Gordon and affine Toda field theories on the half-linewith classically integrable boundary conditions, and show that in the quantumtheory a remnant survives of the bulk quantized affine algebra symmetrygenerated by non-local charges. The paper also develops a general framework forobtaining solutions of the reflection equation by solving an intertwiningproperty for representations of certain coideal subalgebras of quantized affinealgebras.
