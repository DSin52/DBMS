We construct 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2 BPS solutions spanned by diagonal elements ofU(N) constant fluxes in the 6+1 dimensional U(N) super Yang-Mills theory on T^6with topological stability. These solutions represent BPS bound states of D0,D2, D4, and D6 branes. The consistency with the D-brane charge conservationimplies that unstable D0-D2-D6-brane systems in a B field decay to the BPSsolutions, in which lower dimensional D-branes are dissolved in D6-branes.
