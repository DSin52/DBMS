references addedThe existence of future horizons in spacetime geometries poses seriousproblems for string theory and quantum field theories. The observation that theexpansion of the universe is accelerating has recently been shown to lead to acrisis for the mathematical formalism of string and M-theories, since theexistence of a future horizon for an eternally accelerating universe does notallow the formulation of physical S-matrix observables. Postulating that thespeed of light varies in an expanding universe in the future as well as in thepast can eliminate future horizons, allowing for a consistent definition ofS-matrix observables.
