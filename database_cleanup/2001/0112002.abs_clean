We consider the Kerr-de Sitter (Kerr-dS) black hole in various dimensions.Introducing a counterterm, we show that the total action of these spacetimesare finite. We compute the masses and the angular momenta of Kerr-dS spaceswith one rotational parameter in four, five and seven dimensions. Theseconserved charges are also computed for the case of Kerr-dS space with tworotational parameters in five dimensions. Although the angular momentum densitydue to the counterterm is nonzero, it gives a vanishing contribution to thetotal angular momentum. We also find that the total angular momentum of thespacetime is independent of the radius of the boundary for all cases, a factthat is not true for the total mass of the system.
