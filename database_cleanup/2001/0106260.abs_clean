Nonlinear Sigma Models on AdS spaces and Chern-Simons p-branesComments: 43 pages, Tex file

It is shown that the large $N$ limit of SU(N) YM in $curved$ $m$-dimbackgrounds can be subsumed by a higher $m+n$ dimensional gravitational theorywhich can be identified to an $m$-dim generally invariant gauge theory of diffs$N$, where $N$ is an $n$-dim internal space (Cho, Sho, Park, Yoon). Based onthese findings, a very plausible geometrical interpretation of the $AdS/CFT$correspondence could be given. Conformally invariant sigma models in $D=2n$dimensions with target non-compact SO(2n,1) groups are reviewed. Despite thenon-compact nature of the SO(2n,1), the classical action and Hamiltonian arepositive definite. Instanton field configurations are found to correspondgeometrically to conformal ``stereographic'' mappings of $R^{2n}$ into theEuclidean signature $AdS_{2n}$ spaces. The relation between Self Dual branesand Chern-Simons branes, High Dimensional Knots, follows. A detailed discussionon $W_\infty $ symmetry is given and we outline the Vasiliev procedure toconstruct an action involving higher spin massless fields in $AdS_4$. This$AdS_4$ spacetime higher spin theory should have a one-to-one correspondence tononcritical $W_\infty$ strings propagating on $AdS_4 \times S^7$.
