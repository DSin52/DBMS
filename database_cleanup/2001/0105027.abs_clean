We borrow the minisuperspace approximation from Quantum Cosmology and thequenching approximation from QCD in order to derive a new form of the bosonicp-brane propagator. In this new approximation we obtain an exact description ofboth the collective mode deformation of the brane and the center of massdynamics in the target spacetime. The collective mode dynamics is ageneralization of string dynamics in terms of area variables. The final resultis that the evolution of a p-brane in the quenched-minisuperspace approximationis formally equivalent to the effective motion of a particle in a spacetimewhere points as well as hypersurfaces are considered on the same footing asfundamental geometrical objects. This geometric equivalence leads us to definea new tension-shell condition that is a direct extension of the Klein-Gordoncondition for material particles to the case of a physical p-brane.
