We construct the Lagrangian description of arbitrary integer higher spinmassless fields on the background of the D-dimensional anti-de Sitter space.The operator constraints in auxiliary Fock space corresponding to subsidiaryconditions for irreducible unitary massless representations of theD-dimensional anti-de Sitter group are formulated. Unlike flat space, thealgebra of the constraints turns out to be nonlinear and analogous to the $W_3$algebra. We construct the nilpotent BRST charge for this nonlinear algebra andderive on its basis the correct field content and gauge invariant actiondescribing the consistent arbitrary integer spin field dynamics in $AdS$ space.
