Schwinger's quantization scheme is extended in order to solve the problem ofthe formulation of quantum mechanics on a space with a group structure. Theimportance of Killing vectors in a quantization scheme is showed. Usage ofthese vectors provides algebraic properties of operators to be consistent withthe geometrical structure of a manifold. The procedure of the definition of thequantum Lagrangian of a free particle and the norm of velocity (momentum)operators is given. These constructions are invariant under a generalcoordinate transformation. The unified procedure for constructing the quantumtheory on a space with a group structure is developed. Using it quantummechanics on a Riemannian manifold with a simply transitive group acting on itis investigated.
