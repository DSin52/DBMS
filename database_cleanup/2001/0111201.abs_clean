We propose a new holographic C-function for the accelerating universe definedin the stringy frame motivated mainly by the fact that the number of degrees offreedom should be infinite for a physical system of infinite size. This is thegeneralization of Strominger's recent proposal of the holographic C-function tothe asymptotically non-de Sitter universe. We find that the correspondingC-theorem holds true if the universe accelerates toward the weak couplingregime driven by the exponential dilaton potential. It also holds in othersimple cases.
