We continue the study of thermodynamics of black holes in de Sitter spaces.In a previous paper (hep-th/0111093), we have shown that the entropy ofcosmological horizon in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution and topological deSitter solution can be expressed in a form of the Cardy-Verlinde formula, ifone adopts the prescription to compute the gravitational mass from data atearly or late time infinity of de Sitter space. However, this definition ofgravitational mass cannot give a similar expression like the Cardy-Verlindeformula for the entropy associated with the horizon of black holes in de Sitterspaces. In this paper, we first generalize the previous discussion to the caseof Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter and Kerr-de Sitter solutions. Furthermore, wefind that the entropy of black hole horizon can also be rewritten in terms ofthe Cardy-Verlinde formula for these black holes in de Sitter spaces, if we usethe definition due to Abbott and Deser for conserved charges in asymptoticallyde Sitter spaces. We discuss the implication of our result. In addition, wegive the first law of de Sitter black hole mechanics.
