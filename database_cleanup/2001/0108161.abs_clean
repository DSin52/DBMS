In this paper we study the action for N D0-branes in a curved background. Inparticular, we focus on the meaning of space-time diffeomorphism invariance.For a single D-brane, diffeomorphism invariance acts in a naive way on theworld-volume fields, but for multiple D-branes, the meaning of diffeomorphisminvariance is much more obscure. The problem goes beyond the determination ofan ordering of the U(N)-valued fields, because one can show that there is nolift of ordinary diffeomorphisms to matrix-valued diffeomorphisms. On the otherhand, the action can presumably be constructed from perturbative string theorycalculations. Based on the general characteristics of such calculations wedetermine a set of constraints on the action for N D0-branes, that ensurespace-time covariance. These constraints can be solved order by order, but theyare insufficient to determine the action completely. All solutions to theconstraints obey the axioms of D-geometry. Moreover the action must contain newterms. This exhibits clearly that the answer is more than a suitable orderingof the action of a single D0 brane.
