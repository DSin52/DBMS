We construct an exact soliton, which represents a BPS Dp-brane, in a boundarystring field theory action of infinitely many non-BPS D(p-1)-branes.Furthermore, we show that this soliton can be regarded as an exact soliton inthe full string field theory. The world-volume theory of the BPS Dp-braneconstructed in this way becomes usual gauge theory on commutative R^{p+1},instead of non-commutative plane. We also construct a D$p$-brane from non-BPSD(p-n)-branes by the ABS like configuration. We confirm that the Dp-brane hascorrect RR charges and the tension.
