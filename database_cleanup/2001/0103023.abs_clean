Regularization of quantum field theories (QFT's) can be achieved byquantizing the underlying manifold (spacetime or spatial slice) therebyreplacing it by a non-commutative matrix model or a ``fuzzy manifold''. Suchdiscretization by quantization is remarkably successful in preservingsymmetries and topological features, and altogether overcoming thefermion-doubling problem. In this paper, we report on our work on the``fuzzification'' of the four-dimensional CP2 and its QFT's. CP2 is not spin,but spin${}_c$. Its Dirac operator has many unique features. They are explainedand their fuzzy versions are described.
