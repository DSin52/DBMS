The spacetime symmetries of SGM action proposed as the gravitational couplingof N-G fermions are investigated. The commutators of new nonlinearsupersymmetry (NL SUSY) transformations form a closed algebra, which revealsN-G fermion (NL SUSY) nature and a generalized general coordinatetransformation. A generalized local Lorentz transformation, which forms aclosed algebra, is also introduced.
