We extend the analysis of the canonical structure of the Wess-Zumino-Wittentheory to the bulk and boundary coset G/H models. The phase spaces of the cosettheories in the closed and in the open geometry appear to coincide with thoseof a double Chern-Simons theory on two different 3-manifolds. In particular, weobtain an explicit description of the canonical structure of the boundary G/Gcoset theory. The latter may be easily quantized leading to an example of atwo-dimensional topological boundary field theory.
