We propose a way to introduce matter fields transforming in arbitraryrepresentations of the gauge group in noncommutative U(N) gauge theories. Wethen argue that in the presence of supersymmetry, an ordinary commutative SU(N)gauge theory with a general matter content can always be embedded into anoncommutative U(N) theory at energies above the noncommutativity mass scaleM_{NC} ~ \theta^{-1/2}. At energies below M_{NC}, the U(1) degrees of freedomdecouple due to the IR/UV mixing, and the noncommutative theory reduces to itscommutative counterpart. Supersymmetry can be spontaneously broken by aFayet-Iliopoulos D-term introduced in the noncommutative U(N) theory. U(1)degrees of freedom become arbitrarily weakly coupled in the infrared andnaturally play the role of the hidden sector for supersymmetry breaking. Toillustrate these ideas we construct a noncommutative U(5) GUT model withFayet-Iliopoulos supersymmetry breaking, which reduces to a realisticcommutative theory in the infrared.
