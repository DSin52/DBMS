explicitly that the two solutions correspond to distinct physical systemsWe discuss the propagation of gravity in five-dimensional Minkowski space inthe presence of a four-dimensional brane. We show that there exists a solutionto the wave equation that leads to a propagator exhibiting four-dimensionalbehavior at low energies (long distances) with five-dimensional effects showingup as corrections at high energies (short distances). We compare our resultswith propagators derived in previous analyses exhibiting five-dimensionalbehavior at low energies. We show that different solutions correspond todifferent physical systems.
