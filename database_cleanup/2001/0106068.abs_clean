We study some properties of the tachyonic lumps in the level truncationscheme of bosonic cubic string field theory. We find that several gauges workwell and that the size of the lump as well as its tension is approximatelyindependent of these gauge choices at level (2,4). We also examine thefluctuation spectrum around the lump solution, and find that a tachyon withm^2=-0.96 and some massive scalars appear on the lump world-volume. This resultstrongly supports the conjecture that a codimension 1 lump solution isidentified with a D-brane of one lower dimension within the framework ofbosonic cubic string field theory.
