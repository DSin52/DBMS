The (2+1)D Georgi-Glashow (or Polyakov) model with the additional fundamentalmassless quarks is explored at finite temperature. In the case of vanishingYukawa coupling, it is demonstrated that the interaction of a monopole and anantimonopole in the molecule via quark zero modes leads to the decrease of theBerezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical temperature when the number of quarkflavors is equal to one. If the number of flavors becomes larger, monopoles areshown to exist only in the molecular phase at any temperatures exceeding acertain exponentially small one. This means that for such a number of flavorsand at such temperatures, no fundamental matter can be confined by means of themonopole mechanism.
