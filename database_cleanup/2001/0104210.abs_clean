We consider the dynamics of a charged particle in a space whose coordinatesare $N\times N$ hermitian matrices. Putting things in the framework ofD0-branes of String Theory, we mention that the transformations of the matrixcoordinates induce non-Abelian transformations on the gauge potentials. TheLorentz equations of motion for matrix coordinates are derived, and it isobserved that the field strengths also transform like their non-Abeliancounterparts. The issue of the map between theory on matrix space and ordinarynon-Abelian gauge theory is discussed. The phenomenological aspect of "finite-Nnon-commutativity" for the bound states of D0-branes appears to be veryattractive.
