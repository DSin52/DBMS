Title: The derivative expansion of the exact renormalization group

Comments: Thesis, August 1996. LaTeX, 125 pages,28 figs

We formulate a method of performing non-perturbative calculations in quantumfield theory, based upon a derivative expansion of the exact renormalizationgroup. We then proceed to apply this method to the calculation of criticalexponents for three dimensional O(N) symmetric theory. Finally we discuss howthe approximation scheme manages to reproduce some exactly known solutions incritical phenomena.
