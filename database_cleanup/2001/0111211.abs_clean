We reconsider the $CP^{1}$ model with the Hopf term by using theBatalin-Fradkin-Tyutin (BFT) scheme, which is an improved version of the Diracquantization method. We also perform a semi-classical quantization of thetopological charge Q sector by exploiting the collective coordinates toexplicitly show the fractional spin statistics.
