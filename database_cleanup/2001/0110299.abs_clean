We consider a brane world scenario which arises as the near-horizon region ofa non-extremal D5-brane. There is a quasi-localized massive graviton mode, aswell as harmonic modes of higher mass which are bound to the brane to a lesserdegree. Lorentz invariance is slightly broken, which may have observableeffects due to the leakage of the metastable graviton states into the bulk.Unlike a brane world arising from an extremal D5-brane, there is no mass gap.We also find that a brane world arising from a non-extremal M5/M5-braneintersection has the same graviton dynamics as that of a non-extremal D5-brane.This is evidence that a previously conjectured duality relation between thedual quantum field theories of each p-brane background may hold away fromextremality.
