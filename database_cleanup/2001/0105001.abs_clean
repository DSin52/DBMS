We use Grassmann even spinor oscillators to construct a bosonic higher spinextension hs(2,2) of the five-dimensional anti-de Sitter algebra SU(2,2), andshow that the gauging of hs(2,2) gives rise to a spectrum S of physicalmassless fields with spin s=0,2,4,... that is a UIR of hs(2,2). In addition toa master gauge field which contains the massless s=2,4,.. fields, we constructa scalar master field containing the massless s=0 field, the generalized Weyltensors and their derivatives. We give the appropriate linearized constraint onthis master scalar field, which together with a linearized curvature constraintproduces the correct linearized field equations. A crucial step in theconstruction of the theory is the identification of a central generator K whichis eliminated by means of a coset construction. Its charge vanishes in thespectrum S, which is the symmetric product of two spin zero doubletons. Weexpect our results to pave the way for constructing an interacting theory whosecurvature expansion is dual to a CFT based on higher spin currents formed outof free doubletons in the large N limit. Thus, extending a recent proposal ofSundborg (hep-th/0103247), we conjecture that the hs(2,2) gauge theorydescribes a truncation of the bosonic massless sector of tensionlessType IIB string theory on AdS_5 x S^5 for large N. This implies AdS/CFTcorrespondence in a parameter regime where both boundary and bulk theories areperturbative.
