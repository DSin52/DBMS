We propose a large N dual of 4d, N=1 supersymmetric, SU(N) Yang-Mills withadjoint field \Phi and arbitrary superpotential W(\Phi). The field theory isgeometrically engineered via D-branes partially wrapped over certain cycles ofa non-trivial Calabi-Yau geometry. The large N, or low-energy, dual arises froma geometric transition of the Calabi-Yau, where the branes have disappeared andhave been replaced by suitable fluxes. This duality yields highly non-trivialexact results for the gauge theory. The predictions indeed agree with expectedresults in cases where it is possible to use standard techniques for analyzingthe strongly coupled, supersymmetric gauge theories. Moreover, the proposedlarge N dual provides a simpler and more unified approach for obtaining exactresults for this class of supersymmetric gauge theories.
