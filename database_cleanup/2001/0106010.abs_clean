Title: Vacuum String Field Theory

Authors: Leonardo Rastelli, Ashoke Sen, and Barton Zwiebach

Comments: 31 pages, 3 figures, LaTeX. Added references, a new subsection, and

edited commentsThis is a brief review of vacuum string field theory, a new approach to openstring field theory based on the stable vacuum of the tachyon. We discuss thesliver state explaining its role as a projector in the space of half-stringfunctionals. We review the construction of D-brane solutions in vacuum stringfield theory, both in the algebraic approach and in the more generalgeometrical approach that emphasizes the role of boundary CFT. -- To appear inthe Proceedings of Strings 2001, Mumbai, India.
