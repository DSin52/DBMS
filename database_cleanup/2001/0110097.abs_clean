A standard Lax representation for the polytropic gas dynamics is derived byexploiting various properties of the Lucas and Fibonacci polynomials. The twoinfinite sets of conserved charges are derived from this representation andshown to coincide with the ones derived from the known non-standardrepresentation. The same Lax function is shown to also give the standard Laxdescription for the elastic medium equations. In addition, some results onpossible dispersive extensions of such models are presented.
