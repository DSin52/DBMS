The causal entropy bound (CEB) is confronted with recent explicit entropycalculations in weakly and strongly coupled conformal field theories (CFTs) inarbitrary dimension $D$. For CFT's with a large number of fields, $N$, the CEBis found to be valid for temperatures not exceeding a value of order$M_P/N^{{1\over D-2}}$, in agreement with large $N$ bounds in generic cut-offtheories of gravity, and with the generalized second law. It is also shown thatfor a large class of models including high-temperature weakly coupled CFT's andstrongly coupled CFT's with AdS duals, the CEB, despite the fact that itrelates extensive quantities, is equivalent to (a generalization of) a purelyholographic entropy bound proposed by E. Verlinde.
