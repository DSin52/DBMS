Title: Phenomenology of Particle Production and Propagation in String-Motivated

Canonical Noncommutative SpacetimeAuthors: Giovanni Amelino-Camelia, Luisa Doplicher, Soonkeon Nam, Yun-Seok Seo

Comments: With respect to the experimental information available at the time of

writing version 1 of this manuscript (hep-th/0109191v1) the situation hasevolved significantly. Our remarks on the benefits of high-energyobservations found additional encouragement from the results reported inhep-th/0209254We outline a phenomenological programme for the search of effects induced by(string-motivated) canonical noncommutative spacetime. The tests we propose arebased, in analogy with a corresponding programme developed over the last fewyears for the study of Lie-algebra noncommutative spacetimes, on the role ofthe noncommutativity parameters in the $E(p)$ dispersion relation. We focus onthe role of deformed dispersion relations in particle-production collisionprocesses, where the noncommutativity parameters would affect the thresholdequation, and in the dispersion of gamma rays observed from distantastrophysical sources. We emphasize that the studies here proposed have theadvantage of involving particles of relatively high energies, and may thereforebe less sensitive to "contamination" (through IR/UV mixing) from the UV sectorof the theory. We also explore the possibility that the relevant deformation ofthe dispersion relations could be responsible for the experimentally-observedviolations of the GZK cutoff for cosmic rays and could have a role in theobservation of hard photons from distant astrophysical sources.
