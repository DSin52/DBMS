A connection between solutions of the relativistic d-brane system in (d+1)dimensions with the solutions of a Galileo invariant fluid in d-dimensions isby now well established. However, the physical nature of the light-cone gaugedescription of a relativistic membrane changes after the reduction to the fluiddynamical model since the gauge symmetry is lost. In this work we argue thatthe original gauge symmetry present in a relativistic d-brane system can berecovered after the reduction process to a d-dimensional fluid model. To thisend we propose, without introducing Wess-Zumino fields, a gauge invarianttheory of isentropic fluid dynamics and show that this symmetry corresponds tothe invariance under local translation of the velocity potential in the fluiddynamics picture. We show that different but equivalent choices of thesympletic sector lead to distinct representations of the embedded gaugealgebra.
