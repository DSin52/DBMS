We study configurations consisting of a pair of non-extremal black holes infour dimensions, both with the same mass, and with charges of the samemagnitude but opposite sign---diholes, for short. We present such exactsolutions for Einstein-Maxwell theory with arbitrary dilaton coupling, and alsosolutions to the U(1)^4 theories that arise from compactified string/M-theory.Despite the fact that the solutions are very complicated, physical propertiesof these black holes, such as their area, charge, and interaction energy, admitsimple expressions. We also succeed in providing a microscopic description ofthe entropy of these black holes using the `effective string' model, and takinginto account the interaction between the effective string and anti-string.
