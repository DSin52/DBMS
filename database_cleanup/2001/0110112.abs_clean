We examine the renormalizability problem of spontaneously broken non-Abeliangauge theory on noncommutative spacetime. We show by an explicit analysis ofthe U(2) case that ultraviolet divergences can be removed at one loop levelwith the same limited number of renormalization constants as required oncommutative spacetime. We thus push forward the efforts towards constructingrealistic models of gauge interactions on noncommutative spacetime.
