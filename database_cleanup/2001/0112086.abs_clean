We perform the calculation of the partition function of the Poisson-sigmamodel on the world sheet with the topology of a two-dimensional disc.Considering the special case of a linear Poisson structure we recover thepartition function of the Yang-Mills theory. Using a glueing procedure we areable to calculate the partition function for arbitrary base manifolds.
