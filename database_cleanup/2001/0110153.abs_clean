references are addedWe consider the phase structure of a pure compact U(1) gauge theory in fourdimensions at finite temperature by treating this system as a perturbativedeformation of the topological model. Phases of a gauge theory can beinvestigated from the phase structure of the topological model. The thermalpressure of the topological model has been calculated, from which its phasestructure can be derived. We have obtained phases of a compact U(1) gaugetheory. Moreover, the critical-line equation has been explicitly evaluated.
