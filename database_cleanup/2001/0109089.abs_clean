In this paper we reformulate Abelian and non-Abelian noninvariant systems asgauge invariant theories using a new constraint conversion scheme, developed onthe symplectic framework. This conversion method is not plagued by theambiguity problem that torments the BFFT and iterative methods and also itseems more powerful since it does not require special modifications to handlewith non-Abelian systems.
