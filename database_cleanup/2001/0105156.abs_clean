The gauge invariance of open string field theory is considered from the pointof view of level truncation, and applications to the tachyon condensationproblem are discussed. We show that the region of validity of Feynman-Siegelgauge can be accurately determined using the level truncation method. We thenshow that singularities previously found in the tachyon effective potential aregauge artifacts arising from the boundary of the region of validity ofFeynman-Siegel gauge. The problem of finding the stable vacuum and tachyonpotential without fixing Feynman-Siegel gauge is addressed.
