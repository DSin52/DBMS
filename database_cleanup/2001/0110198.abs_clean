the YATI Conference on Black Hole Astrophysics, Kolkata, India, April 2001An elementary introduction is given to the problem of black hole entropy asformulated by Bekenstein and Hawking, based on the so-called Laws of Black HoleMechanics. Wheeler's `It from Bit' picture is presented as an explanation ofplausibility of the Bekenstein-Hawking Area Law. A variant of this picture thattakes better account of the symmetries of general relativity is shown to yieldcorrections to the Area Law that are logarithmic in the horizon area, with afinite, fixed coefficient. The Holographic hypothesis, tacitly assumed in theabove considerations, is briefly described and the beginnings of a generalproof of the hypothesis is sketched, within an approach to quantum gravitationwhich is non-perturbative in nature, namely Non-perturbative Quantum GeneralRelativity (also known as Quantum Geometry). The holographic entropy bound isshown to be somewhat tightened due to the corrections obtained earlier. A briefsummary of Quantum Geometry approach is included, with a sketch of ademonstration that precisely the log area corrections obtained from the variantof the It from Bit picture adopted earlier emerges for the entropy of genericblack holes within this formalism.
