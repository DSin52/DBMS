Title: Eternal Black Holes in AdS

Comments: v4

We propose a dual non-perturbative description for maximally extendedSchwarzschild Anti-de-Sitter spacetimes. The description involves two copies ofthe conformal field theory associated to the AdS spacetime and an initialentangled state. In this context we also discuss a version of the informationloss paradox and its resolution.
