Within loop quantum gravity we construct a coarse-grained approximation forthe Einstein-Maxwell theory that yields effective Maxwell equations in flatspacetime comprising Planck scale corrections.The corresponding Hamiltonian is defined as the expectation value of theelectromagnetic term in the Einstein-Maxwell Hamiltonian constraint,regularized a la Thiemann, with respect to a would-be semiclassical state. Theresulting energy dispersion relations entail Planck scale corrections to thosein flat spacetime. Both the helicity dependent contribution of Gambini andPullin [GP] and, for a value of a parameter of our approximation, that of Elliset. al. [ELLISETAL] are recovered. The electric/magnetic asymmetry in theregularization procedure yields nonlinearities only in the magnetic sectorwhich are briefly discussed. Observations of cosmological Gamma Ray Burstsmight eventually lead to the needed accuracy to study some of these quantumgravity effects.
