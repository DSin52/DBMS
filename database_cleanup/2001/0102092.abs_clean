The three dimensional Chern-Simons theory on $\rr^2_{\theta}\times \rr$ isstudied. Considering the gauge transformations under the group elements whichare going to one at infinity, we show that under arbitrary (finite) gaugetransformations action changes with an integer multiple of $2\pi$ {\it if}, thelevel of noncommutaitive Chern-Simons is {\it quantized}. We also brieflydiscuss the case of the noncommutaitve torus and some other possibleextensions.
