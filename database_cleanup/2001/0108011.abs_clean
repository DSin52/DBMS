Title: Finite-N Conformality and Gauge Coupling Unification

Comments: 9 pages LaTeX. Invited talk at the 10th Tohwa International Symposium

on String Theory, Fukuoka, Japan. July 3-7, 2001In this talk I review some aspects of the idea that there is an infra-redconformal fixed-point at the TeV scale. In particular, it is shown how gaugecoupling unification can be achieved by TeV unification in a semi-simple gaugegroup.
