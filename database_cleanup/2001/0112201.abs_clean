Abelian Lagrangians containing $\lambda\phi^{4}$-type vertices areregularized by means of a suitable point-splitting scheme combined withgeneralized gauge transformations. The calculation is developped in details fora general Lagrangian whose fields (gauge and matter ones) satisfy usualconditions. We illustrate our results by considering some special cases, suchas the $(\bar{\psi}\psi)^{2}$ and the Avdeev-Chizhov models. Possibleapplication of our results to the Abelian Higgs model, whenever spontaneoussymmetry breaking is considered, is also discussed. We also pay attention to anumber of features of the point-split action such as the regularity andnon-locality of its new ``interacting terms''.
