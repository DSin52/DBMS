I present a twistor action functional for null 2-surfaces (null strings) in4D Minkowski spacetime. The proposed formulation is reparametrization invariantand free of algebraic and differential constraints. Proposed approach resultsin derivation of evolution equations for the null strings. It is shown thatnon-geodesic null strings are contained in the presented formalism. Adiscussion of the problem of minimality for 2-surfaces with degenerate inducedmetric is given. I also speculate on the possible description of strings(time-like 2-surfaces) and conventional (space-like) 2-surfaces.
