Title: Contextual viewpoint to quantum stochastics

Authors: Andrei Khrennikov

We study the role of context, complex of physical conditions, in quantum aswell as classical experiments. It is shown that by taking into accountcontextual dependence of experimental probabilities we can derive the quantumrule for the addition of probabilities of alternatives. Thus we obtain quantuminterference without applying to wave or Hilbert space approach. The Hilbertspace representation of contextual probabilities is obtained as a consequenceelementary algebra we obtain complex-amplitude representation of probabilities.Finally, we found contextual origin of noncommutativity of incompatibleobservables.
