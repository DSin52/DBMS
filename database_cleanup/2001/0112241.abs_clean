Title: A Gauge-Invariant Color Charge in QCD

Authors: Kurt Haller

Comments: 7 pages LaTeX, no figures

A gauge-invariant color-charge operator is defined and related to an integralof the gauge-invariant chromoelectric field over a closed surface. We discussthe case of a surface all of whose points are a macroscopic distance from asystem of quarks and gluons which it entirely surrounds. When this system ofquarks and gluons forms a hadron or an object composed of hadrons, such as anucleus, it is argued that the gauge-invariant color charge enclosed withinthis surface must vanish and the system of hadrons in the interior of thesurface must be a color singlet.
