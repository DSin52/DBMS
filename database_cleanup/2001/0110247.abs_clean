An unambiguous and slice-independent formula for the two-loop superstringmeasure on moduli space for even spin structure is constructed from firstprinciples. The construction uses the super-period matrix as moduli invariantunder worldsheet supersymmetry. This produces new subtle contributions to thegauge-fixing process, which eliminate all the ambiguities plaguing earliergauge-fixed formulas.The superstring measure can be computed explicitly and a simple expression interms of modular forms is obtained. For fixed spin structure, the measureexhibits the expected behavior under degenerations of the surface. The measureallows for a unique modular covariant GSO projection. Under this GSOprojection, the cosmological constant, the 1-, 2- and 3- point functions ofmassless supergravitons all vanish pointwise on moduli space without theappearance of boundary terms. A certain disconnected part of the 4-pointfunction is shown to be given by a convergent, finite integral on moduli space.A general slice-independent formula is given for the two-loop cosmologicalconstant in compactifications with central charge c=15 and N=1 worldsheetsupersymmetry in terms of the data of the compactification conformal fieldtheory.In this paper, a summary of the above results is presented with detailedconstructions, derivations and proofs to be provided in a series of subsequentpublications.
