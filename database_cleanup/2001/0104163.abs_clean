We study string-loop corrections to magnetic black hole. Four-dimensionaltheory is obtained by compactification of the heterotic string theory on themanifold $K3\times T^2$ or on a suitable orbifold yielding N=1 supersymmetry in6D. The resulting 4D theory has N=2 local supersymmetry. Prepotential of thistheory receives only one-string-loop correction. The tree-level gauge couplingsare proportional to the inverse effective string coupling and decrease at smalldistances from the center of magnetic black hole, so that loop corrections tothe gauge couplings are important in this region. We solve the system of spinorKilling equations (conditions for the supersymmetry variations of the fermionsto vanish) and Maxwell equations. At the string-tree level, we reproduce themagnetic black hole solution which can be also obtained by solving the systemof the Einstein-Maxwell equations and the equations of motion for the moduli.String-loop corrections to the tree-level solution are calculated in the firstorder in string coupling. The resulting corrections to the metric and dilatonare large at small distances from the center of the black hole. Possiblesmearing of the singularity at the origin by quantum corrections is discussed.
