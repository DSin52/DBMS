Explicit solutions to the conifold equations with complex dimension $n=3,4$in terms of {\it{complex coordinates (fields)}} are employed to construct theRicci-flat K\"{a}hler metrics on these manifolds. The K\"{a}hler 2-forms arefound to be closed. The complex realization of these conifold metrics are usedin the construction of 2-dimensional non-linear sigma model with the conifoldsas target spaces. The action for the sigma model is shown to be bounded frombelow. By a suitable choice of the 'integration constants', arising in thesolution of Ricci flatness requirement, the metric and the equations of motionare found to be {\it{non-singular}}. As the target space is Ricci flat, theperturbative 1-loop counter terms being absent, the model becomes topological.The inherent U(1) fibre over the base of the conifolds is shown to correspondto a gauge connection in the sigma model.The same procedure is employed to construct the metric for the resolvedconifold, in terms of complex coordinates and the action for a non-linear sigmamodel with resolved conifold as target space, is found to have a minimum value,which is topological. The metric is expressed in terms of the six realcoordinates and compared with earlier works. The harmonic function, which isthe warp factor in Type II-B string theory, is obtained and the ten-dimensionalwarped metric has the $AdS_{5}\times X_{5}$ geometry.
