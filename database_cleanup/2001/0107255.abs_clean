We study the dynamical consequences of Maggiore's unique generaliseduncertainty principle (GUP). We find that it leads naturally, and generically,to novel consequences. In the high temperature limit, there is a drasticreduction in the degrees of freedom, of the type found, for example, in stringsfar above the Hagedorn temperature. In view of this, the present GUP mayperhaps be taken as the new version of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,conjectured by Atick and Witten to be responsible for such reduction. Also, thepresent GUP leads naturally to varying speed of light and modified dispersionrelations. They are likely to have novel implications for cosmology and blackhole physics, a few of which we discuss qualitatively.
