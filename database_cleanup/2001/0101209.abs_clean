After discussing the peculiarities of quantum systems on noncommutative (NC)spaces with non-trivial topology and the operator representation of the$\star$-product on them, we consider the Aharonov-Bohm and Casimir effects forsuch spaces. For the case of the Aharonov-Bohm effect, we have obtained anexplicit expression for the shift of the phase, which is gauge invariant in theNC sense. The Casimir energy of a field theory on a NC cylinder is divergent,while it becomes finite on a torus, when the dimensionless parameter ofnoncommutativity is a rational number. The latter corresponds to a well-definedphysical picture. Certain distinctions from other treatments based on adifferent way of taking the noncommutativity into account are also discussed.
