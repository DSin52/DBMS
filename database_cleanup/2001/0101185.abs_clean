Motivated by a recently proposed "bigravity" model with two positive tension$AdS_4$ branes in $AdS_5$ by Kogan et al.[hep-th/0011141], we study behavior ofbulk gauge field in the model. In this case, the zero mode of the gauge fieldis not constant but depends on the fifth dimensional coordinate transverse tothe brane. The zero mode then becomes massive on the brane. From the physicalrequirement that the mass must be small, a parameter of the model isconstrained. We also discuss the Kaluza-Klein modes.
