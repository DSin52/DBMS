Non-singular two and three dimensional string cosmologies are constructedusing the exact conformal field theories corresponding to SO(2,1)/SO(1,1) andSO(2,2)/SO(2,1). {\it All} semi-classical curvature singularities are canceledin the exact theories for both of these cosets, but some new quantum curvaturesingularities emerge. However, considering different patches of the globalmanifolds, allows the construction of non-singular spacetimes with cosmologicalinterpretation. In both two and three dimensions, we construct non-singularoscillating cosmologies, non-singular expanding and inflationary cosmologiesincluding a de Sitter (exponential) stage with positive scalar curvature aswell as non-singular contracting and deflationary cosmologies. Similaritiesbetween the two and three dimensional cases suggest a general picture forunavoidable feature, cosmological singularities are generically avoided and itis possible to construct non-singular cosmologies where some spatial dimensionsare experiencing inflation while the others experience deflation.
