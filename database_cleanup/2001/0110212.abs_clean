Our formalism described recently in (Dolby et al, hep-th/0103228) is appliedto the study of particle creation in spatially uniform electric fields,concentrating on the cases of a time-invariant electric field and a so-called`adiabatic' electric field. Several problems are resolved by incorporating the`Bogoliubov coefficient' approach and the `tunnelling' approaches into a singleconsistent, gauge invariant formulation. The value of a time-dependent particleinterpretation is demonstrated by presenting a coherent account of thetime-development of the particle creation process, in which the particles arecreated with small momentum (in the frame of the electric field) and are thenaccelerated by the electric field to make up the `bulge' of created particlespredicted by asymptotic calculations. An initial state comprising one particleis also considered, and its evolution is described as being the sum of twoextra current arising from the initial particle state.
