In this paper we construct and analyze new classes of wormhole and fluxtube-like solutions for the 5D vacuum Einstein equations. These 5D solutionspossess generic local anisotropy which gives rise to a gravitational running orscaling of the Kaluza-Klein ``electric'' and ``magnetic'' charges of thesesolutions. It is also shown that it is possible to self-consistently constructthese anisotropic solutions with various rotational 3D hypersurface geometries(i.e. ellipsoidal, cylindrical, bipolar and toroidal). The local anisotropy ofthese solutions is handled using the technique of anholonomic frames with theirassociated nonlinear connection structures [vst]. Through the use of theanholonomic frames the metrics are diagonalized, in contrast to holonomiccoordinate frames where the metrics would have off-diagonal components. In thelocal isotropic limit these solutions are shown to be equivalent to sphericallysymmetric 5D wormhole and flux tube solutions.
