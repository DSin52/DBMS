Title: Special geometries, from real to quaternionic

Authors: Antoine Van Proeyen

Comments: 21 pages, 2 figures, Contribution to the proceedings of the `Workshop

on special geometric structures in string theory', Bonn, 8-11/9/2001Special geometry is most known from 4-dimensional N=2 supergravity, though itcontains also quaternionic and real geometries. In this review, we first repeatthe connections between the various special geometries. Then the constructionsare given starting from the superconformal approach. Without going in detail,we give the main underlying principles. We devote special attention to thequaternionic manifolds, introducing the notion of hypercomplex geometry, beingmanifolds close to hyperkaehler manifolds but without a metric. These arerelated to supersymmetry models without an action.
