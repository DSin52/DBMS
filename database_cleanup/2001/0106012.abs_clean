(1/4)-supersymmetric D0-charged IIA superstring that has been blown up to acylindrical D2-brane by angular momentum. The supergravity solution capturesall essential features of the supertube, including the D2-dipole moment and anexistence of closed timelike curves, with a consequent ghost-inducedinstability of supertube probes.
