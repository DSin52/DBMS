We discuss the dynamical situation which arises in a local quantum fieldtheory after renormalization. By using the example of the three-dimensionaltheory of a neutral scalar field interacting through the quartic coupling, weshow that after renormalization the dynamics of a theory is governed by ageneralized dynamical equation with a nonlocal interaction operator. It isshown that the generalized dynamical equation allows one to formulate thistheory in an ultraviolet-finite way.
