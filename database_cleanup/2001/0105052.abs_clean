We analyze different types of quantum corrections to the Cardy-Verlindeentropy formula in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe and in an (anti)-deSitter space. In all cases we show that quantum corrections can be representedby an effective cosmological constant which is then used to redefine theparameters entering the Cardy-Verlinde formula so that it becomes valid alsowith quantum corrections, a fact that we interpret as a further indication ofits universality. A proposed relation between Cardy-Verlinde formula and theADM Hamiltonian constraint is given.
