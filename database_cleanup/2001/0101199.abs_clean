correctedIn the noncommutative field theory of open strings in a B-field, D-branesarise as solitons described as projection operators or partial isometries in a$C^*$ algebra. We discuss how D-branes on orbifolds fit naturally into thisalgebraic framework, through the examples of $R^n/G$, $T^n=R^n/Z^n$, and$T^n/G$. We also propose a framework for formulating D-branes on asymmetricorbifolds.
