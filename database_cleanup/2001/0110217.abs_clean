The first heat kernel coefficients are calculated for a dispersive ball whosepermittivity at high frequency differs from unity by inverse powers of thefrequency. The corresponding divergent part of the vacuum energy of theelectromagnetic field is given and ultraviolet divergencies are seen to bepresent. Also in a model where the number of atoms is fixed the pressureexhibits infinities. As a consequence, the ground-state energy for a dispersivedielectric ball cannot be interpreted easily.
