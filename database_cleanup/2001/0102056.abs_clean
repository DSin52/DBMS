The dynamics of a Dp brane can be described either by an open string endingon this brane or by an open D(p - 2) brane ending on the same Dp brane. Theends of the open string couple to a Dp brane worldvolume gauge field while theboundary of the open D(p - 2) brane couples to a (p - 2)-form worldvolumepotential whose field strength is Poincare dual to that of the gauge field onthe Dp-brane worldvolume. With this in mind, we find that the Poincare dual ofthe fixed rank-2 magnetic field used in defining a (1 + p)-dimensionalnoncommutative Yang-Mills (NCYM) gives precisely a near-critical electric fieldfor the open D(p - 2) brane. We therefore find (1 + p)-dimensional open D(p -2) brane theories along the same line as for obtaining noncommutative openstring theories (NCOS), OM theory and open Dp brane theories (ODp) from NS5brane. Similarly, the Poincare dual of the near-critical electric field used indefining a (1 + p)-dimensional NCOS gives a fixed magnetic-like field. Thisfield along with the same bulk field scalings defines a (1 + p)-dimensionalnoncommutative field theory. In the same spirit, we can have various (1 +5)-dimensional noncommutative field theories resulting from the existence ofODp if the description of open D(4 - p) brane ending on the NS5 brane isinsisted.
