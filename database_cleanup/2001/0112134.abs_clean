Quantum mechanics in the presence of $\delta$-function potentials is known tobe plagued by UV divergencies which result from the singular nature of thepotentials in question. The standard method for dealing with these divergenciesis by constructing self-adjoint extensions of the corresponding Hamiltonians.Two particularly interesting examples of this kind are nonrelativistic spinzero particles in $\delta$-function potential and Dirac particles inAharonov-Bohm magnetic background. In this paper we show that by extending thecorresponding Schr\"odinger and Dirac equations onto the flat noncommutativespace a well-defined quantum theory can be obtained. Using a star product andFock space formalisms we construct the complete sets of eigenfunctions andeigenvalues in both cases which turn out to be finite.
