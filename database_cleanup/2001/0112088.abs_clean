We investigate the possibility that stringy nonperturbative instabilities aredescribed by worldsheet methods. We focus on the case of open bosonic stringtheory, where the D-instanton plays a role of the bounce, i.e. it describesbarrier penetration. In the process, we compute the exponential factor in adecay probability.
