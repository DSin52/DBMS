Title: Quantum and Classical Fields in the Finite-Dimensional Formalism

Authors: Miguel Navarro

Comments: LaTeX, 16 pp

The quantization rules recently proposed by M. Navarro (and independentlyI.V. Kanatchikov) for a finite-dimensional formulation of quantum field theoryare applied to the Klein-Gordon and the Dirac fields to obtain the quantumequations of motion of both fields. In doing so several problems arise.Solving these difficulties leads us to propose a new classical canonicalformalism, which, in turn, leads us to new, improved rules of quantization. Weshow that the new classical equations of motion and rules of quantizationovercome several known unsatisfactory features of the previous formalism. Weargue that the new formalism is a general improvement with respect to theprevious one.Further we show that the quantum field theory of the Dirac and Klein-Gordonfield describes particles with extra, harmonic-oscillator-like degrees offreedom. We argue that these degrees of freedom should give rise to amulti-particle interpretation of the formalism.
