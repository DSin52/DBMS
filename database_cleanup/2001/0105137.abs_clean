We study supergravity models in four dimensions where the hidden sector issuperconformal and strongly-coupled over several decades of energy below thePlanck scale, before undergoing spontaneous breakdown of scale invariance andsupersymmetry. We show that large anomalous dimensions can suppress Kahlercontact terms between the hidden and visible sectors, leading to models inwhich the hidden sector is "sequestered" and anomaly-mediated supersymmetrybreaking can naturally dominate, thus solving the supersymmetric flavorproblem. We construct simple, explicit models of the hidden sector based onsupersymmetric QCD in the conformal window. The present approach can beusefully interpreted as having an extra dimension responsible for sequesteringreplaced by the many states of a (spontaneously-broken) strongly-coupledsuperconformal hidden sector, as dictated by the AdS/CFT correspondence.
