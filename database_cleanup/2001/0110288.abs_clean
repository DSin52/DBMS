We discuss gauge-fixing, propagators and effective potentials for topologicalA-brane composites in Calabi-Yau compactifications. This allows for theconstruction of a holomorphic potential describing the low-energy dynamics ofsuch systems, which generalizes the superpotentials known from the ungradedcase. Upon using results of homotopy algebra, we show that the string field andlow energy descriptions of the moduli space agree, and that the deformations ofsuch backgrounds are described by a certain extended version of `off-shellMassey products' associated with flat graded superbundles. As examples, weconsider a class of graded D-brane pairs of unit relative grade. Upon computingthe holomorphic potential, we study their moduli space of composites. Inparticular, we give a general proof that such pairs can form acycliccondensates, and, for a particular case, show that another branch of theirmoduli space describes condensation of a two-form.
