Title: Non-Abelian gauge theory on noncommutative spaces

Authors: Peter Schupp

Comments: 5 pages, Talk given at International Europhysics Conference on

High-Energy Physics (HEP 2001), Budapest, Hungary, 12-18 Jul 2001We present a brief introduction to the construction of gauge theories onnoncommutative spaces with star products. Particular emphasis is given toissues related to non-Abelian gauge groups and charge quantization. This talkis based on joined work with B. Jurco, J. Madore, L. Moeller, S. Schraml and J.Wess.
