Title: On SU(2) Yang-Mills Theory and the Maximal Abelian Gauge

Authors: O. Oliveira

The problem of identifying the dynamical degrees of freedom for SU(2) gaugetheories is discussed. After studying SU(N) theories, it is shown thatclassical pure SU(2) gauge theory is equivalent to an abelian theory. Finally,we prove that the Maximal Abelian Gauge correctly identifies the abeliandegrees of freedom of the SU(2) theory.
