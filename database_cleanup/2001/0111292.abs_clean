Finite groups are of the greatest importance in science. Loops are a simplerequirement that the binary operation be associative. The least loops that arenot themselves groups are those of order five. We offer a brief discussion ofthese loops and challenge the reader (especially Holger) to find usefulapplications for them in physics.
