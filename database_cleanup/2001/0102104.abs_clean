We show that the parent Lagrangian method gives a natural generalization ofthe dual theories concept for non p-form fields. Using this generalization weconstruct here a three-parameter family of Lagrangians that are dual to theFierz-Pauli description of a free massive spin-two system. The dual field is athree-index tensor T, which dinamically belongs to the (2,1) representation ofthe Lorentz group. As expected, the massless limit of our Lagrangian, which isparameter independent, has two propagating degrees of freedom per space point.
