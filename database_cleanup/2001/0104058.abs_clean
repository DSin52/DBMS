The effective action with homogeneous valence (off-diagonal) gluons asbackground fields in the extended SU(2) model of QCD is obtained in one-loopapproximation. We keep the manifest gauge and Lorentz invariance during wholecalculation by using a special gauge-fixing recipe and taking into account thequartic interaction terms in the original Lagrangian as well. It has been shownthat the effective Lagrangian gains a positive imaginary part.
