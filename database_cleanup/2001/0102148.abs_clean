Budapest, August 2000The study of Finite Size Effects in Quantum Field Theory allows theextraction of precious perturbative and non-perturbative information. The useof scaling functions can connect the particle content (scattering theoryformulation) of a QFT to its ultraviolet Conformal Field Theory content. If themodel is integrable, a method of investigation through a nonlinear integralequation equivalent to Bethe Ansatz and deducible from a light-cone latticeregularization is available. It allows to reconstruct the S-matrix and tounderstand the locality properties in terms of Bethe root configurations,thanks to the link to ultraviolet CFT guaranteed by the exact determination ofscaling function. This method is illustrated in practice for Sine-Gordon /massive Thirring models, clarifying their locality structure and the issues ofequivalence between the two models. By restriction of the Sine-Gordon model itis also possible to control the scaling functions of minimal models perturbedby Phi_1,3
