Title: Anomalies from Immersions

Authors: Juan Ospina

Comments: 5 pages on latex

Two forms of anomalies for chiral spinors living on submanifolds of thespacetime are obtained from the integrality theorem for immersions. The firstform of the chiral anomaly is the usual for chiral spinors living on D-braneand O-plane intersections, the second form is exotic.
