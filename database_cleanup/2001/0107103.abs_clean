We study the world-volume theory of a bosonic membrane perturbatively anddiscuss if one can obtain any conditions on the number of space-time dimensionsfrom the consistency of the theory. We construct an action which is suitablefor such a study. In order to study the theory perturbatively we should specifya classical background around which perturbative expansion is defined. We willdiscuss the conditions which such a background should satisfy to deduce thecritical dimension. Unfortunately we do not know any background satisfying suchconditions. In order to get indirect evidences for the critical dimension ofthe membrane, we next consider two string models obtained via doubledimensional reduction of the membrane. The first one reduces to the Polyakovstring theory in the conformal gauge. The second one is described by the Schildaction. We show that the critical dimension is 26 for these string theories,which implies that the critical dimension is 27 for the membrane theory.
