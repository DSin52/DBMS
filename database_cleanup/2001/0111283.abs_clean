The fundamental action of superon-graviton model(SGM) for space-time andmatter is written down explicitly in terms of the fields of the graviton andsuperons by using the affine and the spin connection formalisms, alternatively.Some characteristic structures including some hidden symmetries of thegravitational coupling of superons are manifested (in two dimensionalspace-time) with some details of the calculations. SGM cosmology is discussedbriefly.
