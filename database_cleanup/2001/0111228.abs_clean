Title: Bits and Pieces in Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory

Authors: Michael Flohr

Comments: 91 pages, notes of lectures delivered at the first School and

Workshop on Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory and its Applications, Tehran,September 2001. Amendments in IntroductionThese are notes of my lectures held at the first School & Workshop onLogarithmic Conformal Field Theory and its Applications, September 2001 inTehran, Iran.These notes cover only selected parts of the by now quite extensive knowledgeon logarithmic conformal field theories. In particular, I discuss the propergeneralization of null vectors towards the logarithmic case, and how these canbe used to compute correlation functions. My other main topic is modularinvariance, where I discuss the problem of the generalization of characters inthe case of indecomposable representations, a proposal for a Verlinde formulafor fusion rules and identities relating the partition functions of logarithmicconformal field theories to such of well known ordinary conformal fieldtheories.These two main topics are complemented by some remarks on ghost systems, theHaldane-Rezayi fractional quantum Hall state, and the relation of these two tothe logarithmic c=-2 theory.
