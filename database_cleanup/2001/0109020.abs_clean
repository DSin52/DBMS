The Fedosov deformation quantization of the symplectic manifold is determinedby a 1-form differential r. We identify a class of r for which the $\star$product becomes the Moyal product by taking appropriate Darboux coordinates,but invariant by canonically transforming the coordinates. This respect of the$\star$ product is explained by studying the fuzzy algebrae of the Kaehlercoset space.
