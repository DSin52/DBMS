September 3-5, 2001, 14 pages LaTexAfter briefly reviewing the hamiltonian approach to 2+1 dimensional gravityin absence of matter on closed universes, we consider 2+1 dimensional gravitycoupled to point particles in an open universe. We show that the hamiltonianstructure of the theory is the result of a conjecture put forward by Polyakovin a different context. A proof is given of such a conjecture. Finally we givethe exact quantization of the two particle problem in open space.
