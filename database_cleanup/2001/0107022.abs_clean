We introduce the concept of superfield effective action in noncommutative N=1supersymmetric field theories containing chiral superfields. One and two loopslow-energy contributions to the effective action are found for thenoncommutative Wess-Zumino model. The one loop Kahlerian effective potentialcoincides with its commutative counterpart. We show that the two loopsnonplanar contributions to the Kahlerian effective potential are leading in thecase of small noncommutativity. The structure of the leading chiral correctionsto the effective action and the behaviour of the chiral effective potential inthe limit of large noncommutativity are also investigated.
