Some time ago, it was found that the never-ending oscillatory chaoticbehaviour discovered by Belinsky, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz (BKL) for thegeneric solution of the vacuum Einstein equations in the vicinity of aspacelike ("cosmological") singularity disappears in spacetime dimensions $D=d+1>10$. Recently, a study of the generalization of the BKL chaotic behaviourto the superstring effective Lagrangians has revealed that this chaos is rootedin the structure of the fundamental Weyl chamber of some underlying hyperbolicKac-Moody algebra. In this letter, we show that the same connection applies topure gravity in any spacetime dimension $\geq 4$, where the relevant algebrasare $AE_d$. In this way the disappearance of chaos in pure gravity models in $D> 10$ dimensions becomes linked to the fact that the Kac-Moody algebras $AE_d$are no longer hyperbolic for $d > 9$.
