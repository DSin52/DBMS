We find supertubes with arbitrary (and not necessarily planar) cross section;the stability against the D2-brane tension is due to a compensation by thelocal momentum generated by Born-Infeld fields. Stability against long-rangesupergravity forces is also established. We find the corresponding solutions ofthe infinite-N M(atrix) model. The supersymmetric D2/anti-D2 system is aspecial case of the general supertube, and we show that there are noopen-string tachyons in this system via a computation of the open-stringone-loop vacuum energy.
