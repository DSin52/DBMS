We investigate the Polchinski ERG equation for d-dimensional O(N) scalarfield theory. In the context of the non-perturbative derivative expansion wefind families of regular solutions and establish their relation with thephysical fixed points of the theory. Special emphasis is given to the large Nlimit for which many properties can be studied analytically.
