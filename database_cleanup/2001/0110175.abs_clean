We examine in details Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models in 2+1 dimensions inorder to investigate the cosmic holographic principle suggested by Fischler andSusskind. Our results are rigorously derived differing from the previous onefound by Wang and Abdalla. We discuss the erroneous assumptions done in thiswork. The matter content of the models is composed of a perfect fluid, with a$\gamma$-law equation of state. We found that closed universes satisfy theholographic principle only for exotic matter with a negative pressure. We alsoanalyze the case of a collapsing flat universe.
