253-267We study the general form of the noncommutative associative product (thestar-product) on the Grassman algebra; the star-product is treated as adeformation of the usual "pointwise" product. We show that up to a similaritytransformation, there is only one such product. The relation of the algebra${\cal F}$, the algebra of elements of the Grassman algebra with thestar-product as a product, to the Clifford algebra is discussed.
