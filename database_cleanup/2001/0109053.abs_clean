We study four N=1 SU(N)^6 gauge theories, with bi-fundamental chiral matterand a superpotential. In the infrared, these gauge theories all realize thelow-energy world-volume description of N coincident D3-branes transverse to thecomplex cone over a del Pezzo surface dP_3 which is the blowup of P^2 at threegeneric points. Therefore, the four gauge theories are expected to fall intothe same universality class--an example of a phenomenon that has been termed"toric duality." However, little independent evidence has been given that suchtheories are infrared-equivalent.In fact, we show that the four gauge theories are related by the N=1 dualityof Seiberg, vindicating this expectation. We also study holographic aspects ofthese gauge theories. In particular we relate the spectrum of chiral operatorsin the gauge theories to wrapped D3-brane states in the AdS dual description.We finally demonstrate that the other known examples of toric duality arerelated by N=1 duality, a fact which we conjecture holds generally.
