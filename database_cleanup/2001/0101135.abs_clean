We investigate the spectrum of type IIA BPS D-branes on the quintic from afour dimensional supergravity perspective and the associated split attractorflow picture. We obtain some very concrete properties of the (quantumcorrected) spectrum, mainly based on an extensive numerical analysis, and to alesser extent on exact results in the large radius approximation. We predictthe presence and absence of some charges in the BPS spectrum in various regionsof moduli space, including the precise location of the lines of marginalstability and the corresponding decay products. We explain how the genericappearance of multiple basins of attraction is due to the presence of conifoldsingularities and give some specific examples of this phenomenon. Someinteresting space-time features of these states are also uncovered, such as anontrivial, moduli independent lower bound on the area of the core of arbitraryBPS solutions, whether they are black holes, empty holes, or more complicatedcomposites.
