pagesWe discuss dual formulations of D-brane intersections. The duality is betweenworld volume field theories of different dimensionalities which both describethe same D-brane configuration but are valid in complementary regions ofparameter space. We discuss the duality in terms of bion configurationsinvolving D-strings orthogonally intersecting both D3-branes and D5-branes.
