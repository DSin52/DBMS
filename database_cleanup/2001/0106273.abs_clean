The Dirac equation is not semisimple. We therefore regard it as a contractionof a simpler decontracted theory. The decontracted theory is necessarily purelyalgebraic and non-local. In one simple model the algebra is a Clifford algebrawith 6N generators. The quantum imaginary $\hbar i$ is the contraction of adynamical variable whose back-reaction provides the Dirac mass. The simplifiedDirac equation is exactly Lorentz invariant but its symmetry group is SO(3,3),a decontraction of the Poincare group, and it has a slight but fundamentalnon-locality beyond that of the usual Dirac equation. On operational groundsthe non-locality is ~10^{-25} sec in size and the associated mass is about theHiggs mass.There is a non-standard small but unique spin-orbit coupling ~1/N, whoseobservation would be some evidence for the simpler theory. All the fields ofthe Standard Model call for similar non-local simplification.
