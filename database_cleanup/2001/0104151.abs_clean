By the simple finite element method, we study the symplectic, multisymplecticstructures and relevant preserving properties in some semi-linear ellipticboundary value problem in one-dimensional and two-dimensional spacesrespectively. We find that with uniform mesh, the numerical schemes derivedfrom finite element method can keep a preserved symplectic structure inone-dimensional case and a preserved multisymplectic structure intwo-dimentional case respectively. These results are in fact the intrinsicreason that the numerical experiments indicate that such finite element schemesare accurate in practice.
