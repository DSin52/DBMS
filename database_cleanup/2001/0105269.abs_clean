Brane-world singularities are analysed, emphasizing the case of supergravityin singular spaces where the singularity puzzle is naturally resolved. Thesenaked singularities are either time-like or null, corresponding to the finiteor infinite amount of conformal time that massless particles take in order toreach them. Quantum mechanically we show that the brane-world nakedsingularities are inconsistent. Indeed we find that time-like singularities arenot wave-regular, so the time-evolution of wave packets is not uniquely definedin their vicinity, while null singularities absorb incoming radiation. Finallywe stress that for supergravity in singular spaces there is a topologicalobstruction, whereby naked singularities are necessarily screened off by thesecond boundary brane.
