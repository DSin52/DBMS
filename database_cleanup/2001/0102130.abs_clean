In this letter we study the dilatonic corrections to the static gaugepotential between heavy sources. These corrections come from the solutions tothe the lowest order beta equations. In the energetically favoured branch, thepotential obtained is characterised by having a linear confining term, an $L$independent term and another 1/L piece. This is indicative of a L\"uscher-typebehaviour in the strong-coupling regime of the dual gauge theory. On the otherhand, we also explore the singularity as a point where the theory becomes free.
