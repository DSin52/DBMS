We discuss the Seiberg-Witten solution of the non-commutativeN=2 U(N) SYM model. The solution is described in terms of the ordinarySeiberg-Witten curve of the SU(N) theory plus an additional free U(1). Hence,at the two-derivative approximation the theory flows to the ordinarycommutative theory in the infra-red (k<1/sqrt(theta)). In particular, thecenter U(1) is free and it decouples from the other U(1)'s. In addition, noUV/IR mixing is found.
