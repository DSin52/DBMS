We obtain a supergravity solution arising when D6-branes are wrapped oncoassociative four-cycles of constant curvature in seven manifolds of G_2holonomy. The solutions preserve two supercharges and thus representsupergravity duals of three dimensional Yang-Mills with N=1 supersymmetry. Whenuplifted to eleven dimensions our solution describes M-theory on the backgroundof an eight manifold with Spin(7) holonomy.
