Europhysics Conference on High Energy Physics, Budapest, 2001Real-time anomalous fermion number violation has been investigated formassless chiral fermions in spherically symmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills gauge fieldbackgrounds which can be weakly dissipative or even nondissipative. Restrictingconsideration to spherically symmetric fermion fields, a relation has beenfound between the spectral flow of the Dirac Hamiltonian and twocharacteristics of the background gauge field. This new result may be relevantto electroweak baryon number violation in the early universe.
