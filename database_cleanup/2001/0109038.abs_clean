We study a class of braneworlds where the cosmological evolution arises asthe result of the movement of a three-brane in a five-dimensional staticdilatonic bulk, with and without reflection symmetry. The resultingfour-dimensional Friedmann equation includes a term which, for a certain rangeof the parameters, effectively works as a quintessence component, producing anacceleration of the universe at late times. Using current observations andbounds derived from big-bang nucleosynthesis we estimate the parameters thatcharacterize the model.
