The stability of 5-D brane-world models under conformal perturbations isinvestigated. The analysis is carried out in the general case and then it isapplied to particular solutions. It is shown that models with the Poincare andthe de Sitter branes are unstable because they have negative mass squared ofgravexcitons whereas models with the Anti de Sitter branes have positivegravexciton mass squared and are stable. It is also shown that 4-D effectivecosmological and gravitational constants on branes as well as gravexciton
