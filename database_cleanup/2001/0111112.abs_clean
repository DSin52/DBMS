We present a method to solve the master equation for the Wilsonian action inthe antifield formalism. This is based on a representation theory for cutoffdependent global symmetries along the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG)flow. For the chiral symmetry, the master equation for the free theory yields acontinuum version of the Ginsparg-Wilson relation. We construct chiralinvariant operators describing fermionic self-interactions. The use ofcanonically transformed variables is shown to simplify the underlying algebraicstructure of the symmetry. We also give another non-trivial example, arealization of SU(2) vector symmetry. Our formalism may be used for anon-perturbative truncation of the Wilsonian action preserving globalsymmetries.
