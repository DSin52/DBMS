We give an interpretation of the non-supersymmetric heterotic theories as thesupersymmetric heterotic theories on Melvin background with Wilson lines. Thecoincidence of the partition functions are shown for most of thenon-supersymmetric theories. We also discuss the tachyonic instability in termsof the non-trivial background fields. The behavior in the strong couplingregion is investigated by using the duality relations of the supersymmetrictheories.
