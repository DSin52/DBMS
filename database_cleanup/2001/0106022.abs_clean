This paper is an investigation of the effects of a thermal bulk fluid inbrane world models compactified on AdS_5. Our primary purpose is to study howsuch a fluid changes the bulk dynamics and to compare these effects with thosegenerated by matter localized to the branes. We find an exact cosmologicalsolution for a thermally excited massless bulk field, as well as perturbativesolutions with matter on the brane and in the bulk. We then perturb aroundthese solutions to find solutions for a massive bulk mode in the limit wherethe bulk mass (m_B) is small compared to the AdS curvature scale and T< m_B. Wefind that without a stabilizing potential there are no physical solutions for athermal bulk fluid. We then include a stabilizing potential and calculate theshift in the radion as well as the time dependence of the weak scale as afunction of the bulk mass. It is shown that, as opposed to a brane fluid, thebulk fluid contribution to the bulk dynamics is controlled by the bulk mass.
