We review the status and present range of applications of the``string-inspired'' approach to perturbative quantum field theory. Thisformalism offers the possibility of computing effective actions and S-matrixelements in a way which is similar in spirit to string perturbation theory, andbypasses much of the apparatus of standard second-quantized field theory. Itsdevelopment was initiated by Bern and Kosower, originally with the aim ofsimplifying the calculation of scattering amplitudes in quantum chromodynamicsand quantum gravity. We give a short account of the original derivation of theBern-Kosower rules from string theory. Strassler's alternative approach interms of first-quantized particle path integrals is then used to generalize theformalism to more general field theories, and, in the abelian case, also tohigher loop orders. A considerable number of sample calculations are presentedin detail, with an emphasis on quantum electrodynamics.
