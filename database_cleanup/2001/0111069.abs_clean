We consider "sliver" states which act as projection operators in the matterstar product of Witten's cubic string field theory. These sliver states, whichmight be associated with Dirichlet p-branes, are not finite norm states in thematter string Hilbert space. We describe the singularities of these states, anddemonstrate that the sliver states are composed of strings having singulargeometric features. These singularities take a particularly simple form in thezero slope limit alpha' -> 0, where the star algebra factorizes into a productof the algebra of functions on space-time and the noncommutative star productof fields associated with higher string modes. An analogy to the slivergeometry suggests a natural mechanism for describing closed string states inopen string field theory.
