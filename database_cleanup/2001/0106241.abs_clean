The possibility to study the M/string theory cosmology via 5d bulk & braneaction is investigated. The role of the 4-form field in the theory of BPSbranes in 5d is clarified. We describe arguments suggesting that the effective4d description of the universe in the ekpyrotic scenario (hep-th/0103239)should lead to contraction rather than expansion of the universe. To verifythese arguments, we study the full 5d action prior to its integration over the5th dimension. We show that if one adds the potential V(Y) to the action of thebulk brane, then the metric ansatz used in the ekpyrotic scenario does notsolve the dilaton and gravitational equations. To find a consistentcosmological solution one must use a more general metric ansatz and a complete5d description of the brane interaction instead of simply adding an effective4d bulk brane potential V(Y).
