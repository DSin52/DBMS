We review the construction of regular p-brane solutions of M-theory andstring theory with less than maximal supersymmetry whose transverse spaces havemetrics with special holonomy, and where additional fluxes allow braneresolutions via transgression terms. We focus on the properties of resolvedM2-branes and fractional D2-branes, whose transverse spaces are Ricci flateight-dimensional and seven-dimensional spaces of special holonomy. We alsoreview fractional M2-branes with transverse spaces corresponding to the newtwo-parameter Spin(7) holonomy metrics, and their connection to fractionalD2-branes with transverse spaces of G_2 holonomy.
