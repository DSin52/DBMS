Starting from the bosonic part of N=2 Super QCD with a 'Seiberg-Witten' N=2breaking mass term, we obtain string BPS conditions for arbitrary semi-simplegauge groups. We show that the vacuum structure is compatible with a symmetrybreaking scheme which allows the existence of Z_k-strings and which hasSpin(10) -> SU(5) x Z_2 as a particular case. We obtain BPS Z_k-stringsolutions and show that they satisfy the same first order differentialequations as the BPS string for the U(1) case. We also show that the stringtension is constant, which may cause a confining potential between monopolesincreasing linearly with their distance.
