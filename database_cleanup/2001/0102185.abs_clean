We obtain a simple explicit expression for the hyper-Kahler Calabi metric onthe co-tangent bundle of CP^{n+1}, for all n, in which it is constructed as ametric of cohomogeneity one with SU(n+2)/U(n) principal orbits. These resultsenable us to obtain explicit expressions for an L^2-normalisable harmonic4-form in D=8, and an L^2-normalisable harmonic 6-form in D=12. We use theformer in order to obtain an explicit resolved M2-brane solution, and we showthat this solution is invariant under all three of the supersymmetriesassociated with the covariantly-constant spinors in the 8-dimensional Calabimetric. We give some discussion of the corresponding dual N=3 three-dimensionalfield theory. Various other topics are also addressed, includingsuperpotentials for the Calabi metrics and the metrics of exceptional G_2 andSpin(7) holonomy in D=7 and D=8. We also present complex and quaternionicconifold constructions, associated with the cone metrics whose resolutions areprovided by the Stenzel T^*S^{n+1} and Calabi T^*\CP^{n+1} metrics. In thelatter case we relate the construction to the hyper-Kahler quotient. We thenuse the hyper-K\"ahler quotient to give a quaternionic rederivation of theCalabi metrics.
