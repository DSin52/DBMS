We discuss the non-linear gravitational interactions in the Randall-Sundrumsingle brane model. If we naively write down the 4-dimensional effective actionintegrating over the fifth dimension with the aid of the decomposition withrespect to eigen modes of 4-dimensional d'Alembertian, the Kaluza-Klein modecoupling seems to be ill-defined. We carefully analyze second orderperturbations of the gravitational field induced on the 3-brane under theassumption of the static and axial-symmetric 5-dimensional metric. It is shownthat there remains no pathological feature in the Kaluza-Klein mode couplingafter the summation over all different mass modes. Furthermore, the leadingKaluza-Klein corrections are shown to be sufficiently suppressed in comparisonwith the leading order term which is obtained by the zero mode truncation. Weconfirm that the 4-dimensional Einstein gravity is approximately recovered onthe 3-brane up to second order perturbations.
