We determine the consistent D-brane configurations in type IInonsupersymmetric Melvin Background. The D-branes are analysed from threepartition function and the boundary state approach. We show the agreement ofthe results obtained by the three different approaches. Among the surprisingfeatures is the existence of supersymmetric branes, some of them having aquasi-periodic direction. We also discuss the generalisation to backgroundswith several magnetic fields, some of them preserving in the closed and theopen spectra some amount of supersymmetry. The case of rational magnetic flux,equivalent to freely-acting noncompact orbifolds, is also studied. It allowsmore possibilities of consistent D-brane configurations.
