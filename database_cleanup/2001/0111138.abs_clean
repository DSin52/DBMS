As shown recently 2d quantum gravity theories -- including sphericallyreduced Einstein-gravity -- after an exact path integral of its geometric partcan be treated perturbatively in the loops of (scalar) matter. Obviously theclassical mechanism of black hole formation should be contained in the treeapproximation of the theory. This is shown to be the case for the scattering oftwo scalars through an intermediate state which by its effective black holemass is identified as a "virtual black hole". We discuss the lowest order treevertex for minimally and non-minimally coupled scalars and find a non-trivialfinite S-matrix for gravitational s-wave scattering in the latter case.
