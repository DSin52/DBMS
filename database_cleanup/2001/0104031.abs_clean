Title: From Superalgebras to Superparticles and Superbranes

Comments: Ph.D. dissertation, 173 pages, LaTex

In this work we investigate connections between superalgebras and theirrealizations in terms of particles, branes and field theory models. We startfrom Poincar\'e superalgebras with brane charges and study its representations.The existence of new supermultiplets in different dimensions including an ultrashort supermultiplet in D=11 different from the supergravity multiplet isshown. Generalizations of superalgebras containing brane charges, includingthose in D$>$11 are considered. The realization of these algebras at the levelof relativistic particle models and, upon quantization, at the level of fieldtheory is presented. Application of Hamiltonian/BRST methods of quantization ofsystems with mixture of first and second class constraints as well as aconversion method are discussed for the models of interest. Using quantizationof particle mechanics we obtain information on the spectrum and linearizedequations of motion of the perturbative, linearized M-theory. Thegeneralization of particle models to p-branes is made using a geometricalformulation of superembedding approach to study the example of L-branes whichhave a linear multiplet on their worldvolume. The p-branes and strings inB-field are considered as well as the origin of noncommutativity andnon-associativity in their low-energy limit. It is shown that the applicationof Hamiltonian/BRST methods for those models leads to stringy version ofSeiberg-Witten map and the removal of the non-associativity/noncommutativity.
