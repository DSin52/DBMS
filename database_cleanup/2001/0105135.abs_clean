The nonlinear $n$-supersymmetry with holomorphic supercharges is investigatedfor the 2D system describing the motion of a charged spin-1/2 particle in anexternal magnetic field. The universal algebraic structure underlying theholomorphic $n$-supersymmetry is found. It is shown that the essentialdifference of the 2D realization of the holomorphic $n$-supersymmetry from the1D case recently analysed by us consists in appearance of the central chargeentering non-trivially into the superalgebra. The relation of the 2Dholomorphic $n$-supersymmetry to the 1D quasi-exactly solvable (QES) problemsis demonstrated by means of the reduction of the systems with hyperbolic ortrigonometric form of the magnetic field. The reduction of the$n$-supersymmetric system with the polynomial magnetic field results in thefamily of the one- dimensional QES systems with the sextic potential. Unlikethe original 2D holomorphic supersymmetry, the reduced 1D supersymmetryassociated with $x^6+...$ family is characterized by the non-holomorphicsupercharges of the special form found by Aoyama et al.
