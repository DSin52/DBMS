227-241The propagator and complete sets of in- and out-solutions of wave equation,together with Bogoliubov coefficients, relating these solutions, are obtainedfor vector $W$-boson (with gyromagnetic ratio $g=2$) in a constantelectromagnetic field. When only electric field is present the Bogoliubovcoefficients are independent of boson polarization and are the same as forscalar boson. When both electric and magnetic fields are present and collinear,the Bogoliubov coefficients for states with boson spin perpendicular to thefield are again the same as in scalar case. For $W^-$ spin along (against) themagnetic field the Bogoliubov coefficients and the contributions to theimaginary part of the Lagrange function in one loop approximation are obtainedfrom corresponding expressions for scalar case by substitution $m^2\to m^2+2eH$$(m^2\to m^2-2eH)$. For gyromagnetic ratio $g=2$ the vector boson interactionwith constant electromagnetic field is described by the functions, which can beexpected by comparing wave functions for scalar and Dirac particle in constantelectromagnetic field.
