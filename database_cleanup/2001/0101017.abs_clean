We consider N=1,2 superconformal mechanics in 0+1 dimensions and show that ifthe Hamiltonian is invertible the superconformal generators can be used toconstruct half of the super Virasoro algebra. The full algebra can be derivedif the special conformal generator is also invertible. The generators arequantized and a general prescription is given for the construction of the N=1algebra independently of the specific details of the superconformal mechanicsprovided that in addition its quadratic Casimir operator vanishes.
