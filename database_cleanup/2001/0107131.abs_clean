Title: String Theory on AdS_3/Z_N

Authors: John Son

Comments: 13 pages

We study string theory on singular Z_N quotients of AdS_3, corresponding tospaces with conical defects. The spectrum is computed using the orbifoldprocedure. It is shown that spectral flow may be used to generate the twistedsectors. We further compute the thermal partition function and show that itcorrectly reproduces the spectrum.
