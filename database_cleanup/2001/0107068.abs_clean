We present a series of instanton-like solutions to a matrix model whichsatisfy a self-duality condition and possess an action whose value is, towithin a fixed constant factor, an integer l^2. For small values of thedimension n^2 of the matrix algebra the integer resembles the result of aquantization condition but as n -> \infty the ratio l/n can tend to anarbitrary real number between zero and one.
