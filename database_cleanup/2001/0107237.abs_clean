We show that in the system of two fermions interacting by scalar exchange,the solutions for J$^{\pi}$=$0^+$ bound states are stable without any cutoffregularization, for values of the coupling constant $\alpha$ below a criticalvalue $\alpha_c$. This latter is calculated from an eigenvalue equation.
