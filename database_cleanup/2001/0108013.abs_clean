A general analysis of the induced brane dynamics is performed when theintrinsic curvature term is included in the action. Such a term is known tocause dramatic changes and is generically induced by quantum corrections comingfrom the bulk gravity and its coupling with matter living on the brane. Theinduced brane dynamics is shown to be the usual Einstein dynamics coupled to awell defined modified energy-momentum tensor. In cosmology, conventionalgeneral relativity revives for an initial era whose duration depends on thevalue of the five-dimensional Planck mass. Violations of energy conditions maybe possible, as well as matter inhomogeneities on the brane in (A)dS_{5} orMinkowski backgrounds. A new anisotropic cosmological solution is given in theabove context. This solution, for a fine-tuned five-dimensional cosmologicalconstant, exhibits an intermediate accelerating phase which is followed by anera corresponding to a 4D perfect fluid solution with no future horizons.
