We construct supergravity solutions dual to twisted field theories that arethe worldvolume theories of D4-branes wrapped on 2, 3-cycles, and NS-fivebraneson 3-cycles. We first obtain the solutions for the Romans' six-dimensionalgauged supergravity theories and then up-lift them to ten dimensions. Inparticular, we find solutions for field configurations with either non-Abelianfields or B-fields being excited. One of these solutions, in the massless case,is up-lifted to the massless type IIA string theory. This is the first exampleof such a kind. The cases studied provide new examples of the AdS/CFT dualityinvolving twisted field theories.
