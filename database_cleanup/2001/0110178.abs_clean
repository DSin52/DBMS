We consider Schwinger type processes involving the creation of the charge andmonopole pairs in the external fields and propose interpretation of theseprocesses via corresponding brane configurations in Type IIB string theory. Wesuggest simple description of some new interesting nonperturbative processeslike monopole/dyon transitions in the electric field and W-boson decay in themagnetic field using the brane language. Nonperturbative pair production in thestrong coupling regime using the AdS/CFT correspondence is studied. Thetreatment of the similar processes in the noncommutative theories whennoncommutativity is traded for the background fields is presented and thepossible role of the critical magnetic field which is S-dual to the criticalelectric field is discussed.
