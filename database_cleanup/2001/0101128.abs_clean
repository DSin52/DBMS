We develop a mathematically precise framework for the Casimir effect. Ourworking hypothesis, verified in the case of parallel plates, is that only theregularization-independent Ramanujan sum of a given asymptotic seriesparallel plates, identifying a previous cutoff free version (by G. Scharf andW. W.) as a special case, and the sphere.We finally discuss the open problem ofthe Casimir force for the cube. We propose an Ansatz for the exterior force andargue why it may provide the exact solution, as well as an explanation of therepulsive sign of the force.
