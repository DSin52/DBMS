We demonstrate how one can describe explicitly the present arbitrariness insolutions of relativistic wave equations in external electromagnetic fields ofspecial form. This arbitrariness is connected to the existence of atransformation, which reduces effectively the number of variables in theinitial equations. Then we use the corresponding representations to constructnew sets of exact solutions, which may have a physical interest. Namely, wepresent new sets of stationary and nonstationary solutions in magnetic fieldand in some superpositions of electric and magnetic fields.
