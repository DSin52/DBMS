Near-extremal black holes are obtained by exciting the Ramond sector of theD1-D5 CFT, where the ground state is highly degenerate. We find that the dualgeometries for these ground states have throats that end in a way that ischaracterized by the CFT state. Below the black hole threshold we find adetailed agreement between propagation in the throat and excitations of theCFT. We study the breakdown of the semiclassical approximation and relate thesemiclassical evolution breaks down if hypersurfaces stretch too much during anevolution. We find that a volume V stretches to a maximum throat depth of V/2G.
