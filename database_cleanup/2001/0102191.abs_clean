We propose a technique called dimensional descent to show that Wigner'slittle group for massless particles, which acts as a generator of gaugetransformation for usual Maxwell theory, has an identical role even fortopologically massive gauge theories. The examples of $B\wedge F$ theory andMaxwell-Chern-Simons theory are analyzed in details.
