We show how the level matching condition in six dimensional, abelian andsupersymmetric orbifolds of the E_8 x E_8 heterotic string can be givenequivalently in terms of fractional gauge and gravitational instanton numbers.This relation is used to restate the classification of the orbifolds in termsof flat bundles away from the orbifold singularities under the constraint ofthe level matching condition. In an outlook these results are applied toKaluza-Klein monopoles of the heterotic string on S^1 in Wilson linebackgrounds.
