In this report we study the dual equivalence between the generalizedself-dual (SD) and topologically massive (TM) models. To this end we linearizethe model using an auxiliary field and apply a gauge embedding procedure toconstruct a gauge equivalent model. We clearly show that, under the aboveconditions, a nonlinear SD model always has a duality equivalent TM action.Thegeneral result obtained is then particularized for a number of examples,including the Born-Infeld-Chern-Simons (BICS) model recently discussed in theliterature.
