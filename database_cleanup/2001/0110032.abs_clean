Physics, Budapest, 12-18 July 2001The formulation of 2d-dilaton theories, like spherically reduced Einsteingravity, is greatly facilitated in a formulation as a first order theory withnonvanishing bosonic torsion. This is especially also true at the quantumlevel. The interpretation of superextensions as graded Poisson sigma models isfound to cover generically all possible 2d supergravities. Superfields and thussuperfluous auxiliary fields are avoided altogether. The procedure shows thatgeneralizations of bosonic 2d models are highly ambiguous.
