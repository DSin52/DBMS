In phenomenological models with extra dimensions there is a natural symmetrygroup associated to a brane universe, -- the group of rotations of normalbundle of the brane. We consider Kaluza-Klein gauge fields corresponding tothis group and show that they can be localized on the brane in models withwarped extra dimensions. These gauge fields are coupled to matter fields whichhave nonzero rotation moment around the brane. In a particular example of afour-dimensional brane embedded into six-dimensional asymptoticallyanti-deSitter space, we calculate effective four-dimensional coupling constantbetween the localized fermion zero modes and the Kaluza-Klein gauge field.
