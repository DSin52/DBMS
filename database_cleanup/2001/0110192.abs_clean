The chiral primary operators of the D=6 superconformal (2,0) theorycorresponding to 14 scalars of N=4 D=7 supergravity are obtained by expandingthe world volume action for the M5-brane around an AdS_7 x S^4 background. Inthe leading order, the operators take their values in the symmetric tracelessrepresentation of the SO(5) R-symmetry group in consistency with the earlyconjecture on their structure based on the superconformal symmetry andMatrix-like model arguments.
