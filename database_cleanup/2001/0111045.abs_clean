In this paper we apply the anholonomic frames method developed in refs. [1-4]to construct and study anisotropic vacuum field configurations in 5D gravity.Starting with an off--diagonal 5D metric, parameterized in terms of severalansatz functions, we show that using anholonomic frames greatly simplifies theresulting Einstein field equations. These simplified equations contain aninteresting freedom in that one can chose one of the ansatz functions and thendetermine the remaining ansatz functions in terms of this choice. As exampleswe take one of the ansatz functions to be a solitonic solution of either theKadomtsev-Petviashvili equation or the sine-Gordon equation. There are severalinteresting physical consequences of these solutions. First, a certain subclassof the solutions discussed in this paper have an exponential warp factorsimilar to that of the Randall-Sundrum model. However, the warp factor dependson more than just the 5$^{th}$ coordinate. In addition the warp factor arisesfrom anisotropic vacuum solution rather than from any explicit matter. Second,the solitonic character of these solutions might allow them to be interpretedeither as gravitational models for particles (i.e. analogous to the ' tHooft-Polyakov monopole, but in the context of gravity), or as nonlinear,anisotropic gravitational waves.
