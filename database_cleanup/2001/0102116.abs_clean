Consistent couplings between an Abelian gauge field and three types of matterfields are investigated by means of the Hamiltonian BRST deformation theorybased on cohomological techniques. In this manner, scalar electrodynamics, theStuckelberg theory for Abelian zero- and one-forms, respectively, spinorelectrodynamics, are inferred.
