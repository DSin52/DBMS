We report yes-go and no-go results on consistent cross-couplings for acollection of gravitons. Motivated by the search of theories where multipletsof massless spin-two fields cross-interact, we look for all the consistentdeformations of a positive sum of Pauli-Fierz actions. We also investigate theproblem of deforming a (positive and negative) sum of linearized Weyl gravityactions and show explicitly that there exists multi-Weyl-graviton theories. Asthe single-graviton Weyl theory, these theories do not have an energy boundedfrom below.
