The loop representation formulation of non-relativistic particles coupledwith abelian gauge fields is studied. Both Maxwell and Chern-Simonsinteractions are separately considered. It is found that the loop-spaceformulations of these models share significant similarities, although in theChern-Simons case there exists an unitary transformation that allows to removethe degrees of freedom associated with the paths. The existence of thistransformation, which allows to make contact with the anyonic interpretation ofthe model, is subjected to the fact that the charge of the particles bequantized. On the other hand, in the Maxwell case, we find that chargequantization is necessary in order to the geometric representation beconsistent.
