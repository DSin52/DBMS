After a brief presentation of the exact renormalization group equation, weillustrate how the field theoretical (perturbative) approach to criticalphenomena takes place in the more general Wilson (nonperturbative) approach.Notions such as the continuum limit and the renormalizability and the presenceof singularities in the perturbative series are discussed.
