We derive dynamical equations to describe a single 3-brane containing fluidmatter and a scalar field coupling to the dilaton and the gravitational fieldin a five dimensional bulk. First, we show that a scalar field or an arbitraryfluid on the brane cannot evolve to cancel the cosmological constant in thebulk. Then we show that the Randall-Sundrum model is unstable under smalldeviations from the fine-tuning between the brane tension and the bulkcosmological constant and even under homogeneous gravitational perturbations.Implications for brane world cosmologies are discussed.
