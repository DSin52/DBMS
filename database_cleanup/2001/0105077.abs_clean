The enhancon mechanism removes a family of time-like singularities fromcertain supergravity spacetimes by forming a shell of branes on which theexterior geometry terminates. The problematic interior geometry is replaced bya new spacetime, which in the prototype extremal case is simply flat. We showthat this excision process, made inevitable by stringy phenomena such asenhanced gauge symmetry and the vanishing of certain D-branes' tension at theshell, is also consistent at the purely gravitational level. The sourceintroduced at the excision surface between the interior and exterior geometriesbehaves exactly as a shell of wrapped D6-branes, and in particular, the tensionvanishes at precisely the enhancon radius. These observations can begeneralised, and we present the case for non-extremal generalisations of thegeometry, showing that the procedure allows for the possibility that theinterior geometry contains an horizon. Further knowledge of the dynamics of theenhancon shell itself is needed to determine the precise position of thehorizon, and to uncover a complete physical interpretation of the solutions.
