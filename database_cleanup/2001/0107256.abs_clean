An informal introduction to our recent work on the principal chiral modelwith boundary. We found that both classically integrable boundary conditionsand quantum boundary S-matrices were classified by the symmetric spaces G/H.The connection is explained by the presence of a twisted Yangian algebra ofnon-local charges.
