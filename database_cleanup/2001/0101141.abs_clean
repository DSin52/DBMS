Marcel Grossmann Meeting (Rome, July 2000). Talk based on hep-th/0011200The quantum completion of the space of connections in a manifold can be seenas the set of all morphisms from the groupoid of the edges of the manifold tothe (compact) gauge group. This algebraic construction generalizes theanalogous description of the gauge-invariant quantum configuration space ofAshtekar and Isham. We present a description of the groupoid approach whichbrings the gauge-invariant degrees of freedom to the foreground, thus makingthe action of the gauge group more transparent.
