We propose a field theoretical model that exhibits spontaneous breaking ofthe rotational symmetry. The model has a two-dimensional sphere as extradimensions of the space-time and consists of a complex scalar field and abackground gauge field. The Dirac monopole, which is invariant under therotations of the sphere, is taken as the background field. We show that whenthe radius of the sphere is larger than a certain critical radius, the vacuumexpectation value of the scalar field develops vortices, which pin down therotational symmetry to lower symmetries. We evaluate the critical radius andcalculate configurations of the vortices by the lowest approximation. Theoriginal model has a $U(1) \times SU(2)$ symmetry and it is broken to U(1),U(1), D_3 for each case of the monopole number q = 1/2, 1, 3/2, respectively,where D_3 is the symmetry group of a regular triangle. Moreover, we show thatthe vortex configurations are stable against higher corrections of theperturbative approximation.
