We consider a reduced model of four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with a massterm. This matrix model has two classical solutions, two-dimensional fuzzysphere and two-dimensional fuzzy torus. These classical solutions areconstructed by embedding them into three or four dimensional flat space. Theyexist for finite size matrices, that is, the number of the quantum on thesemanifolds is finite. Noncommutative gauge theories on these noncommutativemanifolds are derived by expanding the model around these classical solutionsand studied by taking two large $N$ limits, a commutative limit and a largeradius limit. The behaviors of gauge invariant operators are also discussed.
