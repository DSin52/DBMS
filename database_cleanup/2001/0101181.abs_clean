$AdS_{5}$ with linear dilaton and non vanishing $B$-field is shown to be asolution of the non critical string beta function equations. A non critical$(D=5)$ solution interpolating between flat space-time and $AdS_{5}$, withasymptotic linear dilaton and non vanishing $B$-field is also presented. Thissolution is free of space-time singularities and has got the string couplingconstant everywhere bounded. Both solutions admit holographic interpretation interms of ${\cal N}=0$ field theories. Closed string tachyon stability is alsodiscussed.
