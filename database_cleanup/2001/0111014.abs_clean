The Hamiltonian formulation of the dynamics of a relativistic particledescribed by a higher-derivative action that depends both on the first and thesecond Frenet-Serret curvatures is considered from a geometrical perspective.We demonstrate how reparametrization covariant dynamical variables and theirprojections onto the Frenet-Serret frame can be exploited to provide not only asignificant simplification of but also novel insights into the canonicalanalysis. The constraint algebra and the Hamiltonian equations of motion arewritten down and a geometrical interpretation is provided for the canonicalvariables.
