Title: Spectral geometry for strings and branes

Authors: Dmitri V. Vassilevich

Comments: A talk at "Quantum Gravity and Spectral Geometry", Naples, July 2001,

to appear in the ProceedingsJournal-ref: Nucl.Phys.Proc.Suppl. 104 (2002) 208-211

I give a short guide into applications of the heat kernel technique tostring/brane physics with an emphasis on the emerging boundary value problems.
