Results unchangedThe coefficients in the 1/N expansions of the vacuum expectation values andcorrelation functions of Wilson loops, in continuum SU(N) gauge theories in 3+1dimensions, are shown to be determined by a closed and complete set ofequations, called the Group-Variation Equations, that exhibit a simple androbust mechanism for the emergence of massive glueballs and the Wilson arealaw. The equations predict that the cylinder-topology minimal-area spanningsurface term in the two-glueball correlation function, when it exists, must bemultiplied by a pre-exponential factor, which for large area A of theminimal-area cylinder-topology surface, decreases with increasing A at least asfast as $1/\ln(\sigma A)$. If this factor decreases faster than $1/\ln(\sigmaA)$, then the mass $m_{0^{++}}$ of the lightest glueball, and the coefficient$\sigma$ of the area in the Wilson area law, are determined in a preciselyparallel manner, and the equations give a zeroth-order estimate of$m_{0^{++}}/\sqrt{\sigma}$ of 2.38, about 33% less than the best lattice value,without the need for a full calculation of any of the terms in the right-handsides. The large distance behaviour of the vacuum expectation values andcorrelation functions is completely determined by terms called island diagrams,the dominant contributions to which come from islands of \emph{fixed} size ofabout $1/\sqrt{\sigma}$. The value of $\sigma$ is determined by the point atwhich $|\beta(g)/g|$ reaches a critical value, and since the large distancebehaviour of all physical quantities is determined by islands of the fixed size$1/\sqrt{\sigma}$, the running coupling $g^2$ never increases beyond the valueat which $|\beta(g)/g|$ reaches the critical value.
