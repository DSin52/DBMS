We study linearized perturbations of eleven-dimensional $OSp(32|1)$Chern-Simons supergravity. The action contains a term that changes the value ofthe cosmological constant, as considered by Horava. It is shown that thespectrum contains a 3-form and a 6-form whose field strengths are dual to eachother, thus providing a link with the eleven-dimensional supergravity ofCremmer, Julia and Scherk. The linearized equations for the graviton andRarita-Schwinger field are shown to be the standard ones as well.
