The well-known fact that classical automorphisms of (compactified) Minkowskispacetime (Poincare or conformal trandsformations) also allow a naturalderivation/interpretation in the modular setting (in the operator-algebraicsense of Tomita and Takesaki) of the algebraic formulation of QFT has aninteresting nontrivial chiral generalization to the diffeomorphisms of thecircle. Combined with recent ideas on algebraic (d-1)-dimensional lightfrontholography, these diffeomorphisms turn out to be images of ``fuzzy'' actinggroups in the original d-dimensional (massive) QFT. These actions do notrequire any spacetime noncommutativity and are in complete harmony withcausality and localization principles. Their use tightens the relation withkinematic chiral structures on the causal horizon and makes recent attempts toexplain the required universal structure of a possible future quantumBekenstein law in terms of Virasoro algebra structures more palatable.
