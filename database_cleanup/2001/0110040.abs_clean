We study a scale invariant two measures theory where a dilaton field \phi hasno explicit potentials. The scale transformations include a shift\phi\to\phi+const. The theory demonstrates a new mechanism for gene- ration ofscale invariance, the theory develops the exponential potential and, ingeneral, non-linear kinetic term is generated as well. The possibility ofquintessence solutions are shown. As an example, for one choice of theparameters we obtain standard scaling solutions usually used in the context ofthe quintessential scenario. For other choice of the parameters, the theoryallows a scaling solution with equation of state p_{\phi}=w\rho_{\phi} where wis restricted by -1<w<-0.82. The regime where the fermionic matter dominates(as compared to the dilatonic contribution) is analyzed. There it is found thatstarting from a single fermionic field we obtain exactly three different typesof spin 1/2 particles in CEF that appears to suggest a new approach to thefamily problem of particle physics. It is automatically achieved that for twoof them, fermion masses are constants, gravitational equations are canonicaland the "fifth force" is absent. For the third type of particles, a fermionicself-interaction appears as a result of SSB of scale invariance.
