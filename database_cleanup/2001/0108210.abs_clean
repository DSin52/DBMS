D=2,N=2 generalized Wess-Zumino theory is investigated by the dimensionalreduction from D=4,N=1 theory. For each solitonic configuration (i,j) theclassical static solution is solved by the Hamilton-Jacobi method of equivalentone-dimensional classical mechanics. It is easily shown that the Bogomol'nyimass bound is saturated by these solutions and triangular mass inequalityM_{ij}<M_{ik}+M_{kj} is automatically satisfied.
