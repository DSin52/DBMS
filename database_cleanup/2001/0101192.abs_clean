To gain insight into the non-abelian Born-Infeld (NBI) action, we studycoinciding D-branes wrapped on tori, and turn on magnetic fields on theirworldvolume. We then compare predictions for the spectrum of open stringsstretching between these D-branes, from perturbative string theory and from theeffective NBI action. Under some plausible assumptions, we find corrections tothe Str-prescription for the NBI action at order F^6. In the process we give away to classify terms in the NBI action that can be written in terms of fieldstrengths only, in terms of permutation group theory.
