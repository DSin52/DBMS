Realization of the conformal higher spin symmetry on the 4d massless fieldsupermultiplets is given. The self-conjugated supermultiplets, including thelinearized ${\cal N}=4$ SYM theory, are considered in some detail. Dualitybetween non-unitary field-theoretical representations and the unitarydoubleton--type representations of the 4d conformal algebra $su(2,2)$ isformulated in terms of a Bogolyubov transform. The set of 4d massless fields ofall spins is shown to form a representation of $sp(8)$.The obtained results are extended to the generalized superspace invariantunder $osp(L, 2M)$ supersymmetries. World line particle interpretation of thefree higher spin theories in the $osp(2\N, 2M)$ invariant (super)space isgiven. Compatible with unitarity free equations of motion in the $osp(L,2M)$invariant (super)space are formulated. A conjecture on the chain of$AdS_{d+1}/CFT_d \to AdS_{d}/CFT_{d-1} \to ...$ dualities in the higher spingauge theories is proposed.
