The simplest possible noncommutative harmonic oscillator in two dimensions isused to quantize the free closed bosonic string in two flat dimensions. Thepartition function is not deformed by the introduction of noncommutativity, ifwe rescale the time and change the compactification radius appropriately. Thefour point function is deformed, preserving, nevertheless, the sl(2,C)invariance. Finally the first Ward identity of the deformed theory is derived.
