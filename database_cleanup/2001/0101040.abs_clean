The renormalization of effective potentials for the noncommutative scalarfield theory at high temperature are investigated to the two-loopapproximation. The Feynman diagrams in evaluating the effective potential maynonplanar diagrams, which depend on the parameter of noncommutativity, do notappear in the one-loop potential. Despite their appearance in the two-looplevel, they do not have an inclination to restore the symmetry breaking in thetree level, in contrast to the planar diagrams. This phenomenon is explained asa consequence of the drastic reduction of the degrees of freedom in thenonplanar diagrams when the thermal wavelength is smaller than thenoncommutativity scale. Our results show that the nonplanar two-loopcontribution to the effective potential can be neglected in comparsion withthat from the planar diagrams.
