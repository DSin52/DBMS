It is shown that quantum mechanics on noncommutative spaces (NQM) can beobtained by the canonical quantization of some underlying second classconstrained system formulated in extended configuration space. It leads, inparticular, to an intriguing possibility of quantization in terms of theinitial (noncommutative) variables. Two different formulations are discissed.The first one is appropriate for at most quadratic potential. Thenoncommutativity parameter and rank of matrix of the constraint brackets dependon the potential. It explains appearance of two phases of the resulting NQM.The second formulation is appropriate for an arbitrary potential. In both casesthe corresponding Lagrangian action is presented and quantized, which leads toquantum mechanics with ordinary product replaced by the Moyal product.
