We study the SO(4)-symmetric solution of the five-dimensional SU(2) x U(1)gauged N=4 supergravity theory obtained in [hep-th/0101202]. This solutioncontains purely magnetic non-Abelian and electric Abelian fields. It can beinterpreted as a reduction of seven-dimensional gauged supergravity on a torus,which comes from type IIB supergravity on S^3. We also show how to obtain thatsolution from six-dimensional Romans' theory on a circle. We then up-lift thesolution to massless type IIA supergravity. The dual gauge field theory istwisted and is defined on the worldvolume of a NS-fivebrane wrapped on S^3. Twoother spatial directions of the NS-fivebrane are on a torus. In the IR limit itcorresponds to a three-dimensional gauge field theory with two supercharges.
