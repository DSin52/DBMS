Title: World-Sheet String Duality and the Hidden Supersymmetry

Authors: Tamiaki Yoneya

Comments: 12 pages, talk presented at the 10th International Symposium on

String Theory (July 3-7, Fukuoka, Japan, 2001) and a part of lectures givenat the Summer Conference on Strings (July 16-27, Beijing, China, 2001)It is reviewed how space-time supersymmetry is realized nonlinearly in opensuperstring theory without making the GSO projection. We show that theworld-sheet string dualities, viz. dualities of open-closed strings and ofopen-open strings, play crucial roles for the existence of 10 dimensional N=2supersymmetry in a spontaneously broken phase. We also speculate on a possiblemechanism of the restoration of supersymmetry from the viewpoint of world-sheetdynamics.
