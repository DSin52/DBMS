We point out that scenarios in which the universe is born from the interiorof a black hole may not posses many of the problems of the Standard Big-Bang(SBB) model. In particular we demonstrate that the horizon problem, flatness,and the structure formation problem might be solved naturally, not necessarilyrequiring a long period of cosmological inflation. The black hole informationloss problem is also discussed. Our conclusions are completely independent ofthe details of general models.
