The Dirac equation for an electron in an external electromagnetic field canbe regarded as a singular set of linear equations for the vector potential.Radford's method of algebraically solving for the vector potential is reviewed,with attention to the additional constraints arising from non-maximality of therank. The extension of the method to general spacetimes is illustrated byexamples in diverse dimensions with both $c$- and $a$-number wavefunctions.
