Sigma models arise frequently in particle physics and condensed-matterphysics as low-energy effective theories. In this paper I compute the exactfree energy at any temperature in two hierarchies of integrable sigma models intwo dimensions. These theories, the SU(N)/SO(N) and O(2P)/O(P) x O(P) models,are asymptotically free and exhibit charge fractionalization. When theinstanton coupling theta=pi, they flow to the SU(N)_1 and O(2P)_1 conformalfield theories, respectively. I also generalize the free energy computation tomassive and massless perturbations of the coset conformal field theoriesSU(N)_k/SO(N)_{2k} and O(2P)_k/O(P)_k x O(P)_k.
