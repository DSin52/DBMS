The Cho-Faddeev-Niemi-Shabanov decomposition of the SU(2) Yang-Mills field isemployed for the calculation of the corresponding Wilsonian effective action toone-loop order with covariant gauge fixing. The generation of a mass scale isobserved, and the flow of the marginal couplings is studied. Our resultsindicate that higher-derivative terms of the color-unit-vector $\mathbf{n}$field are necessary for the description of topologically stable knotlikesolitons which have been conjectured to be the large-distance degrees offreedom.
