Type A N-fold supersymmetry of one-dimensional quantum mechanics can beconstructed by using sl(2) generators represented on a finite dimensionalfunctional space. Using this sl(2) formalism we show a general method ofconstructing Type A N-fold supersymmetric models. We also present systematicgeneration of known models and several new models using this method.
