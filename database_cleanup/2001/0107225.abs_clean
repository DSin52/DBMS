In this paper, we describe a method for obtaining the nonabelianSeiberg-Witten map for any gauge group and to any order in theta. The equationsdefining the Seiberg-Witten map are expressed using a coboundary operator, sothat they can be solved by constructing a corresponding homotopy operator. Theambiguities, of both the gauge and covariant type, which arise in this map aremanifest in our formalism.
