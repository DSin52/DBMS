Title: Curvature actions on Spin(n) bundles

Authors: Collin Bennett and Thomas Branson

Comments: 24 pages, LaTeX

We compute the number of linearly independent ways in which a tensor of Weyltype may act upon a given irreducible tensor-spinor bundle V over a Riemannianmanifold. Together with the analogous but easier problem involving actions oftensors of Einstein type, this enumerates the possible curvature actions on V.
