The apparent observation of dark energy poses problems for string theory. Inde Sitter space, or in quintessence models, one cannot define a gauge-invariantS-matrix. We argue that eternal quintessence does not arise in weakly coupledstring theory, but point out that it is difficult to define an $S$-matrix evenin the presence of perturbative potentials for the moduli. The solutions of theFischler-Susskind equations all have Big Bang or Big Crunch Singularities. Webelieve that an S-matrix (or S-vector) exists in this context but cannot becalculated by purely perturbative methods. We study the possibility ofmetastable de Sitter vacua in such weakly coupled scenarios, and conclude thatthe S-matrix of the extreme weak coupling region cannot probe de Sitterphysics.We also consider proposed explanations of the dark energy from the perspectiveof string theory, and find that most are implausible. We note that it ispossible that the axion constitutes both the dark matter and the dark energy.
