The universal formulation of spin exchange models related to Calogero-Mosermodels implies the existence of integrable hierarchies, which have not beenexplored. We show the general structures and features of the spin exchangemodel hierarchies by taking as examples the well-known Heisenberg spin chainwith the nearest neighbour interactions. The energy spectra of the secondmember of the hierarchy belonging to the models based on the $A_r$ root systems$(r=3,4,5)$ are explicitly and {\em exactly} evaluated. They show many manyinteresting features and in particular, much higher degree of degeneracy thanthe original Heisenberg model, as expected from the integrability.
