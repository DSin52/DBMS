We study the holographic principle in the brane cosmology. Especially wedescribe how to accommodate the 5D anti de Sitter Schwarzschild (AdSS$_5$)black hole in the Binetruy-Deffayet-Langlois (BDL) approach of brane cosmology.It is easy to make a connection between a mass $M$ of the AdSS$_5$ black holeand a conformal field theory (CFT)-radiation dominated universe on the brane inthe moving domain wall approach. But this is not established in the BDLapproach. In this case we use two parameters $C_1, C_2$ in the Friedmannequation. These arise from integration and are really related to the choice ofinitial bulk matter. If one chooses a bulk energy density $\rho_B$ to accountfor a mass $M$ of the AdSS$_5$ black hole and the static fifth dimension, aCFT-radiation term with $\rho_{CFT} \sim M/a^{4}$ comes out from the bulkmatter without introducing a localized matter distribution on the brane. Thismeans that the holographic principle can be established in the BDL branecosmology.
