We propose an extended BRST invariant Lagrangian quantization scheme ofgeneral gauge theories based on an explicit realization of the modifiedtriplectic algebra that was announced in our previous investigation(hep-th/0104189). The algebra includes, besides the odd operators $V^a$appearing in the triplectic formalism, also the odd operators $U^a$ introducedwithin modified triplectic quantization, both of which being anti-Hamiltonianvector fields. We show that some even supersymplectic structure defined on thespace of fields and antifields provides the extended BRST path integral with awell-defined integration measure. All the known Lagrangian quantization schemesbased on the extended BRST symmetry are obtained by specifying the (free)parameters of that method.
