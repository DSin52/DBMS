We study the enhancon mechanism for fractional D-branes in conifold andorbifold backgrounds and show how it can resolve the repulson singularity ofthese geometries. In particular we show that the consistency of the excisionprocess requires that the interior space be not empty. In the orbifold case, weexploit the boundary state formalism to obtain an explicit conformaldescription and emphasize the non trivial role of the volume of the internalmanifold.
