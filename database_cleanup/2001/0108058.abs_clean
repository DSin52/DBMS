It is shown that the dimensional reduction of the N_T=2, D=3 Blau-Thompsonmodel to D=2, i.e., the novel topological twist of N=8, D=2 super Yang-Millstheory, provides an example of a Hodge-type cohomological theory. In thattheory the generators of the topological shift, co-shift and gauge symmetry,together with a discrete duality operation, are completely analogous to the deRham cohomology operators and the Hodge *-operation.
