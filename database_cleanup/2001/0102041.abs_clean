We discuss in details a simple, purely bosonic, quantum field theoryasymptotically free, with a dynamically generated mass scale. b) They have aspace of parameters which gets quantum corrections drastically modifying theclassical singularity structure. The quantum theory can have massless solitons,Argyres-Douglas-like CFTs, exhibit confinement, etc... c) The physics can, to alarge extent, be worked out in models with a large number of supersymmetries aswell as in purely bosonic ones. In the former case, exact BPS mass formulas canbe derived, brane constructions and embedding in M theory do exist. d) Themodels have an interesting 1/N expansion, and it is possible to define a doublescaling limit in the sense of the ``old'' matrix models when approaching thesingularities in parameter space. These properties make these theories verygood toy models for four dimensional gauge theories with Higgs fields, andprovide a framework where the effects of breaking supersymmetry can beexplicitly studied. In our model, we work out in details the quantum space ofparameters. We obtain the non-local lagrangian description of theArgyres-Douglas-like CFT, and show that it admits a strongly coupled fixedpoint. We also explicitly demonstrate property d). The possibility of definingsuch double scaling limits was not anticipated on the gauge theory side, andcould be of interest to understand the gauge theory/string theorycorrespondence.
