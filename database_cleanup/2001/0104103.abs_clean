Professor E.S.FradkinWe discuss the form of the string-loop-corrected effective action and theloop-corrected solutions of the equations of motion. At the string-tree level,a solution we consider is the extremal magnetic black hole, in which case thetree-level effective gauge couplings decrease at small r, and in this regionstring-loop corrections to the gauge couplings become important. The effective4D theory is the N=2 supergravity interacting with matter. Using the N=2structure of the theory, we calculate the loop corrections to the effectiveaction and solve the loop-corrected equations of motion. In the resultingperturbative solution for the metric, singularity at the origin is smeared byquantum effects.
