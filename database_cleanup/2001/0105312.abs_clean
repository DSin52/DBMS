Title: Quantum Corrections in p-adic String Theory

Authors: Joseph A. Minahan (Uppsala)

Comments: LaTeX, 12 pages, 4 figures

We compute loop corrections in p-adic open string field theory. We argue thatquantum effects induce a pole with m^2 ~ - ln g for the open string field atthe locally stable vacuum. We also compute the one loop effective potential andshow that the potential develops an imaginary piece when the field becomestachyonic.
