We propose a way to identify the gauge invariant operator in noncommutativegauge theory on a D-brane with nonzero B field which couples to a specificsupergravity mode in the bulk. This uses the description of noncommutativegauge theories in terms of ordinary $U(\infty)$ gauge theories in lowerdimensions. The proposal is verified in the DBI approximation. Other authorshave shown that the proposal is also consistent with explicit string worldsheetcalculations. We comment on implications to holography.
