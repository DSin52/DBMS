The non-linear behaviour of Randall-Sundrum gravity with one brane isexamined. Due to the non-compact extra dimension, the perturbation spectrum hasno mass gap, and the long wavelength effective theory is only understoodperturbatively. The full 5-dimensional Einstein equations are solvednumerically for static, spherically symmetric matter localized on the brane,yielding regular geometries in the bulk with axial symmetry. An ellipticrelaxation method is used, allowing both the brane and asymptotic radiationboundary conditions to be simultaneously imposed. The same data that specifiesstars in 4-dimensional gravity, uniquely constructs a 5-dimensional solution.The algorithm performs best for small stars (radius less than the AdS length)yielding highly non-linear solutions. An upper mass limit is observed for thesesmall stars, and the geometry shows no global pathologies. The geometricperturbation is shown to remain localized near the brane at high densities, theconfinement interestingly increasing for both small and large stars as theupper mass limit is approached. Furthermore, the static spatial sections arefound to be approximately conformal to those of AdS. We show that the intrinsicgeometry of large stars, with radius several times the AdS length, is describedby 4-dimensional General Relativity far past the perturbative regime. Thisindicates that the non-linear long wavelength effective action remains local,even though the perturbation spectrum has no mass gap. The implication is thatRandall-Sundrum gravity, with localized brane matter, reproduces relativisticastrophysical solutions, such as neutron stars and massive black holes,consistent with observation.
