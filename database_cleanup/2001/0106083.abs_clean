Title: Cosmological constant problems and their solutions

Comments: 19 pages, revtex. Based on talks given at ``The dark Universe''

(Space Telescope Institute) and PASCOS-2001 in April 2001is so small and (ii) why it comes to dominate at about the epoch of galaxyformation. Anthropic selection appears to be the only approach that cannaturally resolve both problems. The challenge presented by this approach isthat it requires scalar fields with extremely flat potentials or four-formfields coupled to branes with an extremely small charge. Some recentsuggestions are reviewed on how such features can arise in particle physicsmodels.
