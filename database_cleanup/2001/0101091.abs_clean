We include the brane curvature scalar to study its cosmological implicationin the brane world cosmology. This term is usually introduced to obtain thewell-defined stress-energy tensor on the boundary of anti deSitter-Schwarzschild space. Here we treat this as the perturbed term forcosmological purpose. We find corrections to the well-known equation of thebrane cosmology. It contains new interesting terms which may play the importantrole in the brane cosmology.
