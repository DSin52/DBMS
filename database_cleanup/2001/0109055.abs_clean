Compactifications of M-theory on singular manifolds contain additionalcharged massless states descending from M-branes wrapped on vanishing cycles.We construct the first explicit example of a complete supergravity Lagrangianthat includes such extra states. This is done for a compactification on aCalabi-Yau threefold that develops a genus zero curve of A_1 singularities atthe boundary of the K\"ahler cone with a resulting SU(2) gauge symmetryenhancement. The corresponding SU(2) gauged supergravity Lagrangian includestwo charged and two neutral vector multiplets, and turns out to be uniquelyfixed by the Calabi-Yau geometry and by the effective ungauged Lagrangiandescribing the Coulomb branch. One can see explicitly how resolving thesingularity corresponds to a supersymmetric Higgs effect in the gaugedsupergravity description. The elementary transformation relating the twofamilies of smooth Calabi-Yau resolutions of the singularity acts as the SU(2)Weyl twist. The resulting structure appears to be very rigid and is likely toapply to other types of singularities and manifolds as well.
