The solutions of 10 and 11 dimensional supergravity that are warped productsof de Sitter space with a non-compact `internal' space are investigated. Aconvenient form of the metric is found and it is shown that in each case theinternal space is asymptotic to a cone over a product of spheres. A consistenttruncation gives gauged supergravities with non-compact gauge groups. The BPSdomain wall solutions of the non-compact gauged supergravities are lifted towarped solutions in 10 or 11 dimensions.
