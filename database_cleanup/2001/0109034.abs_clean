The solitons of the SO(3) gauged Skyrme model with no pion-mass potentialwere studied in Refs. {nl,jmp}. Here, the effects of the inclusion of thispotential are studied. In contrast with the (ungauged) Skyrme model, where theeffect of this potential on the solitons is marginal, here it turns out to bedecisive, resulting in very different dependence of the energy as a function ofthe Skyrme coupling constant.
