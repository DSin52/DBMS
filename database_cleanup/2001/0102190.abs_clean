A proof that the prepotential for pure N=2 Super-Yang-Mills theory associatedwith Lie algebras B_r and C_r satisfies the generalized WDVV(Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde) system was given by Marshakov, Mironov andMorozov. Among other things, they use an associative algebra of holomorphicdifferentials. Later Ito and Yang used a different approach to try toaccomplish the same result, but they encountered objects of which it is unclearwhether they form structure constants of an associative algebra. We show byexplicit calculation that these objects are none other than the structureconstants of the algebra of holomorphic differentials.
