The multi-field generalisation of the Bateman equation arises fromconsiderations of the continuation of String and Brane equations to the casewhere the base space is of higher dimension than the target space. The complexextension of this equation possesses a remarkably large invariance group, andadmits a very simple implicit form for its general solution, in addition to thespecial case of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic explicit solutions. A class ofinequivalent Lagrangians for this equation is discovered.
