We study topological defects as inhomogeneous (localized) condensates ofparticles in Quantum Field Theory. In the framework of the Closed-Time-Pathformalism, we consider explicitly a $(1+1)$ dimensional $\la \psi^4$ model andconstruct the Heisenberg picture field operator $\psi$ in the presence ofkinks. We show how the classical kink solutions emerge from the vacuumexpectation value of such an operator in the Born approximation and/or $\la \to0$ limit. The presented method is general in the sense that applies also to thecase of finite temperature and to non-equilibrium; it also allows for thedetermination of Green's functions in the presence of topological defects. Wediscuss the classical kink solutions at $T\neq 0$ in the high temperaturelimit. We conclude with some speculations on the possible relevance of ourmethod for the description of the defect formation during symmetry-breakingphase transitions.
