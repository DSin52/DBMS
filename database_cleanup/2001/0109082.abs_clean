We present examples of four dimensional, non-supersymmetric field theories inwhich ultraviolet supersymmetry breaking effects, such as bose-fermi splittingsand the vacuum energy, are suppressed by $(\alpha/4 \pi)^{N}$, where $\alpha$is a weak coupling factor and $N$ can be made arbitrarily large. The particlecontent and interactions of these models are conveniently represented by agraph with sites and links, describing the gauge theory space structure. Whilethe theories are supersymmetric ``locally'' in theory space, supersymmetry canbe explicitly broken by topological obstructions.
