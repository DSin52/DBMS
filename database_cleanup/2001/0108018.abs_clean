Title: The local potential approximation of the renormalization group

Comments: Thesis, March 1999. LaTeX, 126 pages, 25 figs

We introduce Wilson's, or Polchinski's, exact renormalization group, andreview the Local Potential Approximation as applied to scalar field theory.Focusing on the Polchinski flow equation, standard methods are investigated,and by choosing restrictions to some sub-manifold of coupling constant space wearrive at a very promising variational approximation method. Within the LocalPotential Approximation, we construct a function, C, of the coupling constants;it has the property that (for unitary theories) it decreases monotonicallyalong flows and is stationary only at fixed points - where it `counts degreesof freedom', i.e. is extensive, counting one for each Gaussian scalar. In thelatter part of the thesis, the Local Potential Approximation is used to derivea non-trivial Polchinski flow equation to include Fermi fields. Our flowequation does not support chirally invariant solutions and does not reproducethe features associated with the corresponding invariant theories. We solveboth for a finite number of components, N, and within the large N limit. TheLegendre flow equation provides a comparison with exact results in the large Nlimit. In this limit, it is solved to yield both chirally invariant andnon-invariant solutions.
