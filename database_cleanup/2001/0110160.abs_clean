The finite temperature parity-violating contributions to the polarizationtensor are computed at one loop in a system without fermions. The systemstudied is a Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Higgs system in the broken phase, for whichthe parity-violating terms are well known at zero temperature. At nonzerotemperature the static and long-wavelength limits of the parity violating termshave very different structure, and involve non-analytic log terms depending onthe various mass scales. At high temperature the boson loop contribution to theChern-Simons term goes like T in the static limit and like T log T in thelong-wavelength limit, in contrast to the fermion loop contribution whichbehaves like 1/T in the static limit and like log T/T in the long wavelengthlimit.
