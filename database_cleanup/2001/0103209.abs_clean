The extension of the noncommutative u*(N) Lie algebra to noncommutativeorthogonal and symplectic Lie algebras is studied. Using an anti-automorphismof the star-matrix algebra, we show that the u*(N) can consistently berestricted to o*(N) and usp*(N) algebras that have new mathematical structures.We give explicit fundamental matrix representations of these algebras, throughwhich the formulation for the corresponding noncommutative gauge field theoriesare obtained. In addition, we present a D-brane configuration with anorientifold which realizes geometrically our algebraic construction, thusembedding the new noncommutative gauge theories in superstring theory in thepresence of a constant background magnetic field. Some algebraicgeneralizations that may have applications in other areas of physics are alsodiscussed.
