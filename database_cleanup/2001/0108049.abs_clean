Title: Quantum Dirac field without vacuum energy divergence

Authors: Ruo Peng Wang

Comments: 5 pages, RevTeX

A quantum Dirac field theory with no divergences of vacuum energy ispresented. The vacuum energy divergence is eliminated by removing a extradegree of freedom of the Dirac fields. The conditions for removing the extradegree of freedom, expressed in the form of a conservation law and anorthogonality relation, define another spin 1/2 field with the same rest massthat is just the antifermion field. The anticommutation relations for fermionand antifermion fields are imposed by this conservation law. Both fermion andantifermion fields have only states with positive energies due to theorthogonality relation. The expressions of the charge density and the currentdensity are obtained. The charge conservation law is established. A form forcanical quantization applicable to both Boson and Dirac fields is introduced.
