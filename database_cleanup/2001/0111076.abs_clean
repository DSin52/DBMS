and text, New references added. Typos correctedThe noncommutative star product of phase space functions is, by construction,associative for both non-degenerate and degenerate case (involving only secondclass constraints) as has been shown by Berezin, Batalin and Tyutin. However,for the latter case, the manifest associativity is lost if an arbitrarycoordinate system is used but can be restored by using an unconstrainedcanonical set.The existence of such a canonical transformation is guaranteed by a theoremdue to Maskawa and Nakajima. In terms of these new variables, the Kontsevichseries for the star product reduces to an exponential series which ismanifestly associative. We also show, using the star product formalism, thatthe angular momentum of a particle moving on a circle is quantized.
