We construct the covariant, spinor sets of relativistic wave equations for amassless field on the basis of the two copies of the R-deformed Heisenbergalgebra. For the finite-dimensional representations of the algebra they give auniversal description of the states with integer and half-integer helicity. Theinfinite-dimensional representations correspond formally to the massless stateswith fractional (real) helicity. The solutions of the latter type, however,break down the (3+1)$D$ Poincar\'e invariance to the (2+1)$D$ Poincar\'einvariance, and via a compactification on a circle a consistent theory formassive anyons in $D$=2+1 is produced. A general analysis of the ``helicityequation'' shows that the (3+1)$D$ Poincar\'e group has no massless irreduciblerepresentations with the trivial non-compact part of the little groupconstructed on the basis of the infinite-dimensional representations of$sl(2,\CC)$. This result is in contrast with the massive case where integer andhalf-integer spin states can be described on the basis of such representations,and means, in particular, that the (3+1)$D$ Dirac positive energy covariantequations have no massless limit.
