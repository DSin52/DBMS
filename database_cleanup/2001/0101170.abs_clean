We present an analysis of the canonical structure of the WZW theory withuntwisted conformal boundary conditions. The phase space of the boundary theoryon a strip is shown to coincide with the phase space of the Chern-Simons theoryon a solid cylinder (a disc times a line) with two Wilson lines. This reveals anew aspect of the relation between two-dimensional boundary conformal fieldtheories and three-dimensional topological theories. A decomposition of theChern-Simons phase space on a punctured disc in terms of the one on a puncturedsphere and of coadjoint orbits of the loop group easily lends itself toquantization, providing at the same time a quantization of the boundary WZWmodel.
