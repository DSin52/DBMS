Title: Chiral Phase Transitions

Authors: M. D. Scadron and P. Zenczykowski

Comments: 13 pages, 1 figure included

We show that melting the quark mass, the scalar $\sigma $ mass and the quarkcondensate leads uniquely to the quark-level SU(2) linear $\sigma $ model fieldtheory. Upon thermalization, the chiral phase transition curve requires $T_c=2f^{CL}_{\pi}\approx 180 MeV$ when $\mu = 0$, while the critical chemicalpotential is $\mu_c =m_q\approx 325 MeV$. Transition to the superconductivephase occurs at $T^{(SC)}_c=\Delta /\pi e^{-\gamma_E}$. Coloured diquarkssuggest $T_c^{(SC)}<180 MeV$.
