Title: Tubular Field Theory

Comments: 3 pages, latex

We propose tubular field theory, which is a continuum analogue of latticefield theory. One-dimensional links (and zero-dimensional sites) in latticefield theory are replaced by two-dimensional tubes to result in two-dimensionalspacetime microscopically. As an example, scalar and gauge fields areconsidered in `three-dimensional' tubular spacetime.
