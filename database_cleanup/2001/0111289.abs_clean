Symmetry in Nonlinear Mathematical Physics}, July 9-15, 2001, Kyiv, UKRAINEAs a prototype of powerful non-abelian symmetry in an Integrable System, Iwill show the appearance of a Witt algebra of vector fields in the SG theory.This symmetry does not share anything with the well-known Virasoro algebra ofthe conformal $c=1$ unperturbed limit. Although it is quasi-local in the SGfield theory, nevertheless it gives rise to a local action on $N$-solitonsolution variables. I will explicitly write the action on special variables,which possess a beautiful geometrical meaning and enter the Form Factorexpressions of quantum theory. At the end, I will also give some preliminaryhints about the quantisation.
