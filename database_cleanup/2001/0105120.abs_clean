We propose a new approach to field theory on $\kappa$-Minkowskinon-commutative space-time, a popular example of Lie-algebra space-time. Ourproposal is essentially based on the introduction of a star product, atechnique which is proving to be very fruitful in analogous studies ofcanonical non-commutative space-times, such as the ones recently found to playa role in the description of certain string-theory backgrounds. We find to beincorrect the expectation, previously reported in the literature, that the lackof symmetry of the $\kappa$-Poincare' coproduct should lead to interactionvertices that are not symmetric under exchanges of the momenta of identicalparticles entering the relevant processes. We show that in $\kappa$-Minkowskithe coproduct and the star product must indeed treat momenta in a non-symmetricway, but the overall structure of interaction vertices is symmetric underexchange of identical particles. We also show that in $\kappa$-Minkowski fieldtheories it is convenient to introduce the concepts of "planar" and"non-planar" Feynman loop-diagrams, again in close analogy with thecorresponding concepts previously introduced in the study of field theories incanonical non-commutative space-times.
