We study null bulk geodesic motion in the brane world cosmology in the RS2scenario and in the static universe in the bulk of the charged topological AdSblack hole. We obtain equations describing the null bulk geodesic motion asobserved in one lower dimensions. We find that the null geodesic motion in thebulk of the brane world cosmology in the RS2 scenario is observed to be underthe additional influence of extra non-gravitational force by the observer onthe three-brane, if the brane universe does not possess the Z_2 symmetry. Asfor the null geodesic motion in the static universe in the bulk of the chargedAdS black hole, the extra force is realized even when the brane universe hasthe Z_2 symmetry.
