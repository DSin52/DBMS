A new generalization of the Jack polynomials that incorporates fermionicvariables is presented. These Jack superpolynomials are constructed as thoseeigenfunctions of the supersymmetric extension of the trigonometricCalogero-Moser-Sutherland (CMS) model that decomposes triangularly in terms ofthe symmetric monomial superfunctions. Many explicit examples are displayed.Furthermore, various new results have been obtained for the supersymmetricoperators and the explicit expressions for the conserved charges. Thereformulation of the models in terms of the exchange-operator formalism is acrucial aspect of our analysis.
