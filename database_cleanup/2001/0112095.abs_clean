We conjecture the factorized scattering description for OSP(m/2n)/OSP(m-1/2n)supersphere sigma models and OSP(m/2n) Gross Neveu models. The non-unitarity ofthese field theories translates into a lack of `physical unitarity' of the Smatrices, which are instead unitary with respect to the non-positive scalarproduct inherited from the orthosymplectic structure. Nevertheless, we findthat formal thermodynamic Bethe ansatz calculations appear meaningful,reproduce the correct central charges, and agree with perturbativecalculations. This paves the way to a more thorough study of these and othermodels with supergroup symmetries using the S matrix approach.
