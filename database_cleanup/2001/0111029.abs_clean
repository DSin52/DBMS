Based on a general analysis of Green functions in the real-time thermal fieldtheory, we have proven that the four-point amputated functions in a NJL modelin the fermion bubble diagram approximation behave like usual two-pointfunctions. We expound the thermal transformations of the matrix propagator fora scalar bound state in the $F\bar{F}$ basis and in the $RA$ basis. Theresulting physical causal, advanced and retarded propagator are respectivelyidentical to corresponding ones derived in the imaginary-time formalism andthis shows once again complete equivalence of the two formalisms of thermalfield theory on the discussed problem in the NJL model.
