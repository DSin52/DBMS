We analyze D-brane states and their central charges on the resolution ofC^2/Z_n by using local mirror symmetry. There is a point in the moduli spacewhere all n(n-1)/2 branches of the principal component of the discriminantlocus coincide. We argue that this is the point where compactifications of TypeIIA theory on a K3 manifold containing such a local geometry acquire anon-perturbative gauge symmetry of the type A_{n-1}. This analysis, whichinvolves an explicit solution of the GKZ system of the local geometry, explainshow the quantum geometry exhibits all positive roots of A_{n-1} and not justthe simple roots that manifest themselves as the exceptional curves of theclassical geometry. We also make some remarks related to McKay correspondence.
