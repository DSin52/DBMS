A family of solutions with mass and electric charge of five-dimensionalChern-Simons supergravity is displayed. The action contains an extra term thatchanges the value of the cosmological constant, as considered by Horava. It isshown that the solutions approach asymptotically the Reissner-Nordstromspacetime. The role of the torsion tensor in providing charged solutions isstressed.
