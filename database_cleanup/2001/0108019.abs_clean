We consider the effects of homogeneous Dirichlet's boundary conditions on twoinfinite parallel plane surfaces separated by a small distance {\it a}. We findthat although spontaneous symmetry breaking does not occur for the theory of amassless, quartically self-interacting real scalar field, the theory becomes atheory of a massive scalar field.
