For redundant second-class constraints the Dirac brackets cannot be definedand new brackets must be introduced. We prove here that the Jacobi identity forthe new brackets must hold on the surface of the second-class constraints. Inorder to illustrate our proof we work out explicitly the cases of a fractionalspin particle in 2+1 dimensions and the original Brink-Schwarz masslesssuperparticle in D=10 dimensions in a Lorentz covariant constraints separation.
