We point out that when a D-brane is placed in an NS-NS B field backgroundwith non-vanishing field strength (H=dB) along the D-brane worldvolume, thecoordinate of one end of the open string does not commute with that of theother in the low energy limit. The degrees of the freedom associated with bothends are not decoupled and accordingly, the effective action must be quitedifferent from that of the ordinary noncommutative gauge theory for a constantB background. We construct an associative and noncommutative product whichoperates on the coordinates of both ends of the string and propose a new typeof noncommutative gauge action for the low energy effective theory of aDp-brane. This effective theory is bi-local and lives in twice as largedimensions (2D=2(p+1)) as in the H=0 case. When viewed as a theory in theD-dimensional space, this theory is non-local and we must force the two ends ofthe string to coincide. We will then propose a prescription for reducing thisbi-local effective action to that in D dimensions and obtaining a localeffective action.
