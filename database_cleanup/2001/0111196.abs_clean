Title: Emergent Gauge Bosons

Comments: Contributed to the 4th Workshop "What Comes beyond the Standard

Model?", Bled, Slovenia, July 17-27, 2001The old idea that the photon is a Goldstone boson emergent from aspontaneously broken theory of interacting fermions is revisited. It isconjectured that the gauge-potential condensate has a vacuum expectation valuewhich is very large, perhaps the GUT/Planck momentum scale, but that themagnitude of the effective potential which generates it is very small, so smallthat in the limit of vanishing cosmological constant it would vanish. In thisway, the threat of unacceptably large observable, noncovariant residual effectsis mitigated. The linkage of these ideas to other speculative ideas involvingblack holes and parametrizations of Standard-Model coupling constants is alsodescribed.
