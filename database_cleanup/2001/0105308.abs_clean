We find M-theory solutions with homogeneous fluxes for which the spacetime isa lorentzian symmetric space. We show that generic solutions preserve sixteensupersymmetries and that there are two special points in their moduli space ofparameters which preserve all thirty-two supersymmetries. We calculate thesymmetry superalgebra of all these solutions. We then construct variousM-theory and string theory branes with homogeneous fluxes and we also find newhomogeneous flux-brane solutions.
