We consider the dynamical stability of a static brane model that incorporatesa three-index antisymmetric tensor field and has recently been proposed as apossible solution to the cosmological constant problem. Ultimately, we are ableto establish the existence of time-dependent, purely gravitationalperturbations. As a consequence, the static solution of interest is``dangerously'' located at an unstable saddle point. This outcome is suggestiveof a hidden fine tuning in what is an otherwise self-tuning model.
