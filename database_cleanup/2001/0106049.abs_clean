We consider diquark condensation in external chromomagnetic fields atnon--zero temperature. The general features of this process are investigatedfor various field configurations in relation to their symmetry properties andthe form of the quark spectrum. According to the fields, there arisesdimensional reduction by one or two units. In all cases there exists diquarkcondensation even at arbitrary weak quark attraction, confirming the idea aboutuniversality of this mechanism in a chromomagnetic field. Possible influence ofa nonzero chemical potential on the results obtained is also discussed.
