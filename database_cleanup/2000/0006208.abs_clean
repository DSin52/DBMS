In this paper a new look on the electro-magnetic duality is presented andappropriately exploited. The duality analysis in the nonrelativistic andrelativistic formulations is shown to lead to the idea the mathematical modelfield to be a differential form valued in the 2-dimensional vector space ${\calR}^2$. A full ${\cal R}^2$ covariance is achieved through introducingexplicitly the canonical complex structure ${\cal I}$ of ${\cal R}^2$ in thenonrelativistic equations. The connection of the relativistic Hodge * with${\cal I}$ is shown and a complete coordinate free relativistic form of theequations and the conservative quantities is obtained. The duality symmetry isinterpreted as invariance of the conservative quantities and conservationequations.
