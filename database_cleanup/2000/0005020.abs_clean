Conference, Moscow, June 2000An example of the holographic correspondence between 2d, N=2 quantum fieldtheories and classical 4d, N=2 supergravity theories is found. The constraintson the target space geometry of the 4d, N=2 non-linear sigma-models in N=2supergravity background are interpreted as the renormalization flow equationsin two dimensions. Our geometrical description of the renormalization flow ismanifestly covariant under reparametrization of the 2d coupling constants. Theproposed holography is described in terms of the (Weyl) anti-self-dual Einsteinmetrics, whose exact regular (Tod-Hitchin) solutions are governed by thePainleve VI equation.
