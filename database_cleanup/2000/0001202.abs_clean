The renormalization of quantum field theory twists the antipode of anoncocommutative Hopf algebra of rooted trees, decorated by an infinite set ofprimitive divergences. The Hopf algebra of undecorated rooted trees, ${\calH}_R$, generated by a single primitive divergence, solves a universal problemcocommutative subalgebra ${\cal H}_{\rm ladder}$ of pure ladder diagrams andthe Connes-Moscovici noncocommutative subalgebra ${\cal H}_{\rm CM}$ ofnoncommutative geometry. These three Hopf algebras admit a bigrading by $n$,the number of nodes, and an index $k$ that specifies the degree of primitivity.In each case, we use iterations of the relevant coproduct to compute thedimensions of subspaces with modest values of $n$ and $k$ and infer a simplegenerating procedure for the remainder. The results for ${\cal H}_{\rm ladder}$are familiar from the theory of partitions, while those for ${\cal H}_{\rm CM}$involve novel transforms of partitions. Most beautiful is the bigrading of${\cal H}_R$, the largest of the three. Thanks to Sloane's {\tt superseeker},we discovered that it saturates all possible inequalities. We prove this byusing the universal Hochschild-closed one-cocycle $B_+$, which plugs one set ofdivergences into another, and by generalizing the concept of natural growthbeyond that entailed by the Connes-Moscovici case. We emphasize the yet greaterchallenge of handling the infinite set of decorations of realistic quantumfield theory.
