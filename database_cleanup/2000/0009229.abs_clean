The Z_k-parafermion Hall state is an incompressible fluid of k-electronclusters generalizing the Pfaffian state of paired electrons. Extending ourearlier analysis of the Pfaffian, we introduce two ``parent'' abelian Hallstates which reduce to the parafermion state by projecting out some neutraldegrees of freedom. The first abelian state is a generalized (331) state whichdescribes clustering of k distinguishable electrons and reproduces theparafermion state upon symmetrization over the electron coordinates. Thisdescription yields simple expressions for the quasi-particle wave functions ofthe parafermion state. The second abelian state is realized by a conformaltheory with a (2k-1)-dimensional chiral charge lattice and it reduces to theZ_k-parafermion state via the coset construction su(k)_1+su(k)_1/su(k)_2. Thedetailed study of this construction provides us a complete account of theexcitations of the parafermion Hall state, including the field identifications,the Z_k symmetry and the partition function.
