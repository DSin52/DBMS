We extend the general method of hep-th/0009192 to compute the consistentgauge anomaly for noncommutative 4d SSYM coupled to chiral matter. The choiceof the minimal homotopy path allows us to obtain a simple and compact result.We perform the reduction to components in the WZ gauge proving that our resultcontains, as lowest component, the bosonic chiral anomaly for noncommutative YMtheories recently obtained in literature.
