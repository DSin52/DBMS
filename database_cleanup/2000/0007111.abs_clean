Title: The superfluidity of fermions coupled to gravity

Comments: LaTeX, 10 pages, no figures

We investigate superfluidity of the relativistic fermi-gas with gravitationalinteraction. The excitation spectrum is obtained within the linearized theory.While superfluidity may take place at a definite ratio of the Fermi momentum,rest mass and coupling constant, the metric coefficients play predominant roleforming the gap of excitation spectrum.
