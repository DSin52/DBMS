Title: Actions for Curved Branes

Authors: Mohab Abou-Zeid

Comments: LaTeX, 13 pages, no figures

The nondeterminantal forms of the Born-Infeld and related brane actions inwhich the gauge fields couple to both an induced metric and an intrinsic metricare generalised by letting either or both metrics be dynamical. The resultingactions describe ` brane world' and cosmological scenarios in which the gaugefields are confined to the brane, while gravity propagates in both theworld-volume and the bulk. In particular, for actions involving a nonsymmetric` metric', nonsymmetric gravity propagates on the worldvolume. For 3-braneswith a symmetric metric, conformal (Weyl) gravity propagates on the worldvolumeand has conformally invariant couplings to the gauge fields.
