We propose a time-varying parameter $\underline{\alpha}$ for G\"{o}del metricand an energy momentum tensor corresponding to this geometry is found. Tosatisfy covariance arguments time-varying gravitational and cosmological termare introduced. The ``Einstein's equation'' for this special evolution for theUniverse are written down where expansion, rotation and closed time-like curvesappear as a combination between standard model, G\"{o}del and steady stateproperties are obtained.
