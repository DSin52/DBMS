We study charged brane-world black holes in the model of Randall and Sundrumin which our universe is viewed as a domain wall in asymptotically anti-deSitter space. Such black holes can carry two types of ``charge'', one arisingfrom the bulk Weyl tensor and one from a gauge field trapped on the wall. Weuse a combination of analytical and numerical techniques to study how theseblack holes behave in the bulk. It has been shown that a Reissner-Nordstromgeometry is induced on the wall when only Weyl charge is present. However, weshow that such solutions exhibit pathological features in the bulk. For moregeneral charged black holes, our results suggest that the extent of the horizonin the fifth dimension is usually less than for an uncharged black hole thathas the same mass or the same horizon radius on the wall.
