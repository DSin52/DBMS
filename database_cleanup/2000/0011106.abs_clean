Recent string theory developments suggest the necessity to understandsupersymmetric gauge theories non-perturbatively, in various dimensions. Inthis work we show that there is a standard Hamiltonian formulation thatgenerates a finite and supersymmetric result at every order of the DLCQapproximation scheme. We present this DLCQ renormalized Hamiltonian and solvefor the bound states and the wave functions to verify that it exactlyit automatically chooses the t'Hooft prescription for renormalizing thesingularities and it introduces irrelevant operators that serve to preserve thesupersymmetry and improve the convergence. This is a first step in extendingthe advantages of SDLCQ to non-supersymmetric theories.
