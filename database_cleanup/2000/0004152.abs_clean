The incorrect affiliation of M. S. El Naschie was removedA Cantorian fractal spacetime, a family member of von Neumann'snoncommutative geometry is introduced as a geometry underlying a new relativitytheory which is similar to the relation between general relativity andRiemannian geometry. Based on this model and the new relativity theory anensemble distribution of all the dimensions of quantum spacetime is derivedwith the help of Fermat grand theorem. The calculated average dimension is veryclose to the value of $4+\phi^3 $ (where $\phi$ is the golden mean) obtained byEl Naschie on the basis of a different approach. It is shown that within theframework of the new relativity the cosmological constant problem isnonexistent, since the Universe self-organizes and self-tunes according to therenormalization group (RG) flow with respect to a local scaling microscopicarrow of time. This implies that the world emerged as a result of anon-equilibrium process of self-organized critical phenomena launched by vacuumfluctuations in Cantorian fractal spacetime $\cal E^{\infty}$. It is shown thatwe are living in a metastable vacuum and are moving towards a fixed point ($ D$= 4+$\phi^3$) of the RG. After reaching this point, a new phase transition willdrive the universe to a quasi-crystal phase of the lower average dimension of$\phi^3$.
