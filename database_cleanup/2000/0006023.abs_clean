We study the non-critical space-time non-commutative open string (NCOS)theory using a dual supergravity description in terms of a certain near-horizonlimit of the F1-Dp bound state. We find the thermodynamics of NCOS theory fromsupergravity. The thermodynamics is equivalent to Yang-Mills theory on acommutative space-time. We argue that this fact does not have to be incontradiction with the expected Hagedorn behaviour of NCOS theory. To supportthis we consider string corrections to the thermodynamics. We also discuss therelation to Little String Theory in 6 dimensions.
