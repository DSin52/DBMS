Nacional de Fisica de Particulas e Campos", October 2000, Sao Lourenco,BrazilIn this talk, we present a parity-preserving QED3 model with spontaneousbreaking of a local U(1)-symmetry. The breaking is accomplished by a potentialof the phi^6-type. It is shown that a net attractive interaction appears in theMoeller scattering (s- and p-wave scatterings between two electrons) asmediated by the gauge field and a Higgs scalar. We show, by solving numericallythe Schroedinger equation for both the scattering potentials (s- and p-wave),that in the weak-coupling regime only s-wave bound states appear, whereas inthe strong-coupling regime s- and p-wave bound states show up. Also, we discusspossible applications of the model to the phenomenology of high-Tcsuperconductors and to the re-entrant superconductivity effect.
