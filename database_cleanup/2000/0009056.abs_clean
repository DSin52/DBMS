We investigate cosmological consequences arising from the interaction betweena homogeneous and isotropic brane-universe and the bulk. A Friedmann equationis derived which incorporates both the brane and bulk matter contributions,which are both assumed to be of arbitrary fluid form. In particular, new termsarise which describe the energy flow onto (or away from) the brane, as well aschanges of the equation of state in the bulk. We discuss Randall-Sundrum typemodels as well as dilatonic domain walls and carefully consider the conditionsfor stabilising the induced gravitational constant. Furthermore, consequencesfor cosmological perturbations are analysed. We show that, in general,super-horizon amplitudes are not constant.
