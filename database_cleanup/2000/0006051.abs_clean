We present a gauge independent method to construct the effective action ofQCD, and calculate the one loop effective action of $SU(2)$ QCD in an arbitraryconstant background field. Our result establishes the existence of a dynamicalsymmetry breaking by demonstrating that the effective potential develops aunique and stable vacuum made of the monopole condensation in one loopapproximation. This provides a strong evidence for the magnetic confinement ofcolor through the dual Meissner effect in the non-Abelian gauge theory. Theresult is obtained by separating the topological degrees which describe thenon-Abelian monopoles from the dynamical degrees of the gauge potential, andintegrating out all the dynamical degrees of QCD. We present three independentarguments to support our result.
