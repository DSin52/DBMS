We introduce the general N=1 gauge theory superconformally coupled tosupergravity. The theory has local SU(2,2|1) symmetry and no dimensionalparameters. The superconformal origin of the Fayet-Iliopoulos terms isclarified. The phase of this theory with spontaneously broken conformalsymmetry gives various formulations of N=1 supergravity interacting withmatter, depending on the choice of the R-symmetry fixing.We have found that the locally superconformal theory is useful for describingthe physics of the early universe with a conformally flat FRW metric. Fewapplications of superconformal theory to cosmology include the study of i)particle production after inflation, particularly the non-conformal helicity1/2 states of gravitino, ii) the super-Higgs effect in cosmology and thederivation of the equations for the gravitino interacting with any number ofchiral and vector multiplets in the gravitational background with varyingscalar fields, iii) the weak coupling limit of supergravity andgravitino-goldstino equivalence. This explains why gravitino production in theearly universe is not suppressed in the limit of weak gravitational coupling.We discuss the possible existence of an unbroken phase of the superconformaltheories, interpreted as a strong coupling limit of supergravity.
