We review the de Boer-Verlinde-Verlinde formalism for the renormalizationgroup in the context of Dp brane vacua. We comment on various aspects of thedictionary between bulk and boundary and relate the discussion to theRandall-Sundrum scenario. We find that the gravitational coupling for theRandall-Sundrum gravity on the Dp brane worldvolume is proportional to thec-function of the Yang-Mills theory. We compute the beta function and find theexpected uneventful flow prescribed by the classical dimension of theYang-Mills operator. Finally, we argue for a dynamical mechanism fordetermining the cosmology on the brane.
