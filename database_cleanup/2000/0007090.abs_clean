In the presence of internal magnetic fields, a D9 brane can acquire a D5 (oranti-D5) R-R charge, and can therefore contribute to the corresponding tadpole.In the resulting vacua, supersymmetry is generically broken and tachyonicinstabilities are present. However, suitable choices for the magnetic fields,corresponding to self-dual configurations in the internal space, can yield newchiral supersymmetric vacua with gauge groups of reduced rank, where themagnetic energy saturates, partly or fully, the negative tension of the O5+planes. These models contain Green-Schwarz couplings to untwisted R-R forms notpresent in conventional orientifolds.
