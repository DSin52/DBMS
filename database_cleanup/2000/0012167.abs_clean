We review the boundary state description of D-branes in type I string theoryand show that the only stable non-BPS configurations are the D-particle and theD-instanton. We also compute the gauge and gravitational interactions of thenon-BPS D-particles and compare them with the interactions of the dual non-BPSstates of the heterotic string, finding complete agreement.
