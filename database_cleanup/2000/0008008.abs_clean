We give a proof of the existence of $G=SU(5)$, stable holomorphic vectorbundles on elliptically fibered Calabi--Yau threefolds with fundamental group$\bbz_2$. The bundles we construct have Euler characteristic 3 and an anomalythat can be absorbed by M-theory five-branes. Such bundles provide the basisfor constructing the standard model in heterotic M-theory. They are alsoapplicable to vacua of the weakly coupled heterotic string. We explicitlypresent a class of three family models with gauge group $SU(3)_C\timesSU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$.
