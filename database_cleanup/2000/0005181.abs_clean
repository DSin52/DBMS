Two implicit periodic structures in the solution of sinh-Gordon thermodynamicBethe ansatz equation are considered. The analytic structure of the solution asa function of complex $\theta$ is studied to some extent both analytically andnumerically. The results make a hint how the CFT integrable structures can berelevant in the sinh-Gordon and staircase models. More motivations are figuredout for subsequent studies of the massless sinh-Gordon (i.e. Liouville) TBAequation.
