In this note we address the problem of finding Abelian instantons of finiteenergy on the Euclidean Schwarzschild manifold. This amounts to constructself-dual L^2 harmonic 2-forms on the space. Gibbons found a non-topologicalL^2 harmonic form in the Taub-NUT metric, leading to Abelian instantons withcontinuous energy. We imitate his construction in the case of the EuclideanSchwarzschild manifold and find a non-topological self-dual L^2 harmonic 2-formon it. We show how this gives rise to Abelian instantons and identify them withSU(2)-instantons of Pontryagin number 2n^2 found by Charap and Duff in 1977.Using results of Dodziuk and Hitchin we also calculate the full L^2 harmonicspace for the Euclidean Schwarzschild manifold.
