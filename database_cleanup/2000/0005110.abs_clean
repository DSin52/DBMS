I show that a particle structure in conformal field theory is incompatiblewith interactions. As a substitute one has particle-like exitations whoseinterpolating fields have in addition to their canonical dimension an anomalouscontribution. The spectra of anomalous dimension is given in terms of theLorentz invariant quadratic invariant (compact mass operator) of a conformalgenerator $R_{\mu}$ with pure discrete spectrum. The perturbative reading of$R_{0\text{}}$as a Hamiltonian in its own right i.e. associated with an actionin a functional integral setting naturally leads to the AdS formulation. Theformal service role of AdS in order to access CQFT by a standard perturbativeformalism (without being forced to understand first massive theories and thentaking their scale-invariant limit) vastly increases the realm ofconventionally accessible 4-dim. CQFT beyond those for which one had to useLagrangians with supersymmetry in order to have a vanishing Beta-function.
