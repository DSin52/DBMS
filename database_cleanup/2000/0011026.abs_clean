Title: Quantum Clifford Hopf Gebra for Quantum Field Theory

Authors: Bertfried Fauser

Comments: 10 pages, talk at the Symposium on Quantum Groups, GROUP23

Conference, DUBNA, 2000We give arguments for the necessity to employ Quantum Clifford Hopf Gebras inquantum field theory. The role of the antipode is examined, Feynman diagramsare re-interpreted as tangles of graphical calculus. Regularization due to thedesign of convolution Hopf gebras is given as a program for further research.
