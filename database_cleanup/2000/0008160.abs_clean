The attempt to understand if AdS/CFT correspondence may be realized as theone between some AdS-like cosmological space and CFT living on the boundary ismade. In order to obtain such cosmology we exchange the time and radialcoordinates in d5 Schwarzschild-anti de Sitter (S-AdS) BH (with correspondingsignature change). The test on proportionality of free energies from such d5cosmological space (after AdS/CFT identification of parameters) and from ${\calN}=4$ SU(N) super Yang-Mills quantum theory is successfully passed.
