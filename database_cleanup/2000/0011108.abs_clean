Title: Background Independent Open String Field Theory and Constant B-Field

Authors: D.Nemeschansky and V. Yasnov

Comments: 11 pages

We calculate the background independent action for bosonic and supersymmetricopen string field theory in a constant B-field. We also determine the tachyoneffective action in the presence of constant B-field.
