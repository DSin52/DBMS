Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we show that the Anti-de Sitter (AdS)rotating (Kerr) black holes in five and seven dimensions provide us withexamples of non-trivial field theories which are scale, but not conformallyinvariant. This is demonstrated by our computation of the actions and thestress-energy tensors of the four and six dimensional field theories residingon the boundary of these Kerr-AdS black holes spacetimes.
