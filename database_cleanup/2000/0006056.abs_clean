It is widely believed that via the Seiberg-Witten map, the linearly realizedBPS equation in the non-commutative space is related to the non-linearlyrealized BPS equation in the commutative space in the zero slope limit. We showthat the relation also holds without taking the zero slope limit as is expectedfrom the arguments of the BPS equation for the non-Abelian Born-Infeld theory.This is regarded as an evidence for the relation between the two BPS equations.As a byproduct of our analysis, the non-linear instanton equation is solvedexactly.
