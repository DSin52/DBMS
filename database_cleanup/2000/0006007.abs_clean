We discuss the evolution of gravitational waves in a brane-world cosmologyembedded in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. We show that duringslow-roll inflation, modelled as a period of quasi-de Sitter expansion on thebrane, there is a discrete normalizable massless graviton mode. There is a massgap due to the expansion, above which there is a continuum of massive modes.Only the massless mode is `light' compared with the Hubble scale duringinflation, leading to the production of classical perturbations on large scalesfrom vacuum fluctuations on small scales. We calculate the amplitude of thesefluctuations at horizon-crossing and show that the standard four-dimensionalresult is recovered at low energies, but the amplitude of the perturbations isenhanced at high energies.
