An anti-self-dual instanton solution in Yang-Mills theory on noncommutative${\R}^4$ with an anti-self-dual noncommutative parameter is constructed. Thesolution is constructed by the ADHM construction and it can be treated in theframework of the IIB matrix model. In the IIB matrix model, this solution isinterpreted as a system of a Dp-brane and D(p+4)-branes, with the Dp-branedissolved in the worldvolume of the D(p+4)-branes. The solution has a parameterthat characterises the size of the instanton. The zero of this parametercorresponds to the singularity of the moduli space. At this point, the solutionis continuously connected to another solution which can be interpreted as asystem of a Dp-brane and D(p+4)-branes, with the Dp-brane separated from theD(p+4)-branes. It is shown that even when the parameter of the solution comesto the singularity of the moduli space, the gauge field itself is non-singular.A class of multi-instanton solutions is also constructed.
