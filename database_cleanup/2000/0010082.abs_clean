Talk given by GMTW at "Nonperturbative Quantum Effects 2000", published atWe review recent developments in the theory of renormalisation group flows inminimal models with boundaries. Among these, we discuss in particular theperturbative calculations of Recknagel et al, not only as a tool to predict theIR endpoints of certain flows, but also as a motivation for considering theparticular limiting case of c = 1. By treating this limit, we are able toinvestigate a wide class of perturbations by considering them as deformationsaway from the c = 1 point. We also present the truncated conformal spaceapproach as a tool for investigating the space of RG flows and checkingparticular predictions.
