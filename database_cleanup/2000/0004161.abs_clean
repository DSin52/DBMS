We describe a Riemannian space class where the second Dirac operator arisesand prove that the operator is always equivalent to a standard Dirac one. Theparticle state in this gravitational field is degenerate to some extent and weintroduce an additional value in order to describe a particle state completely.Some supersymmetry constructions are also discussed. As an example we study allRiemannian spaces with a five-dimentional motion group and find all metrics forwhich the second Dirac operator exists. On the basis of our discussed exampleswe hypothesize about the number of second Dirac operators in Riemannian space.
