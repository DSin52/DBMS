We systematically study deformations of chiral forms with applications tostring theory in mind. To first order in the coupling constant, this problemcan be translated into the calculation of the local BRST cohomological group atghost number zero. We completely solve this cohomology and present detailedproofs of results announced in a previous letter. In particular, we show thatthere is no room for non-abelian, local, deformations of a pure system ofchiral p-forms.
