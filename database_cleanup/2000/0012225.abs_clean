Noncommutative gauge fields (similar to the type that arises in string theorywith background B-fields) are constructed for arbitrary nonabelian gauge groupswith the help of a map that relates ordinary nonabelian and noncommutativegauge theories (Seiberg-Witten map). As in our previous work we employKontsevich's formality and the concept of equivalent star products. As abyproduct we obtain a ``Mini Seiberg-Witten map'' that explicitly relatesordinary abelian and nonabelian gauge fields.
