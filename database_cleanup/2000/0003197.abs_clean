Title: Solitons and Domain Walls in Odd Dimensions

Authors: N.D. Lambert and G.W. Gibbons

Comments: 13 pages. Substantially re-written including a more detailed

discussion of fermion zero modesJournal-ref: Phys.Lett. B488 (2000) 90-96

We discuss the existance of smooth soliton solutions which interpolatebetween supersymmetric vacua in odd-dimensional theories. In particular weapply this analysis to a wide class of supergravities to argue against theexistence of smooth domain walls interpolating between supersymmetric vacua. Wefind that if the superpotential changes sign then any Goldstino modes willdiverge.
