We study derivative corrections to the effective action for a single D-branein type II superstring theory coupled to constant background fields. Inparticular, within this setting we determine the complete expression for the(disk level) four-derivative corrections to the Born-Infeld part of the action.We also determine 2n-form 2n-derivative corrections to the Wess-Zumino term.Both types of corrections involve all orders of the gauge field strength, F.The results are obtained via string sigma-model loop calculations using theboundary state operator language. The corrections can be succinctly written interms of the Riemann tensor for a non-symmetric metric.
