We study a kaehler potential K of a one parameter family of Calabi-Yau d-foldembedded in CP^{d+1}. By comparing results of the topological B-model and thedata of the CFT calculation at Gepner point, the K is determined unambiguously.It has a moduli parameter psi that describes a deformation of the CFT by amarginal operator. Also the metric, curvature and hermitian two-point functionsin the neighborhood of the Gepner point are analyzed. We use a recipe of tt^{*}fusion and develop a method to determine the K from the point of view oftopological sigma model. It is not restricted to this specific model and can beapplied to other Calabi-Yau cases.
