This paper proves that it is possible to build a Lagrangian for quantumelectrodynamics which makes it explicit that the photon mass is eventually setto zero in the physical part on observational ground. Gauge independence isachieved upon considering the joint effect of gauge-averaging term and ghostfields. It remains possible to obtain a counterterm Lagrangian where the onlynon-gauge-invariant term is proportional to the squared divergence of thepotential, while the photon propagator in momentum space falls off like theinverse square of k at large k, which indeed agrees with perturbativerenormalizability. The resulting radiative corrections to the Coulomb potentialin QED are also shown to be gauge-independent. The experience acquired withquantum electrodynamics is used to investigate properties and problems of theextension of such ideas to non-Abelian gauge theories.
