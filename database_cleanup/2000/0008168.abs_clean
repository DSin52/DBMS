The $CP^1$ model with Hopf interaction is quantised following theBatalin-Tyutin (BT) prescription. In this scheme, extra BT fields areintroduced which allow for the existence of only commuting first-classconstraints. Explicit expression for the quantum correction to the expectationvalue of the energy density and angular momentum in the physical sector of thismodel is derived. The result shows, in the particular operator ordering that wehave chosen to work with, that the quantum effect has a divergent contributionof $ {\cal O} (\hbar^2)$ in the energy expectation value. But, interestinglythe Hopf term, though topological in nature, can have a finite ${\cal O}(\hbar)$ contribution to energy density in the homotopically nontrivialtopological sector. The angular momentum operator, however, is found to have noquantum correction, indicating the absence of any fractional spin even at thisquantum level. Finally, the extended Lagrangian incorporating the BT auxiliaryfields is computed in the conventional framework of BRST formalism exploitingFaddeev-Popov technique of path integral method.
