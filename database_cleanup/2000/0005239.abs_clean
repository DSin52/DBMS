The evolution of the cosmological perturbations is studied in the context ofthe Randall-Sundrum brane world scenario, in which our universe is realized ona three-brane in the five dimensional Anti-de Sitter(AdS) spacetime. We developa formalism to solve the coupled dynamics of the cosmological perturbations inthe brane world and the gravitational wave in the AdS bulk. Using ourformalism, the late time evolution of the cosmological scalar perturbations atany scales larger than the AdS curvature scale $l$ is shown to be identicalwith the one obtained in the conventional 4D cosmology, provided the effect ofheavy graviton modes may be neglected. Here the late time means the epoch whenthe Hubble horizon $H^{-1}$ in the 4D brane world is sufficiently larger thanthe AdS curvature scale $l$. If the inflation occurs sufficiently lower than$l^{-1}$, the scalar temperature anisotropies in the Cosmic MicrowaveBackground at large scales can be calculated using the constancy of the Bardeenparameter as is done in the 4D cosmology. The assumption of the result is thatthe effect of the massive graviton with mass $m e^{-\alpha_0}>l^{-1}$ in thebrane world is negligible, where $e^{\alpha_0}$ is the scale factor of thebrane world. We also discuss the effect of these massive gravitons on theevolution of the perturbations.
