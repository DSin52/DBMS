We study a non-commutative generalization of the standard electroweak modelproposed by Balakrishna, Gursey and Wali [ Phys.Lett. B254(1991)430] that isformulated in terms of the derivations Der_2(M_3) of a three-dimensionalrepresentation of the su(2) Lie algebra of weak isospin. The linearized Higgsfield equations and the scalar boson mass eigenvalues are explicitly given. Alight Higgs boson with mass around 130 GeV together with four very heavy scalarbosons are predicted.
