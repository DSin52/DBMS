We show that the decay of the D2-\bar{D2} system with large worldvolumemagnetic fields can be described in noncommutative gauge theory. Tachyoncondensation in this system describes the annihilation of D2-\bar{D2} into$D0$-branes. From the 2+1 dimensional point of view, this is the decay of anonabelian magnetic flux into vortices. The semiclassical approximation isvalid over a long period of the decay. Our analysis allows us to clarifyearlier results in the literature related to tachyon condensation andnoncommutative gauge theory.
