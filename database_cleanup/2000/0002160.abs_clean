Necessary conditions are proposed for the admissibility of singular classicalsolutions with 3+1-dimensional Poincare invariance to five-dimensional gravitycoupled to scalars. Finite temperature considerations and examples from AdS/CFTsupport the conjecture that the scalar potential must remain bounded above fora solution to be physical. Having imposed some restrictions on nakedsingularities allows us to comment on a recent proposal for solving thecosmological constant problem.
