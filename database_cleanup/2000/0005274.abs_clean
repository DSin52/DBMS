We suggest that quantum mechanics and gravity are intimately related. Inparticular, we investigate the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the case oftwo free particles and show that the quantum potential, which is attractive,may generate the gravitational potential. The investigation, related to theformulation of quantum mechanics based on the equivalence postulate, is basedon the analysis of the reduced action. A consequence of this approach is thatthe quantum potential is always non-trivial even in the case of the freeparticle. It plays the role of intrinsic energy and may in fact be at theorigin of fundamental interactions. We pursue this idea, by making apreliminary investigation of whether there exists a set of solutions for whichthe quantum potential can be expressed with a gravitational potential leadingterm which alone would remain in the limit hbar \to 0. A number of questionsare raised for further investigation.
