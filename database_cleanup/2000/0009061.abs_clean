We consider Sen's effective action for unstable D-branes, and study itsclassical dynamics exactly. In the true vacuum, the Hamiltonian dynamicsremains well-defined despite a vanishing action, and is that of massiverelativistic string fluid of freely moving electric flux lines. Theenergy(tension) density equals the flux density in the local co-moving frame.Furthermore, a finite dual Lagrangian exists and is related to theNielsen-Olesen field theory of ``dual'' strings, supplemented by a crucialconstraint. We conclude with discussion on the endpoint of tachyoncondensation.
