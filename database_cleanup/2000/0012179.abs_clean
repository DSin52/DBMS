Title: Linear Models of Supersymmetric D-Branes

We construct a class of supersymmetric boundary interactions in N=2 fieldtheories on the half-space, which depend on parameters that are not at allrenormalized or not renormalized in perturbation theory beyond one-loop. Thiscan be used to study D-branes wrapped on a certain class of Lagrangiansubmanifolds as well as holomorphic cycles. The construction of holomorphicD-branes is in close relationship with the background independent open stringfield theory approach to brane/anti-brane systems. As an application, mirrorpairs of Lagrangian and holomorphic D-branes are identified. The mirror pairsare studied by twisting to open topological field theories.
