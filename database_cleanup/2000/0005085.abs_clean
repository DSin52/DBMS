The naive low energy effective action of the tachyon and the U(1) gauge fieldobtained from string field theory does not correspond to the world volumeaction of unstable branes in bosonic string theory. We show that there exists afield redefinition which relates the gauge field and the tachyon of the stringfield theory action to the fields in the world volume action of unstablebranes. We identify a string gauge symmetry which corresponds to the U(1) gaugetransformation. This is done to the first non-linear order in the fields. Weexamine the vector fluctuations at the tachyon condensate till level (4,8).
