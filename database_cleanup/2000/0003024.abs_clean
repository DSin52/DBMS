We investigate the D-brane contents of asymmetric orbifolds. Using T-dualitywe find that the consistent description of open strings in asymmetric orbifoldsrequires to turn on background gauge fields on the D-branes. We derive thecorresponding noncommutative geometry arising on such D-branes with mixedNeumann-Dirichlet boundary conditions directly by applying an asymmetricrotation to open strings with pure Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. Asa concrete application of our results we construct asymmetric type I vacuarequiring open strings with mixed boundary conditions for tadpole cancellation.
