We study BPS domain wall solutions of 5-dimensional N=2 supergravity whereisometries of the hypermultiplet geometry have been gauged. We derive thecorresponding supersymmetric flow equations and define an appropriatec-function. As an example we discuss a domain wall solution of Freedman,Gubser, Pilch and Warner which is related to a RG-flow in a dual superconformalfield theory.
