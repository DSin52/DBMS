We calculate the effective action for small velocity scattering of localized1-branes and 5-branes. Momentum is allowed to flow in the direction along the1-branes so that the moduli space has only 1/8 of the full supersymmetry.Relative to the more familiar case with the 1-branes delocalized along the5-branes, this introduces new moduli associated with the motion of the 1-branesalong the 5-branes. We consider in detail the moduli space metric for theassociated two body problem. Even for motion transverse to the 5-brane, ourresults differ substantially from the delocalized case. However, thisdifference only appears when both the 1-brane charge and the momentum chargeare localized. Despite the fact that, in a certain sense, 1-branesspontaneously delocalize near a 5-brane horizon, the moduli space metric inthis limit continues to differ from the delocalized result. This fact may be ofuse in developing a new description of the associated BPS bound states. The newterms depend on the torus size $L$ in such a way that they give a finitecontribution in the $L \to \infty$ limit.
