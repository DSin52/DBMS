The time-reparametrization-invariant dynamics of a relativistic string isstudied in the Dirac generalized Hamiltonian theory by resolving the firstclass constraints. The reparametrization-invariant evolution parameter isidentified with the time-like coordinate of the "center of mass" of a stringwhich is separated from local degrees of freedom by transformations conservingthe group of diffeomorphisms of the generalized Hamiltonian formulation and thePoincare covariance of local constraints. To identify the "center of mass"time-like coordinate with the invariant proper time (measured by an observer inthe comoving frame of reference), we apply the Levi-Civita - Shanmugadhasancanonical transformations which convert the global (mass-shell) constraint intoa new momentum, so that the corresponding gauge is not needed for theHamiltonian reduction. The resolving of local constraints leads to an"equivalent unconstrained system" in the reduced phase space with theRoehrlich-type Hamiltonian of evolution with respect to the proper time.
