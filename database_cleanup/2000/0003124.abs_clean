It has been conjectured that the vortex solution on a D-brane - anti-D-branesystem represents a D-brane of two lower dimension. We establish this result byfirst identifying a series of marginal deformations which create the vortex -antivortex pair on the brane - antibrane system, and then showing that underthis series of marginal deformations the original D-brane - anti-D-brane systembecomes a D-brane - anti-D-brane system with two lower dimensions.Generalization of this construction to the case of solitons of highercodimension is also discussed.
