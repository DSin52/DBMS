We present evidence for the existence of infinitely-many new families ofrenormalisation group flows between the nonunitary minimal models of conformalfield theory. These are associated with perturbations by the $\phi_{21}$ and$\phi_{15}$ operators, and generalise a family of flows discovered by Martins.In all of the new flows, the finite-volume effective central charge is anon-monotonic function of the system size. The evolution of this effectivecentral charge is studied by means of a nonlinear integral equation, a masslessvariant of an equation recently found to describe certain massive perturbationsof these same models. We also observe that a similar non-monotonicity arises inthe more familiar $\phi_{13}$ perturbations, when the flows induced are betweennonunitary minimal models.
