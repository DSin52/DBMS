We investigate some aspects of Moyal-Weyl deformations of superspace andtheir compatibility with supersymmetry. For the simplest case, when onlybosonic coordinates are deformed, we consider a four dimensional supersymmetricfield theory which is the deformation of the Wess-Zumino renormalizable theoryof a chiral superfield. We then consider the deformation of a free theory of anabelian vector multiplet, which is a non commutative version of the rank oneYang-Mills theory. We finally give the supersymmetric version of the$\alpha'\mapsto 0$ limit of the Born-Infeld action with a B-field turned on,which is believed to be related to the non commutative U(1) gauge theory.
