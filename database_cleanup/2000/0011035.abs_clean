A noncommutative and non-anticommutative quantum field theory is formulatedin a superspace, in which the superspace coordinates satisfy noncommutative andnon-anticommutative relations. A perturbative scalar field theory isinvestigated in which only the non-anticommutative algebraic structure is kept,and one loop diagrams are calculated and found to be finite due to the dampingcaused by a Gaussian factor in the propagator.
