Scale invariance is considered in the context of gravitational theories wherethe action, in the first order formalism, is of the form $S = \int L_{1} \Phid^4x$ + $\int L_{2}\sqrt{-g}d^4x$ where the volume element $\Phi d^4x$ isindependent of the metric. For global scale invariance, a "dilaton" $\phi$ hasto be introduced, with non-trivial potentials $V(\phi)$ = $f_{1}e^{\alpha\phi}$in $L_1$ and $U(\phi)$ = $f_{2}e^{2\alpha\phi}$ in $L_2$. This leads tonon-trivial mass generation and a potential for $\phi$ which is interesting forinflation. Interpolating models for natural transition from inflation to aslowly accelerated universe at late times appear naturally. This is alsoachieved for "Quintessential models", which are scale invariant but formulatedwith the use of volume element $\Phi d^4x$ alone. For closed strings and branes(including the supersymmetric cases), the modified measure formulation ispossible and does not require the introduction of a particular scale (thestring or brane tension) from the begining but rather these appear asintegration constants.
