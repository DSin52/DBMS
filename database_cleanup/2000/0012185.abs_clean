The vacuum expectation values for the energy-momentum tensor of a massivescalar field with general curvature coupling and obeying the Robin boundarycondition on spherically symmetric boundaries in D-dimensional space areinvestigated. The expressions are derived for the regularized vacuum energydensity, radial and azimuthal stress components (i) inside and outside a singlespherical surface and (ii) in the intermediate region between two concentricspheres. Regularization procedure is carried out by making use of thegeneralized Abel-Plana formula for the series over zeros of cylinder functions.Asymptotic behavior of the vacuum densities near the sphere and at largedistances is investigated. A decomposition of the Casimir energy into volumicand surface parts is provided for both cases (i) and (ii). We show that themode sum energy, evaluated as a sum of the zero-point energies for each normalmode of frequency, and the volume integral of the energy density in general aredifferent, and argue that this difference is due to the existence of anadditional surface energy contribution.
