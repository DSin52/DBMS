As part of program to quantize superstrings in AdS_5 x S^5 background inlight cone approach we find the explicit form of the correspondingGreen-Schwarz action in fermionic light-cone kappa-symmetry gauge. Theresulting action is quadratic and quartic in fermions. In the flat space limitit reduces to the standard light-cone Green-Schwarz action, and also has thecorrect superparticle limit. We discuss fixing the bosonic light-cone gauge anda reformulation of the action in terms of 2-d Dirac spinors.
