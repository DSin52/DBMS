We study noncommutative field theories at finite temperature to learn moreabout the degrees of freedom in the non-planar sector of these systems. We findevidence for winding states. At temperatures for which the thermal wavelengthis smaller than the noncommutativity scale, there is a drastic reduction of thedegrees of freedom in the non-planar sector. In this regime, the non-planarsector has thermodynamics resembling that of a 1+1 dimensional field theory.
