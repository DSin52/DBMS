We consider a class of (2+1) dimensional baby Skyrme models with potentialsthat have more than one vacum. These potentials are generalisation of old andnew baby Skyrme models;they involve more complicated dependence on phi_3.Wefind that when the potential is invariant under phi_3 -> -phi_3 theconfiguration corresponding to the baby skyrmions lying "on top of each other"are the minima of the energy. However when the potential breaks this symmetrythe lowest field configurations correspond to separated baby skyrmions. Wecompute the energy distributions for skyrmions of degrees between one and eightand discuss their geometrical shapes and binding energies. We also compare the2-skyrmion states for these potentials. Most of our work has been performednumerically with the model being formulated in terms of three real scalarfields (satisfying one constraint).
