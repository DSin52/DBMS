Gravitational properties of domain walls in fundamental theory and theirimplications for the trapping of gravity are reviewed. In particular, thedifficulties to embed gravity trapping configurations within gaugedsupergravity is reviewed and the status of the domain walls obtained via thebreathing mode of sphere reduced Type IIB supergravity is presented.
