We study the regularization and renormalization of the Yang-Mills theory inthe framework of the manifestly invariant formalism, which consists of a highercovariant derivative with an infinitely many Pauli-Villars fields. Unphysicallogarithmic divergence, which is the problematic point on the Slavnov's method,does not appear in our scheme, and the well-known vale of the renormalizationgroup functions are derived. The cancellation mechanism of the quadraticdivergence is also demonstrated by calculating the vacuum polarization tensorof the order of $\Lambda^0$ and $\Lambda^{-4}$. These results are the evidencethat our method is valid for intrinsically divergent theories and is expectedto be available for the theory which contains the quantity depending on thespace-time dimensions, like supersymmetric gauge theories.
