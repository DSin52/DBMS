In AdS_{2p+1} we construct propagators for p-forms whose lagrangians containterms of the form A / d A. In particular we explore the case of formssatisfying ``self duality in odd dimensions'', and the case of forms with atopological mass term. We point out that the ``complete'' set of maximallysymmetric bitensors previously used in all the other propagator papers isincomplete - there exists another bitensor which can and does appear in theformulas for the propagators in this particular case. Nevertheless, itspresence does not affect the other propagators computed so far.On the AdS side of the correspondence we compute the 2 and 3 point functionsinvolving the self-dual tensor of the maximal 7d gauged supergravity (sugra),S_{\mu\nu\rho}. Since the 7 dimensional antisymmetric self-dual tensor obeysfirst order field equations (S + * d S=0), to get a nonvanishing 2 pointfunction we add a certain boundary term (to satisfy the variational principleon a manifold with boundary) to the 7d action. The 3 point functions we computeare of the type SSB and SBB, describing vertex interactions with the gaugefields B_{\mu}.
