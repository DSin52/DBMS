We extend standard path-integral techniques of bosonization and duality tothe setting of noncommutative geometry. We start by constructing thebosonization prescription for a free Dirac fermion living in the noncommutativeplane R_\theta^2. We show that in this abelian situation the fermion theory isdual to a noncommutative Wess-Zumino-Witten model. The non-abelian situation isalso constructed along very similar lines. We apply the techniques derived tothe massive Thirring model on noncommutative R_\theta^2 and show that it isdualized to a noncommutative WZW model plus a noncommutative cosine potential(like in the noncommutative Sine-Gordon model). The coupling constants in thefermionic and bosonic models are related via strong-weak coupling duality. Thisis thus an explicit construction of S-duality in a noncommutative field theory.
