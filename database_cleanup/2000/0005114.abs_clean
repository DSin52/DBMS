We construct the explicit boundary state description of the vortex-type(codimension two) tachyon condensation in brane-antibrane systems generalizingthe known result of the kink-type (Frau et al. hep-th/9903123). In thisdescription we show how the RR-charge of the lower dimensional D-branesemerges. We also investigate the tachyon condensation in T^4/Z_2 orbifold andfind that the twisted sector can be treated almost in the same way as theuntwisted sector from the viewpoint of the boundary state. Further we discussthe higher codimension cases.
