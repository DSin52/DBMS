In a deep-infrared (ergodic) regime, QCD coupled to massive pseudoreal andreal quarks are described by chiral orthogonal and symplectic ensembles ofrandom matrices. Using this correspondence, general expressions for the QCDpartition functions are derived in terms of microscopically rescaled massvariables. In limited cases, correlation functions of Dirac eigenvalues anddistributions of the smallest Dirac eigenvalue are given as ratios of thesepartition functions. When all masses are degenerate, our results reproduce theknown expressions for the partition functions of zero-dimensional sigma models.
