Title: Boundary states and non-abelian orbifolds

Authors: Frederik Roose

Comments: Latex, 11 pages, no figures

In this note the open string partition function is analyzed carefully in away to reveal the group-theoretical aspects. For the simple cases of ADEorbifolds with regular Chan-Paton action a prescription for consistent boundarystates is given. In the process of outlining how they encode McKaycorrespondence, we argue that this results from a non-trivial conspiracy ofnumerical factors in the string amplitudes.
