Title: On noncommutative and commutative equivalence for BFYM theory

Seiberg-Witten mapComments: 8 pages, one figure, latex

BFYM on commutative and noncommutative ${\mathbb{R}}^4$ is considered and aSeiberg-Witten gauge-equivalent transformation is constructed for thesetheories. Then we write the noncommutative action in terms of the ordinaryfields and show that it is equivalent to the ordinary action up to higherdimensional gauge invariant terms.
