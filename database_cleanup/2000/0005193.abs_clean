in this paper were previously obtained in hep-ph/0003173, of which the authorwas not awareIn the study of three-brane cosmological models, an unusual law ofcosmological expansion on the brane has been reported. According to this law,the energy density of matter on the brane quadratically enters the right-handside of the new equations for the brane world, in contrast with the standardcosmology, where it enters the similar equations linearly. However, this resultis obtained in the absence of curvature-dependent terms in the action for thebrane. In this paper, we derive the field equations for a brane world embeddedinto a five-dimensional spacetime in the case where such terms are present. Wealso discuss some cosmological solutions of the resulting equations.
