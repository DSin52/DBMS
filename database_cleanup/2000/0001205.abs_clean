We point out that the low energy theory of 6d, N=(2,0) field theories, whenaway from the origin of the moduli space of vacua, necessarily includes a newkind of Wess-Zumino term. The form of this term is related to the Hopfinvariant associated with \pi_7 (S^4). The coefficient of the Wess-Zumino termis fixed by an anomaly matching relation for a global flavor symmetry. Forexample, in the context of a single M5 brane probe in the background of Ndistant M5 branes, the probe must have the Hopf-WZ term with coefficientproportional to N(N+1). Various related checks and observations are made. Wealso point out that there are skyrmionic strings, and propose that they are theW-boson strings.
