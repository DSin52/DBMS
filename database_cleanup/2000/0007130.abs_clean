Title: Recent Progress in Superstring Theory

Comments: 13 pages; Talk presented at the Conference Quantization, Gauge

Theory, and Strings dedicated to the memory of Professor Efim Fradkin and atthe Ninth Marcel Grossmann Meeting (MG9)Superstring theory has continued to develop at a rapid clip in the past fewyears. Following a quick review of some of the major discoveries prior to 1998,this talk focuses on a few of the more recent developments. The topics I havechosen to present are 1) the use of K-theory to classify conserved chargescarried by D-branes; 2) tachyon condensation on unstable D-brane systems; and3) an introduction to noncommutative field theories and their solitons.
