We prove that the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity arising in themassless limit of massive gravity theories is peculiar to Minkowski space andit is not present in Anti De Sitter space, where the massless limit is smooth.More generally, the massless limit is smooth whenever the square of thegraviton mass vanishes faster than the cosmological constant.
