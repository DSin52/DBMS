In earlier work we have given a Hamiltonian analysis of Yang-Mills theory in(2+1) dimensions showing how a mass gap could arise. In this paper,generalizing and covariantizing from the mass term in the Hamiltonian analysis,we obtain two manifestly covariant and gauge-invariant mass terms which can beused in a resummation of standard perturbation theory to study properties ofthe mass gap.
