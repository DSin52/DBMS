We present a nonperturbative lattice formulation of noncommutative Yang-Millstheories in arbitrary even dimension. We show that lattice regularization of anoncommutative field theory requires finite lattice volume which automaticallyprovides both an ultraviolet and an infrared cutoff. We demonstrate explicitlyMorita equivalence of commutative U(p) gauge theory with (p*n_f) flavours offundamental matter fields on a lattice of size L with twisted boundaryconditions and noncommutative U(1) gauge theory with n_f species of matter on alattice of size (p*L) with single-valued fields. We discuss the relation withtwisted large N reduced models and construct observables in noncommutativegauge theory with matter.
