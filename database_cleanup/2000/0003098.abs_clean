We provide a method to decompose the two-point function of a quantum field ona warped manifold in terms of fields living on a lower-dimensional manifold. Wediscuss explicit applications to Minkowski, de Sitter and anti-de Sitterquantum field theories. This decomposition presents a remarkable analogy withthe holography principle, in the sense that physics in d+1 dimensions may beencoded into the physics in one dimension less. Moreover in a context a laRandall--Sundrum, the method outlined here allows a mechanism of generation ofmass-spectra in the 3-brane (or more generally a d-1-brane).
