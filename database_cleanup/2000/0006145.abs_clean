We show that a D-brane in a group manifold given by a (twisted) conjugacyclass is characterised by a gauge invariant two-form field determined in termsof the matrix of gluing conditions. Using a quantisation argument based on thepath integral one obtains the known quantisation condition for thecorresponding D-branes. We find no evidence for the existence of a quantisedU(1) gauge field flux. We propose an expression for the D0 charge of suchD-branes.
