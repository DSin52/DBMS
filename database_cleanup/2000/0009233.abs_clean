Anomalies arising from nonplanar triangle diagrams of noncommutative gaugetheory are studied. Local chiral gauge anomalies for both noncommutative U(1)and U(N) gauge theories with adjoint matter fields are shown to vanish. Fornoncommutative QED with fundamental matters, due to UV/IR mixing a finiteanomaly emerges from the nonplanar contributions. It involves a generalized$\star$-product of gauge fields.
