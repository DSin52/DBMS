We study an ambiguity of the current regularization in the Thirring model. Wefind a new current definition which enables to make a comprehensive treatmentof the current. Our formulation is simpler than Klaiber's formulation. Wecompare our result with other formulations and find a very good agreement withtheir result. We also obtain the Schwinger term and the general formula for anycurrent regularization.
