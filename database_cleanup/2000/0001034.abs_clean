The form of the vacuum stress-tensor for the quantized scalar field at adielectric to vacuum interface is studied. The dielectric is modeled to have anindex of refraction that varies with frequency. We find that the stress-tensorcomponents, derived from the mode function expansion of the Wightman function,are naturally regularized by the reflection and transmission coefficients ofthe mode at the boundary. Additionally, the divergence of the vacuum energyassociated with a perfectly reflecting mirror is found to disappear for thedielectric mirror at the expense of introducing a new energy density near thesurface which has the opposite sign. Thus the weak energy condition is alwaysviolated in some region of the spacetime. For the dielectric mirror, the meanvacuum energy density per unit plate area in a constant time hypersurface isalways found to be positive (or zero) and the averaged weak energy condition isproven to hold for all observers with non-zero velocity along the normaldirection to the boundary. Both results are found to be generic features of thevacuum stress-tensor and not necessarily dependent of the frequency dependenceof the dielectric.
