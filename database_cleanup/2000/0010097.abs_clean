We exactly calculate the thermal distribution and temperature of Hawkingradiation for a two-dimensional charged dilatonic black hole after it hassettled down to an "equilibrium" state. The calculation is carried out usingthe Bogoliubov coefficients. The background of the process is furnished by apreexisting black hole and not by collapsing matter as considered by Giddingsand Nelson for the case of a Schwarzschild black hole. Furthermore, thevanishing of the temperature and/or the Hawking radiation in the extremal caseis obtained as a regular limit of the general case.
