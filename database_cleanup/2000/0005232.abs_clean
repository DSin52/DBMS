Interesting non-linear functions on the phase spaces of classical fieldtheories can never be quantized immediately because the basic fields of thetheory become operator valued distributions. Therefore, one is usually forcedto find a classical substitute for such a function depending on a regulatorwhich is expressed in terms of smeared quantities and which can be quantized ina well-defined way. Namely, the smeared functions define a new symplecticmanifold of their own which is easy to quantize. Finally one must remove theregulator and establish that the final operator, if it exists, has the correctclassical limit.In this paper we investigate these steps for diffeomorphism invariant quantumfield theories of connections. We introduce a generalized projective family ofsymplectic manifolds, coordinatized by the smeared fields, which is labelled bya pair consisting of a graph and another graph dual to it. We show that thereexists a generalized projective sequence of symplectic manifolds whose limitagrees with the symplectic manifold that one started from.This family of symplectic manifolds is easy to quantize and we illustrate theprogramme outlined above by applying it to the Gauss constraint. The frameworkdeveloped here is the classical cornerstone on which the semi-classicalanalysis developed in a new series of papers called ``Gauge Theory CoherentStates'' is based.
