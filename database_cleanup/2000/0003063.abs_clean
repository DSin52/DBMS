Supersymmetric, rotating, asymptotically flat black holes with a regularhorizon are rare configurations in String Theory. One example is known in fivespacetime dimensions, within the toroidal compactification of type IIB stringtheory. Such special solution is allowed by the existence of a Chern-Simonscoupling in the Supergravity theory and by the possibility of imposing a selfduality condition on the `rotation 2-form'. We explore three peculiar featuresmay be interpreted as a system of $D1-D5$ branes with a Brinkmann wavepropagating along their worldvolume. Unlike its five dimensional Kaluza-Kleincompactification, the universal covering space of this manifold has nocausality violations. In other words, causal anomalies can be solved in higherdimensions. From the dual SCFT viewpoint, the causality bound for thecompactified spacetime arises as the unitarity bound; 2) The vanishing of thescattering cross section for uncharged scalars and sufficiently high angularmomentum of the background is shown still to hold at the level of chargedinteractions. The same is verified when a non-minimal coupling to the geometryis used. Therefore, the `repulson' behaviour previously found is universal fornon accelerated observers; 3) The solutions are shown to have a non-standardgyromagnetic ratio of $g=3$. In contrast, the superpartners of a static, BPS,five dimensional black hole have $g=1$. At the semi-classical level, we findthat a Dirac fermion propagating in the rotating hole background has $g=2\pm1$,depending on the spinor direction of the fermion being parallel to Killing or`anti-Killing' spinors.
