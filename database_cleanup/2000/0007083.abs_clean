It is shown that the supergravity moduli spaces of D1-D5 and D2-D6 branesystems coincide with those of the Coulomb branches of the associatednon-abelian gauge theories. We further discuss situations in which worldvolumebrane actions include a potential term generated by probing certainsupergravity backgrounds. We find that in many cases, the appearance of thepotential is due to the application of the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism. We givesome examples and discuss the existence of novel supersymmetric braneconfigurations.
