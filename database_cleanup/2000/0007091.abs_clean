A system of generalized coherent states for the de Sitter group obeying theKlein-Gordon equation and corresponding to the massive spin zero particles overthe de Sitter space is considered. This allows us to construct the quantizedscalar field by the resolution over these coherent states; the correspondingpropagator is computed by the method of analytic continuation to the complex deSitter space and coincides with expressions obtained previously by othermethods. Considering the case of spin 1/2 we establish the connection of theinvariant Dirac equation over the de Sitter space with irreduciblerepresentations of the de Sitter group. The set of solutions of this equationis obtained in the form of the product of two different systems of generalizedcoherent states for the de Sitter group. Using these solutions the quantizedDirac field over de Sitter space is constructed and its propagator is found. Itis a result of action of some de Sitter invariant spinor operator onto the spinzero propagator with an imaginary shift of a mass. We show that the constructedpropagators possess the de Sitter-invariance and causality properties.
