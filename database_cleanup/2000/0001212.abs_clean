We discuss geometry underlying orientifolds with non-trivial NS-NS B-flux. IfD-branes wrap a torus with B-flux the rank of the gauge group is reduced due tonon-commuting Wilson lines whose presence is implied by the B-flux. In the caseof D-branes transverse to a torus with B-flux the rank reduction is due to asmaller number of D-branes required by tadpole cancellation conditions in thepresence of B-flux as some of the orientifold planes now have the oppositeorientifold projection. We point out that T-duality in the presence of B-fluxis more subtle than in the case with trivial B-flux, and it is preciselyconsistent with the qualitative difference between the aforementioned twosetups. In the case where both types of branes are present, the states in themixed (e.g., 59) open string sectors come with a non-trivial multiplicity,which we relate to a discrete gauge symmetry due to non-zero B-flux, andconstruct vertex operators for the the mixed sector states. Using these resultswe revisit K3 orientifolds with B-flux (where K3 is a T^4/Z_M orbifold) andpoint out various subtleties arising in some of these models. For instance, inthe Z_2 case the conformal field theory orbifold does not appear to be theconsistent background for the corresponding orientifolds with B-flux. This isrelated to the fact that non-zero B-flux requires the presence of both O5^- aswell as O5^+ planes at various Z_2 orbifold fixed points, which appears to beinconsistent with the presence of the twisted B-flux in the conformal fieldtheory orbifold. We also consider four dimensional N=2 and N=1 supersymmetricorientifolds. We construct consistent four dimensional models with B-flux whichdo not suffer from difficulties encountered in the K3 cases.
