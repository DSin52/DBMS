In this paper we construct the BPS black hole generating solution oftoroidally compactified string (and M) theory, giving for it both themacroscopic and microscopic description. Choosing a proper U-duality gauge thelatter will be given by a bound state made solely of D-branes. The axionicnature of the supergravity solution will be directly related to non-trivialangles between the constituent D-branes (type IIB configuration) or, in aT-dual gauge, to the presence of magnetic flux on constituent D-brane worldvolumes (type IIA configuration). As expected, the four dimensional axionfields arise from the dimensional reduction of non-diagonal metric tensorcomponents or Kalb-Ramond B field components for type IIB or type IIA cases,respectively. Thanks to this result it is then now possible to fill the full56-dimensional U-duality orbit of N=8 BPS black holes and to have a macroscopicand microscopic description of all of them.
