We report here on the application of the perturbative renormalization-groupto the Coulomb gauge in QCD. We use it to determine the high-momentumasymptotic form of the instantaneous color-Coulomb potential $V(\vec{k})$ andof the vacuum polarization $P(\vec{k}, k_4)$. These quantities arerenormalization-group invariants, in the sense that they are independent of therenormalization scheme. A scheme-independent definition of the running couplingconstant is provided by $\vec{k}^2 V(\vec{k}) = x_0g^2(\vec{k}/\Lambda_{coul})$, and of $\alpha_s \equiv {{g^2(\vec{k} /\Lambda_{coul})} \over {4\pi}}$, where $x_0 = {{12N} \over {11N - 2N_f}}$, and$\Lambda_{coul}$ is a finite QCD mass scale. We also show how to calculate thecoefficients in the expansion of the invariant $\beta$-function $\beta(g)\equiv |\vec{k}| {{\partial g} \over{\partial |\vec{k}|}} = -(b_0 g^3 + b_1 g^5+b_2 g^7 + ...)$, where all coefficients are scheme-independent.
