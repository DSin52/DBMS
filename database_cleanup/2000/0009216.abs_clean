We propose the model of $D-$dimensional massless particle whose Lagrangian isgiven by the $N-$th extrinsic curvature of world-line. The system has $N+1$gauge degrees of freedom constituting $W-$like algebra; the classicaltrajectories of the model are space-like curves which obey the conditions$k_{N+a}=k_{N-a}$, $k_{2N}=0$, $a=1,...,N-1$, $N\leq[(D-2)/2]$, while the first$N$ curvatures $k_i$ remain arbitrary. We show that the model admits consistentformulation on the anti-De Sitter space. The solutions of the system are themassless irreducible representations of Poincar\'e group with $N$ nonzerohelicities, which are equal to each other.
