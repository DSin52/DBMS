We derive an effective action for Dirac fermions coupled to O(3) non-linearsigma-model (NLSM) through the Yukawa-type interaction. The nonperturbative(global) quantum anomaly of this model results in a Hopf term for the effectiveNLSM. We obtain this term using the ``embedding'' of the CP$^1$ model into theCP$^M$ generalization of the model which makes the quantum anomalyperturbative. This perturbative anomaly is calculated by means of a gradientexpansion of a fermionic determinant and is given by the Chern-Simons term foran auxiliary gauge field.
