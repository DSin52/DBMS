We study high energy scattering amplitudes in a strongly coupled (confining)gauge theory using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The scattering described by aWilson line/loop correlation function was shown earlier to correspond tominimal surfaces of the helicoid type, and gave amplitudes with unit interceptand linear trajectory. In this paper we find the correction to the interceptfrom quadratic fluctuations of the string worldsheet around the helicoid. Therelevant term comes from analytical continuation of a L\"uscher like term. Itis coupling-constant independent and proportional to the number of effectivetransverse flat dimensions. The shift of the intercept, under our assumptions,is $n_\perp /96$, and for $n_\perp=7,8$ gives respectively 0.0729, 0.083.Incidentally we note that this is surprisingly close to the observed value of0.08.
