Title: Nonanalyticity of the beta-function and systematic errors in

field-theoretic calculations of critical quantitiesAuthors: M. Caselle, A. Pelissetto and E. Vicari

Comments: 9 pages

We consider the fixed-dimension perturbative expansion. We discuss thenonanalyticity of the renormalization-group functions at the fixed point andits consequences for the numerical determination of critical quantities.
