The model of d5 higher derivative (HD) gravity admitting Schwarzschild--antide Sitter Black Hole (S-AdS BH) as exact solution is considered. The surfacecounterterms are added to the complete action, they are fixed by the conditionof finiteness of bulk AdS spacetime when brane goes to infinity. As a resultthe brane (observable Universe) is defined dynamically in terms of d5 theoryparameters (brane tension is fixed). Brane radius is always bigger than horizonradius and the 4d Universe itself could be static or inflationary. Naturalganeralization of this model gives warped compactification (with dynamicallygenerated brane) in the next-to-leading order of AdS/CFT correspondence.
