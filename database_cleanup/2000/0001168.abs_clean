Title: Double Elliptic Systems

Authors: A.Mironov and A.Morozov

Comments: 18 pages, LaTeX; talk presented at the International Workshop

"Supersymmetries and quantum symmetries", Dubna, July 1999This talk presents a list of problems related to the double-elliptic (Dell)integrable systems with elliptic dependence on both momenta and coordinates. Asexpected, in the framework of Seiberg-Witten theory the recently discoveredexplicit self-dual family of 2-particle Dell Hamiltonians provides aperturbative period matrix which is a logarithm of the ratio of the(momentum-space) theta-functions.
