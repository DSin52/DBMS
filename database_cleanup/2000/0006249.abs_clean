We show that the class of functions of topologically nontrivial gaugetransformations in QCD includes a zero-mode of the Gauss law constraint. Theequivalent unconstrained system compatible with Feynman's integral is derivedin terms of topological invariant variables, where the zero-mode is identifiedwith the winding number collective variable and leads to the dominance of theWu-Yang monopole. Physical consequences of Feynman's path integral in terms ofthe topological invariant variables are studied.
