We discuss Poincare three-brane solutions in D=5 M-Theory compactificationson Calabi-Yau (CY) threefolds with G-fluxes. We show that the vector modulifreeze at an attractor point. In the case with background flux only, thespacetime geometry contains a zero volume singularity with the three-brane andthe CY space shrinking simultaneously to a point. This problem can be avoidedsingle brane and, when the transverse dimension is compactified on a circle, apair of branes with opposite tensions.
