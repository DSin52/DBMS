Spacetime is modelled by binary relations - by the classes of theautomorphisms $\GL(\C^2)$ of a complex 2-dimensional vector space with respectto the definite unitary subgroup $\U(2)$. In extension of Feynman propagatorsfor particle quantum fields representing only the tangent spacetime structure,global spacetime representations are given, formulated as residues usingenergy-momentum distributions with the invariants as singularities. Theassociatated quantum fields are characterized by two invariant masses - fortime and position - supplementing the one mass for the definite unitaryparticle sector with another mass for the indefinite unitary interaction sectorwithout asymptotic particle interpretation.
