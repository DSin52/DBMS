Just as for non-abelian gauge theories at strong coupling, discrete latticemethods are a natural tool in the study of non-perturbative quantum gravity.They have to reflect the fact that the geometric degrees of freedom aredynamical, and that therefore also the lattice theory must be formulated in abackground-independent way. After summarizing the status quo of discretecovariant lattice models for four-dimensional quantum gravity, I describe a newclass of discrete gravity models whose starting point is a path integral overLorentzian (rather than Euclidean) space-time geometries. A number ofinteresting and unexpected results that have been obtained for thesedynamically triangulated models in two and three dimensions make discreteLorentzian gravity a promising candidate for a non-trivial theory of quantumgravity.
