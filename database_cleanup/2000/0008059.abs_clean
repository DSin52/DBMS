As a technical exercise with possible relevance to the holographic principleand string theory, the effective actions (functional determinants) for scalarsand spinors on the squashed three-sphere identified under the action of acyclic group, Z_m, are determined. Especially in the extreme oblate squashinglimit, which has a thermodynamic interpretation, the high temperature behaviouris found as a function of m. Although the intermediate details for odd and evenm are different, the final answers are the same. A thermodynamic interpretationfor spinors is possible only for twisted periodicity conditions and m even.
