We study the recently proposed D-brane configuration [hep-th/0010105]modeling the quantum Hall effect, focusing on the nature of the interactionsbetween the charged particles. Our analysis indicates that the interaction isrepulsive, which it should be for the ground state of the system to behave as aquantum Hall liquid. The strength of interactions varies inversely with thefilling fraction, leading us to conclude that a Wigner crystal is the groundstate at small nu. For larger rational nu (still less than unity), it isreasonable to expect a fractional quantum Hall ground state.
