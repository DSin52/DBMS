It is shown that in the two-exponential version of Liouville theory thecoefficients of the three-point functions of vertex operators can be determineduniquely using the translational invariance of the path integral measure andthe self-consistency of the two-point functions. The result agrees with thatobtained using conformal bootstrap methods. Reflection symmetry and apreviously conjectured relationship between the dimensional parameters of thetheory and the overall scale are derived.
