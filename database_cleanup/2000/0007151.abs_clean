We consider the integrable XXZ model with special open boundary conditionsthat renders its Hamiltonian ${SU(2)}_q$ symmetric, and the one-dimensionalquantum Ising model with four different boundary conditions. We show that foreach boundary condition the Ising quantum chain is exactly given by the MinimalModel of integrable lattice theory $LM(3, 4)$. This last theory is obtained asthe result of the quantum group reduction of the XXZ model at anisotropy$\Delta=(q + q^{-1})/2=\sqrt{2}/2$, with a number of sites in the latterdefined by the type of boundary conditions.
