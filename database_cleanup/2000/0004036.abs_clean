Title: On area and entropy of a black hole

Authors: A. Alekseev, A. P. Polychronakos and M. Smedb\"ack

Comments: LaTeX, 4 pages

We consider a model of a black hole consisting of a number of elementarycomponents. Examples of such models occur in the Ashtekar's approach tocanonical Quantum Gravity and in M-theory. We show that treating the elementarycomponents as completely distinguishable leads to the area law for the blackhole entropy. Contrary to previous results, we show that no Bose condensationoccurs, the area has big local fluctuations and that in the framework ofcanonical Quantum Gravity the area of the black hole horizon is equidistantlyquantized.
