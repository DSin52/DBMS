The formation of near-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in the S-waveapproximation can be described, near the event horizon, by an effectivesolvable model. The corresponding one-loop quantum theory remains solvable andallows to follow analytically the evaporation process which is shown to requirean infinite amount of time.
