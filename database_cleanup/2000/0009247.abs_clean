Title: Lectures on Warped Compactifications and Stringy Brane Constructions

Comments: 31 pages, harvmac big. To appear in the proceedings of TASI 1999 and

the 2000 Trieste Spring Workshop on SuperstringsIn these lectures, two different aspects of brane world scenarios in 5dgravity or string theory are discussed. In the first two lectures, work on howwarped compactifications of 5d gravity theories can change the guise of thehierarchy problem and the cosmological constant problem is reviewed, and adiscussion of several issues which remain unclear in this context is provided.In the next two lectures, microscopic constructions in string theory whichinvolve D-branes wrapped on cycles of Calabi-Yau manifolds are described. Thefocus is on computing the superpotential in the brane worldvolume field theory.Such calculations may be a necessary step towards understanding e.g.supersymmetry breaking and moduli stabilization in stringy realizations of suchscenarios, and are of intrinsic interest as probes of the quantum geometry ofthe Calabi-Yau space.
