The hidden supersymmetry of the monopole found by De Jonghe et al. isgeneralized to a spin $\2$ particle in the combined field of a Dirac monopoleplus a $\lambda^2/r^2$ potential [considered before by D'Hoker and Vinet], andrelated to the operator introduced by Biedenharn a long time ago in solving theDirac-Coulomb problem. Explicit solutions are obtained by diagonalizing theBiedenharn operator
