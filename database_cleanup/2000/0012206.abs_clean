The exceptional superalgebra $\D21a$ has been classified as a candidateconformal supersymmetry algera in two dimensions. We propose an alternativeinterpretation of it as an extended BFV-BRST quantisation superalgebra in 2D($D(2,1;1) \simeq osp(2,2|2)$). A superfield realization is presented whereinthe standard extended phase space coordinates can be identified. The physicalstates are studied via the cohomology of the BRST operator. Finally we reverseengineer a classical action corresponding to the algebraic model we haveconstructed, and identify the Lagrangian equations of motion.
