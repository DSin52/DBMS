SUSY breaking without messenger fields is proposed. We assume that our worldis on a wall and SUSY is broken only by the coexistence of another wall withsome distance from our wall. The Nambu-Goldstone fermion is localized on thedistant wall. Its overlap with the wave functions of physical fields on ourwall gives the mass splitting of physical fields on our wall thanks to alow-energy theorem. We propose that this overlap provides a practical method toevaluate mass splitting in models with SUSY breaking due to the coexistingwalls.
