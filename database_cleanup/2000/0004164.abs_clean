The complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation admits covariant bi-symplectic structurefor complex dimension 3, or higher. The first symplectic 2-form is obtainedfrom a new variational formulation of complex Monge- Amp\`ere equation in theframework of the covariant Witten-Zuckerman approach to symplectic structure.We base our considerations on a reformulation of the Witten-Zuckerman theory interms of holomorphic differential forms. The first closed and conservedWitten-Zuckerman symplectic 2-form for the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation isobtained in arbitrary dimension and for all cases elliptic, hyperbolic andhomogeneous.The connection of the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation with Ricci-flatK\"ahler geometry suggests the use of the Hilbert action. However, we point outthat Hilbert's Lagrangian is a divergence for K\"ahler metrics. Nevertheless,using the surface terms in the Hilbert Lagrangian we obtain the secondWitten-Zuckerman symplectic 2-form for complex dimension>2.
