We consider exact solutions for static black holes localized on a three-branein five-dimensional gravity in the Randall-Sundrum scenario. We show that theReissner-Nordstrom metric is an exact solution of the effective Einsteinequations on the brane, re-interpreted as a black hole without electric charge,but with instead a tidal 'charge' arising via gravitational effects from thefifth dimension. The tidal correction to the Schwarzschild potential isnegative, which is impossible in general relativity, and in this case only onehorizon is admitted, located outside the Schwarzschild horizon. The solutionsatisfies a closed system of equations on the brane, and describes thestrong-gravity regime. Current observations do not strongly constrain the tidalcharge, and significant tidal corrections could in principle arise in thestrong-gravity regime and for primordial black holes.
