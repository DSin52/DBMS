We compute fractional and integer fermion quantum numbers of staticbackground field configurations using phase shifts and Levinson's theorem. Byextending fermionic scattering theory to arbitrary dimensions, we implementdimensional regularization in a 1+1 dimensional gauge theory. We demonstratethat this regularization procedure automatically eliminates the anomaly in thevector current that a naive regulator would produce. We also apply thesetechniques to bag models in one and three dimensions.
