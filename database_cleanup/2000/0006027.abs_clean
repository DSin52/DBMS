The Riemann normal coordinate expansion method is generalized to a Kahlermanifold. The Kahler potential and holomorphic coordinate transformations areused to define a normal coordinate preserving the complex structure. Theexistence of this Kahler normal coordinate is shown explicitly to all orders.The formalism is applied to background field methods in supersymmetricnonlinear sigma models.
