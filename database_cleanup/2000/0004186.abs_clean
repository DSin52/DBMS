In these lectures, which are written at an elementary and pedagogical level,we discuss general aspects of (single) instantons in SU(N_c) Yang-Mills theory,and then specialize to the case of N = 4 supersymmetry and the large N_c limit.We show how to determine the measure of collective coordinates and computeinstanton corrections to certain correlation functions. We then relate this toD-instantons in type IIB supergravity. By taking the D-instantons to live in an$AdS_5\times S^5$ background, we perform explicit checks of the AdS/CFTcorrespondence.
