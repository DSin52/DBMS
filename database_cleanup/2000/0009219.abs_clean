It also reveals a lot on the structure of the theory``in the bulk''. The same graphs classify both the torus and the cylinderpartition functions and provide data on their hidden ``quantum symmetry''. TheOcneanu triangular cells -- the 3j-symbols of these symmetries, admit variousinterpretations and make a link between different problems.
