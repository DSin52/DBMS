We define an iterative procedure to obtain a non-abelian generalization ofthe Born-Infeld action. This construction is made possible by the use of thesevere restrictions imposed by kappa-symmetry. We have calculated all bosonicterms in the action up to terms quartic in the Yang-Mills field strength andall fermion bilinear terms up to terms cubic in the field strength. Already atthis order the fermionic terms do not satisfy the symmetric trace-prescription.
