We study a brane-antibrane system and a non-BPS D-brane in SU(2) WZW model.We first discuss the tachyon condensation using the vertex operator formalismand find the generation of codimension two D-branes after the condensation. Ourresult is consistent with the recent interpretation that a D2-brane is a boundstate of D0-branes. Then we investigate the world volume effective theory on anon-BPS D-brane. It becomes a field theory on the ``fuzzy sphere'' when thelevel is sent to infinity. The most interesting feature is that there exist thenoncommutative tachyonic solitons and we can identify them with D0-branes. Wealso discuss the brane-antibrane system from the world volume point of view andcomment on the relation to the noncommutative version of the index theorem.
