We have recently proposed a dynamical mechanism that may realize a flatfour-dimensional space time as a brane in type IIB superstring theory. Acrucial role is played by the phase of the chiral fermion integral associatedwith the IKKT Matrix Theory, which is conjectured to be a nonperturbativedefinition of type IIB superstring theory. We demonstrate our mechanism bystudying a simplified model, in which we find that a lower-dimensional braneindeed appears dynamically. We also comment on some implications of ourmechanism on model building of the brane world.
