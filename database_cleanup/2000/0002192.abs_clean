We present a new compactification of chiral, N=2 ten-dimensional supergravitydown to five dimensions and show that it corresponds to the N=2 supersymmetriccritical point of five-dimensional, N=8 gauged supergravity found in [KPW].This solution presented here is of particular significance because it involvesnon-zero tensor gauge fields and, via the AdS/CFT correspondence, is dual tothe non-trivial N=1 supersymmetric fixed point of N=4 Yang-Mills theory.
