The issue of microstate counting for general black holes in D=5, N=2supergravity coupled to vector multiplets is discussed from various viewpoints.The statistical entropy is computed for the near-extremal case by using thecentral charge appearing in the asymptotic symmetry algebra of AdS_2.Furthermore, we show that the considered supergravity theory enjoys a dualityinvariance which connects electrically charged black holes and magneticallycharged black strings. The near-horizon geometry of the latter turns out to beAdS_3 x S^2, which allows a microscopic calculation of their entropy using theBrown-Henneaux central charges in Cardy's formula. In both approaches we findperfect agreement between statistical and thermodynamical entropy.
