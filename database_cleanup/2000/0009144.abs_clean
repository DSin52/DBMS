We discuss the integrability of the Berkovits-Siegel open string fieldequations and derive an infinite set of their non-local (solution-generating)symmetries. The string field equations are embedded in an infinite system ofoverdetermined equations (BS hierarchy) associated with hidden stringsymmetries. The latter enforce the vanishing of most scattering amplitudes forthe open N=2 string.
