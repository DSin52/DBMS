We give arguments for a conjecture made in a previous paper, that one has touse only the gauged sugra action for the calculation of correlators of certainoperators via the AdS-CFT correspondence. The existence of consistenttruncations implies that the massive modes decouple, and gauged supergravity issufficient for computing n-point functions of CFT operators coupled to themassless (sugra) sector. The action obtained from the linear ansatz, of thetype $\phi(x,y)=\phi_I(x)Y^I(y)$ gives only part of the gauged sugra. Thismeans that there is a difference for the correlators on the boundary of AdSspace. We find, studying examples of correlators, that the right prescriptionis to use the full gauged sugra, which implies using the full nonlinear KKansatz. To this purpose, we analyze 3 point functions of various gauge fieldsin 5 and 7 dimensions, and the R-current anomaly in the corresponding CFT. Wealso show that the nonlinear rotation in the tower of scalar fields of Lee etal., Corrado et al. and Bastianelli and Zucchini produces a consistenttruncation to the massless level and coincides with the Taylor expansion of thenonlinear KK ansatz in massless scalar fluctuations. Finally, we speculateabout the way to do the full nonlinear rotation for the massive tower.
