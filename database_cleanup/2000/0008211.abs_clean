Using the counterterm subtraction technique we calculatehe stress-energytensor, action, and other physical quantities for Kerr-AdS black holes invarious dimensions. For Kerr-AdS_5 with both rotation parameters non-zero, wedemonstrate that stress-energy tensor, in the zero mass parameter limit, isequal to the stress tensor of the weakly coupled four dimensional dual fieldtheory. As a result, the total energy of the generalKerr-AdS_5 black hole atzero mass parameter, exactly matches the Casimir energy of the dual fieldtheory. We show that at high temperature, the general Kerr-AdS_5 andperturbative field theory stress-energy tensors are equal, up to the usualfactor of 3/4. We also use the counterterm technique to calculate the stresstensors and actions for Kerr-AdS_6, and Kerr-AdS_7 black holes, with onerotation parameter, and we display the results. We discuss the conformalanomalies of the field theories dual to the Kerr-AdS_5 and Kerr-AdS_7spacetimes. In these two field theories, we show that the rotation parametersbreak conformal invariance but not scale invariance, a novel result for anon-trivial field theory. For Kerr-AdS_7 the conformal anomalies calculated onthe gravity side and the dual (0,2) tensor multiplet theory are equal up to 4/7factor. We expect that the Casimir energy of the free field theory is the sameas the energy of the Kerr-AdS_7 black hole (with zero mass parameter), up tothat factor.
