added. To appear in "Mathematical Physics 2000", T. Kibble editor, ImperialCollege Press, July 2000We describe consequences of the chiral anomaly in the theory of quantumwires, the (quantum) Hall effect, and of a four-dimensional cousin of the Halleffect. We explain which aspects of conductance quantization are related to thechiral anomaly. The four-dimensional analogue of the Hall effect involves theaxion field, whose time derivative can be interpreted as a (space-timedependent) difference of chemical potentials of left-handed and right-handedcharged fermions. Our four-dimensional analogue of the Hall effect may play asignificant role in explaining the origin of large magnetic fields in the(early) universe.
