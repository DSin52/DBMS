The canonical quantization of the topological particle is described; it isshown that BRST quantization of the model gives the supersymmetric quantummechanical model considered by Witten when investigating Morse theory, and therigorous path integral method appropriate for this model is discussed.Possibilities for the extension of this work to two dimensional models arebriefly considered.
