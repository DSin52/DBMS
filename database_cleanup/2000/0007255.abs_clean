We investigate the behavior of the noncommutative scalar soliton solutions atfinite noncommutative scale $\theta$. A detailed analysis of the equation ofthe motion indicates that fewer and fewer soliton solutions exist as $\theta$is decreased and thus the solitonic sector of the theory exhibits an overallhierarchy structure. If the potential is bounded below, there is a finite$\theta_c$ below which all the solitons cease to exist even though thenoncommutativity is still present. If the potential is not bounded below, forany nonzero $\theta$ there is always a soliton solution, which becomes singularonly at $\theta = 0$. The $\phi^4$ potential is studied in detail and it isfound the critical $(\theta m^2)_c =13.92$ ($m^2$ is the coefficient of thequadratic term in the potential) is universal for all the symmetric $\phi^4$potential.
