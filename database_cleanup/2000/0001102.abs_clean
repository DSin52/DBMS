The possibility that a static magnetic field may decay through production ofelectron positron pairs is studied. The conclusion is that this decay cannothappen through production of single pairs, as in the electric case, but onlythrough the production of a many-body state, since the mutual magneticinteractions of the created pairs play a relevant role. The investigation ismade in view of the proposed existence of huge magnetic field strengths aroundsome kind of neutron stars.
