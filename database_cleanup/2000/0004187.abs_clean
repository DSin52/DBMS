It has recently been conjectured that the AdS_5/SYM_4 correspondence can begeneralized away from the conformal limit, to a duality between supergravity onthe full asymptotically flat three-brane background and a theory characterizedas N=4 SYM deformed in the IR by a specific dimension-eight operator. Assumingthat this relation is valid, we derive a prescription for computing n-pointcorrelation functions in the holographic theory, which reduces to the standardAdS/CFT recipe at low energies. One- and two-point functions are discussed indetail. The prescription follows from very simple considerations and appears tobe applicable to any asymptotically flat background. We also compute thequark-antiquark potential and comment on the description of the baryon in thesupergravity picture. We conclude with some comments on the possible relationbetween our work and recent results in non-commutative field theories.
