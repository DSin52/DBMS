We suggest Clifford algebra as a useful simplifying language for presentquantum dynamics. Clifford algebras arise from representations of thepermutation groups as they arise from representations of the rotation groups.Aggregates using such representations for their permutations obey Cliffordstatistics. The vectors supporting the Clifford algebras of permutations androtations are plexors and spinors respectively. Physical spinors may actuallybe plexors describing quantum ensembles, not simple individuals. We useClifford statistics to define quantum fields on a quantum space-time, and toformulate a quantum dynamics-field-space-time unity that evades thecompactification problem. The quantum bits of history regarded as a quantumcomputation seem to obey a Clifford statistics.
