Title: The FSUSY Hamiltonian in the connexion with the Chern-Simons gauge

theoryAuthors: J. Douari and Y.Hassouni

On the two-dimensional lattice, the construction of anyonic operators and itsalgebras is discussed. Thus, the fractional supersymetry (FSUSY) and theassociated FSUSY Hamiltonian basing on the quonic anyons are recalled. Itsparticular case for bosonic anyon and fermionic anyon is given. The FSUSYHamiltonian in the connexion with the Chern-Simons gauge theory is constructed.
