Using the Chern-Simon formulation of (2+1) gravity, we derive, for thegeneral asymptotic metrics given by the Fefferman-Graham-Lee theorems, theemergence of the Liouville mode associated to the boundary degrees of freedomof (2+1) dimensional anti de Sitter geometries. Holonomies are describedthrough multi-valued gauge and Liouville fields and are found to algebraicallycouple the fields defined on the disconnected components of spatial infinity.In the case of flat boundary metrics, explicit expressions are obtained for thefields and holonomies. We also show the link between the variation underdiffeomorphisms of the Einstein theory of gravitation and the Weyl anomaly ofthe conformal theory at infinity.
