We present an alternative derivation of the parity anomaly for a masslessDirac field in 2+1 dimensions coupled to a gauge field. The anomaly functional,a Chern-Simons action for the gauge field, is obtained from the non-trivialJacobian corresponding to a non local symmetry of the Pauli-Villars regularizedaction. That Jacobian is well-defined, finite, and yields the standardChern-Simons term when the cutoff tends to infinity.
