We take advantage of the superspace formalism and explicitly find the N=2supersymmetric extension of the Maxwell Chern-Simons model. In our constructiona special form of a potential term and indispensability of an additionalneutral scalar field arise naturally. By considering the algebra ofsupersymmetric charges we find Bogomol'nyi equations for the investigatedmodel.
