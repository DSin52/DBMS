The simplest and the most straightforward new algorithm for generatingsolutions to (anti) self-dual Yang-Mills (YM) equation in the typicalgravitational instanton backgrounds is proposed. When applied to the Taub-NUTand the Eguchi-Hanson metrics, the two best-known gravitational instantons, thesolutions turn out to be the rather exotic type of instanton configurationscarrying finite YM action but generally fractional topological charge values.
