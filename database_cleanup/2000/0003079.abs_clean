We consider the dynamics governing the evolution of a many body systemconstrained by an nonabelian local symmetry. We obtain explicit forms of theglobal macroscopic condition assuring that at the microscopic level theevolution respects the overall symmetry constraint. We demonstrate theconstraint mechanisms for the case of SU(2) system comprising particles infundamental, and adjoint representations (`nucleons' and `pions').
