We study localization of bosonic bulk fields on a string-like defect withcodimension 2 in a general space-time dimension in detail. We show that incases of spin 0 scalar and spin 1 vector fields there are an infinite number ofmassless Kaluza-Klein (KK) states which are degenerate with respect to theradial quantum number, but only the massless zero mode state among them iscoupled to fermion on the string-like defect. It is also commented oninteresting extensions of the model at hand to various directions such as'little' superstring theory, conformal field theory and a supersymmetricconstruction.
