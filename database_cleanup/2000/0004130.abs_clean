We construct regular and black hole solutions in SU(2) Einstein-Born-Infeldtheory. These solutions have many features in common with the correspondingSU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills solutions. In particular, sequences of neutralnon-abelian solutions tend to magnetically charged limiting solutions, relatedto embedded abelian solutions. Thermodynamic properties of the black holesolutions are addressed.
