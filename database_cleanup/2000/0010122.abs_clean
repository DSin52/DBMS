By evaluating string scattering amplitudes, we investigate various low energyinteractions for the massless scalars on a nonabelian Dirichlet brane. Weconfirm the existence of couplings of closed string fields to the world-volumescalars, involving commutators of the latter. Our results are consistent withthe recently proposed nonabelian world-volume actions for Dp-branes.
