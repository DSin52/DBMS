The idea of a companion Lagrangian associated with $p$-Branes is extended toinclude the presence of U(1) fields. The Brane Lagrangians are constructed with$F_{ij}$ represented in terms of Lagrange Brackets, which make manifest thereparametrisation invariance of the theory; these are replaced by PoissonBrackets in the companion Lagrangian, which is now covariant under fieldredefinition. The ensuing Lagrangians possess a similar formal structure tothose in the absence of an anti-symmetric field tensor.
