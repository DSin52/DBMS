Title: Soldering and Mass Generation in Four Dimensions

Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Clovis Wotzasek

Comments: 7 pages, latex

We propose bosonised expressions for the chiral Schwinger models in fourdimensions. Then, in complete analogy with the two dimensional case, we showthe soldering of two bosonised chiral Schwinger models with oppositechiralities to yield the bosonised Schwinger model in four dimensions. Theimplications of the Schwinger model or its chiral version, as known for twodimensions, thereby get extended to four dimensions.
