The rate of pair production of open strings in general uniformelectromagnetic fields is calculated in various space-time dimensions. Thecorrections with respect to the case of pure electric backgrounds aredisplayed. In particular, a contribution in the form of a Born-Infeld action isderived and its role in the present context emphasized
