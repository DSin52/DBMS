The physical meaning and the geometrical interpretation of causalityimplementation in classical field theories are discussed. Local causality arekinematical constraints dynamically implemented via solutions of the fieldequations, but in a limit of zero-distance from the field sources part of theseconstraints carries a dynamical content that explains old problems of classicalelectrodynamics away with deep implications to the nature of physicalinteractions.
