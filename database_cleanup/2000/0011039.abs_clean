Title: A Note on Singular Black Holes

Authors: Takao Suyama

Comments: 7 pages

We reconsider entropy of black holes which do not have finite area horizon.It is suggested that some of them should have nonzero entropy from bothsupergravity and string theory point of view. We also refine our arguments inour previous papers for the existence of the microstates of the black hole.
