We study a kaehler potential K in the large radius region of a Calabi-Yaud-fold M embedded in CP^{d+1}. It has a kaehler parameter t that describes adeformation of the A-model moduli. Also the metric, curvature and hermitiantwo-point functions in the large volume region are analyzed. We use a result ofour previous paper in the B-model of the mirror. We perform an analyticcontinuation of a parameter to the large complex structure region. Bytranslating the result in the A-model side of M, we determine the K. The methodis not restricted to this specific model and we apply the recipe to completeintersection Calabi-Yau cases.
