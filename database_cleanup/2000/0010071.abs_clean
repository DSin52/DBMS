We propose a mechanism ensuring (quasi)localization of massless gauge fieldson a brane. The mechanism does not rely on BPS properties of the brane and canbe realized in any theory where charged particles are confined to theworld-volume. The localized matter fluctuations induce a gauge kinetic term onthe brane. At short distances the resulting propagator for the gauge field is{\it identical} to the four-dimensional propagator. The gauge theory on thebrane is effectively four-dimensional at short distances; it becomeshigher-dimensional on very large (cosmic) scales. The brane-bulk systemexhibits the phenomenon of ``infrared transparency''. As a result, only verylow frequency modes can escape into extra dimensions. In this framework thelarge wavelength cosmic radiation can dissipate in extra space at a rate thatmay be observable, in principle. We briefly discuss some astrophysicalconsequences of this scenario.The same mechanism of localization of gauge fields may work in Kaplan'sframework for domain wall chiral fermions on lattices.
