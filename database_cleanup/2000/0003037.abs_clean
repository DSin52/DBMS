We explain how D-branes on group manifolds are stabilized against shrinkingby quantized worldvolume U(1) fluxes. Starting from the Born-Infeld action inthe case of the SU(2) group manifold we derive the masses, multiplicities andspectrum of small fluctuations of these branes, and show that they agreeexactly with the predictions of conformal field theory, to all orders in the$\alpha^\prime$ expansion. We discuss the generalization to other groups andquantized?
