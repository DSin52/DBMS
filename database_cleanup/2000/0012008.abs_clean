Title: Hidden Virasoro Symmetry of the Sine Gordon Theory

Authors: Davide Fioravanti

Comments: 6 pages, JHEP proceedings style, talk presented at the Conference

"Nonperturbative Quantum Effects 2000"In the framework of the Sine-Gordon (SG) theory we will present theconstruction of a dynamical Virasoro symmetry which has nothing to do with thespace-time Virasoro symmetry of 2D CFT. Although, it is non-local in the SGfield theory, nevertheless it gives rise to a local action on specificN-soliton solution variables. These {\it analytic} variables possess abeautiful geometrical meaning and enter the Form Factor expressions. At theend, we will also give some preliminary hints about the quantisation.
