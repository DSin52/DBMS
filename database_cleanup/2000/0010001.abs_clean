Title: Morita Equivalence and Interpolation of The Dirac-Born-infeld Theory on

the Non-Commutative TorusAuthors: Pei Wang, Rui-Hong Yue and Kang-Jie Shi

Comments: 6 pages, latex, no figures

In the noncommutative Dirac-Born-Infeld action with Chern-Simons term, aninterpolation field $\Phi$ is used in both DBI action and Chern-Simons term.The Morita equivalence is discussed in both the lagrangian and the Hamiltonianformalisms, which is more transparent in this treatment.
