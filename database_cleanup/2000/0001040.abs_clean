misprints correctedA system of generalized coherent states for the de Sitter group obeyingKlein-Gordon equation and corresponding to the massive spin zero particles overthe de Sitter space is considered. This allows us to construct the quantizedscalar field by the resolution over these coherent states; the correspondingpropagator can be computed by the method of analytic continuation to thecomplexified de Sitter space and coincides with expressions obtained previouslyby other methods. We show that this propagator possess the de Sitter-invarianceand causality properties.
