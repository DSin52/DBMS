We have calculated the energy levels of the hydrogen atom and as well theLamb shift within the noncommutative quantum electrodynamics theory. Theresults show deviations from the usual QED both on the classical and on thequantum levels. On both levels, the deviations depend on the parameter ofspace/space noncommutativity.
