We revisit the lattice formulation of the Abelian Chern-Simons model definedon an infinite Euclidean lattice. We point out that any gauge invariant, localand parity odd Abelian quadratic form exhibits, in addition to the zeroeigenvalue associated with the gauge invariance and to the physical zero modeat p=0 due to traslational invariance, a set of extra zero eigenvalues insidethe Brillouin zone. For the Abelian Chern-Simons theory, which is linear in thederivative, this proliferation of zero modes is reminiscent of theNielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem for fermions. A gauge invariant, local andparity even term such as the Maxwell action leads to the elimination of theextra zeros by opening a gap with a mechanism similar to that leading to Wilsonfermions on the lattice.
