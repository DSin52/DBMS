TMR Conference on Quantum Aspects of Gauge Theories, Supersymmetry andUnification, Paris, 1-7 September 1999According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, the maximally supersymmetric SU(N)Yang-Mills theory in 4 dimensions is dual to the type IIB string theorycompactified on AdS_5 x S^5. Most of the tests performed so far are confined tothe leading order at large N or equivalently string tree-level. To probe thecorrespondence beyond this leading order and obtain 1/N^2 corrections isdifficult since string one-loop computations on an AdS_5 x S^5 backgroundgenerally are beyond feasibility. However, we will show that the chiral SU(4)_Ranomaly of the super YM theory provides an ideal testing ground to go beyondleading order in N. We review and develop further our previous results that the1/N^2 corrections to the chiral anomaly on the super YM side can be exactlyaccounted for by the supergravity/string effective action induced at one loop.
