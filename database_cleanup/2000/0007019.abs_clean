We study non-linear electrodynamics in curved space from the viewpoint ofdualities. After establishing the existence of a topological bound forself-dual configurations of Born-Infeld field in curved space, we check thatthe energy-momentum tensor vanishes. These properties are shown to hold forgeneral duality-invariant non-linear electrodynamics. We give the dimensionalreduction of Born-Infeld action to three dimensions in a general curvedbackground admitting a Killing vector. The SO(2) duality symmetry becomesmanifest but other symmetries present in flat space are broken, as is U-dualitywhen one couples to gravity. We generalize our arguments on duality to the caseof n U(1) gauge fields, and present a new Lagrangian possessing SO(n) XSO(2)_elemag duality symmetry. Other properties of this model such as Legendreduality and enhancement of the symmetry by adding dilaton and axion, arestudied. We extend our arguments to include a background b-field in the curvedspace, and give new examples including almost Kaehler manifolds andSchwarzshild black holes with a $b$-field.
