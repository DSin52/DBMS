We study D-branes of the ${SL(2,\bR)}$ WZW model, and of its discreteorbifolds. Gluing the currents by group automorphisms leads to three types ofor anti-de-Sitter branes (AdS$_2$). We explain that the dS$_2$ branes areunphysical, because the electric field on their worldvolume is supercritical.By combining ${SL(2,\bR)}$ and SU(2), we exhibit a class of supersymmetricAdS$_2\times S^2$ three-brane worldvolumes, and consider their possibleembeddings in the near-horizon region of stringy black holes. We point out theintriguing difference between the induced and the effective geometries of theseD-branes, and speculate on its possible significance.
