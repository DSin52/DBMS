General formalism of quantum field theory and addition theorem for Besselfunctions are applied to derive formula for Casimir-Polder energy ofinteraction between a polarizable particle and a dilute dielectric ball. Theequivalence of dipole-dipole interaction and Casimir energy for dilutehomogeneous dielectrics is shown. A novel method is used to derive Casimirenergy of a dilute dielectric ball without divergences in calculations.Physically realistic model of a dilute ball is discussed. Different approachesto the calculation of Casimir energy of a dielectric ball are reviewed.
