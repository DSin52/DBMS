We find evidence for a duality between the standard matrix formulations of Mtheory and a background independent theory which extends loop quantum gravityby replacing SU(2) with a supersymmetric and quantum group extension of SU(16).This is deduced from the recently proposed cubic matrix model for M theorywhich has been argued to have compactifications which reduce to the IKKT anddWHN-BFSS matrix models. Here we find new compactifications of this theorywhose Hilbert spaces consist of SU(16) conformal blocks on compacttwo-surfaces. These compactifications break the SU(N) symmetry of the standardM theory compactifications, while preserving SU(16), while the BFSS modelpreserve the SU(N) but break SU(16) to the SO(9) symmetry of the 11 dimensionallight cone coordinates. These results suggest that the supersymmetric andquantum deformed SU(16) extension of loop quantum gravity provides a dual,background independent description of the degrees of freedom and dynamics ofthe M theory matrix models.
