We study some non-perturbative aspects of noncommutative gauge theories. Wefind analytic solutions of the equations of motion, for noncommutative U(1)gauge theory, that describe magnetic monopoles with a finite tension stringattached. These solutions are non-singular, finite and sourceless. We identifythe string with the projection of a D-string ending on a D3-brane in thepresence of a constant B-field.
