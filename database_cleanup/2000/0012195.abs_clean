We construct supergravity solutions dual to the twisted field theoriesarising when M-theory fivebranes wrap general supersymmetric cycles. Thesolutions are constructed in maximal D=7 gauged supergravity and then upliftedto D=11. Our analysis covers Kahler, special Lagrangian and exceptionalcalibrated cycles. The metric on the cycles are Einstein, but do notnecessarily have constant curvature. We find many new examples of AdS/CFTduality, corresponding to the IR superconformal fixed points of the twistedfield theories.
