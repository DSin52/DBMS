We derive the noncommutative Chern-Simons action induced by Dirac fermionscoupled to a background gauge field, for the fundamental, antifundamental, andthe adjoint representation. We discuss properties of the noncommutativeChern-Simons action showing in particular that the Seiberg-Witten formula mapsit into the standard commutative Chern-Simons action.
