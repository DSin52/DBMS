Higher dimensional conformal QFT possesses an interesting braided structurewhich, different from the d=1+1 models, is restricted to the timelike regionand therefore easily escapes euclidean action methods. It lies behind thespectrum of anomalous dimensions which may be viewed as a kind of substitutefor a missing particle interpretation in the presence of interactions.
