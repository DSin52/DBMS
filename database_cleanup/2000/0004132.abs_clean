We study exact solutions of Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations and Greenfunctions in d-dimensional QED and in an external electromagnetic field withconstant and homogeneous field invariants. The cases of even and odd dimensionsare considered separately, they are essentially different. We direct attentionto the asymmetry of the quasienergy spectrum, which appears in odd dimensions.The in and out classification of the exact solutions as well as thecompleteness and orthogonality relations is strictly proven. Different Greenfunctions in the form of sums over the exact solutions are constructed. TheFock-Schwinger proper time integral representations of these Green functionsare found. As physical applications we consider the calculations of differentquantum effects related to the vacuum instability in the external field. Forexample, we present mean values of particles created from the vacuum, theprobability of the vacuum remaining a vacuum, the effective action, and theexpectation values of the current and energy-momentum tensor.
