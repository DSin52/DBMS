Title: Effective action for QED_4 through zeta function regularization

Authors: C.G. Beneventano and E.M. Santangelo

Comments: Several changes, including title, LateX, 9 pages

We obtain, through zeta function methods, the one-loop effective action formassive Dirac fields in the presence of a uniform, but otherwise general,electromagnetic background. After discussing renormalization, we compare ourzeta function result with Schwinger's proper time approach.
