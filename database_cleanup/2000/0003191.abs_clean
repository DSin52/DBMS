Consistent interactions between Yang-Mills gauge fields and an abelian 2-formare investigated by using a Hamiltonian cohomological procedure. It is shownthat the deformation of the BRST charge and the BRST-invariant Hamiltonian ofthe uncoupled model generates the Yang-Mills Chern-Simons interaction term. Theresulting interactions deform both the gauge transformations and their algebra,but not the reducibility relations.
