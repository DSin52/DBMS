We test the Maldacena conjecture for type IIB String Theory/ N=4 Yang-Millsby calculating the one-loop corrections in the bulk theory to the Weyl anomalyof the boundary CFT when the latter is coupled to a Ricci-flat metric. Thecontributions cancel within each supermultiplet, in agreement with theconjecture.
