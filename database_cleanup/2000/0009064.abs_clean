Title: Dynamical Localization of Gravity

Authors: Aharon Davidson (Ben Gurion) and Philip D. Mannheim (U. Connecticut

and MIT)Comments: RevTeX, 9 pages. (updated version v2 with references to prior work,

conclusions unchanged)We show that the thin wall limit of the thick domain wall associated with asine-Gordon soliton in a single non-compactified patch of 5-dimensionalspacetime explicitly yields the Randall-Sundrum localized gravity two patchbrane, with its discrete $Z_2$ symmetry arising from the discrete symmetry ofthe potential, and with the thin Minkowski brane$\Lambda_5+\kappa^2_5\Lambda^2_b/6=0$ relation between bulk and branecosmological constants arising naturally without any need for fine tuning.Additionally we show that for an embedded thin de Sitter brane, localization ofgravity is again possible provided the 5-space is compactified, with the nownon-zero net cosmological constant $\Lambda_5+\kappa^2_5\Lambda^2_b/6$ on thebrane being found to vary inversely with the compactification radius.
