Open string theories can be decoupled from closed strings and gravity byscaling to the critical electric field. We propose dual descriptions for thestrong coupling limit of these NCOS (Non-Commutative Open String) theories insix or fewer spacetime dimensions. In particular, we conjecture that thefive-dimensionsal NCOS theory at strong coupling, is a theory of light OpenMembranes (OM), decoupled from gravity, on an M5-brane with a near-criticalthree-form field strength. The relation of OM theory to NCOS theories resemblesthat of M theory to Type II closed string theories. In two dimensions weconjecture that supersymmetric U($n$) gauge theory with a unit of electric fluxis dual to the NCOS theory with string coupling $1 \over n$. A constructionbased on NS5-branes leads to new theories in six dimensions generalising thelittle string theory. A web of dualities relates all the above theories whenthey are compactified on tori.
