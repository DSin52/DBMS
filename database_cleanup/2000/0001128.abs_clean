We describe a general construction principle which allows to add colourvalues to a coupling constant dependent scattering matrix. As a concreterealization of this mechanism we provide a new type of S-matrix whichgeneralizes the one of affine Toda field theory, being related to a pair of Liealgebras. A characteristic feature of this S-matrix is that in general itviolates parity invariance. For particular choices of the two Lie algebrasinvolved this scattering matrix coincides with the one related to the scalingmodels described by the minimal affine Toda S-matrices and for other choiceswith the one of the Homogeneous sine-Gordon models with vanishing resonanceparameters. We carry out the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz and identify thecorresponding ultraviolet effective central charges.
