The `winding state' behavior appears in the two-loop nonplanar contributionto the partition function in thermal noncommutative field theories. We derivethis feature directly from the purely open string theory analysis in thepresence of the constant background $B$-field; we compute the two-looppartition function for worldsheets with a handle and a boundary when the timedirection of the Euclideanized target space is compactified. In contrast to theclosed-string-inspired approach, it is not necessary to add infinite number ofextra degrees of freedom. Furthermore, we find a piece of supporting evidencetoward the conjecture that, in the UV limit, the noncommutativity parameterplays the role of the effective string scale in noncommutative field theories.
