It has recently been argued that D-branes in bosonic string theory can bedescribed as noncommutative solitons, outside whose core the tachyon iscondensed to its ground state. We conjecture that, in addition, the local U(1)gauge symmetry is restored to a $U(\infty)$ symmetry in the vacuum outside thiscore. We present new solutions obeying this boundary condition. The tension ofthese solitons agrees exactly with the expected D-brane tension for arbitrarynoncommutativity parameter $\t$, which effectively becomes a dynamicalvariable. The restored $U(\infty)$ eliminates unwanted extra modes which mightotherwise appear outside the soliton core.
