Title: A New Basis Function Approach to 't Hooft Equation

Authors: O. Abe

Comments: 6 pages, 2 figures. Prepared for Fifth Workshop on QCD (QCD2000),

Villefranche-Sur-Mer, France, 3-7 January 2000We present the new basis functions to investigate the 't Hooft equation, thelowest order mesonic Light-Front Tamm-Dancoff equation for $\rm SU(N_C)$ gaugetheories. We find the wave function can be well approximated by new basisfunctions and obtain an analytic formula for the mass of the lightest boundstate. Its value is consistent with the precedent results.
