In this paper we consider the worldsheet of superstring as a noncommutativespace. Some additional terms can be added to the superstring action, such thatfor ordinary worldsheet they are zero. Expansion of this extended action up tothe first order of the noncommutativity parameter, leads to the newsupersymmetric action for string. For the closed superstring, we obtain theboundary state that describes a brane. From the open string point of view, thenew boundary conditions on the worldsheet bosons, generalize thenoncommutativity of spacetime. Finally, we suggest some definitions for thenoncommutativity parameter of superstring worldsheet.
