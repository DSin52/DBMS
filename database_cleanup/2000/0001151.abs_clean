The knowledge of {\it non usual} and sometimes {\it hidden} symmetries of(classical) integrable systems provides a very powerful setting-out ofsolutions of these models. Primarily, the understanding and possibly thequantisation of intriguing symmetries could give rise to deeper insight intothe nature of field spectrum and correlation functions in quantum integrablemodels. With this perspective in mind we will propose a general framework fordiscovery and investigation of local, quasi-local and non-local symmetries inclassical integrable systems. We will pay particular attention to the structureof symmetry algebra and to the r\^ole of conserved quantities. We will alsostress a nice unifying point of view about KdV hierarchies and Toda fieldtheories with the result of obtaining a Virasoro algebra as exact symmetry ofSine-Gordon Model.
