The state space and observables for the leading order of the large-N theoryare constructed. The obtained model ("theory of infinite number of fields") isshown to obey Wightman-type axioms (including invariance under boosttransformations) and to be nontrivial (there are scattering processes, boundstates, unstable particles etc). The considered class of exactly solvablerelativistic quantum models involves good examples of theories containing suchdifficulties as volume divergences associated with the Haag theorem,Stueckelberg divergences and infinite renormalization of the wave function.
