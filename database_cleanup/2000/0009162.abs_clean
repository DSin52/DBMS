The presentation is lighter (some results have been put in an appendix, thenumber of figures has been reduced). Some conclusions have been modifiedVarious deformations of the position-momentum algebras operators have beenproposed. Their implications for single systems like the hydrogen atom or theharmonic oscillator have been addressed. In this paper we investigate theconsequences of some of these algebras for macroscopic systems. The key pointof our analysis lies in the fact that the modification of the Heisenberguncertainty relations present in these theories changes the volume of theelementary cell in the hamiltonian phase space and so the measure needed tocompute partition functions.The thermodynamics of a non interacting gas are studied for two members ofthe Kempf-Mangano-Mann (K.M.M.) deformations. It is shown that the theory whichexhibits a minimal uncertainty in length predicts a new behavior at hightemperature while the one with a minimal uncertainty in momentum displaysunusual features for huge volumes. In the second model negative pressures areobtained and mixing two different gases does not necessarily increase theentropy . This suggests a possible violation of the second law ofthermodynamics. Potential consequences of these models in the evolution of theearly universe are briefly discussed.Constructing the Einstein model of a solid for the q deformed oscillator, wefind that the subset of eigenstates whose energies are bounded from above leadsto a divergent partition function.
