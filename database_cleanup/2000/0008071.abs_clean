We find the spectrum of boundary bound states for the sine-Gordon model withDirichlet boundary conditions, closing the bootstrap and providing a completedescription of all the poles in the boundary reflection factors. The boundaryColeman-Thun mechanism plays an important role in the analysis. Two basiclemmas are introduced which should hold for any 1+1-dimensional boundary fieldtheory, allowing the general method to be applied to other models.
