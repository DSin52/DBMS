By analysing the work of Campolattaro we argue that the second Seiberg-Wittenequation over the Spin^c_4 manifold, i.e., F^+_{ij}=< M,S_ij M >, is thegeneralization of the Campolattaro's description of the electromagnetic fieldtensor F^{\mu\nu} in the bilinear form F^{\mu\nu}=\bar{\Psi} S^{\mu\nu}\Psi. Itturns out that the Seiberg-Witten equations (also the perturbed Seiberg-Wittenequations) can be well understood from this point of view. We suggest that thesecond Seiberg-Witten equation can be replaced by a nonlinear Dirac-likeEquation. We also derive the spinor representation of the connection on theassociated unitary line bundle over the Spin^c_4 manifold.
