We analyse a supersymmetric mechanical model derived from (1+1)-dimensionalfield theory with Yukawa interaction, assuming that all physical variables taketheir values in a Grassmann algebra B. Utilizing the symmetries of the model wedemonstrate how for a certain class of potentials the equations of motion canbe solved completely for any B. In a second approach we suppose that theGrassmann algebra is finitely generated, decompose the dynamical variables intoreal components and devise a layer-by-layer strategy to solve the equations ofmotion for arbitrary potential. We examine the possible types of motion forboth bosonic and fermionic quantities and show how symmetries relate the formerto the latter in a geometrical way. In particular, we investigate oscillatorymotion, applying results of Floquet theory, in order to elucidate the role thatenergy variations of the lower order quantities play in determining thequantities of higher order in B.
