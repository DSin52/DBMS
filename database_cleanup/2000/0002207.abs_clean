Using a Lax pair based on twisted affine $sl(2,R)$ Kac-Moody and Virasoroalgebras, we deduce a r-matrix formulation of two dimensional reduced vacuumEinstein's equations. Whereas the fundamental Poisson brackets arenon-ultralocal, they lead to pure c-number modified Yang-Baxter equations. Wealso describe how to obtain classical observables by imposing reasonableboundaries conditions.
