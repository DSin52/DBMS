The minimal chiral Schwinger model is discussed from theBatalin-Fradkin-Fradkina-Tyutin point of view. The conversion of second-classconstraints to first-class ones results in an extended gauge-invariant theorywhich is equivalent for $a=2$ to the vector Schwinger model at the Lagrangianlevel. Here, we present arguments which show that such equivalence does notexist at the operatorial level.
