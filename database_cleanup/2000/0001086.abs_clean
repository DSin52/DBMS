The fundamental laws of physics can be derived from the requirement ofinvariance under suitable classes of transformations on the one hand, and fromthe need for a well-posed mathematical theory on the other hand. As a part ofthis programme, the present paper shows under which conditions the introductionof pseudo-differential boundary operators in one-loop Euclidean quantum gravityis compatible both with their invariance under infinitesimal diffeomorphismsand with the requirement of a strongly elliptic theory. Suitable assumptions onthe kernel of the boundary operator make it therefore possible to overcomeproblems resulting from the choice of purely local boundary conditions.
