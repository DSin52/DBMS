Title: Scaling Behavior of Black Hole Entropy

Authors: Rolf Schimmrigk

Comments: 8 pages, 1 figure

It is shown that the entropy of fourdimensional black holes in string theorycompactified on weighted Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces shows scaling behavior in acertain limit. This leads to non-monotonic functions on the moduli space.
