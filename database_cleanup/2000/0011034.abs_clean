equations of the paper and the general concept of non-Abelian geometryaccentuated, reference added; this is the version accepted to appear in Comm.in Mathematical PhysicsAlgebras; Symplectic GeometrySpatial noncommutativity is similar and can even be related to thenon-Abelian nature of multiple D-branes. But they have so far seemedindependent of each other. Reflecting this decoupling, the algebra of matrixvalued fields on noncommutative space is thought to be the simple tensorproduct of constant matrix algebra and the Moyal-Weyl deformation. We proposescenarios in which the two become intertwined and inseparable. Therefore theusual separation of ordinary or noncommutative space from the internal discretespace responsible for non-Abelian symmetry is really the exceptional case of anunified structure. We call it non-Abelian geometry. This general structureemerges when multiple D-branes are configured suitably in a flat but varying Bfield background, or in the presence of non-Abelian gauge field background. Itcan also occur in connection with Taub-NUT geometry. We compute the deformedproduct of matrix valued functions using the lattice string quantum mechanicalmodel developed earlier. The result is a new type of associative algebradefining non-Abelian geometry. Possible supergravity dual is also discussed.
