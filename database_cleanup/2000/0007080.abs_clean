We discuss the scattering of relativistic spin zero particles by aninfinitely long and arbitrarily thin solenoid. The exact solution of thefirst-quantized problem can be obtained as a mimic of the nonrelativistic case,either in the original Aharonov-Bohm way or by using the Berry's magnetizationscheme. The perturbative treatment is developed in the Feshbach-Villarstwo-component formalism for the Klein-Gordon equation and it is shown that italso requires renormalization as in the Schrodinger counterpart. The resultsare compared with those of the field theoretical approach which corresponds tothe two-body sector of the scalar Chern-Simons theory.
