We discuss the analytic properties of AdS scalar exchange graphs in thecrossed channel. We show that the possible non-analytic terms drop out byvirtue of non-trivial properties of generalized hypergeometric functions. Theabsence of non-analytic terms is a necessary condition for the existence of anoperator product expansion for CFT amplitudes obtained from AdS/CFTcorrespondence.
