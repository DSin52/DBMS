Confinement of electrically charged test particles in the dilute plasma ofmonopoles and pointlike magnetic dipoles is studied. We calculate the tensionof the string emerging between the infinitely separated test particles. Thestring tension is an increasing function of the dipole density provided otherparameters of the plasma are fixed. The relevance of our results to confininggauge theories is discussed.
