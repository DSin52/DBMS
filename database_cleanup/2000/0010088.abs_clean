The type IIB supergravity solution describing a collection of regular andfractional D3 branes on the conifold (hep-th/0002159) was recently generalizedto the case of the deformed conifold (hep-th/0007191). Here we present anothergeneralization -- when the conifold is replaced by the resolved conifold. Thisconstructing the Ricci-flat Kahler metric on resolved conifold and then solvingthe supergravity equations for the D3-brane ansatz with constant dilaton and(self-dual) 3-form fluxes; (ii) by generalizing the ``conifold'' ansatz ofhep-th/0002159 in a natural ``asymmetric'' way so that the 1-d actiondescribing radial evolution still admits a superpotential and then solving theresulting 1-st order system. The superpotentials for the ``resolved'' and``deformed'' conifold cases turn out to have essentially the same simplestructure. The solution in the resolved conifold case has the same asymptoticUV behaviour as in the conifold case, but unlike the deformed conifold case isstill singular in the IR. The naked singularity is of repulson type and mayhave a brane resolution.
