SystemsThe conformal affine Toda model coupled to the matter field (CATM) isobtained through a classical reduction of the $sl(2)^{(1)}$ affine two-loopWZNW model. After spontaneously broken the conformal symmetry by means of BRSTanalysis, we end up with an effective theory, the so called affine Toda modelcoupled to the matter (ATM). Further, using a bosonization technique we recoverfrom this theory the sine-Gordon model plus a free massless scalar field. TheATM model is considered as a QCD-motivated integrable field theory, since itdescribes various features in the baryonic sector of the low-energy effectiveLagrangian of QCD in two dimensions with one flavor and two colors. Imposingthe equivalence of the Noether and topological currrents as a constraint, it isshown that the intercharge ``quark''- ``anti-quark'' static potential reveals alinear confinement behavior for large intercharge separation.
