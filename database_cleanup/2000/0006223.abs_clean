It is argued that D-brane charge takes values in K-homology. For smoothmanifolds with spin structure, this could explain why the phase factor$\Omega(x)$ calculated with a D-brane state x in IIB theory appears inDiaconescu, Moore and Witten's computation of the partition function of IIAstring theory.
