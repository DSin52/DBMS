It has recently been shown that the Randall-Sundrum brane-world may beobtained from an appropriate doubled D3-brane configuration in type IIB theory.This corresponds, in five dimensions, to a sphere compactification of theoriginal IIB theory with a non-trivial breathing mode supporting the brane. Inthis paper, we shall study the supersymmetry of this reduction to massivefive-dimensional supergravity, and derive the effective supersymmetrytransformations for the fermionic superpartners to the breathing mode. We alsoconsider the sphere compactifications of eleven-dimensional supergravity toboth four and seven dimensions. For the compactifications on S^5 and S^7, weinclude a squashing mode scalar and discuss the truncation from N=8 to N=2supersymmetry.
