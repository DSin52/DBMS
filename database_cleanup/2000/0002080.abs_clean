We use the conformal Ward identities to study the structure of correlationfunctions in coset conformal field theories. For a large class of primaryfields of arbitrary g/h theory a factorization anzatz is found.Correspondingcorrelation functions are explicitly expressed in terms of correlationfunctions of two independent WZNW theories for g and h.
