We study the dynamics of brane worlds coupled to a scalar field and gravity,and find that self-tuning of the cosmological constant is generic in theorieswith at most two branes or a single brane with orbifold boundary conditions. Wedemonstrate that singularities are generic in the self-tuned solutionswith an infinitely large extra dimension is only consistent with particularfine-tuned values of the brane tension. The number of allowed brane tensionvalues is related to the number of negative stationary points of the scalarbulk potential and, in the case of an oscillatory potential, the brane tensionfor which gravity is localized without singularities is quantized. We alsoexamine a resolution of the singularities, and find that fine-tuning isgenerically re-introduced at the singularities in order to retain a staticsolution. However, we speculate that the presence of additional fields mayrestore self-tuning.
