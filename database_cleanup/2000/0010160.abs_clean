We evaluate the one-loop correction to the spectrum of Kaluza-Klein systemfor the $\phi^3$ model on $R^{1,d}\times (T_\theta^2)^L$, where $1+d$dimensions are the ordinary flat Minkowski spacetimes and the extra dimensionsare the L two-dimensional noncommutative tori with noncommutativity $\theta$.The correction to the Kaluza-Klein mass spectrum is then used to compute theCasimir energy. The results show that when $L>2$ the Casimir energy due to thenoncommutativity could give repulsive force to stabilize the extranoncommutative tori in the cases of $d = 4n - 2$, with $n$ a positive integral.
