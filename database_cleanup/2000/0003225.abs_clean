Using the formal analogy between the Dick superstring inspired model ofref.[6] and the problem of building of Eguchi Hanson metric in 4d N=2 harmonicsuperspace (hs), we derive a general formula for the quark-quark interactionpotential V(r) including the Dick confining potential. The interquark potentialV(r) depends on the dilaton-gluon coupling and may be related to theparameterization of confinement by the quark and gluon vacuum condensates. Itis also shown how the axion field may be incorporated in agreement with 10dtype IIB superstring requirements. Others features are also discussed.
