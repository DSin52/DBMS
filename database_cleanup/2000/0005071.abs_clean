A formulation of Skyrme model as an embedded gauge theory with the constraintdeformed away from the spherical geometry is proposed. The gauge invariantformulation is obtained firstly generalizing the intrinsic geometry of themodel and then converting the constraint to first-class through an iterativeWess-Zumino procedure. The gauge invariant model is quantized via Dirac methodfor first-class system. A perturbative calculation provides new free parametersrelated to deformation that improve the energy spectrum obtained in earlierapproaches.
