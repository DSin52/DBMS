A solution to the cosmological constant problem has been proposed in whichour universe is a 3-brane in a 5-dimensional spacetime. With a bulk scalar, thefield equations admit a Poincare invariant brane solution regardless of thevalue of the cosmological constant (tension) on the brane. However, thesolution does not include matter in the brane. We find new exact staticsolutions with matter density and pressure in the brane. We study smallperturbations about these solutions. None seem consistent with observationalcosmology. As a byproduct we find a class of new matterless static solutionsand a non-static solution which, curiously, requires the string value for thedilaton coupling.
