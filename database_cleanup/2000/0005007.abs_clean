A class of supergravity backgrounds have been proposed as dual descriptionsof strong coupling large-N noncommutative Yang-Mills (NCYM) theories in 3+1dimensions. However calculations of correlation functions in supergravity froman evaluation of relevant classical actions appear ambiguous. We propose aresolution of this ambiguity. Assuming that {\it some} holographic descriptionexists - regardless of whether it is the NCYM theory - we argue that thereshould be operators in the holographic boundary theory which create normalizedstates of definite energy and momenta. An operator version of the dualcorrespondence then provides a calculation of correlators of these operators interms of bulk Green's functions. We show that in the low energy limit thecorrelators reproduce expected answers of the ordinary Yang-Mills theory.
