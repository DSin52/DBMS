We show how the threshold level of affine fusion, the fusion ofWess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theories, fits into the Schubertcalculus introduced by Gepner. The Pieri rule can be modified in a simple wayto include the threshold level, so that calculations may be done for all(non-negative integer) levels at once. With the usual Giambelli formula, themodified Pieri formula deforms the tensor product coefficients (and the fusioncoefficients) into what we call threshold polynomials. We compare them with theq-deformed tensor product coefficients and fusion coefficients that are relatedto q-deformed weight multiplicities. We also discuss the meaning of thethreshold level in the context of paths on graphs.
