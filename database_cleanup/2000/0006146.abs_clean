The junction condition across a singular surface in general relativity,formulated by Israel, has double covariance. In this paper, a generalperturbation scheme of the junction condition around an arbitrary background isgiven in a doubly covariant way. After that, as an application of the generalscheme, we consider perturbation of the junction condition around a backgroundwith the symmetry of a $(D-2)$-dimensional constant curvature space, where $D$is the dimensionality of the spacetime. The perturbed junction condition iswritten in terms of doubly gauge-invariant variables only. Since the symmetricbackground includes cosmological solutions in the brane-world as a specialcase, the doubly gauge-invariant junction condition can be used as basicequations for perturbations in the brane-world cosmology.
