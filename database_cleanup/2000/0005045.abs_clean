We explore the idea of a network of defects to live inside a domain wall inmodels of three real scalar fields, engendering the Z_2 x Z_3 symmetry. Thefield that governs the Z_2 symmetry generates a domain wall, and entraps thehexagonal network formed by the three-junctions of the model of two scalarfields that describes the remaining Z_3 symmetry. If the host domain wall bendsto the spherical form, in the thin wall approximation there may appearnon-topological structures hosting networks that accept diverse patterns. IfZ_3 is also broken, the model may generate a buckyball containing sixtyjunctions, a fullerene-like structure. Applications to cosmology are outlined.
