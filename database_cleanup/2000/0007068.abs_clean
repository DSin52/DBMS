Authors: Juan Fernando Ospina Giraldo

Comments: 8 pages, Latex

The Wess-Zumino couplings for generalized sigma-orbifold fixed-points arepresented and the generalized GS 6-form that encoding the completesigma-standard gauge-gravitational-non standard gauge anomaly and its oppositeinflow is derived.
