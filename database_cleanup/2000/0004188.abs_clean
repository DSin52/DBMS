Using an exact solution as a concrete example, Nambu-Goldstone modes on theBPS domain wall junction are worked out for N=1 supersymmetric theories in fourdimensions. Their wave functions extend along the wall to infinity (notlocalized) and are not normalizable. It is argued that this feature is ageneric phenomenon of Nambu-Goldstone modes on domain wall junctions in thebulk flat space in any dimensions. We formulate mode equations and show thatfermion and boson with the same mass come in pairs except massless modes whichcan appear singly, in accordance with unitary representations of (1, 0)supersymmetry.
