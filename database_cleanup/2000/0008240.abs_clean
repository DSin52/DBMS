International Conference on High Energy Physics (ICHEP 2000), July 27-August2, 2000, Osaka, JapanTwo dimensional N=2 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models on hermitiansymmetric spaces are formulated in terms of the auxiliary superfields. If weeliminate auxiliary vector and chiral superfields, they give D- and F-termconstraints to define the target manifolds. The integration over auxiliaryvector superfields, which can be performed exactly, is equivalent to theelimination of the auxiliary fields by the use of the classical equations ofmotion.
