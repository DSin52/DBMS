We study monotonicity and other properties of the canonical c-function(defined through the correlator of the energy-momentum tensor) in someholographic duals of 4-d quantum field theories. The canonical c-function andits derivatives are related to the 5-d Green's function of the dualsupergravity theory. While positivity of the canonical c-function is obvious,we have not found a general proof of its monotonicity, even though c ismonotonic in the few explicit examples we examine in this paper.
