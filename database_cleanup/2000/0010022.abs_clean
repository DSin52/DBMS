The dependence on the torsion H=db of the Wess-Zumino couplings of D-branesthat are trivially embedded in space-time is studied. We show that even in thissimple set-up some torsion components can be turned on, with a non-trivialeffect on the RR couplings. In the special cases in which either the tangent orthe normal bundle are trivial, the torsion dependence amounts to substitute thestandard curvature with its generalization in the presence of torsion, in theusual couplings involving the roof genus A.
