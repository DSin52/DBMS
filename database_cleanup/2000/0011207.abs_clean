The holographic description of supersymmetric RG flows in supergravity isconsidered from both the five-dimensional and ten-dimensional perspectives. AnN=1* flow of N=4 super-Yang Mills is considered in detail, and the infra-redlimit is studied in terms of IIB supergravity in ten dimensions. Depending onthe vevs and the direction of approach to the core, the supergravity solutioncan be interpreted in terms of either 5-branes or 7-branes. Generally, it isshown that it is essential to use the ten-dimensional description in order tostudy the infra-red asymptotics in supergravity.
