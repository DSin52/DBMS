A submodel of the so-called conformal affine Toda model coupled to the matterfield (CATM) is defined such that its real Lagrangian has a positive-definitekinetic term for the Toda field and a usual kinetic term for the (Dirac) spinorfield. After spontaneously broken the conformal symmetry by means of BRSTanalysis, we end up with an effective theory, the off-critical affine Todamodel coupled to the matter (ATM). It is shown that the ATM model inherits theremarkable properties of the general CATM model such as the soliton solutions,the particle/soliton correspondence and the equivacence between the Noether andtopological currents. The classical solitonic spectrum of the ATM model is alsodiscussed.
