Motivated by the mixing of UV and IR effects, we test the OPE formula innoncommutative field theory. First we look at the renormalization of localcomposite operators, identifying some of their characteristic IR/UVsingularities. Then we find that the product of two fields in general cannot bedescribed by a series expansion of single local operator insertions.
