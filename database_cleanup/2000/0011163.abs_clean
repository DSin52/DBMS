Title: Renormalization of non-locally regularized BRST-anti-BRST theories

Authors: V. Calian, G. Stoenescu

Comments: 9 pages

An extension of the non-local regularization scheme is formulated in theSp(2) symmetric Lagrangian BRST quantization framework. It generates asystematic treatment of the anomalous quantum master equations and allows tosubstract the divergences as well as to calculate genuine higher loop BRST andanti-BRST anomalies.
