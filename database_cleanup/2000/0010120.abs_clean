We investigated the bubble collisions during the first order phasetransitions. Numerical results indicate that within the certain range ofparameters the collision of two bubbles leads to formation of separaterelatively long-lived quasilumps - configurations filled with scalar fieldoscillating around the true vacuum state. Energy is perfectly localized, anddensity is slightly pulsating around its maximum. This process is accompaniedby radiation of scalar waves.
