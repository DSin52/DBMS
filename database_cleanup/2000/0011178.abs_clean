Authors: M. A. R. Osorio, Mar\'{\i}a Su\'arez (University of Oviedo, Asturias,

Spain)Comments: Old section 3 suppressed, the end of old section 4 is now an

appendix. For the obssesed reader, we also stress that the work has nothingto do with any proposal of modification for the DBI action in the non abeliancaseJournal-ref: Phys.Lett. B502 (2001) 239-245

We study the way Lorentz covariance can be reconstructed from Matrix Theoryas a IMF description of M-theory. The problem is actually related to theinterplay between a non abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action and Super-Yang-Millsas its generalized non-relativistic approximation. All this physics shows up bymeans of an analysis of the asymptotic expansion of the Bessel functions$K_\nu$ that profusely appear in the computations of amplitudes at finitetemperature and solitonic calculations. We hope this might help to betterunderstand the issue of getting a Lorentz covariant formulation in relationwith the $N\to +\infty$ limit. There are also some computations that could beof some interest in Relativistic Statistical Mechanics.
