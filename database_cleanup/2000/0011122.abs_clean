We investigate Matrix theory in the large-N limit following the conjecturedcorrespondence between Matrix theory and supergravity on the near-horizon limitof the D0-brane background. We analyze the complete fermionic spectrum ofsupergravity and obtain two-point functions of the supercurrents in Matrixtheory. By examining the large-N scaling properties of the correlators, wediscuss the consistency of the 11-dimensional interpretation of thesupersymmetry of Matrix theory.
