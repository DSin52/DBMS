We present a Lorentz invariant lagrangian formulation for a supersymmetricYang-Mills vector multiplet in eleven dimensions (11D). The Lorentz symmetry isbroken at the field equation level, and therefore the breaking is spontaneous,as in other formulations of supersymmetric theories in 12D or higherdimensions. We introduce a space-like unit vector formed by the gradient of ascalar field, avoiding the problem of Lorentz non-invariance at the lagrangianlevel, which is also an analog of non-commutative geometry with constant fieldstrengths breaking Lorentz covariance. The constancy of the space-like unitvector field is implied by the field equation of a multiplier field. The fieldequations for the physical fields are formally the same as those of 10Dsupersymmetric Yang-Mills multiplet, but now with some constraints on thesefields for supersymmetric consistency. This formulation also utilizes themultiplier fields accompanied by the bilinear forms of constraints, such thatthese multiplier fields will not interfere with the physical field equations.Based on this component result, we also present a $\k$-symmetric supermembraneaction with the supersymmetric Yang-Mills backgrounds.
