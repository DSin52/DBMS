We present new solutions of higher dimensional Einstein's equations with acosmological constant that localize gravity on branes which are transverse toRicci-flat manifolds or to homogeneous spaces with topologically non-trivialsolutions of gauge field equations. These solutions are relevant for thelocalization of chiral fermions on a brane.
