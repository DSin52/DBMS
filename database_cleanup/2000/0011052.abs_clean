Title: New symplectic structure for KdV

Comments: To be published in "Integrable Hierarchies and Modern Physics

Theories, NATO ARW-UIC 2000" Editors H. Aratyn and A. SorinStarting with Lagrangians, which turn out to be degenerate, the Hamiltonianoperators for integrable systems can be constructed using Dirac's theory ofconstraints. We illustrate this by giving a systematic discussion of the firstHamiltonian structure of KdV. The first symplectic 2-form obtained from Dirac'stheory is the time component of the covariant Witten-Zuckerman symplectic2-form current. We derive the flux of the first symplectic 2-form. Then we turnto a new Lagrangian for KdV recently obtained by Pavlov and present thecorresponding new covariant symplectic structure for KdV. This shows that theinverse of Magri's second Hamiltonian operator is also a Hamiltonian operatorfor KdV.
