Lately, to provide a solid ground for quantization of the open string theorywith a constant B-field, it has been proposed to treat the boundary conditionsas hamiltonian constraints.It seems that this proposal is quite general and should be applicable to awide range of models defined on manifolds with boundaries. The goal of thepresent paper is to show how the boundary conditions can arise as constraintsin a purely algebraic fashion within the Hamiltonian approach without anyreference to the Lagrangian formulation of the theory. The construction of theboundary Dirac brackets is also given and some subtleties are pointed out.sigma model, the open string theory with and without a constant $B$-field andelectrodynamics with topological term.A curious result for electrodynamics on a manifold with boundaries ispresented.
