We study the Quantum-Mechanics on the hyper-Kahler manifold that is theblow-up of an $A_1$-singularity. This system is relevant for M(atrix)-theory asit was conjectured to describe scattering in the "noncommutative" deformationof a free 5+1D tensor multiplet in the sector with two units of longitudinallight-like momentum.
