In these notes we review the theory of the microscopic modeling of the 5-dim.black hole of type IIB string theory in terms of the $D1-D5$ brane system. Theemphasis here is more on the brane dynamics rather than on supergravitysolutions. We present a discussion of the low energy brane dynamics and accountfor black hole thermodynamics and Hawking radiation rates. These considerationsare valid in the regime of supergravity due to the non-renormalization of thelow energy dynamics in this model.
