We consider the boundary states which describe D-branes in a constant B-fieldbackground. We show that the two-form field Phi, which interpolates commutativeand noncommutative descriptions of D-branes, can be interpreted as theinvariant field strength in the T-dual picture. We also show that the extendedalgebra parametrized by theta and Phi naturally appears as the commutationrelations of the original and the T-dual coordinates.
