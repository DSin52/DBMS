We examine the thermodynamic stability of large black holes infour-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, and we demonstrate numerically thatblack holes which lack local thermodynamic stability often also lack stabilityagainst small perturbations. This shows that no-hair theorems do not apply inanti-de Sitter space. A heuristic argument, based on thermodynamics only,suggests that if there are any violations of Cosmic Censorship in the evolutionof unstable black holes in anti-de Sitter space, they are beyond the reach of aperturbative analysis.
