We present an explicit study of the holographic renormalization group (RG) insix dimensions using minimal gauged supergravity. By perturbing the theory withthe addition of a relevant operator of dimension four one flows to anon-supersymmetric conformal fixed point. There are also solutions describingnon-conformal vacua of the same theory obtained by giving an expectation valueto the operator. One such vacuum is supersymmetric and is obtained by using thetrue superpotential of the theory. We discuss the physical acceptability ofthese vacua by applying the criteria recently given by Gubser for the fourdimensional case and find that those criteria give a clear physical picture inthe six dimensional case as well. We use this example to comment on the role ofthe Hamilton-Jacobi equations in implementing the RG. We conclude with someremarks on AdS_4 and the status of three dimensional superconformal theoriesfrom squashed solutions of M-theory.
