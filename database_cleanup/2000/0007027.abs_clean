We find that Euclidian or Minkowski gravity in d dimensions can be formallyexpressed as the restriction to a slice of a supersymmetric Yang-Mills theoryin d+1 dimensions with SO(d+1), SO(d,1) or SO(d-1,2) internal symmetry. Wesuggest that renormalization effects in the bulk imply a contraction of thelatter symmetry into the Poincare group ISO(d) or ISO(d-1,1).
