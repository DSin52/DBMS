We propose a topological Chern-Simons term in D=5 dimensions coupled toEinstein Hilbert theory. Hartree approximation for topological Lagrangian andthe Chern-Simons term in D=3 is considered. An effective model of QuantumGravity in D=5 dimensions is presented here. The analysis of residues isconsidered and the unitarity is guaranteed at tree level. The propagator isghost and tachyon free.
