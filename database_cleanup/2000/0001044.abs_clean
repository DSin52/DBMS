Title: Tachyon condensation and Boundary States in Bosonic String

Authors: Y. Matsuo

Comments: Proceeding of the talk given at YITP workshop ``Tachyon condensation

and boundary state''(October 27-29, 1999), latex fileWe discuss tachyon configuration for the unoriented bosonic string theorywhich produces a bosonic string theory with SO(32) gauge symmetry in tendimensions. It is closely related to the tachyon condensation scenario proposedby A. Sen. We also give the boundary state description of the tachyoncondensation process, with some emphasis on the r\^ole of orbifold conformalfield theory.
