We study noncommutative geometry in the framework of theBatalin-Fradkin-Tyutin(BFT) scheme, which converts second class constraintsystem into first class one. In an open string theory noncommutative geometryappears due to the mixed boundary conditions having second class constraints,which arise in string theory with $D$-branes under a constant Neveu-Schwarz$B$-field. Introduction of a new coordinate $y$ on $D$-brane through BFTanalysis allows us to obtain the commutative geometry with the help of thefirst class constraints, and the resulting action corresponding to the firstclass Hamiltonian in the BFT Hamiltonian formalism has a new local symmetry.
