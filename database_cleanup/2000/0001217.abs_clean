We discuss the calculation of threshold corrections to gauge couplingconstants for the, only, non-decomposable class of abelian (2, 2) symmetric N=1four dimensional heterotic orbifold models, where the internal twist isrealized as a generalized Coxeter automorphism. The latter orbifold was singledout in earlier work as the only N=1 heterotic $Z_N$ orbifold that satisfy thephenomenological criteria of correct minimal gauge coupling unification andcancellation of target space modular anomalies.
