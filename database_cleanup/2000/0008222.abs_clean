E. Gol\c{c}alves and B. M. Pimentel (World Scientific, 2001). pp, 73-79)The concept of fractal index is introduced in connection with the idea ofuniversal class $h$ of particles or quasiparticles, termed fractons, which obeyfractal statistics. We show the relation between fractons and conformal fieldtheory(CFT)-quasiparticles taking into account the central charge $c[\nu]$ andthe particle-hole duality $\nu\longleftrightarrow\frac{1}{\nu}$, forinteger-value $\nu$ of the statistical parameter. The Hausdorff dimension $h$which labelled the universal classes of particles and the conformal anomaly aretherefore related. We also establish a connection between Rogers dilogarithmfunction, Farey series of rational numbers and the Hausdorff dimension.
