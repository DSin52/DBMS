Title: Exact String Solutions in Curved Backgrounds

Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX. A comment and a reference added

We show how the classical string dynamics in $D$-dimensional curvedbackground can be reduced to the dynamics of a massless particle constrained ona certain surface whenever there exists at least one Killing vector for thebackground metric. Then we obtain a number of sufficient conditions, whichensure the existence of exact solutions to the equations of motion andconstraints. The results are also relevant to the null string case. Finally, weillustrate our considerations with an explicit example in four dimensions.
