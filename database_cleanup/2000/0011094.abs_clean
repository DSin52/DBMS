The D2brane-anti-D2brane system is described in the framework of BFSS Matrixmodel and noncommutative (NC) gauge theory. The physical spectrum of fields isfound by appropriate gauge fixing. The exact tachyon potential is computed interms of these variables and an exact description of tachyon condensationprovided. We exhibit multiple vortex production with increasing topologicalcharge and interpret this as gradual conversion of the brane-antibrane systemto $D0$ branes. The entire analysis is carried out using the known hamiltonianof the Matrix model, which is equivalent to the hamiltonian of the NC gaugetheory. We identify the supersymmetric ground state of this hamiltonian withthe tachyonic vacuum; Sen's conjecture about the latter follows simply fromthis identification. We also find two types of closed string excitations,solitonic (a la Dijkgraaf, Verlinde and Verlinde) as well as perturbative,around the tachyonic vacuum.
