We consider fixing the bosonic light-cone gauge for string in AdS in thephase space framework, i.e. by choosing $x^+ = \tau$, and by choosing $\sigma$so that $P^+$ is distributed uniformly (its density is independent of$\sigma$). We discuss classical bosonic string in AdS space and superstring inAdS_5 x S^5. In the latter case the starting point is the action found inhep-th/0007036 where the kappa-symmetry is fixed by a fermionic light conegauge. We derive the light cone Hamiltonian in the AdS_5 x S^5 case and in thecase of superstring in AdS_3 x S^3. We also obtain a realization of thegenerators of the basic symmetry superalgebra psu(2,2|4) in terms of the AdS_5x S^5 superstring coordinate fields.
