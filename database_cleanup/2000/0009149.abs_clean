Title: Confinement and Flavor Symmetry Breaking via Monopole Condensation

Authors: Hitoshi Murayama (UC Berkeley, LBNL)

Comments: 6 pages. Parallel session talk presented at ICHEP 2000, July 27 -

August 2, 2000, Osaka, JapanWe discuss dynamics of N=2 supersymmetric SU(n_c) gauge theories with n_fquark hypermultiplets. Upon N=1 perturbation of introducing a finite mass forthe adjoint chiral multiplet, we show that the flavor U(n_f) symmetry isdynamically broken to U(r) \times U(n_f-r), where r\leq [n_f/2] is an integer.This flavor symmetry breaking occurs due to the condensates of magnetic degreesof freedom which acquire flavor quantum numbers due to the quark zero modes. Webriefly comment on the USp(2n_c) gauge theories. This talk is based on workswith Giuseppe Carlino and Ken Konishi, hep-th/0001036 and hep-th/0005076.
