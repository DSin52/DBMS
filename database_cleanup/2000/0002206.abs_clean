Title: Asymptotic Dynamics in Quantum Field Theory - When does the coupling

switch off?Authors: Robin Horan, Martin Lavelle and David McMullan

Comments: LaTeX, 10 pages, 3 eps figures

We discuss the approach to asymptotic dynamics due to Kulish and Faddeev. Weshow that there are problems in applying this method to theories with fourpoint interactions. The source of the difficulties is identified and a moregeneral method is constructed. This is then applied to various theoriesincluding some where the coupling does switch off at large times and some whereit does not.
