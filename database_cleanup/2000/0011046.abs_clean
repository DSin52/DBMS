We continue the study of string theory on AdS_3 x SU(3)/U(1) and AdS_3 xSO(5)/SO(3). We compute the spacetime spectrum of the N=3 supersymmetric dualCFT using worldsheet techniques. The spectrum of chiral primaries coincides forthe two models. Unlike N=4 theories, the building block of the symmetricproduct in spacetime (corresponding to a single long string) is not by itselfin the moduli space of a symmetric product.
