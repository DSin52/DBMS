Using pure spinors, the superstring was recently quantized in a manifestlyten-dimensional super-Poincar\'e covariant manner and a covariant prescriptionwas given for tree-level scattering amplitudes. In this paper, we prove thatthis prescription is cyclically symmetric and, for the scattering of anarbitrary number of massless bosons and up to four massless fermions, it agreeswith the standard Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz prescription.
