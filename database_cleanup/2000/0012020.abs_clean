meeting of the Japanese Society of General Relativity and Gravitation, Osaka,2000 Sept. 11-14The thermodynamics of nearly-extreme charged black holes depends upon thenumber of ground states at fixed large charge and upon the distribution ofhighly degenerate (as suggested by the large semiclassical Hawking entropy ofan extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black hole), excited states not. (2) All energylevels highly degenerate, with macroscopic energy gaps between them. (3) Allstates nondegenerate (or with low degeneracy), separated by exponentially tinyenergy gaps. I suggest that in our world with broken supersymmetry, this lastpossibility seems most plausible. An experiment is proposed to distinguishbetween these possibilities, but it would take a time that is here calculatedto be more than about 10^837 years.
