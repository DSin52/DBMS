In the quantum mechanics of collision problems we must consider scatteringstates of the system. For these states, the wave functions do not remain inHilbert space, but they are expressible in terms of generalized functions of aGel'fand triplet. Supersymmetric quantum mechanics for dealing with thescattering states is here proposed.
