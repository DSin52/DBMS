The supersymmetric sinh-Gordon model on a half-line with integrable boundaryconditions is considered perturbatively to verify conjectured exact reflectionfactors to one loop order. Propagators for the boson and fermion fieldsrestricted to a half-line contain several novel features and are developed asprerequisites for the calculations.
