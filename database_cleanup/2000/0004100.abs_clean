Open descendants with boundaries and crosscaps of non-trivial automorphismtype are studied. We focus on the case where the bulk symmetry is broken to aZ_2 orbifold subalgebra. By requiring positivity and integrality for the opensector, we derive a unique crosscap of automorphism type g \in Z_2 and acorresponding g-twisted Klein bottle for a charge conjugation invariant. As aspecific example, we use T-duality to construct the descendants of the truediagonal invariant with symmetry preserving crosscaps and boundaries.
