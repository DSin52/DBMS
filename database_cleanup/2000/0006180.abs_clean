Using the average action defined with a continuum analog of the block spintransformation, we show the presence of gauge symmetry along the Wilsonianrenormalization group flow. As a reflection of the gauge symmetry, the averageaction satisfies the quantum master equation(QME). We show that the quantumpart of the master equation is naturally understood once the measurecontribution under the BRS transformation is taken into account. Furthermore aneffective BRS transformation acting on macroscopic fields may be defined fromthe QME. The average action is explicitly evaluated in terms of the saddlepoint approximation up to one-loop order. It is confirmed that the actionsatisfies the QME and the flow equation.
