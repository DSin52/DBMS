Title: The transformations of the electromagnetic potentials under translations

Authors: Bernd A. Berg

I consider infinitesimal translations $x'^{\alpha}=x^{\alpha}+\deltax^{\alpha}$ and demand that Noether's approach gives a symmetricelectromagnetic energy-momentum tensor as it is required for gravitationalsources. This argument determines the transformations of the electromagneticpotentials under infinitesimal translations to be $A'_{\gamma} (x') =A_{\gamma}(x)+\partial_{\gamma} [\delta x_{\beta} A^{\beta}(x)]$, which differsfrom the usually assumed invariance $A'_{\gamma} (x') = A_{\gamma}(x)$, by thegauge transformation $\partial_{\gamma} [\delta x_{\beta} A^{\beta}(x)]$.
