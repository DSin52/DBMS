As opposed to usual Einstein gravity in four dimensions, the Brane-Worldscenario allows the construction of a local density of gravitational energy(and also of momentum, of angular momentum, etc...). This is a directconsequence of the hypothesis that our universe is located at the boundary of afive-dimensional diffeomorphism invariant manifold. We compute theseBrane-World densities of charge using the Lanczos-Israel boundary conditions.To proceed, we implement an explicitely covariant generalization of theHamiltonian procedure of Regge and Teitelboim given in a previous work. Wefinally study two simple Brane-World examples.
