We have studied the theory of gauged chiral bosons and proposed a generaltheory, a master action, that encompasses different kinds of gauge fieldcouplings in chiral bosonized theories with first-class chiral constraints. Wehave fused opposite chiral aspects of this master action using the solderingformalism and applied the final action to several well known models. TheLorentz rotation permitted us to fix conditions on the parameters of thisgeneral theory in order to preserve the relativistic invariance. We also haveestablished some conditions on the arbitrary parameter concerned in a chiralSchwinger model with a generalized constraint, investigating both covarianceand Lorentz invariance. The results obtained supplements the one that shows thesoldering formalism as a new method of mass generation.
