We discuss several aspects of three dimensional N=2 supersymmetric gaugetheories coupled to chiral multiplets. The generation of Chern-Simons couplingsat low-energies results in novel behaviour including compact Coulomb branches,non-abelian gauge symmetry enhancement and interesting patterns of dynamicallygenerated potentials. We further show how, given any pair of mirror theorieswith N=4 supersymmetry, one may flow to a pair of mirror theories with N=2supersymmetry by gauging a suitable combination of the R-symmetries. Theresulting theories again have interesting properties due to Chern-Simonscouplings.
