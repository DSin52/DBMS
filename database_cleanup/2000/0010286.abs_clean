We consider the effective action of M-theory compactified on a S^1/Z_2orbifold with R^2 interaction in the Gauss-Bonnet combination. We deriveequations of motion with source terms arising from the Gauss-Bonnet terms andfind the M2-brane solution up to order \kappa^{2/3}. It receives a correctionwhich depends on the orbifold coordinate in the same form as the gauge 5-branesolution.
