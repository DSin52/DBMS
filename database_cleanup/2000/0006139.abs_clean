We point out several subtleties arising in brane-world scenarios ofcosmological constant cancellation. We show that solutions with curvaturesingularities are inconsistent, unless the contribution to the effectivefour-dimentional cosmological constant of the physics that resolves thesingularities is fine-tuned. This holds for both flat and curved branes.Irrespective of this problem, we then study an isolated class of flat solutionsin models where a bulk scalar field with a vanishing potential couples to a3-brane. We give an example where the introduction of a bulk scalar potentialresults in a nonzero cosmological constant. Finally we comment on the stabilityof classical solutions of the brane system with respect to quantum corrections.
