We demonstrate that under certain conditions a theory of conformal quantummechanics will exhibit the symmetries of two half-Virasoro algebras. We furtherdemonstrate the conditions under which these algebras combine to form a singleVirasoro algebra, and comment on the connection between this result and theAdS/CFT correspondence.
