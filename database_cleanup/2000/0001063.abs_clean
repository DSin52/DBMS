We discuss the modular invariance of the SL(2,R) WZW model. In particular, wediscuss in detail the modular invariants using the \hat{sl}(2,R) charactersbased on the discrete unitary series of the SL(2,R) representations. Theexplicit forms of the corresponding characters are known when no singularvectors appear. We show, for example, that from such characters modularinvariants can be obtained only when the level k < 2 and infinitely large spinsare included. In fact, we give a modular invariant with three variablesZ(z,\tau, u) in this case. We also argue that the discrete series charactersare not sufficient to construct a modular invariant compatible with theunitarity bound, which was proposed to resolve the ghost problem of the SL(2,R)strings.
