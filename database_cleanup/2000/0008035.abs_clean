We recall the non-Abelian Stokes theorem for the Wilson loop in theYang-Mills theory and discuss its meaning. Then we move to `gravitationalWilson loops', i.e. to holonomies in curved d=2,3,4 spaces and derivenon-Abelian Stokes theorems for these quantities as well, which are similar toour formula in the Yang-Mills theory. In particular we derive an elegantformula for the holonomy in the case of a constant-curvature background inthree dimensions and a formula for small-area loops in any number ofdimensions.
