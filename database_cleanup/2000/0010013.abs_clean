Quantum dynamical semigroups are applied to the study of the time evolutionof harmonic oscillators, both bosonic and fermionic. Explicit expressions forthe density matrices describing the states of these systems are derived usingthe holomorphic representation. Bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom arethen put together to form a supersymmetric oscillator; the conditions thatassure supersymmetry invariance of the corresponding dynamical equations areexplicitly derived.
