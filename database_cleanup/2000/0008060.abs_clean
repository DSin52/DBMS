We consider four-graviton scattering in Type II string theory on one-looplevel in the large centre of mass energy M^2 limit. We extract from it anexplicit integral expression for the full string theory corrections to theimaginary part of the mass-shift and the lifetime of a massive state with thehighest allowed spin J=2M^2+2. We find a decay rate that is up to log Mcorrections of order 1 in string units, times g_s^2. We also find that thedominant decay mode corresponds to the emission of light particles, whereas thedecay into two massive or two massless states is exponentially suppressed. Wediscuss the relation of our results to quantum gravity aspects of a Kerr BlackHole.
