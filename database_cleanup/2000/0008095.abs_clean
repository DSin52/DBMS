We derive an exact duality transformation for pure non-Abelian gauge theoryregularized on a lattice. The duality transformation can be applied to gaugetheory with an arbitrary compact Lie group G as the gauge group and onEuclidean space-time lattices of dimension d >= 2. It maps the partitionfunction as well as the expectation values of generalized non-Abelian Wilsonloops (spin networks) to expressions involving only finite-dimensional unitaryrepresentations, intertwiners and characters of G. In particular, all groupintegrations are explicitly performed. The transformation maps the strongcoupling regime of non-Abelian gauge theory to the weak coupling regime of thedual model. This dual model is a system in statistical mechanics whoseconfigurations are spin foams on the lattice.
