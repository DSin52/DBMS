We investigate the oblique vacua in the perturbed 2+1 dimensional gaugetheory living on D2 branes. The string theory dual of these vacua is expectedto correspond to polarizations of the D2 branes into NS5 branes with D4 branecharge. We perturb the gauge theory by adding fermions masses. In thenonsupersymmetric case, we also consider the effect of slight variations of themasses of the scalars. For certain ranges of scalar masses we find obliquevacua.We show that D4 charge is an essential ingredient in understanding D2 -> NS5polarizations. We find that some of the polarization states which appear asmetastable vacua when D4 charge is not considered are in fact unstable. Theydecay by acquiring D4 charge, tilting and shrinking to zero size.
