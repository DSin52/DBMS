We solve the Schwinger-Dyson equations for (2+1)-dimensional QED in thepresence of a strong external magnetic field. The calculation is done at finitetemperature and the fermionic self energy is not supposed to bemomentum-independent, which is the usual simplification in such calculations.The phase diagram in the temperature-magnetic field plane is determined. Forintermediate magnetic fields the critical temperature turns out to have asquare root dependence on the magnetic field, but for very strong magneticfields it approaches a B-independent limiting value.
