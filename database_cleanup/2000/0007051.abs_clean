856-865We develop an approximation scheme for the quantum mechanics of N D0-branesat finite temperature in the 't Hooft large-N limit. The entropy of the quantummechanics calculated using this approximation agrees well with theBekenstein-Hawking entropy of a ten-dimensional non-extremal black hole with0-brane charge. This result is in accord with the duality conjectured byItzhaki, Maldacena, Sonnenschein and Yankielowicz. Our approximation schemeprovides a model for the density matrix which describes a black hole in thestrongly-coupled quantum mechanics.
