Recently it was shown that the Born-Infeld-type modification of thequadratic Yang-Mills action gives rise to classical particle-like solutions inthe flat space which have a striking similarity with the Bartnik-McKinnonsolutions known in the gravity coupled Yang-Mills theory. We show that bothfamilies are continuously related within the framework of theEinstein-Born-Infeld theory through interpolating sequences of parameters. Wealso investigate an internal structure of the associated black holes. It isfound that the Born-Infeld non-linearity leads to a drastic modification ofthe black hole interior typical for the usual Yang-Mills theory. In the lattercase a generic solution exhibits violent metric oscillations near thesingularity. In the Born-Infeld case a generic interior solution is smooth, themetric has the standard Schwarzschild type singularity, and we did not observeinternal horizons. Such smoothing of the 'violent' EYM singularity may beinterpreted as a result of quantum effects.
