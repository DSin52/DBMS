Title: Realistic regularization of the QED Green functions

Authors: Marijan Ribaric and Luka Sustersic

Generalizing the 't Hooft and Veltman method of unitary regulators, wedemonstrate for the first time the existence of local, Lorentz-invariant,(i) Feynman diagrams are finite and equal the diagrams of QED but withregularized propagators. (ii) N-point Green functions are C-, P-, andT-invariant up to a phase factor, Lorentz-invariant and causal. (iii) Noauxiliary particles or parameters are introduced.
