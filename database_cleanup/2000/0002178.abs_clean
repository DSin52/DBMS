In 2+1 dimensions there exists a duality between a charged Dirac particlecoupled minimally to a background vector potential and a neutral one couplednonminimally to a background electromagnetic field strength. A constant uniformbackground electric current induces in the vacuum of the neutral particle afermion current which is proportional to the background one. A backgroundelectromagnetic plane wave induces no current in the vacuum. For constant butnonuniform background electric charge, known results for charged particles canbe translated to give the induced fermion number. Some new examples withinfinite background electric charge are presented. The induced spin and totalangular momentum are also discussed.
