We calculate a component of connection superfields and Lorentz superparameterat second order in anticommuting coordinates in terms of the component fieldsof 11-dimensional on-shell supergravity by using `Gauge completion'. Thisconfiguration of superspace holds the $\kappa $-symmetry for supermembraneLagrangian and represents 11-dimensional on-shell supergravity.
