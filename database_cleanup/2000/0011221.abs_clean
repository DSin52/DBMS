Mathematics and Physics (Kluwer, 2001) 229-243We outline the the geometry of locally anisotropic (la) superspaces andla-supergravity. The approach is backgrounded on the method of anholonomicsuperframes with associated nonlinear connection structure. Following theformalism of enveloping algebras and star product calculus we propose a modelof gauge la-gravity on noncommutative spaces. The corresponding Seiberg-Wittenmaps are established which allow the definition of dynamics for a finite numberof gravitational gauge field components on noncommutative spaces.
