We construct supergravity solutions that correspond to N Dp-branes coincidingwith \bar{N} \bar{Dp}-branes. We study the physical properties of the solutionsand analyse the supergravity description of tachyon condensation. We constructan interpolation between the brane-antibrane solution and the Schwarzschildsolution and discuss its possible application to the study ofnon-supersymmetric black holes.
