Title: Finite Volume Spectrum of Sine-Gordon Model and its Restrictions

Authors: G. Feverati

Comments: PhD thesis, 96 pages, 28 figures

In this thesis, we review recent progresses on Nonlinear Integral Equationapproach to finite size effects in two dimensional integrable quantum fieldtheories, with emphasis to Sine-Gordon/Massive Thirring model and restrictionsto minimal models perturbed by $\Phi_{1,3}$. Exact calculations of thedependence of energy levels on the size are presented for vacuum and manyexcited states.
