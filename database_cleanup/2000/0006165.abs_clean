We develop a method of singularity analysis for conformal graphs which, inparticular, is applicable to the holographic image of AdS supergravity theory.It can be used to determine the critical exponents for any such graph in agiven channel. These exponents determine the towers of conformal blocks thatare exchanged in this channel. We analyze the scalar AdS box graph and showthat it has the same critical exponents as the corresponding CFT box graph.Thus pairs of external fields couple to the same exchanged conformal blocks inboth theories. This is looked upon as a general structural argument supportingthe Maldacena hypothesis.
