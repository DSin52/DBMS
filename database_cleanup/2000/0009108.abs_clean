Generalized quantum statistics will be presented in the context ofrepresentation theory of Lie (super)algebras. This approach provides a naturalmathematical framework, as is illustrated by the relation between para-Bose andpara-Fermi operators and Lie (super)algebras of type B. Inspired by thisrelation, A-statistics is introduced, arising from representation theory of theLie algebra A_n. The Fock representations for A_n=sl(n+1) provide microscopicdescriptions of particular kinds of exclusion statistics, which may be calledquasi-Bose statistics. It is indicated that A-statistics appears to be thenatural statistics for certain lattice models in condensed matter physics.
