Considering the theory of induced gravity coupled to matter fields, takingthe $\phi ^6$ interaction potential model we evaluate the one-loop effectivepotential in a (3+1)dimensional Bianchi type-I spacetime. It is proved that the$\phi ^6$ theory can be regularised in (3+1)dimensional curved spacetime. Weevaluate the finite temperature effective potential and study the temperaturedependence of phase transitions. The nature of phase transitions in the earlyuniverse is clarified to be of first order. The effects of spacetime curvatureand arbitrary field coupling on the phase transitions in the early universe arealso discussed.
