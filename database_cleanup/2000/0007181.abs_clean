The possible role of gravity in a noncommutative geometry is investigated.Due to the Moyal *-product of fields in noncommutative geometry, it isnecessary to complexify the metric tensor of gravity. We first consider thepossibility of a complex Hermitian, nonsymmetric $g_{\mu\nu}$ and discuss theproblems associated with such a theory. We then introduce a complex symmetric(non-Hermitian) metric, with the associated complex connection and curvature,as the basis of a noncommutative spacetime geometry. The spacetime coordinatesare in general complex and the group of local gauge transformations isassociated with the complex group of Lorentz transformations CSO(3,1). A realaction is chosen to obtain a consistent set of field equations. A Weylquantization of the metric associated with the algebra of noncommutingcoordinates is employed.
