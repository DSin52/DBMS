It is shown how a integrable mechanical system provides all the localizedstatic solutions of a deformation of the linear O(N)-sigma model in twospace-time dimensions. The proof is based on the Hamilton-Jacobi separabilityof the mechanical analogue system that follows when time-independent fieldconfigurations are being considered. In particular, we describe the propertiesof the different kinds of kinks in such a way that a hierarchical structure ofsolitary wave manifolds emerges for distinct N.
