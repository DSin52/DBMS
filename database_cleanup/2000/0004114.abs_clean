A globally consistent treatment of linearized gravity in the Randall-Sundrumbackground with matter on the brane is formulated. Using a novel gauge, inwhich the transverse components of the metric are non-vanishing, the brane iskept straight. We analyze the gauge symmetries and identify the physicaldegrees of freedom of gravity. Our results underline the necessity fornon-gravitational confinement of matter to the brane.
