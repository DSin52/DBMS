We propose that the expectation value of a circular BPS-Wilson loop in N=4SUSYM can be calculated exactly, to all orders in a 1/N expansion and to allorders in g^2 N. Using the AdS/CFT duality, this result yields a prediction ofthe value of the string amplitude with a circular boundary to all orders inalpha' and to all orders in g_s. We then compare this result with stringtheory. We find that the gauge theory calculation, for large g^2 N and to allorders in the 1/N^2 expansion does agree with the leading string theorycalculation, to all orders in g_s and to lowest order in alpha'. We also find arelation between the expectation value of any closed smooth Wilson loop and theloop related to it by an inversion that takes a point along the loop toinfinity, and compare this result, again successfully, with string theory.
