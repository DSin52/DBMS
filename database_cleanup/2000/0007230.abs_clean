For many systems with second class constraints, the question posed in thetitle is answered in the negative. We prove this for a range of systems withtwo second class constraints. After looking at two examples, we consider afairly general proof. It is shown that, to unravel gauge invariances in secondclass constrained systems, it is sufficient to work in the original phase spaceitself. Extension of the phase space by introducing new variables or fields isnot required.
