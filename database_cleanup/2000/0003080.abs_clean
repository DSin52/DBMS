A group theoretical procedure, introduced earlier (hep-th/9901090), todecompose bilocal light-ray operators into (harmonic) operators of definitetwist is applied to the case of arbitrary 2nd rank tensors. As a genericexample the bilocal gluon operator is considered which gets contributions oftwist-2 up to twist-6 from four different symmetry classes characterized byconrresponding Young tableaus; also the twist decomposition of the relatedvector and scalar operators is considered. In addition, we extend these reseltsto various trilocal light-ray operators, like the Shuryak-Vainshtein, thethree-gluon and the four-quark operators, which are required for theconsideration of higher twist distribution amplitudes. The present results relyon the knowledge of harmonic tensor polynomials of any order n which habe beendetermined up to the case of 2nd rank symmetric tensors for arbitraryspace-time dimension.
