The Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition is described by the nonperturbativerenormalization flow of the two dimensional $\phi^4$-model. The observation ofessential scaling demonstrates that the flow equation incorporatesnonperturbative effects which have previously found an alternative descriptionin terms of vortices. The duality between the linear and nonlinear$\sigma$-model gives a unified description of the long distance behaviour forO(N)-models in arbitrary dimension $d$. We compute critical exponents in firstorder in the derivative expansion.
