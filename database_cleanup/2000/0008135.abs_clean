Title: Post-Riemannian Merger of Yang-Mills Interactions with Gravity

Authors: O. Megged

Comments: Advanced version

bibliographyWe show that a post-Riemannian spacetime can accommodate an internal symmetrystructure of the Yang-Mills prototype in such a way that the internal symmetrybecomes an integral part of the spacetime itself. The construction encrusts theinternal degrees of freedom in spacetime in a manner that merges the gauging ofthese degrees of freedom with the frame geometrical gauges of spacetime. Inparticular, we prove that the three spacetime structural identities, which nowbecome ``contaminated'' by internal degrees of freedom, remain invariant withrespect to internal gauge transformations. In a Weyl Cartan spacetime, thetheory regains the original form of Einstein's equations, in which gauge fieldsources on the r.h.s. determine on the l.h.s the geometry of spacetime and thefields it induces. In the more general case we identify new contributions ofweak magnitude in the interaction between the Yang-Mills field and gravity. Themerger of spacetime with internal degrees of freedom which we propose here isnot constrained by the usual Coleman-Mandula considerations.
