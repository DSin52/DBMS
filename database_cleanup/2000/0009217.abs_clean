Title: Harmonic Superspaces and Superconformal Fields

Authors: P. Heslop, P. S. Howe

Comments: 7 pages, JHEP Proceedings style. Contribution to the Proceedings of

the TMR Conference "Non-Perturbative Quantum Effects 2000," Paris, September2000Representations of four-dimensional superconformal groups on harmonicsuperfields are discussed. It is argued that any representation can be given asa superfield on many superflag manifolds. Representations on analyticsuperspaces do not require constraints. We discuss short representations andhow to obtain them as explicit products of fundamental fields. We also discusssuperfields that transform under supergroups.
