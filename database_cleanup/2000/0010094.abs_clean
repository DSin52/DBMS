Title: Boundary bound states in integrable quantum field theories

Authors: E. Corrigan

Comments: 9 pages, JHEP proceedings style, talk presented at the TMR conference

"Nonperturbative Quantum Effects 2000"The purpose of this talk is to sketch some recent progress which has beenmade in calculating non-perturbatively the reflection factors for thesinh-Gordon model restricted to a half-line by integrable boundary conditions.The essential idea is to calculate the energy spectrum of boundary breathers intwo independent ways; firstly by using the boundary bootstrap and secondly byquantizing the classical solutions corresponding to boundary breathers.Comparing these two calculations provides a way to determine the dependence ofthe reflection factors on the parameters introduced into the Lagrangian by theboundary conditions. The basic idea is illustrated using a massive free scalarfield with a linear boundary condition confining it to a half-line.
