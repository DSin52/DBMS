d3 and d5 maximally SUSY gauged supergravity is considered in theparametrization (flow) of full scalar coset where the kinetic term for scalarstakes the standard field theory form and the bulk potential is an arbitrary onesubject to consistent parametrization. From such SG duals we calculate d2 andd4 holographic conformal anomaly which depends on bulk scalars potential.AdS/CFT correspondence suggests that such SG side conformal anomaly should beidentified with (non-perturbative) QFT conformal anomaly (taking account ofradiative corrections) for the theory living on the boundary of AdS space. Inthe limit of constant bulk potential and single scalar, d4 result reproducesthe known exact conformal anomaly corresponding to maximally SUSY superYang-Mills theory coupled to ${\cal N}=4$ conformal supergravity.
