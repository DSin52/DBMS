Germany, July 19-24, 1999We present a class of N=1 supersymmetric ``standard'' models of particlephysics, derived directly from heterotic M-theory, that contain three familiesof chiral quarks and leptons coupled to the gauge group SU(3)_C X SU(2)_L XU(1)_Y. These models are a fundamental form of ``brane world'' theories, withan observable and hidden sector each confined, after compactification on aCalabi--Yau threefold, to a BPS three-brane separated by a higher dimensionalbulk space with size of the order of the intermediate scale. The requirement ofthree families, coupled to the fundamental conditions of anomaly freedom andsupersymmetry, constrains these models to contain additional five-braneslocated in the bulk space and wrapped around holomorphic curves in theCalabi--Yau threefold.
