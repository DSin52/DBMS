Motivated by the results of Hashimoto and Taylor, we perform a detailed studyof the mass spectrum of the non-abelian Born-Infeld theory, defined by thesymmetrized trace prescription, on tori with constant magnetic fields turnedon. Subsequently, we compare this for several cases to the mass spectrum ofconfigurations on the four-torus and coinciding tilted branes. Finally weinvestigate the fluctuation dynamics of an arbitrarily wrapped Dp-brane withflux.
