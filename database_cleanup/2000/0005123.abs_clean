We investigate the dynamics of open membrane boundaries in a constant C-fieldbackground. We follow the analysis for open strings in a B-field background,and take some approximations. We find that open membrane boundaries do shownoncommutativity in this case by explicit calculations. Membrane boundaries areone dimensional strings, so we face a new type of noncommutativity, that is,noncommutative strings.
