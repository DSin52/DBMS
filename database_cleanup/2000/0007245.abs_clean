We continue to derive spacetime quantities and spin 1/2 propagators fromrotations. Rotation-invariant projection operators are found for each elementof a four element basis, i.e. a basis for four component quantities withspecific transformation rules under rotations. With these four projectionoperators, we make two spacetime invariant projection operators, i.e. oncespace, time, energy, and momentum are identified. The spacetime invariantoperators are propagators for free neutrinos. Except for the substitute basis,the process is the same as the one that gave electron propagators in Part I.
