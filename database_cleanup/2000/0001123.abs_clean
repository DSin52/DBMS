Authors: J. Kluson

Comments: 35 pages, corrected some typos

In this paper we will construct all BPS and non-BPS D-branes in Type IIA andType IIB theories from tachyon condensation. We also propose form ofWess-Zumino term for non-BPS D-brane and we will show that tachyon condensationin this term leads to standard Wess-Zumino term for BPS D-brane.
