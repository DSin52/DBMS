We suggest a mechanism by which four-dimensional Newtonian gravity emerges ona 3-brane in 5D Minkowski space with an infinite size extra dimension. Theworldvolume theory gives rise to the correct 4D potential at short distanceswhereas at large distances the potential is that of a 5D theory. We discusssome phenomenological issues in this framework.
