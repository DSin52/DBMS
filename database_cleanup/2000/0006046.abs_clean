In a brane (domain wall) scenario with an infinite extra dimension andlocalized gravity, bulk fermions and scalars often have bound states with zero4-dimensional mass. In this way massless matter residing on the brane may beobtained. We consider what happens when one tries to introduce small, butnon-vanishing mass to these matter fields. We find that the discrete zero modesturn into quasi-localized states with finite 4-dimensional mass and finitewidth. The latter is due to tunneling of massive matter into extra dimension.We argue that this phenomenon is generic to fields that can have bulk modes. Wealso point out that in theories meant to describe massive scalars, the4-dimensional scalar potential has, in fact, power-law behavior at largedistances.
