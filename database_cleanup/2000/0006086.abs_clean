Several distinct mechanisms of confinement and dynamical symmetry breaking(DSB) are identified, in a class of supersymmetric $SU(n_c)$, $USp(2n_c)$ and$SO(n_c)$ gauge theories. In some of the vacua, the magnetic monopoles carryingnontrivial flavor quantum numbers condense, causing confinement and symmetrybreaking simultaneously. In more general classes of vacua, however, theeffective low-energy degrees of freedom are found to be constituents of themonopoles - dual (magnetic) quarks. These magnetic quarks condense and giverise to confinement and DSB. We find two more important classes of vacua, oneis in various universality classes of nontrivial superconformal theories(SCFT), another in free-magnetic phase.
