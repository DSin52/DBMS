A concise geometrical formulation of N=4 supergravity containing angraviphotons are identified in the super-vielbein on the same footing as thevierbein and the Rarita-Schwinger fields. As a consequence of superspacesoldering, Chern-Simons terms in the fieldstrength of the antisymmetric tensorarise as an intrinsic property of superspace with central charge coordinates.
