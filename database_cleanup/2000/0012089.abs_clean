It has been recently proposed that the background independent opensuperstring field theory action is given by the disc partition function withall possible open string operators inserted at the boundary of the disc. We usethis proposal to study tachyon condensation in the D0-D2 system. We evaluatethe disc partition function for the D0-D2 system in presence of a largeNeveu-Schwarz B-field using perturbation theory. This perturbative expansion ofthe disc partition function makes sense as the boundary tachyon operator forthe large Neveu-Schwarz B-field is almost marginal. We find that the massdefect for the formation of the D0-D2 bound state agrees exactly with theexpected result in the large B-field limit.
