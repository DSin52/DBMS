In this short note we would like to propose a form for the action of anon-BPS D-brane, which will be manifestly supersymmetric invariant andT-duality covariant. We also explicitly show that tachyon condensation on theworld-volume of this brane leads to the Dirac-Born-Infeld action for BPSD(p-1)-brane.
