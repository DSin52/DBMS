The nonlinear supersymmetry of one-dimensional systems is investigated in thecontext of the quantum anomaly problem. Any classical supersymmetric systemcharacterized by the nonlinear in the Hamiltonian superalgebra issymplectomorphic to a supersymmetric canonical system with the holomorphic formof the supercharges. Depending on the behaviour of the superpotential, thecanonical supersymmetric systems are separated into the three classes. In oneof them the parameter specifying the supersymmetry order is subject to somesort of classical quantization, whereas the supersymmetry of another extremeclass has a rather fictive nature since its fermion degrees of freedom aredecoupled completely by a canonical transformation. The nonlinear supersymmetrywith polynomial in momentum supercharges is analysed, and the most generalone-parametric Calogero-like solution with the second order supercharges isfound. Quantization of the systems of the canonical form reveals the twoanomaly-free classes, one of which gives rise naturally to the quasi-exactlysolvable systems. The quantum anomaly problem for the Calogero-like models is``cured'' by the specific superpotential-dependent term of order $\hbar^2$. Thenonlinear supersymmetry admits the generalization to the case oftwo-dimensional systems.
