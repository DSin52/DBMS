The combined Einstein equations and scalar equation of motion in theHorava-Witten scenario of the strongly coupled heterotic string compactified ona Calabi-Yau manifold are solved in the presence of additional matter densitieson the branes. We take into account the universal Calabi-Yau modulus phi withpotentials in the 5-d bulk and on the 3-branes, and allow for an arbitrarycoupling of the additional matter to phi and an arbitrary equation of state. Noad hoc stabilization of the five dimensional radius is assumed. The matterdensities are assumed to be small compared to the potential for phi on thebranes; in this approximation we find solutions in the bulk which are exact iny and t. Depending on the coupling of the matter to phi and its equation ofstate, various solutions for the metric on the branes and in the 5-d bulk arestatic 5-d radius, which reproduce the standard cosmological evolution.
