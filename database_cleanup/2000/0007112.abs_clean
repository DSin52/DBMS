New solutions to the abelian U(1) Higgs model, corresponding to vortices ofinteger and half-integer winding number bound onto the edges of domain wallsand possibly surrounded by annular current flows, are described, based on afine-grained analysis of the topology of such configurations in spacetime. Theexistence of these states, which saturate BPS bounds in specific limits and arequite reminiscent of D-branes and membranes in general, could have interestingand some important consequences in a wide range of physical contexts. Forinstance, they raise the possibility that for some regimes of couplings theusual vortex of unit winding number would split into two vortices each ofone-half winding number bound by a domain wall. A similar approach may also berelevant to other known topological states of field theory.
