We derive constraints on the non-perturbative 3-point fermion-bosontransverse vertex in massless QED3 from its perturbative calculation to order$\alpha$. We also check the transversality condition to two loops and evaluatethe fermion propagator to the same order. We compare a conjecture of thenon-perturbative vertex by Burden and Tjiang against our results and comment onits draw backs. Our calculation calls for the need to construct anon-perturbative form for the fermion-boson vertex which agrees with itsperturbative limit to ${\cal O}(\alpha)$.
