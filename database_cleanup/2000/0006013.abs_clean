In this paper we study the interplay of electric and magnetic backgrounds indetermining the decoupling limit of coincident D-branes towards anoncommutative Yang-Mills (NCYM) or open string (NCOS) theory. No decouplinglimit has been found for NCYM with space-time noncommutativity. It is suggestedthat there is a new duality, which we call V-duality, which acts on NCOS withboth space-space and space-time noncommutativity, resulting from decoupling inLorentz-boost related backgrounds. We also show that the holographiccorrespondence, previously suggested by Li and Wu, between NCYM and itssupergravity dual can be generalized to NCOS as well.
