classical fields IIAuthors: Hiroshi Ozaki

A covariant description of the canonical theory for interacting classicalfields is developed on a space-like hypersurface. An identity invariant underthe canonical transformations is obtained. The identity follows a canonicalequation in which the interaction Hamiltonian density genarates a deformationof the space-like hypersurface. The equation just corresponds to theYang-Feldman equation in the Heisenberg pictures in quantum field theory.
