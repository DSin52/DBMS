We give a detailed general description of a recent geometrical discretisationscheme and illustrate, by explicit numerical calculation, the scheme's abilityto capture topological features. The scheme is applied to the AbelianChern-Simons theory and leads, after a necessary field doubling, to anexpression for the discrete partition function in terms of untwistedReidemeister torsion and of various triangulation dependent factors. Thediscrete partition function is evaluated computationally for varioustriangulations of $S^3$ and of lens spaces. The results confirm that thediscretisation scheme is triangulation independent and coincides with thecontinuum partition function
