We study the cosmological evolution of the four-dimensional universe on theprobe D3-brane in geodesic motion in the curved background of the sourceDp-brane with non-zero NS B field. The Friedman equations describing theexpansion of the brane universe are obtained and analyzed for various limits.We elaborate on corrections to the cosmological evolution due to nonzero NS Bfield.
