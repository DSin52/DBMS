The behaviour of the chiral condensates in the SU(2) gauge theory with brokenN=2 supersymmetry is reviewed. The calculation of monopole, dyon, and chargecondensates is described. It is shown that the monopole and charge condensatesvanish at the Argyres-Douglas point where the monopole and charge vacuacollide. This phenomenon is interpreted as a deconfinement of electric andmagnetic charges at the Argyres-Douglas point.
