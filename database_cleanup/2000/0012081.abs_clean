We study the physics of open strings in bosonic and type II string theoriesin the presence of unstable D-branes. When the potential energy of the openstring tachyon is at its minimum, Sen has argued that only closed stringsremain in the perturbative spectrum. We explore the scenario of Yi and ofBergman, Hori and Yi, who argue that the open string degrees of freedom arestrongly coupled and disappear through confinement. We discuss arguments usingopen string field theory and worldsheet boundary RG flows, which seem toindicate otherwise. We then describe a solitonic excitation of the open stringtachyon and gauge field with the charge and tension of a fundamental closedstring. This requires a double scaling limit where the tachyon is taken to itsminimal value and the electric field is taken to its maximum value. Theresulting flux tube has an unconstrained spatial profile; and for largefundamental string charge, it appears to have light, weakly coupled openstrings living in the core. We argue that the flux tube acquires a size ororder $\alpha'$ through sigma model and string coupling effects; and we arguethat confinement effects make the light degrees of freedom heavy and stronglyinteracting.
