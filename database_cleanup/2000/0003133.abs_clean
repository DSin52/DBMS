This work deals with the formation of black hole in bidimensional dilatongravity coupled to scalar matter fields. We investigate two scalar mattersystems, one described by a sixth power potential and the other defined withtwo scalar fields containing up to the fourth power in the fields. Thetopological solutions that appear in these cases allow the formation of blackholes in the corresponding dilaton gravity models.
