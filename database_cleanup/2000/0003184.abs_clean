We discuss the effect of boundaries in boundary logarithmic conformal fieldtheory and show, with reference to both $c=-2$ and $c=0$ models, how theyproduce new features even in bulk correlation functions which are not presentin the corresponding models without boundaries. We discuss the modification ofCardy's relation between boundary states and bulk quantities.
