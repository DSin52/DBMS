By exploiting the boundary state formalism we obtain the string correlatorbetween two internal points on the one loop open string world-sheet in thepresence of a constant background $B$-field. From this derivation it is clearthat there is an ambiguity when one tries to restrict the Green function to theboundary of the surface. We fix this ambiguity by showing that there is a {\emunique} form for the correlator between two points on the boundary whichreproduces the one loop field theory results of different noncommutative fieldtheories. In particular, we present the derivation of one loop diagrams for$\phi^3_6$ and $\phi^4_4$ scalar interactions and for Yang--Mills theory. Fromthe 2-point function we are able to derive the one loop $\beta$-function fornoncommutative gauge theory.
