Title: Ratio of Quark Masses in Duality Theories

Authors: G. Cleaver and K. Tanaka

Comments: 12 pages. Standard Latex

We consider N=2 SU(2) Seiberg-Witten duality theory for models with N_f=2 andN_f=3 quark flavors. We find that it is possible to have arbitrary large baremass ratios between the two or three quarks.
