We study the infra-red dynamics of D1-branes at the conifold. We show usingmethods developed to study the infra-red dynamics of (4,4) theories, theinfra-red degrees of freedom of the (2,2) theory of a single D1-brane at theconifold is that of a linear dilaton with background charge of $\sqrt{2}$ and acompact scalar. The gauge theory of $N$ D1-branes at the conifold is used toformulate the matrix string in the conifold background.
