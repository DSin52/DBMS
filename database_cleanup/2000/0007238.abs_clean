Title: Defining Entropy Bounds

Authors: Don N. Page

Comments: 29 pages, LaTeX

Bekenstein's conjectured entropy bound for a system of linear size R andenergy E, S < 2 pi E R, has counterexamples for many of the ways in which the``system,'' R, E, and S may be defined. Here new ways are proposed to definethese quantities for arbitrary nongravitational quantum field theories in flatspacetime, such as defining R as the smallest radius outside of which onlyvacuum expectation values occur. Difficulties of extending these definitions togravitational quantum theories are noted.
