We construct low-energy Goldstone superfield actions describing variouspatterns of the partial spontaneous breakdown of two-dimensional N=(1,1),N=(2,0) and N=(2,2) supersymmetries, with the main focus on the last case.These nonlinear actions admit a representation in the superspace of theunbroken supersymmetry as well as in a superspace of the full supersymmetry.The natural setup for implementing the partial breaking in a self-consistentway is provided by the appropriate central extensions of D=2 supersymmetries,with the central charges generating shift symmetries on the Goldstonesuperfields. The Goldstone superfield actions can be interpreted as manifestlyworld-sheet supersymmetric actions in the static gauge of some superstrings andD1-branes in D=3 and D=4 Minkowski spaces. As an essentially new example, weelaborate on the action representing the 1/4 partial breaking pattern N=(2,2)
