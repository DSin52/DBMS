We generalize the standard product integral formalism to incorporateGrassmann valued matrices and show that the resulting supersymmetric productintegrals provide a natural framework for describing supersymmetric WilsonLines and Wilson Loops. We use this formalism to establish the supersymmetricversion of the non-Abelian Stokes theorem.
