Black hole no-hair theorems are proven using inequalities that govern theradial dependence of spherically symmetric configurations of matter fields. Inthis paper, we analyze the analogous inequalities for geometries dual torenormalization group flows via the AdS/CFT correspondence. These inequalitiesgive much useful information about the qualitative properties of such flows.For Poincare invariant flows, we show that generic flows of relevant orirrelevant operators lead to singular geometries. For the case of irrelevantoperators, this leads to an apparent conflict with Polchinski's decouplingtheorem, and we offer two possible resolutions to this problem.
