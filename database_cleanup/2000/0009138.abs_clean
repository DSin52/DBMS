Title: Remarks on Liouville theory with boundary

Authors: J. Teschner

Comments: Talk presented at TMR-conference "Nonperturbative Quantum Effects

2000", 7 pages, LATEX with JHEP proceedings styleThe bootstrap for Liouville theory with conformally invariant boundaryconditions will be discussed. After reviewing some results on one- and boundarytwo-point functions we discuss some analogue of the Cardy condition linkingthese data. This allows to determine the spectrum of the theory on the strip,and illustrates in what respects the bootstrap for noncompact conformal fieldtheories with boundary is richer than in RCFT. We briefly indicate someconnections with $U_q(sl(2,R))$ that should help completing the bootstrap.
