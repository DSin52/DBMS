The quantization of the SU(2)$\times $U(1) gauge-symmetric electroweak theoryis performed in the Hamiltonian path-integral formalism. In this quantization,we start from the Lagrangian given in the unitary gauge in which the unphysicalGoldstone fields are absent, but the unphysical longitudinal components of thegauge fields still exist. In order to eliminate the longitudinal components, itis necessary to introduce the Lorentz gauge conditions as constraints. Theseconstraints may be incorporated into the Lagrangian by the Lagrangeundetermined multiplier method. In this way, it is found that every componentof a four-dimensional vector potential has a conjugate counterpart. Thus, aLorentz-covariant quantization in the Hamiltonian path-integral formalism canbe well accomplished and leads to a result which is the same as given by theFaddeev-Popov approach of quantization.
