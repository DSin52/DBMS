The full list of conserved conformal higher spin currents built from masslessscalar and spinor fields is presented. It is shown that, analogously to therelationship between usual conformal and AdS symmetries, the set of theconformal higher spin symmetry parameters associated with the conformalconserved currents in d dimensions is in the one-to-one correspondence with theresult of the dimensional reduction of the usual (i.e., non-conformal) higherspin symmetry parameters in d+1 dimensions.
