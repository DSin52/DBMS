A solution of the 6D gravitational model, which has the pole configuration,is found. The vacuum setting is done by the 6D Higgs potential and the solutionis for a family of the vacuum and boundary parameters. The boundary conditionis solved by the $1/k^2$-expansion (thin pole expansion) where $1/k$ is the{\it thickness} of the pole. The obtained analytic solution is checked by thenumerical method. This is a dimensional reduction model from 6D to 4D by use ofthe soliton solution (brane world). It is regarded as a higher dimensionalversion of the Randall-Sundrum 5D model. The mass hierarchy is examined.Especially the {\it geometrical see-saw} mass relation is obtained. Somephysical quantities in 4D world such as the Planck mass, the cosmologicalconstant, and fermion masses are focussed. Comparison with the 5D model ismade.
