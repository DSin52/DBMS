We present a construction of a Virasoro symmetry of the sine-Gordon (SG)theory. It is a dynamical one and has nothing to do with the space-timeVirasoro symmetry of 2D CFT. Although it is clear how it can be realizeddyrectly in the SG field theory, we are rather concerned here with thecorresponding N-soliton solutions. We present explicit expressions for theirinfinithesimal transformations and show that they are local in this case. Somepreliminary stages about the quantization of the classical results presented inthis paper are also given.
