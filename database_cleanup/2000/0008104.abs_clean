Authors: P.M. Lavrov, P.Yu. Moshin

Comments: 9 pages, no figures, LaTex. Talk given by P.M. Lavrov at the Fradkin

Memory Conference, "Quantum Gauge Theory and Strings", Moscow, June 5-10,2000We generalize the method of superfield Lagrangian BRST quantization in thepart of the gauge-fixing procedure and obtain a quantization method that can beconsidered as an alternative to the Batalin - Vilkovisky formalism.
