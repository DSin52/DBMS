We construct dual supergravity descriptions of field theories and littlestring theories with light-like non-commutativity. The field theories arerealized on the world-volume of Dp branes with light-like NS $B$ field and M5branes with light-like $C$ field. The little string theories are realized onthe world-volume of NS5 branes with light-like RR $A$ fields. The supergravitybackgrounds are closely related to the $A=0,B=0,C=0$ backgrounds. We discussthe implications of these results. We also construct dual supergravitydescriptions of ODp theories realized on the worldvolume of NS5 branes with RRbackgrounds.
