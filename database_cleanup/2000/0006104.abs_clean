It is shown that the application of the non-Abelian Stokes theorem to thecomputation of the operators constructed with Wilson loop will lead toambiguity, if the gauge field under consideration is a non-trivial one. Thispoint is illustrated by the specific examples of the computation of a non-localoperator.
