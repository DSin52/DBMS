Title: Homotopic Classification of Yang-Mills Vacua Taking into Account

CausalityComments: LaTex, 11 pages, no figures

In this letter we study the existence of theta-vacuum states in Yang-Millstheories defined over asymptotically flat, stationary space-times taking intoaccount not only the topology but the complicated causal structure of thesespace-times, too. By a result of Chrusciel and Wald, apparently causality makesall vacuum states, seen by a distant observer, homotopically equivalent makingthe introduction of theta-terms unnecessary in (causally) effectiveLagrangians.But a more careful study shows that certain twisted classical vacuum statessurvive even in this case eventually leading to the conclusion that the conceptof ``theta-vacua'' is meaningful in the case of general Yang-Mills theories. Wegive a classification of these vacuum states based on Isham's results showingthat the Yang-Mills vacuum has the same complexity as in the flat Minkowskiancase hence the general CP-problem is not more complicated than the well-knownflat one.
