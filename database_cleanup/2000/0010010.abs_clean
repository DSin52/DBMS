Title: Supersymmetry and F-theory realization of the deformed conifold with

three-form fluxAuthors: Steven S. Gubser (Princeton University)

Comments: 11 pages, latex

It is shown that the deformed conifold solution with three-form flux, foundby Klebanov and Strassler, is supersymmetric, and that it admits a simpleF-theory description in terms of a direct product of the deformed conifold anda torus. Some general remarks on Ramond-Ramond backgrounds and warpedcompactifications are included.
