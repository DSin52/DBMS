We show that the noncommutative Wess-Zumino model is renormalizable to allorders of perturbation theory. The noncommutative scalar potential by itself isnon-renormalizable but the Yukawa terms demanded by supersymmetry improve thesituation turning the theory into a renormalizable one. As in the commutativecase, there are neither quadratic nor linear divergences. Hence, the IR/UVmixing does not give rise to quadratic infrared poles.
