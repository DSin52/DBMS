A class of exact solutions to the Born-Infeld field equations, over manifoldsof any even dimension, is constructed. They are an extension of the self-dualconfigurations. They are local minima of the action for riemannian basemanifolds and local minima of the Hamiltonian for pseudo-riemannian ones. Ageneral explicit expression for the Born-Infeld determinant is obtained, forany dimension of space-time.
