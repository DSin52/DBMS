A manifestly super-Poincar\'e covariant formalism for the superstring hasrecently been constructed using a pure spinor variable. Unlike the covariantGreen-Schwarz formalism, this new formalism is easily quantized with a BRSToperator and tree-level scattering amplitudes have been evaluated in amanifestly covariant manner.In this paper, the cohomology of the BRST operator in the pure spinorformalism is shown to give the usual light-cone Green-Schwarz spectrum.Although the BRST operator does not directly involve the Virasoro constraint,this constraint emerges after expressing the pure spinor variable in terms ofSO(8) variables.
