In this work we apply Thompson's method (of the dimensions) to study thequantum electrodynamics (QED). This method can be considered as a simple andalternative way to the renormalisation group (R.G) approach and when applied toQED lagrangian is able to obtain the running coupling constant behavior $\alpha(\mu)$, namely the dependence of $\alpha$ on the energy scale. We also obtainthe dependence of the mass on the energy scale. The calculations are evaluatedjust at $d_c=4$, where $d_c$ is the upper critical dimension of the problem, sothat we obtain logarithmic behavior both for the coupling $\alpha$ and the mass$m$ on the energy scale $\mu$.
