We consider generic N=1 supersymmetric matter coupled to linearized N=1supergravity through the multiplet of currents. By completing the square, wefind the effective action giving the leading supergravity induced correction tothe matter dynamics, expressed explicitly as a quadratic form in the componentsof the current multiplet. The effective action is supersymmetry invariantthrough an interplay of the local terms arising from the auxiliary fieldcouplings, and the nonlocal terms arising from graviton and gravitino exchange,neither of which is separately invariant. Having an explicit form for thesupergravity induced effective action is a first step in studying whethersupergravity corrections can lead to dynamical supersymmetry breaking insupersymmetric matter dynamics. In Appendices we give explicit expressions forthe currents, in our notational conventions, in the Wess-Zumino andsupersymmetric Yang Mills models.
