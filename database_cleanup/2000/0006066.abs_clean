We consider N=1 supersymmetric renormalization group flows of N=4 Yang-Millstheory from the perspective of ten-dimensional IIB supergravity. We explicitlyconstruct the complete ten-dimensional lift of the flow in which exactly onechiral superfield becomes massive (the LS flow). We also examine theten-dimensional metric and dilaton configurations for the ``super-QCD'' flow(the GPPZ flow) in which all chiral superfields become massive. We show thatthe latter flow generically gives rise to a dielectric 7-brane in theinfra-red, but the solution contains a singularity that may be interpreted as a``duality averaged'' ring distribution of 5-branes wrapped on S^2. At specialvalues of the parameters the singularity simplifies to a pair of S-dual braneswith (p,q) charge (1,\pm 1).
