tcilatex, 3 latexcad figuresUsing the previously gained insight about the particle/field relation inconformal quantum field theories which required interactions to be related tothe existence of particle-like states associated with fields of anomalousscaling dimensions, we set out to construct a classification theory for thespectra of anomalous dimensions. Starting from the old observations onconformal superselection sectors related to the anomalous dimensions via thephases which appear in the spectral decomposition of the center of theconformal covering group $Z(\widetilde{SO(d,2)}),$ we explore the possibilityof a timelike braiding structure consistent with the timelike ordering whichrefines and explains the central decomposition. We regard this as a preparatorystep in a new construction attempt of interacting conformal quantum fieldtheories in D=4 spacetime dimensions. Other ideas of constructions based on the$AdS_{5}$-$CQFT_{4}$ or the perturbative SYM approach in their relation to thepresent idea are briefly mentioned.
