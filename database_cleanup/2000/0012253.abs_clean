(2002), 663-705The cosmological constant problem arises at the intersection between generalrelativity and quantum field theory, and is regarded as a fundamental problemin modern physics. In this paper we describe the historical and conceptualorigin of the cosmological constant problem which is intimately connected tothe vacuum concept in quantum field theory. We critically discuss how theproblem rests on the notion of physical real vacuum energy, and which relationsbetween general relativity and quantum field theory are assumed in order tomake the problem well-defined.
