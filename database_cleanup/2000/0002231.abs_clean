The cutoff scheme dependence in the several formulations of the ExactRenormalization Group (ERG) is investigated. It is shown that the cutoff schemedependence of the Wilsonian effective action is regarded as a certaincoordinate transformation on the theory space. From this observation theWilsonian effective actions are found to suffer from strong dependence on theschemes even in the infra-red asymptotic region for massive theories. Howeverthere is no such scheme dependence in the one particle irreducible parts ofthem, which is called the effective average actions. We also derive theexplicit form of the Polchinski RG equation in the sharp cutoff limit. Finallythis equation is shown to be identical with the Wegner-Houghton RG equation.
