In this paper we explore some general aspects of the embeddings associatedwith brane-localized gravity. In particular we show that the consistency ofsuch embeddings can require (or impose) very specific relations between all theinvolved bulk and brane matter source parameters. We specifically explore theembeddings of 3-branes with non-zero spatial 3-curvature $k$ into 5-dimensionalspacetime bulks, and show that for such embeddings, a 5-dimensional bulkcosmological constant is not able to produce the exponential suppression of thegeometry thought necessary to localize gravity to the brane.
