The cosmological term is assumed to be a function of time such as $\Lambda=Ba^{-2}$ where a(t) means the scale factor of standard cosmology. Analyticalsolutions for radiation dominated epoch and open universe are found. For closeduniverse, k=+1, and for flat universe, k=0, we show a numerical solution. Ingeneral the scenario of Big Bang is preserved in our case for theFriedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology.
