"Non-Perturbative Quantum Effects 2000," Paris, September 2000. 9 pages, JHEPStyleThe extraction of Wilson loops of confining gauge systems from their SUGRA(string) duals is reviewed. I start with describing the basic classical setup.A theorem that determines the classical values of the loops associated with ageneralized background is derived. In particular sufficient conditions forconfining behavior are stated . I then introduce quadratic quantum fluctuationsaround the classical configurations. I discuss in details the following modelsand its correspondence with pure YM theory in three dimensions. In particularan attractive Luscher term is shown to be the outcome of the quantumfluctuations. (iii) Type 0 string model (iv) The Polchinski Strassler $N=1*$model. In the latter case we show that SUGRA alone is not enough to get thecorrect nature of the loops, and only by incorporating the worldvolumephenomena of the five branes a coherent qualitative picture can be derived.
