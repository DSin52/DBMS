Nonminimal coupling of the inflaton field to the Ricci curvature of spacetimeis generally unavoidable, and the paradigm of inflation should be generalizedby including the corresponding term in the Lagrangian of the inflationarytheory. This paper reports on the status of the programme of generalizinginflation. First, the problem of finding the correct value (or set of values)of the coupling constant is analyzed; the result has important consequences forthe success or failure of inflationary scenarios. Then, the slow-rollapproximation to generalized inflation is studied. Both the unperturbedinflating universe models and scalar/tensor perturbations are discussed, andopen problems are pointed out.
