We find a static solution to Einstein's field equations on a five-dimensionalorbifold with a compact S_1/Z_2 fifth direction and Poincare invariant 3+1sections. The solution describes a theory with bulk cosmological constant and3-branes at the orbifold fixed points which carry matter density and pressurein addition to tension. The radius of the fifth dimension is determined by thematter content of the branes. The ratio of the space and time components of themetric depends on the fifth coordinate. Thus, the speed of propagation ofmassless fields is path dependent. For example, bulk and brane fields propagatewith different speeds.
