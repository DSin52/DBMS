Title: What does the string/gauge correspondence teach us about Wilson loops?

Comments: Lectures presented at Santiago de Compostela-99, 47 pages, 13 figs

In these lectures we describe the attempt to extract the expectation valuesof Wilson loops from the string/gauge correspondence. We start with theoriginal calculation in $AdS_5$. It is then extended to the non-conformalbackground of $D_p$ in the near horizon limit. We discuss the computation atfinite temperature. Supergravity models that admit confinement in 3d and 4d aredescribed. A theorem that determines the classical values of loops associatedwith a generalized background is derived.In particular we determine sufficientconditions for confining behavior. We then apply the theorem to various stringmodels including type 0 ones. We describe an attempt to go beyond the classicalstring picture by incorporating quadratic quantum fluctuations. In particularwe address the BPS configuration of a single quark, the supersymmetricdeterminant of $AdS_5\times S^$ and a setup that corresponds to a confininggauge theory. We determine the form of the Wilson loop for actions that includenon trivial $B_{\mu\nu}$ field. The issue of an exact determination of thevalue of the stringy Wilson loop is discussed. We end with a brief review ofthe baryons from the string/gauge correspondence Lectures presented in the``Advanced School on Supersymmetry in the theories of fields, strings andbranes'' Santiago de Compostela-99.
