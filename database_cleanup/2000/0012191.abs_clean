We discuss a possible explanation of the hierarchy problem within thetheories with spacetime dimensions higher than four. We show that the presenceof relatively (not hierarchically) large extra dimensions can significantlyalter the evolution of the Higgs field VEV, driving it to an infrared stablefixed point $\sim M_{W}$. Such a behaviour results in self-organizingcriticality and naturally explains gauge hierarchy without any fine tuning ofthe parameters.
