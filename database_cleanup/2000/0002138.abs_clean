We construct noncommutative gauge theories based on the notion of the Weylbundle, which appears in Fedosov's construction of deformation quantization onan arbitrary symplectic manifold. These correspond to D-brane worldvolumetheories in non-constant B-field and curved backgrounds in string theory. Allsuch theories are embedded into a "universal" gauge theory of the Weyl bundle.This shows that the combination of a background field and a noncommutativefield strength has universal meaning as a field strength of the Weyl bundle. Wealso show that the gauge equivalence relation is a part of such a "universal"gauge symmetry.
