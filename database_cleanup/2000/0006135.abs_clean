It is known that self-duality equations for multi-instantons on a line infour dimensions are equivalent to minimal surface equations in threedimensional Minkowski space. We extend this equivalence beyond the equations ofmotion and show that topological number, instanton moduli space andanti-self-dual solutions have representations in terms of minimal surfaces. Theissue of topological charge is quite subtle because the surfaces that appearare non-compact. This minimal surface/instanton correspondence allows us todefine a metric on the configuration space of the gauge fields. We obtain theminimal surface representation of an instanton with arbitrary charge. Thetrivial vacuum and the BPST instanton as minimal surfaces are worked out indetail. BPS monopoles and the geodesics are also discussed.
