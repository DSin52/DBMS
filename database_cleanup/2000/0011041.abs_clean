We discuss some features of the regular supergravity solution for fractionalbranes on a deformed conifold, recently found by Klebanov-Strassler, mostlyadapting it to a type 0 non-sypersymmetric context. The non-supersymmetricgauge theory is SU(M)*SU(M) with two bi-fundamental Weyl fermions. The tachyonis now stabilized by the RR antisymmetric tensor flux. We briefly discuss themost general non-supersymmetric theory on electric, magnetic and fractionaltype 0 D3-branes on a conifold. This includes the pure SU(N) theory.
