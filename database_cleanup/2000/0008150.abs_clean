Title: D-Branes and Scheme Theory

Authors: Tomas Gomez, Eric R. Sharpe

Comments: 10 pages, LaTeX

In this highly speculative note we conjecture that it may be possible tounderstand features of coincident D-branes, such as the appearance of enhancednon-abelian gauge symmetry, in a purely geometric fashion, using a form ofgeometry known as scheme theory. We give a very brief introduction to somerelevant ideas from scheme theory, and point out how these ideas work inspecial cases.
