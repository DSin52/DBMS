Title: Invariances of regularized QED diagrams

Authors: Marijan Ribaric and Luka Sustersic

Comments: 27 pages, 2 figures

We consider properties of connected diagrams with fermion-photon interactionand such fermion and photon propagators and vertex function that the values ofthese diagrams are finite. We establish the properties of these propagators andvertex function that imply that these diagrams are invariant under C, P, T, CP,CT, PT, or CPT transformations up to some phase factor common to each process.We introduce eight new transformations related to Hermiticity and establish theconditions under which they leave the tree transition probabilities invariant.We determine such general Lorentz form-invariant fermion and photon propagatorsand fermion-photon vertex functions that make diagrams Lorentz-invariant.
