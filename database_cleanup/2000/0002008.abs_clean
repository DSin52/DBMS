space-timeComments: 10 pages, LaTeX, Based on talk given at International Workshop

"Supersymmetries and Quantum Symmetries", Dubna, Russia, July 27-31, 1999Light-cone gauge manifestly supersymmetric formulation of type IIB10-dimensional supergravity in $AdS_5 \times S^5$ background is discussed. Theformulation is given entirely in terms of light-cone scalar superfield,allowing us to treat all component fields on an equal footing. Discrete energyspectrum of field propagating in AdS space is explained within the framework oflight-cone approach. Light-cone gauge formulation of self-dual fieldspropagating in AdS space is developed. An conjectured interrelation of higherspin massless fields theory in AdS space-time and superstring theory inMinkowski space is discussed.
