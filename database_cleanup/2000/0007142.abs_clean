Using recent results on string on $AdS_{3}\times N^d$, where N is ad-dimensional compact manifold, we re-examine the derivation of the non trivialextension of the (1+2) dimensional-Poincar\'e algebra obtained by Rausch deTraubenberg and Slupinsky, refs [1] and [29]. We show by explicit computationthat this new extension is a special kind of fractional supersymmetric algebrawhich may be derived from the deformation of the conformal structure living onthe boundary of $AdS_3$. The two so(1,2) Lorentz modules of spin $\pm{1\overk}$ used in building of the generalisation of the (1+2) Poincar\'e algebra arere-interpreted in our analysis as highest weight representations of the leftand right Virasoro symmetries on the boundary of $AdS_3$. We also completeknown results on 2d-fractional supersymmetry by using spectral flow of affineKac-Moody and superconformal symmetries. Finally we make preliminary commentson the trick of introducing Fth-roots of g-modules to generalise the so(1,2)result to higher rank lie algebras g.
