We develop a systematic approach to boundary conditions that break bulksymmetries in a general way such that left and right movers are not necessarilyconnected by an automorphism. In the context of string compactifications, suchboundary conditions typically include non-BPS branes. Our formalism is based ontwo dual fusion rings, one for the bulk and one for the boundary fields. Onlyin the Cardy case these two structures coincide. In general they are related bya version of alpha-induction. Symmetry breaking boundary conditions correspondto solitonic sectors. In examples, we compute the annulus amplitudes andboundary states.
