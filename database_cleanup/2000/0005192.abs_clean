We examine the dual correspondence between holographic IIB superstring theoryand N=4 super Yang-Mills theory at finite values of the coupling constants. Inparticular we analyze a field theory strong-coupling expansion which is theS-dual of the planar expansion. This expansion arises naturally as the AdS/CFTdual of the IIB superstring scattering amplitudes given a genus truncationproperty due to modular invariance. The space-time structure of thecontributions to the field theory four-point correlation functions obtainedfrom the IIB scattering elements is investigated in the example of the productof four conserved stress tensors, and is expressed as an infinite sum of fieldtheory triangle integrals. The OPE structure of these contributions to thestress tensor four-point function is analyzed and shown not to give rise to anypoles. Quantization of the string in the background of a five-form fieldstrength is performed through a covariantized background field approach, andrelations to the N=4 topological string are found.
