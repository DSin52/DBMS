Dp-branes placed in a certain external RR (p+4)-form field expand into atransverse fuzzy two-sphere, as shown by Myers. We find that by changing the(p+4)-form background other fuzzy cosets can be obtained. Three new examples,S^2 X S^2, CP^2 and SU(3)/(U(1) X U(1)) are constructed. The first two arefour-dimensional while the last is six-dimensional. The dipole and quadrupolemoments which result in these configurations are discussed. Finally, thegravity backgrounds dual to these vacua are examined in a leading orderapproximation. These are multi-centered solutions containing (p+4)- or(p+6)-dimensional brane singularities.
