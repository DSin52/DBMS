A Born-Infeld theory describing a D2-brane coupled to a 4-form RR fieldstrength is considered, and the general solutions of the static and Euclideantime equations are derived and discussed. The period of the bounce solutions isshown to allow a consideration of tunneling and quantum-classical transitionsin the sphaleron region. The order of such transitions, depending on thestrength of the RR field strength, is determined. A criterion is then derivedto confirm these findings.
