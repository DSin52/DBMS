Title: A two point function in a cascading N=1 gauge theory from supergravity

Authors: Michael Krasnitz

We compute the two point correlation function of a dimension 4 operator in anonconformal cascading N=1 SUSY gauge theory using the supergravity dual foundby Klebanov and Strassler[hep-th/0007191]. The two point function has alogarithmic correction to conformal behavior which is related to the scaledependence of the effective number of colors. The nonsingular behavior of thiscorrelator suggests that the theory remains a local 4-dimensional quantum fieldtheory at all scales. We also compute the spectrum of low-lying glueball modescorresponding to the above operator.
