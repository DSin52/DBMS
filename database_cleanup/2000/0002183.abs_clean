Title: Higher Spin Symmetries, Star-Product and Relativistic Equations in AdS

SpaceComments: 21 pages, latex, no figures, Based on the talks given at QFTHEP'99

(Moscow, May 1999), Supersymmetries and Quantum Symmetries (Dubna, July1999), Bogolyubov Conference Problems of Theoretical and Mathematical Physics(Moscow-Dubna-Kyiv, Sept-Oct. 1999) and Symmetry and Integrability inMathematical and Theoretical Physics, the Conference in Memory ofM.V.Saveliev (Protvino, January 2000)We discuss general properties of the theory of higher spin gauge fields in$AdS_4$ focusing on the relationship between the star-product origin of thehigher spin symmetries, AdS geometry and the concept of space-time locality. Afull list of conserved higher spin currents in the flat space of arbitrarydimension is presented.
