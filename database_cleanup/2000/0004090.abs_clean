The conformal symmetry SO(d,2) of the massless particle in d dimensions, orsuperconformal symmetry OSp(N|4), SU(2,2|N), OSp(8|N) of the superparticle ind=3,4,6 dimensions respectively, had been previously understood as the globalLorentz symmetry and supersymmetries of 2T physics in d+2 dimensions. Byutilising the gauge symmetries of 2T physics, it is shown that the dynamics canbe cast in terms of superspace coordinates, momenta and theta variables or interms of supertwistor variables a la Penrose and Ferber. In 2T physics thesecan be gauge transformed to each other. In the supertwistor version thequantization of the model amounts to the well known oscillator formalism fornon-compact supergroups.
