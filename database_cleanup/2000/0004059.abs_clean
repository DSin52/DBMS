Thermalisation of configurations with initial white noise power spectrum isstudied in numerical simulations of a classical one-component $\Phi^4$ theoryin 2+1 dimensions, coupled to a small amplitude homogenous external field. Thestudy is performed for energy densities corresponding to the broken symmetryphase of the system in equilibrium. The effective equation of the orderparameter motion is reconstructed from its trajectory which starts from aninitial value near the metastable point and ends in the stable ground state.This phenomenological theory quantitatively accounts for the decay of the falsevacuum. The large amplitude transition of the order parameter between the twominima displays characteristics reflecting dynamical aspects of the Maxwellconstruction.
