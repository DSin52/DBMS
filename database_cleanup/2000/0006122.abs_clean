The non-abelian flat directions in the tachyon potential of stable non-BPSbranes recently found are shown to persist to all orders in alpha' at treelevel in the string coupling. We also obtain the non-abelian Born-Infeld actionincluding the tachyon potential for a stack of stable non-BPS branes on acritical orbifold. Finally we discuss stable soliton states on the non-BPSbrane.
