Theory; Exactly Solvable and Integrable SystemsWe present a unified treatment of three cases of quasi-exactly solvableproblems, namely, charged particle moving in Coulomb and magnetic fields, forboth the Schr\"odinger and the Klein-Gordon case, and the relative motion oftwo charged particles in an external oscillator potential. We show that allthese cases are reducible to the same basic equation, which is quasi-exactlysolvable owing to the existence of a hidden $sl_2$ algebraic structure. Asystematic and unified algebraic solution to the basic equation using themethod of factorization is given. Analytic expressions of the energies and theallowed frequencies for the three cases are given in terms of the roots of oneand the same set of Bethe ansatz equations.
