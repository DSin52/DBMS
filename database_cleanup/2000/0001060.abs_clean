A new approach to study the scaling behavior of the scalar theory near theGaussian fixed point in $d$-dimensions is presented. For a class of initialdata an explicit use of the Green's function of the evolution equation is made.It is thus discussed under which conditions non-polynomial relevantinteractions can be generated by the renormalization group flow.
