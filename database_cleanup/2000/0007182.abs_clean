In order to understand QCD at the energies relevant to hadronic physics onerequires analytical methods for dealing with relativistic gauge field theoriesat large couplings. Strongly coupled quenched QED provides an ideal laboratoryfor the development of such techniques, in particular as many calculationssuggest that - like QCD - this theory has a phase with broken chiral symmetry.In this talk we report on a nonperturbative variational calculation of theelectron propagator within quenched QED and compare results to those obtainedin other approaches. We find surprising differences among these results.
