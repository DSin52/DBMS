We consider asymtotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes in general dimensions. Wereview the origin of infrared divergences in the on-shell gravitational action,and the construction of the renormalized on-shell action by the addition ofboundary counterterms. In odd dimensions, the renormalized on-shell action isnot invariant under bulk diffeomorphisms that yield conformal transformationsin the boundary (holographic Weyl anomaly). We obtain formulae for thegravitational stress energy tensor, defined as the metric variation of therenormalized on-shell action, in terms of coefficients in the asymptoticexpansion of the metric near infinity. The stress energy tensor transformsanomalously under bulk diffeomorphisms broken by infrared divergences.
