We show that the Skyrme theory possesses a submodel with an infinite numberof local conserved currents. The constraints leading to the submodel explore adecomposition of SU(2) with a complex field parametrizing the symmetric spaceSU(2)/U(1) and a real field in the direction of U(1). We demonstrate that theSkyrmions of topological charges $\pm 1$ belong to such integrable sector ofthe theory. Our results open ways to the development of exact methods,compensating for the non-existence of a BPS type sector in the Skyrme theory.
