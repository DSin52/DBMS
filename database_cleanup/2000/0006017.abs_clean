We elaborate on a new N=2, d=3 supermultiplet (double-vector multiplet) witha non-trivial off-shell realization of the central charge. Its bosonic sectorcomprises two abelian gauge vector fields forming an SO(2) vector. We present asuperfield formulation of this multiplet in the central-charge extended N=2,d=3 superspace and then employ it, in the framework of the nonlinearrealizations approach, as the Goldstone one for the partial breaking N=4 -> N=2in three dimensions. The covariant equations of motion for the self-interactingGoldstone superfield arise as a natural generalization of the free ones and areinterpreted as the worldvolume supersymmetric form of the equations of motionof a N=4 D2-brane. For the vector fields we find a coupled nonlinear system ofBorn-Infeld type and demonstrate its dual equivalence to the d=5 membrane. Thedouble-vector multiplet can be fused with some extra N=2, d=3 multiplet to forman off-shell N=4, d=3 supermultiplet.
