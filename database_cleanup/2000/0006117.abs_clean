Conference, based on a talk given June 6 in MoscowIn theories with Chern-Simons terms or modified Bianchi identities, it isuseful to define three notions of either electric or magnetic charge associatedwith a given gauge field. A language for discussing these charges is introducedand the properties of each charge are described. `Brane source charge' is gaugeinvariant and localized but not conserved or quantized, `Maxwell charge' isgauge invariant and conserved but not localized or quantized, while `Pagecharge' conserved, localized, and quantized but not gauge invariant. Thisprovides a further perspective on the issue of charge quantization recentlyraised by Bachas, Douglas, and Schweigert.
