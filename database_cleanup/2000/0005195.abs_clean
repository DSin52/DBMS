Title: A differential equation approach for examining the subtraction schemes

Comments: 5 pages, RevTex, revised version, more references added

We propose a natural differential equation with respect to mass(es) toanalyze the scheme dependence problem. It is shown that the vertex functionssubtracted at an arbitrary Euclidean momentum (MOM) do not satisfy suchdifferential equations, as extra unphysical mass dependence is introduced whichis shown to lead to the violation of the canonical form of the Slavnov-Tayloridentities, a notorious fact with MOM schemes. By the way, the traditionaladvantage of MOM schemes in decoupling issue is shown to be lost in the contextof Callan-Symanzik equations.
