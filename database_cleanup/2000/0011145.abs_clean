We study the elliptic C_n and BC_n Ruijsenaars-Schneider models which iselliptic generalization of system given in hep-th/0006004. The Lax pairs forthese models are constructed by Hamiltonian reduction technology. We show thatthe spectral curves can be parameterized by the involutive integrals of motionfor these models. Taking nonrelativistic limit and scaling limit, we verifythat they lead to the systems corresponding to Calogero-Moser and Toda types.
