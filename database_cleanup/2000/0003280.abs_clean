We derive the vertex operators that are expected to govern the emission ofthe massless d=11 supermultiplet from the supermembrane in the light conegauge. We demonstrate that they form a representation of the supersymmetryalgebra and reduce to the type IIA superstring vertex operators under doubledimensional reduction, as well as to the vertices of the d=11 superparticle inthe point-particle limit. As a byproduct, our results can be used to derive thecorresponding vertex operators for matrix theory and to describe its linearcoupling to an arbitrary d=11 supergravity background. Possible applicationsare discussed.
