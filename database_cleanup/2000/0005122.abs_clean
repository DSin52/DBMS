It is shown that the generator of the nonstandard fermion-monopolesupersymmetry uncovered by De Jonghe, Macfarlane, Peeters and van Holten, andthe generator of its standard N=1/2 supersymmetry have to be supplemented bytheir product operator to be treated as independent supercharge. As a result,the fermion-monopole system possesses the nonlinear N=3/2 supersymmetry havingthe nature of the 3D spin-1/2 free particle's supersymmetry generated by thesupercharges represented in a scalar form. Analyzing the supercharges'structure, we trace how under reduction of the fermion-monopole system to thespherical geometry the nonlinear N=3/2 superalgebra comprising the Hamiltonianand the total angular momentum as even generators is transformed into thestandard linear N=1 superalgebra with the Hamiltonian to be the unique evengenerator.
