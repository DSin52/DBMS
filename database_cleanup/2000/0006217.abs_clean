Quantum fields on a stationary space-time in a rotating Killing referenceframe are considered. Finding solutions of wave equations in this frame isreduced to a fiducial problem on a static background. The rotation results in agauge connection in a way similar to appearance of gauge fields in Kaluza-Kleinmodels. Such a Kaluza-Klein method in theory of rotating quantum fields enablesone to simplify computations and get a number of new results similar to thoseestablished for static backgrounds. In particular, we find with its helpfunctional form of free energy at high temperatures. Applications of theseresults to quantum fields near rotating black holes are briefly discussed.
