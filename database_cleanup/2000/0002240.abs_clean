Four dimensional reflexive polyhedra encode the data for smooth Calabi-Yauthreefolds that are hypersurfaces in toric varieties, and have importantapplications both in perturbative and in non-perturbative string theory. Wedescribe how we obtained all 473,800,776 reflexive polyhedra that exist in fourdimensions and the 30,108 distinct pairs of Hodge numbers of the resultingCalabi-Yau manifolds. As a by-product we show that all these spaces (and hencethe corresponding string vacua) are connected via a chain of singulartransitions.
