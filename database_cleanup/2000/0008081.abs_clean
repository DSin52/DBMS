We study the family of ten dimensional type IIB supergravity solutionscorresponding to renormalisation group flows from N=4 to N=2 supersymmetricYang-Mills theory. Part of the solution set corresponds to a submanifold of theCoulomb branch of the gauge theory, and we use a D3-brane probe to uncoverdetails of this physics. At generic places where supergravity is singular, thesmooth physics of the probe yields the correct one-loop form of the effectivelow energy gauge coupling. The probe becomes tensionless on a ring at finiteradius. Supergravity flows which end on this ``enhancon'' ring correspond tothe vacua where extra massless degrees of freedom appear in the gauge theory,and the gauge coupling diverges there. We identify an SL(2,Z) duality action onthe enhancon ring which relates the special vacua, and comment on the masslessdyons within them. We propose that the supergravity solution inside theenhancon ring should be excised, since the probe's tension is unphysical there.
