The Caswell-Wilczek analysis on the gauge dependence of the effective actionand the renormalization group functions in Yang-Mills theories is generalizedto generic, possibly power counting non renormalizable gauge theories. It isshown that the physical coupling constants of the classical theory can beredefined by gauge parameter dependent contributions of higher orders in$\hbar$ in such a way that the effective action depends trivially on the gaugeparameters, while suitably defined physical beta functions do not depend onthose parameters.
