We find some lifts to M theory of orientifold and orbifold planes includingthe O1, O3 and O5 planes of Type IIB and their transformations under SL(2,Z).The possible discrete torsion variants (or K theory classes) are explored, andare interpreted as arising from brane intersections with planes. We find newvariants of the O0 and of an orbifold line (OF1) and determine their tensionsin some cases. A systematic review of orientifolds, M orientifolds, and known Mlifts, with some new clarifications is included together with a discussion ofthe role of T duality.
