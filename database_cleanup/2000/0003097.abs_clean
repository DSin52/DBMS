From a supersymmetry covariant source extension of N=2 SYM we studynon-trivial thermodynamical limits thereof. Using an argument by one of usabout the solution of the strong CP problem and the uniqueness of the QCDground state we find that the dependence of the effective potential on thedefining field operators is severely restricted. In contrast to the solution bySeiberg and Witten an acceptable infrared behavior only exists for brokensupersymmetry while the gauge symmetry remains unbroken.
