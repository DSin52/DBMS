The role of bulk matter quantum effects (via the corresponding effectivepotential discussed on the example of conformal scalar) and of boundary matterquantum effects (via the conformal anomaly induced effective action) isconsidered in brane-world cosmology. Scenario is used where brane tension isnot free parameter, and the initial bulk-brane classical action is defined bysome considerations. The effective bulk-brane equations of motion are analyzed.The quantum creation of 4d de Sitter or Anti-de Sitter(AdS) brane Universeliving in 5d AdS space is possible when quantum bulk and (or) brane matter istaken into account. The consideration of only conformal field theory (CFT)living on the brane admits the full analytical treatment. Then bulkgravitational Casimir effect leads to deformation of 5d AdS space shape as wellas of shape of spherical or hyperbolic branes. The generalization of abovepicture for the dominant bulk quantum gravity naturally represents suchscenario as self-consistent warped compactification within AdS/CFT set-up.
