We consider moving-brane-solutions in AdS type back ground. In the firstRandall-Sundrum configuration, there are two branes at fixed points of theorbifold symmetry. We point out that if one brane is fixed and the other braneis moving, the configuration is still a solution provided the moving brane hasa specific velocity determined by its tension and bulk cosmological constant.In the absence of the $\bf Z_2$ symmetry, we can construct multi-braneconfigurations by patching AdS-Schwarzshild solutions. In this case, we showthat the 4-dimensional effective cosmological constant on the brane world isnot well defined. We find a condition for a brane to be stationary. Using thebrane scattering, we suggest a scenario of inflation on the brane universeduring a finite time, i.e, a scenario of a graceful exit of inflation.
