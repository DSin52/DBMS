Naive light-front quantization, carried out by a light-front energyintegration of covariant amplitudes, is not guaranteed to generate thecorresponding Feynman amplitudes. In an explicit example we show that thenonvalence contribution to the minus-component of the EM current of a mesonwith fermion constituents has a persistent end-point singularity. Only afterthis term is subtracted, the result is covariant and satisfies currentconservation. If the spin-1/2 constituents are replaced by spin zero ones, thesingularity does not occur and the result is, without any adjustment, identicalto the Feynman amplitude. Numerical estimates of valence and nonvalencecontributions are presented for the cases of fermion and boson constituents.
