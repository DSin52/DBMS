We briefly discuss some possible cosmological implications of noncommutativegeometry. While the noncommutativity we consider does not affect gravity, itcan play an important role in the dynamics of other fields that are present inthe early universe. We point out the possibility that noncommutativity maycause inflation induced fluctuations to become non-gaussian and anisotropic,and may modify the short distance dispersion relations.
