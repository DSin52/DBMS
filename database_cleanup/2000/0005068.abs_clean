The effective action of N=2 supersymmetric 5-dimensional supergravity arisingfrom compactifications of M-theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds receivesnon-perturbative corrections from wrapped Euclidean membranes and fivebranes.These contributions can be interpreted as instanton corrections in the 5dimensional field theory. Focusing on the universal hypermultiplet, a solutionof this type is presented and the instanton action is calculated, generalizingprevious results involving membrane instantons. The instanton action is not anon-threshold bound states.
