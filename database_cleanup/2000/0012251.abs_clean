Assuming that around the tachyon vacuum the kinetic term of cubic open stringfield theory is made purely of ghost operators we are led to gauge invariantactions which manifestly implement the absence of open string dynamics aroundthis vacuum. We test this proposal by showing the existence of lump solutionsof arbitrary codimension in this string field theory. The key ingredients inthis analysis are certain assumptions about the analyticity properties oftachyon Green's functions. With the help of some further assumptions about theproperties of these Green's functions, we also calculate the ratios of tensionsof lump solutions of different dimensions. The result is in perfect agreementwith the known answers for the ratios of tensions of D-branes of differentdimensions.
