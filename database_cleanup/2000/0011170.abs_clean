Title: Quantum Corrections to Noncommutative Solitons

Comments: 19 pages, harvmac. v2

Noncommutative solitons are easier to find in a noncommutative field theory.Similarly, the one-loop quantum corrections to the mass of a noncommutativesoliton are easier to compute, in a real scalar theory in 2+1 dimensions. Wecarry out this computation in this paper. We also discuss the model with adouble-well potential, and conjecture that there is a partial symmetryrestoration in a vacuum state.
