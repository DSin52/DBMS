It has been claimed that whereas scalars can be bound to a Randall-Sundrumbrane, higher p-form potentials cannot, in contradiction with the Hodge dualitybetween 0-form and 3-form potentials in the five-dimensional bulk. Here we showthat a 3-form in the bulk correctly yields a 2-form on the brane, in completeagreement with both bulk and brane duality. We also emphasize that thephenomenon of photon screening in the Randall-Sundrum geometry is ruled out bythe bulk Einstein equation.
