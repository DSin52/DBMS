Title: An algebraic approach to coarse graining

Authors: Fotini Markopoulou

We propose that Kreimer's method of Feynman diagram renormalization via aHopf algebra of rooted trees can be fruitfully employed in the analysis ofblock spin renormalization or coarse graining of inhomogeneous statisticalsystems. Examples of such systems include spin foam formulations ofnon-perturbative quantum gravity as well as lattice gauge and spin systems onirregular lattices and/or with spatially varying couplings. We study threeexamples which are Z_2 lattice gauge theory on irregular 2-dimensionallattices, Ising/Potts models with varying bond strengths and (1+1)-dimensionalspin foam models.
