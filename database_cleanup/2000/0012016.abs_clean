The static Yang-Mills-Higgs dyonic instanton is shown to have anon-vanishing, but anti-self-dual, angular momentum 2-form with skeweigenvalues equal to the electric charge; for large charge the angular momentumcauses the instanton to expand into a hyper-spherical shell. A class of exactmulti dyonic instantons is then found and then generalized to a new class of1/4 supersymmetric, non-singular, stationary, exact solutions of theten-dimensional supergravity/Yang-Mills theory. These self-gravitating dyonicinstantons yield new heterotic string solitons, to leading order in the inversestring tension.
