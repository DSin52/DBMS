We construct a consistent reduction of type IIA supergravity on S^3, leadingto a maximal gauged supergravity in seven dimensions with the full set ofmassless SO(4) Yang-Mills fields. We do this by starting with the known S^4reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity, and showing that it is possibleto take a singular limit of the resulting standard SO(5)-gauged maximalsupergravity in seven dimensions, whose eleven-dimensional interpretationinvolves taking a limit where the internal 4-sphere degenerates to RxS^3. Thisallows us to reinterpret the limiting SO(4)-gauged theory in seven dimensionsas the S^3 reduction of type IIA supergravity. We also obtain the consistentS^4 reduction of type IIA supergravity, which gives an SO(5)-gauged maximalsupergravity in D=6.
