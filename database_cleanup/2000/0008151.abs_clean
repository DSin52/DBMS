The dynamics of a stabilized radion in the Randall-Sundrum model (RS) withtwo branes is investigated, and the effects of the radion on electroweakprecision observables are evaluated. The radius is assumed to be stabilizedusing a bulk scalar field as suggested by Goldberger and Wise. First the massand the wavefunction of the radion is determined including the backreaction ofthe bulk stabilization field on the metric, giving a typical radion mass oforder the weak scale. This is demonstrated by a perturbative computation of theradion wavefunction. A consequence of the background configuration for thescalar field is that after including the backreaction the Kaluza-Klein (KK)states of the bulk scalars couple directly to the Standard Model fields on theTeV brane. Some cosmological implications are discussed, and in particular itis found that the shift in the radion at late times is in agreement with thefour-dimensional effective theory result. The effect of the radion on theoblique parameters is evaluated using an effective theory approach. In theabsence of a curvature-scalar Higgs mixing operator, these corrections aresmall and give a negative contribution to S. In the presence of such a mixingoperator, however, the corrections can be sizable due to the modified Higgs andradion couplings.
