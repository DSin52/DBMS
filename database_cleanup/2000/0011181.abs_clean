We examine the structure of the Yukawa couplings in the 11 dimensionalHorava-Witten M-theory based on non-standard embeddings. We find that the CKMand quark mass hierarchies can be explained in M Theory without introducingundue fine tuning. A phenomenological example is presented satisfying all CKMand quark mass data requiring the 5-branes cluster near the second orbifoldplane, and that the instanton charges of the physical orbifold plane vanish.The latter condition is explicitly realized on a Calabi-Yau manifold with delPezzo base dP_7.
