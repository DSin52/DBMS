We generalize the mechanism proposed in [hep-th/0005016] and show that afour-dimensional relativistic tensor theory of gravitation can be obtained on adelta-function brane in flat infinite-volume extra space. In particular, wedemonstrate that the induced Ricci scalar gives rise to Einstein's gravity on adelta-function type brane if the number of space-time dimensions is bigger thanfive. The bulk space exhibits the phenomenon of infrared transparency. That isto say, the bulk can be probed by gravitons with vanishing four-dimensionalmomentum square, while it is unaccessible to higher modes. This provides anattractive framework for solving the cosmological constant problem.
