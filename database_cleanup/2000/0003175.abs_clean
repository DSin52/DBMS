Title: TASI Lectures on M Theory Phenomenology

Comments: Latex, 68 pages. Typos and refs. corrected

These lectures discuss some of the general issues in developing ahow might one obtain robust, generic predictions. For example, does the theorypredict low energy supersymmetry breaking? In the course of these explorations,basics of supersymmetry and supersymmetry breaking, string moduli, cosmologicalissues, and other questions are addressed. The notion of approximate moduli andtheir possible role plays a central role in the discussion.
