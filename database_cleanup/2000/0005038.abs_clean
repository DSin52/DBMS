The functional integral of pure Einstein 4D quantum gravity admits abnormallylarge and long-lasting "dipolar fluctuations", generated by virtual sourceswith the property Int d^4x Sqrt{g(x)} Tr T(x) = 0. These fluctuations wouldexist also at macroscopic scales, with paradoxical consequences. We set outtheir general features and give numerical estimates of possible suppressionprocesses.
