Title: Discrete Torsion in Perturbative Heterotic String Theory

Authors: Eric R. Sharpe

Comments: 15 pages, LaTeX

In this paper we analyze discrete torsion in perturbative heterotic stringtheory. In previous work we have given a purely mathematical explanation ofdiscrete torsion as the choice of orbifold group action on a B field, in thecase that d H = 0; in this paper, we perform the analogous calculations inheterotic strings where d H is nonzero.
