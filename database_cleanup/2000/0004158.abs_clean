We show that off-diagonal gluons and off-diagonal ghosts acquire their massesdynamically in QCD if the maximal Abelian gauge is adopted. This resultstrongly supports the Abelian dominance in low-energy region of QCD. The massgeneration is shown to occur due to ghost-anti-ghost condensation caused byattractive quartic ghost interactions within the Abelian projected effectivegauge theory (derived by one of the authors). In fact, the quartic ghostinteraction is indispensable for the renormalizability due to nonlinearity ofthe maximal Abelian gauge. The ghost-anti-ghost condensation is associated withthe spontaneous breaking of global SL(2,R) symmetry recently found by Schadenat least for SU(2) case. Moreover we write down a new extended BRS algebra inthe maximal Abelian gauge which should be compared with that of Nakanishi-Ojimafor the Lorentz gauge. Finally, we argue that the mass generation may berelated to the spontaneous breaking of a supersymmetry $OSp(4|2)$ hidden in themaximal Abelian gauge.
