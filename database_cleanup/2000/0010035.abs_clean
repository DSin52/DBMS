We present the consistent approach to finding the discrete transformations inthe representation spaces of the proper Poincar\'e group. To this end we usethe possibility to establish a correspondence between involutory automorphismsof the proper Poincar\'e group and the discrete transformations. As a result,we derive rules of the discrete transformations for arbitrary spin-tensorfields without the use of relativistic wave equations. Besides, we constructexplicitly fields carrying representations of the extended Poincar\'e group,which includes the discrete transformations as well.
