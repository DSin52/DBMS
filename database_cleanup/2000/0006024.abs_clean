Title: Black Holes and Spacetime Physics in String/M Theory

Comments: 33 pages, harvmac

In addition to briefly reviewing recent progress in studying black holephysics in string/M theory, we describe several robust features pertaining tospacetime physics that one can glean by studying quantum physics of blackholes. In particular, we review 't Hooft's S-matrix ansatz which results in anoncommutative horizon. A recent construction of fuzzy AdS2 is emphasized, thisis a nice toy model for fuzzy black hole horizon. We demonstrate that thismodel captures some nonperturbative features of quantum gravity.
