The explicit multi-instanton solutions by 'tHooft and Jackiw, Nohl & Rebbiare generalized to curvilinear coordinates. The idea is that a gaugetransformation can notably simplify the expressions obtained after the changeof variables. The gauge transform generates a compensating addition to thegauge potential of pseudoparticles. Singularities of the compensating field areirrelevant for physics but may affect gauge dependent quantities.
