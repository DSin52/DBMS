We compute the probabilty for the processes A -> q \bar{q}, gg via vacuumpolarization in the presence of a classical space-time dependent non-abelianfield A by applying the background field method of QCD. The processes weconsider are leading order in gA and are simillar to A -> e^+e^- in QED. Gluonsare treated like a matter field and gauge transformations of the quantumgluonic field are different from those of the classical chromofield. To obtainthe correct physical polarization of gluons we deduct the corresponding ghostcontributions. We find that the expression for the probability of the leadingorder process A -> gg is transverse with respect to the momentum of the field.We observe that the contributions from higher order processes to gluon pairproduction need to be added to the this leading order process. Our resultpresented here is a part of the expression for the total probability for gluonpair production from a space-time dependent chromfield. The result for q\bar{q} pair production is similar to that of the e^+e^- pair production inQED. Quark and gluon production from a space-time dependent chromofield willplay an important role in the study of the production and equilibration of thequark-gluon plasma in ultra relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
