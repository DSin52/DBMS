The problem of consistent definition of the quantum corrected gravitationalfield is considered in the framework of the $S$-matrix method. Gauge dependenceof the one-particle-reducible part of the two-scalar-particle scatteringamplitude, with the help of which the potential is usually defined, isinvestigated at the one-loop approximation. The $1/r^2$-terms in the potential,which are of zero order in the Planck constant $\hbar,$ are shown to beindependent of the gauge parameter weighting the gauge condition in the action.However, the $1/r^3$-terms, proportional to $\hbar,$ describing the firstproper quantum correction, are proved to be gauge-dependent. With the help ofthe Slavnov identities, their dependence on the weighting parameter iscalculated explicitly. The reason the gauge dependence originates from isbriefly discussed.
