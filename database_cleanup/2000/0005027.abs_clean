Sklyanin's method of separation of variables is employed in a calculation offinite temperature expectation values. An essential element of the approach isBaxter's $Q$-function. We propose its explicit form corresponding to the groundstate of the sinh-Gordon theory. With the method of separation of variables wecalculate the finite temperature expectation values of the exponential fieldsto one-loop order of the semi-classical expansion.
