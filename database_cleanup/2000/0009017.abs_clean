We study the case of open string theory on a D1-brane in a critical electricfield. It was argued in hep-th/0006085 that the massless open string modes ofthis theory decouple from the massive modes, corresponding to a decoupling ofthe U(1) degrees of freedom in the U(N) gauge theory dual. To provide furthersupport for the decoupling, we present several examples of open string diskamplitudes. Because of the decoupling, many of the massive open string statesare stable, indicating the presence of a number of correspondingly stablestates in the gauge theory. We provide a lengthy list of these stable states.However, when the theory is compactified in the spatial direction of theelectric field, we demonstrate that sufficiently massive such states may decayinto wound closed strings.
