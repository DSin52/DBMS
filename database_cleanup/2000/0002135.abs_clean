Title: Implications of N = 2 Superconformal Symmetry

Authors: Sergei Kuzenko and Stefan Theisen (University of Munich)

Comments: 7 pages, latex, JHEP style, no figures; based on talks delivered at

the Workshop on Supersymmetries and Quantum Symmetries, Dubna, Russia, 26-31Jul 1999, and at the Meeting on Quantum Aspects of Gauge Theories,Supersymmetry and Unification, Paris, France, 1-7 Sep 1999We review recent results on the general structure of two- and three- pointfunctions of the supercurrent and the flavor current of N = 2 superconformalfield theories.
