We study the mechanism of topological superconductivity in a hierarchicalchain of chiral non-linear sigma-models (models of current algebra) in one,two, and three spatial dimensions. The models have roots in the 1DPeierls-Frohlich model and illustrate how the 1D Frohlich's ideal conductivityextends to a genuine superconductivity in dimensions higher than one. Themechanism is based on the fact that a point-like topological soliton carries anelectric charge. We discuss a flux quantization mechanism and show that it isessentially a generalization of the persistent current phenomenon, known inquantum wires. We also discuss why the superconducting state is stable in thepresence of a weak disorder.
