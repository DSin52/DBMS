Workshop on Gravitation and Mathematical Physics', Leon Gto. MexicoWe overview some attempts to find S-duality analogues of non-supersymmetricYang-Mills theory, in the context of gravity theories. The case ofMacDowell-Mansouri gauge theory of gravity is discussed. Three-dimensionaldimensional reductions from the topological gravitational sector in fourdimensions, enable to recuperate the 2+1 Chern-Simons gravity and thecorresponding S-dual theory, from the notion of self-duality in thefour-dimensional theory.
