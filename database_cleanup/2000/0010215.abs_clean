We consider cosmological models where the universe, governed by Einstein'sequations, is a piece of a five dimensional double-sided anti-de Sitterspacetime (that is, a "$Z_2$-symmetric bulk") with matter confined to its fourdimensional Robertson-Walker boundary or "brane". We study the perturbations ofsuch models. We use conformally minkowskian coordinates to disentangle thecontributions of the bulk gravitons and of the motion of the brane. We find therestrictions put on the bulk gravitons when matter on the brane is taken to bea scalar field and we solve in that case the brane perturbation equations.
