We present a finite energy topological Z(2) vortex solution in a 2+1dimensional SO(3) gauge field theory minimally coupled to a matrix valued Higgsfield. The vortex carries a Z(2) magnetic charge and obeys a modulo twoaddition property. The core of this vortex has a structure similar to that ofthe Abrikosov vortex appearing in a type II superconductor. The implications ofthis solution for Wilson loops are quite interesting. In two Euclideandimensions these vortices are instantons and a dilute gas of such vorticesdisorders Wilson loops producing an area law behaviour with an exponentiallysmall string tension. In 2+1 dimensions the vortices are loops and they affectthe same disordering in the phase having large loops.
