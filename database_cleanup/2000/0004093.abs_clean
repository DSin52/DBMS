We supersymmetrize a class of moduli dependent potentials living on braneswith the help of additional bulk terms in 5d N=2 supergravity. The space ofPoincare invariant vacuum solutions includes the Randall-Sundrum solution andthe $M$-theoretical solution. After adding gauge sectors to the branes wediscuss breakdown of low energy supersymmetry in this setup and hierarchy ofphysical scales. In the limit of large warp factors we find decoupling betweeneffects stemming from different branes in the compactified theory.
