We find two types [called (S) and (A)] of new vacuum solutions of open, flat,and closed universes which are inflating in the brane-world scenario. We showthat the warp factor of the stabilized metric is universal for the threedifferent kinds of universes. For (S) type solution, we show that onepositive-tension brane universe solution is admitted as well as two positivetension brane solution even if we consider the vacuum solution. For (A) typesolution, we find that the inflating bulk solutions have black hole likeregions and that the full extended space is the R-S solution.
