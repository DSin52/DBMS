The microcanonical statistics of the Schwarzschild black holes as well as theReissner-Nordstr$\sf \ddot{o}$m black holes are analyzed. In both cases we setup the inequalities in the microcanonical density of states.These are then used to show that the most probable configuration in the gasesof black holes is that one black hole acquires all of the mass and all of thecharge at high energy limit. Thus the black holes obey the statisticalbootstrap condition and, in contrast to the other investigation, we see thatU(1) charge does not break the bootstrap property.
