Vector supersymmetry is shown to exist also in light-cone gauge Chern-Simonstheory. Using a gauge invariant regularization scheme, we demonstrateexplicitly that the finite quantum correction to the coupling constant ofChern-Simons theory is intimately associated with the breaking of vectorsupersymmetry at the regularization level. The advantage of investigating sucha quantum phenomenon in the light-cone gauge is emphasized and the BRST andvector supersymmetry invariance of quantum effective action is discussed.
