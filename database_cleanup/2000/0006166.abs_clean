This is an introduction for nonspecialists to the noncommutative geometricapproach to Planck scale physics coming out of quantum groups. The canonicalrole of the `Planck scale quantum group' $C[x]\bicross C[p]$ and itsobservable-state T-duality-like properties are explained. The general meaningof noncommutativity of position space as potentially a new force in Nature isexplained as equivalent under quantum group Fourier transform to curvature inmomentum space. More general quantum groups $C(G^\star)\bicross U(g)$ and$U_q(g)$ are also discussed. Finally, the generalisation from quantum groups togeneral quantum Riemannian geometry is outlined. The semiclassical limit of thelatter is a theory with generalised non-symmetric metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ obeying$\nabla_\mu g_{\nu\rho}-\nabla_\nu g_{\mu\rho}=0$
