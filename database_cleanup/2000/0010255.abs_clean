The non-perturbative corrections to the universal hypermultiplet moduli spacemetric in the type-IIA superstring compactification on a Calabi-Yau threefoldare investigated in the presence of 4d, N=2 supergravity. These correctionscome from multiple wrapping of the BPS (Euclidean) D2-branes around certain(BPS) Calabi-Yau 3-cycles, and they are known as the D-instantons. The exactuniversal hypermultiplet metric is governed by a quaternionic potential thatsatisfies the SU(\infty) Toda equation. The mechanism is proposed, whichelevates any four-dimensional hyper-K"ahler metric with a rotational isometryto the quaternionic metric of the same dimension. A generic separable solutionto the Toda equation appears to be related to the Eguchi-Hanson metric, whereasanother solution originating from the Atiyah-Hitchin metric describes thegravitationally dressed (mixed) D-instantons.
