We consider the five dimensional $USp(2k)$ gauge theory which consists of oneantisymmetric and $n_{f}$ fundamental hypermultiplets. This gauge theory is amany-probe generalization of the SU(2) gauge theory in five dimensionsconsidered by Seiberg in the context of probing type I superstring by aD4-brane. This gauge theory can also be obtained from the USp(2k) matrix modelby matrix T-dual transformations in the large k limit. We exhibit the anomalousinteraction associated with this five dimensional theory on the new phase,where the vacuum expectation values (vevs) of the scalars belonging to theantisymmetric hypermultiplet are also nonvanishing. On the Coulomb phase, theanomalous interaction has been computed in [1, 2].
