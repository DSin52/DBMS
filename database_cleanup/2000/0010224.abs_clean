Title: Pseudoconformal field theory at the "wrong level"

Authors: Doron Gepner and Dmitry Kerner

Pseudoaffine theories are characterized by formal replacement of the level to$k(g+k)$ ($g$ - dual Coxeter number). An example of "forbidden" $q$ isconsidered (SU(2), $q=2$). The fusions of obtained theory are similar to theaffine ones. Spectra of minimal models are calculated.
