We discuss spacetime singularity resolution in the context of thegravity/gauge correspondence, for brane systems which give rise to gaugetheories with eight supercharges and no hypermultiplets. The discussion isaimed at non-experts. Writeup of talk on hep-th/9911161 with C.V.Johnson and`Way Beyond the Standard Models', Banff CIAR Gravity+Cosmology ProgrammeMeeting.
