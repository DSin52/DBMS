It is shown that 3D vector van der Waals (conformal) nonlinear $\sigma$-model(NSM) on a sphere $S^2$ has two types of topological excitations reminiscentvortices and instantons of 2D NSM. The first, the hedgehogs, are described byhomotopic group $\pi_2(S^2) = \mathbb {Z}$ and have the logarithmic energies.They are an analog of 2D vortices. The energy and interaction of theseexcitations are found. The second, corresponding to 2D instantons, aredescribed by hpmotopic group $\pi_3(S^2) = \mathbb {Z}$ or the Hopf invariant$H \in \mathbb {Z}$. A possibility of the topological phase transition in thismodel and its applications are briefly discussed.
