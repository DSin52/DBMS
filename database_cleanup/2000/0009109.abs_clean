Title: No consistent cross-interactions for a collection of massless spin-2

fieldsAuthors: Nicolas Boulanger, Thibault Damour, Leonardo Gualtieri, Marc Henneaux

Comments: 12+1 pages, to appear in the Proceedings of the Meetings "Spring

School in QFT and Hamiltonian Systems" (Calimanesti, Romania, 2-7 May 2000)and "Quantization, Gauge Theory and Strings" (Moscow, Russia, 5-10 June 2000)We report a no-go theorem excluding consistent cross-couplings for acollection of massless, spin-2 fields described, in the free limit, by the sumof Pauli-Fierz actions (one for each field). We show that, in spacetimedimensions >2, there is no consistent coupling, with at most two derivatives ofthe fields, that can mix the various "gravitons". The only possibledeformations are given by the sum of individual Einstein-Hilbert actions (onefor each field) with cosmological terms. Our approach is based on theBRST-based deformation point of view.
