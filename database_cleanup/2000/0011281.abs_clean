We compute the tree-level four-point scattering amplitudes in string modelswhere matter fields live on D-brane intersections. Extracting the contributionof massless modes, we are left with dimension-six four-fermion operators whichmassive Kaluza--Klein excitations, winding modes and string oscillator states.We compute their coefficients and extract new bounds on the string scale in thebrane-world scenario. This is contrasted with the situation where matter fieldsarise from open strings with both ends confined on the same collection ofD-branes, in which case the exchange of massive string modes leads todimension-eight operators that have been studied in the past. When matterfields live on brane intersections, the presence of dimension-six operatorsincreases the lower bound on the string scale to 2--3 TeV, independently of thenumber of large extra dimensions.
