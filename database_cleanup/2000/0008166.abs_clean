This paper presents a detailed investigation of the motion of a string near aKaluza-Klein black hole, using the null string expansion. The zeroth-orderstring equations of motion are set up separately for electrically andmagnetically charged black hole backgrounds. The case of a string fallinghead-on into the black hole is considered in detail. The equations reduce toquadratures for a magnetically charged hole, while they are amenable tonumerical solution for an electrically charged black hole. The Kaluza-Kleinradius seen by the string as it approaches the black hole decreases in themagnetic case and increases in the electric case. For magnetic backgrounds,analytical solutions can be obtained in terms of elliptical integrals. Thesereduce to elementary functions in special cases, including that of thewell-known Pollard-Gross-Perry-Sorkin monopole. Here the string exhibitsdecelerated descent into the black hole. The results in the authors' earlierpapers are substantiated here by presenting a detailed analysis. A preliminaryanalysis of first-order perturbations is also presented, and it is shown thatthe invariant string length receives a nonzero contribution in the first order.
