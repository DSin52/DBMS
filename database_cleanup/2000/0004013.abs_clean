Motivated by recent discussions of IR/UV mixing in noncommutative fieldtheories, we perform a detailed analysis of the non-planar amplitudes of thebosonic open string in the presence of an external B-field at the one-looplevel. We carefully isolate, at the string theory level, the contribution whichis responsible for the IR/UV behavior in the field theory limit. We show thatit is a pure open string effect by deriving it from the factorization of theone-loop amplitude into the disk amplitudes of intermediate open stringinsertions. We suggest that it is natural to understand IR/UV mixing as thecreation of intermediate ``stretched strings''.
