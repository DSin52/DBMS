The tachyonic instability of the open bosonic string is analyzed using thelevel truncation approach to string field theory. We have calculated all termsin the cubic action of the string field theory describing zero-momentuminteractions of up to level 20 between scalars of level 10 or less. Theseresults are used to study the tachyon effective potential and thenonperturbative stable vacuum. We find that the energy gap between the unstableand stable vacua converges much more quickly than the coefficients of theeffective tachyon potential. By including fields up to level 10, 99.91% of theenergy from the bosonic D-brane tension is cancelled in the nonperturbativestable vacuum. It appears that the perturbative expansion of the effectivetachyon potential around the unstable vacuum has a small but finite radius ofconvergence. We find evidence for a critical point in the tachyon effectivepotential at a small negative value of the tachyon field corresponding to thisradius of convergence. We study the branch structure of the effective potentialin the vicinity of this point and speculate that the tachyon effectivepotential is globally nonnegative.
