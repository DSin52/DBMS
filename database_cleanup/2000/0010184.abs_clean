We develop algebro-geometrical approach for the open Toda lattice. For afinite Jacobi matrix we introduce a singular reducible Riemann surface andassociated Baker-Akhiezer functions. We provide new explicit solution ofinverse spectral problem for a finite Jacoby matrix. For the Toda latticeequations we obtain the explicit form of the equations of motion, thesymplectic structure and Darboux coordinates. We develop similar approach for2D open Toda. Explaining some the machinery we also make contact with theperiodic case.
