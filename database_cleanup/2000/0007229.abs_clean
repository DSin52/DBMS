Fourth Workshop on "Continuous Advances in QCD", Minneapolis, 12.-14.5.2000,to appear in the proceedingsA model for the infrared sector of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory, based on magneticvortices represented by (closed) random surfaces, is presented. The randomsurfaces, governed by an action penalizing curvature, are investigated usingMonte Carlo methods on a hypercubic lattice. A low-temperature confining phaseand a high-temperature deconfined phase are generated by this simple dynamics.After fixing the parameters of the model such as to reproduce the relationbetween deconfinement temperature and zero-temperature string tension found inlattice Yang-Mills theory, a surprisingly accurate prediction of the spatialstring tension in the deconfined phase results. Furthermore, the Pontryaginindex associated with the lattice random surfaces of the model is constructed.This allows to also predict the topological susceptibility; the result iscompatible with measurements in lattice Yang-Mills theory. Thus, for the firsttime an effective model description of the infrared sector emerges whichsimultaneously and consistently reproduces both confinement and the topologicalaspects of Yang-Mills theory within a unified framework.
