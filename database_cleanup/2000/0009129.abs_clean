We use algebraic methods to compute the simple Hurwitz numbers for arbitrarysource and target Riemann surfaces. For an elliptic curve target, we reproducethe results previously obtained by string theorists. Motivated by theGromov-Witten potentials, we find a general generating function for the simpleHurwitz numbers in terms of the representation theory of the symmetric groupS_n. We also find a generating function for Hodge integrals on the moduli spaceM_{g,2} of Riemann surfaces with two marked points, similar to that found byFaber and Pandharipande for the case of one marked point.
