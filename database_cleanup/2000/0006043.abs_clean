We derive an RG flow equation that is satisfied by the regularized partitionfunction for noncritical strings in background fields. The flow refers tochange in the position of a ``boundary'' in the liouville direction. Theboundary is required to regularize the ultraviolet divergences in the partitionfunction coming from integration over world-sheets of arbitrarily small area.From the point of view of the target space effective gravitational actionthat the partition function evaluates on-shell, the boundary regularizes {\itinfrared} divergences coming from the infinite volume of the liouvilledirection. The RG flow equation that we obtain looks very much like theHamilton-Jacobi constraint equation that an on-shell gauge-fixed gravitationalaction must satisfy.
