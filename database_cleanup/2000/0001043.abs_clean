In this paper, we put forth a new massive spin-1 field theory. In contrast tothe quantization of traditional vector field, the quantization of the newvector field is carried out in a natural way. The Lorentz invariance of thetheory is discussed, where owing to an interesting feature of the new vectorfield, the Lorentz invariance has a special meaning. In term of formalismanalogical to QED(i. e. spinor QED), we develop the quantum electrodynamicsconcerning the new spin-1 particles, say, vector QED, where the Feynman rulesare given. The renormalizability of vector QED is manifest without the aid ofHiggs mechanism. As an example, the polarization cross section $\sigma_{polar}$for $e^+ e^-\to f^+ f^-$ is calculated in the lowest order. It turns out that$\sigma_{polar}\sim 0$ and the momentum of $f^+$ and $f^-$ is purelylongitudinal.
