Title: Vacuum energies for the relativistic Landau problem

Authors: D.H. Correa

Comments: Trabajo de Diploma. In Spanish. 43 pages. LateX

We study, through zeta-function techniques, the vacuum energies for Diracfields in a constant magnetic background. We consider the combined effect ofthe background and twisted boundary conditions. The required chargerenormalization is discussed in each case.
