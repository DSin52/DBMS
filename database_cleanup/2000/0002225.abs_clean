We consider the universality class of the two-dimensional Tricritical IsingModel. The scaling form of the free-energy naturally leads to the definition ofuniversal ratios of critical amplitudes which may have experimental relevance.We compute these universal ratios by a combined use of results coming fromPerturbed Conformal Field Theory, Integrable Quantum Field Theory and numericalmethods.
