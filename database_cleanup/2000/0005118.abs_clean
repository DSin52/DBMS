Title: Particle masses and the fifth dimension

Authors: R. L. Ingraham

First we argue in an informal, qualitative way that it is natural to enlargespace-time to five dimensions to be able to solve the problem of elementaryparticle masses. Several criteria are developed for the success of thisprogram. Extending the Poincare group to the group C of all angle-preservingtransformations of space-time is one such scheme which satisfies thesecriteria. Then we show that the field equation for spin 1/2 fermions coupled tocertain range of a key parameter (Casimir invariant) a three-point massspectrum which fits the ``down'' quarks d,s, and b to within their experimentalbounds is obtained. Resonable values of the coupling constant (of QCDmagnitude) and the range of the spatial wave function (a few fermis) alsoresult.
