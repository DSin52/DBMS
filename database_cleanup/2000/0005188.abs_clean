Title: Chiral QED out of matter

Authors: Hidenori Sonoda

Comments: 13 pages, 2 figures, latex

In a previous paper we have shown how the Wilsonian renormalization groupnaturally leads to the equivalence of the standard QED with a matter-onlytheory. In this paper we give an improved explanation of the equivalence anddiscuss, as an example, the equivalence of a chiral QED in the Higgs phase witha matter-only theory. Ignoring the contributions suppressed by the negativepowers of a UV cutoff, the matter-only theory is equivalent to theperturbatively renormalizable chiral QED with two complex Higgs fields. In thematter-only theory chiral anomaly arises without elementary gauge fields.
