We show that the recently proposed formulation of noncommutative N=2 SuperYang-Mills theory implies that the commutative and noncommutative effectivecoupling constants \tau(u) and \tau_{nc}(u) coincide. We then introduce a keyrelation which allows to find a nontrivial solution of such equation, thusfixing the form of the low-energy effective action. The dependence on thenoncommutative parameter arises from a rational function deforming theSeiberg-Witten differential.
