Title: An AAD Model of Point Particle and the Pauli Equation

Authors: J. Weiss

Comments: AMS-TeX, 9 pages

The classical relativistic linear AAD interaction, introduced by the author,leads in the case of weak coupling to a pointlike particle capable to be sub-mitted to quantization via Feynman's path integrals along the line adequate tothe requirements of the Pauli equation. In the discussed nonrelativistic caseof the model the concept of spin is considered within early Feynman's ideas.
