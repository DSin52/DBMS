The dual supergravity description of the flow between (2,0) five-brane theoryand the noncommutative five-brane (OM) theory is examined at criticalfive-brane field strength. The self-duality of the field strength is shown toarise as a consequence of the supergravity solution. Open membrane solutionsare examined in the background of the five-brane giving rise to an M analogueof the noncommutative open string (NCOS) solution.
