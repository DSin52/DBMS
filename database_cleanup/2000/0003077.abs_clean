Title: The condition 0 < Z < 1 and an intrinsic mass scale in Quantum Field

TheoryComments: 13 pages Latex;v2

included, a justification for the view-point added, some repetition deletedIn this work, we suggest a view-point that leads to an intrinsic mass scalein Quantum Field Theories. This view-point is fairly independent of dynamicaldetails of a QFT and does not rely on any particular framework to go beyond thestandard Model. We use the setting of the nonlocal quantum field theories NLQFTwith a finite scale parameter Lambda, which are unitary for finite Lambda. Wepropose that the condition 0 < Z < 1 [wherever proven] can be rigorouslyimplemented/imposed in such theories and that it implies the existence of amass scale Lambda that can be determined from this condition. We derive thenonlocal analogue of the above relation [which is a finite relation in NLQFT]and demonstrate that it can be arrived at only from general principles. Wefurther propose that the nonlocal formulation should be looked as an effectivefield theory that incorporates the effect of dynamics beyond an energy scaleand which breaks at the intrinsic scale Lambda so obtained. Beyond this scaleit should be replaced by another [perhaps, a more fundamental] theory. Weprovide a heuristic justification for this view-point.
