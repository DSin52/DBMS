We consider general black holes in D=5, N=2 supergravity coupled to vectormultiplets, and discuss the issue of microstate counting from variousviewpoints. The statistical entropy is computed for the near-extremal caseusing the central charge of the $AdS_2$ factor appearing in the near-horizongeometry. Furthermore, we explicitly construct the duality transformationconnecting electrically charged black holes to magnetically charged blackstrings, under which the $AdS_2 \times S^3$ near horizon geometry becomes$AdS_3 \times S^2$. For $AdS_3$ the counting of microstates correctlyreproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, thus resolving the discrepancypreviously found for $AdS_2$.
