The nonrelativistic interpretation of quantum field theory achieved byquantization in an infinite momentum frame is spoiled by the inclusion of amode of the field carrying p+=0. We therefore explore the viability of doingwithout such a mode in the context of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB),where its presence would seem to be most needed. We show that the physics ofSSB in scalar quantum field theory in 1+1 space-time dimensions is accuratelydescribed without a zero-mode.
