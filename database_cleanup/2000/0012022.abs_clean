Grossmann Meeting (MG9) (electronic version)It is shown that the reduced particle dynamics of 2+1 dimensional gravity inthe maximally slicing gauge is of hamiltonian nature. We give the exactdiffeomorphism which transforms the expression of the spinning cone geometry inthe Deser, Jackiw, 't Hooft gauge to the maximally slicing gauge. It isexplicitly shown that the boundary term in the action, written in hamiltonianform gives the Hamiltonian for the reduced particle dynamics. The quantummechanical translation of the two particle Hamiltonian is given and the Greenfunction computed.
