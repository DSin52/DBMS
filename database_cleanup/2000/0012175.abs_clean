The Aharonov-Bohm effect on the noncommutative plane is considered.Developing the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, we find thepropagation amplitude for a particle in a noncommutative space. We show thatthe corresponding shift in the phase of the particle propagator due to themagnetic field of a thin solenoid receives certain gauge invariant correctionsbecause of the noncommutativity. Evaluating the numerical value for thiscorrection, an upper bound for the noncommutativity parameter is obtained.
