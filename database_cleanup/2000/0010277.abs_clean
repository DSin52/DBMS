The quantisation of the reduced first-order dynamics of the nonrelativisticmodel for Chern-Simons vortices introduced by Manton is studied on a sphere ofgiven radius. We perform geometric quantisation on the moduli space of staticsolutions, using a Kaehler polarisation, to construct the quantum Hilbertspace. Its dimension is related to the volume of the moduli space in the usualclassical limit. The angular momenta associated with the rotational SO(3)symmetry of the model are determined for both the classical and the quantumsystems. The results obtained are consistent with the interpretation of thesolitons in the model as interacting bosonic particles.
