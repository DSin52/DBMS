We study the locality properties of the vortex operators in compact U(1)Maxwell-Chern-Simons and SU(N) Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theories in 2+1dimensions. We find that these theories do admit local vortex operators andthus in the UV regularized versions should contain stable magnetic vortices. Inthe continuum limit however the energy of these vortex excitations genericallyis logarithmically UV divergent. Nevertheless the classical analysis shows thatat small values of CS coefficient $\kappa$ the vortices become light. It isconceivable that they in fact become massless and condense due to quantumeffects below some small $\kappa$. If this happens the magnetic symmetry breaksspontaneously and the theory is confining.
