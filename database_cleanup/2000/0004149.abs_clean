This paper presents a review of the basic, model-independent differencesbetween the pre-big bang scenario, arising naturally in a string cosmologycontext, and the standard inflationary scenario. We use an unconventionalapproach in which the introduction of technical details is avoided as much aspossible, trying to focus the reader's attention on the main conceptual aspectsof both scenarios. The aim of the paper is not to conclude in favour either ofone or of the other scenario, but to raise questions that are left to theintended as a complete review of all aspects of string cosmology.
