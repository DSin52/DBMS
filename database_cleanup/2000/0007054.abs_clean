Title: Theories of violation of statistics

Authors: O.W. Greenberg

Comments: 16 pages, talk given at the International Conference on the

Theoretical Implications, Capri, Italy, May 31-June 4, 2000. Dedicationadded. Minor misprints correctedI discuss theories of violations of statistics, including intermediatestatistics, parastatistics, parons, and quons. I emphasize quons, which allowsmall violations of statistics. I analyze the quon algebra and itsrepresentations, implications of the algebra including the observables allowedby the superselection rule separating inequivalent representations of thesymmetric group, the conservation of statistics rules, and the rule forcomposite systems of quons. I conclude by raising the question of possibleorigins of violations of statistics and of the level at which violations shouldbe expected if they exist.
