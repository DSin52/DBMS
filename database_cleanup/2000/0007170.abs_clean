psfig.sty. This is an expanded writeup of lectures given at ICTP, TASI, andFollowing is a collection of lecture notes on D-branes, which may be used bythe reader as preparation for applications to modern research applications suchand stringy non-commutative geometry, etc. In attempting to be reasonablyself-contained, the notes start from classical point-particles and develop thesubject logically (but selectively) through classical strings, quantisation,D-branes, supergravity, superstrings, string duality, including many detailedapplications. Selected focus topics feature D-branes as probes of bothspacetime and gauge geometry, highlighting the role of world-volume curvatureand gauge couplings, with some non-Abelian cases. Other advanced topics whichare discussed are the (presently) novel tools of research such as fractionalbranes, the enhancon mechanism, D(ielectric)-branes and the emergence of thefuzzy/non-commutative sphere.
