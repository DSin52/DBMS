We discuss thick domain walls interpolating between spaces with nakedsingularities and give arguments based on the $AdS$/CFT correspondence why suchsingularities may be physically meaningful. Our examples include thick domainwalls with Minkowski, de Sitter, and anti-de Sitter geometries on thefour-dimensional slice. For flat domain walls we can solve the equivalentquantum mechanics problem exactly, which provides the spectrum of gravitonstates. In one of the examples we discuss, the continuum states have a massgap. We compare the graviton spectra with expectations from the $AdS$/CFTcorrespondence and find qualitative agreement. We also discuss unitary boundaryconditions and show that they project out all continuum states.
