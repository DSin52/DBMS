We study some of the algebraic properties of the non-relativistic monopole.We find that we can construct theories that possess an exotic conservedfermionic charge that squares to the Casimir of the rotation group, yet do notpossess an ordinary supersymmetry. This is in contrast to previous knownexamples with such exotic fermionic charges. We proceed to show that thepresence of the exotic fermionic charge in the non-supersymmetric theory cannonetheless be understood using supersymmetric techniques, providing yetanother example of the usefulness of supersymmetry in understandingnon-supersymmetric theories.
