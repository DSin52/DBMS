We discuss how the fine-tuning of the cosmological constant enters braneworld setups. After presenting the Randall Sundrum model as a prototype case,we focus on single brane models with curvature singularities which areseparated from the brane in the additional dimension. Finally, the issue of theexistence of nearby curved solutions is addressed.
