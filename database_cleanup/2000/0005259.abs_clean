285,2001, Cambridge University PressWe review the concept of $\tau$-function for simple analytic curves. The$\tau$-function gives a formal solution to the 2D inverse potential problem andappears as the $\tau$-function of the integrable hierarchy which describesconformal maps of simply-connected domains bounded by analytic curves to theunit disk. The $\tau$-function also emerges in the context of topologicalgravity and enjoys an interpretation as a large $N$ limit of the normal matrixmodel.
