Orientable open string theories containing both bosons and fermions withoutthe GSO projection are expected to have the 10 dimensional N=2(A) space-timesupersymmetry in a spontaneously broken phase. We study the low-energy theoremfor the nonlinearly realized N=2 supersymmetry using the effective action foran unstable D9-brane. It is explicitly confirmed that the 4-fermion open stringamplitudes without the GSO projection obey the low-energy theorem derived fromthe nonlinear N=2 supersymmetry. An intimate connection between the existenceof the hidden supersymmetry and the open-open string (s-t) duality is pointedout.
