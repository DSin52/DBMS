network conference in Paris 1999, ref. addedWe describe a new class of supersymmetric orientifolds which combine theworld-sheet parity transformation with a complex conjugation in the compactdirections. As an example, we investigate in detail the orientifold of the Z_3toroidal orbifold in six and four dimensions. We demonstrate how the solutionto the tadpole cancellation conditions, the resulting gauge groups and themassless spectra depend on the choice of the complex structures on the tori,giving rise to a variety of inequivalent models. We also summarize the resultsfor the orientifolds of the Z_4, Z_6 and Z_6' orbifolds in four and sixdimensions.
