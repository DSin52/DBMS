Title: A Quantum field theory of dyons

Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX, talk given at the conference "Quantum aspects of

gauge theories, supersymmetry and unification", Paris, September 1999We construct a classical field theory action which upon quantization via thefunctional integral approach, gives rise to a consistent Dirac-stringindependent quantum field theory. The approach entails a systematic derivationof the correlators of all gauge invariant observables, and also of chargeddyonic fields. Manifest SO(2)-duality invariance and Lorentz invariance areensured by the PST-approach.
