A massless spinor field is quantized in the background of a singular staticmagnetic vortex in 2+1-dimensional space-time. The method of self-adjointextensions is employed to define the most general set of physically acceptableboundary conditions at the location of the vortex. Under these conditions, thevacuum energy density and effective potential in the vortex background aredetermined.
