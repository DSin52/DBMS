The spectral problem where the field satisfies Dirichlet conditions on onepart of the boundary of the relevant domain and Neumann on the remainder isdiscussed. It is shown that there does not exist a classical asymptoticexpansion for short time in terms of fractional powers of $t$ with locallycomputable coefficients.
