differential formsAuthors: N. Mankoc Borstnik (Univ. of Ljubljana, Jozef Stefan Institute), H. B.

Polynomials in Grassmann space can be used to describe all the internaldegrees of freedom of spinors, scalars and vectors, that is their spins andcharges. It was shown that K\"ahler spinors, which are polynomials ofdifferential forms, can be generalized to describe not only spins of spinorsbut also spins of vectors as well as spins and charges of scalars, vectors andspinors. If the space (ordinary and noncommutative) has 14 dimensions or more,the appropriate spontaneous break of symmetry leads gravity in $d$ dimensionsto manifest in four dimensional subspace as ordinary gravity and all neededgauge fields as well as the Yukawa couplings. Both approaches, the K\"ahler'sone (if generalized) and our, manifest four generations of massless fermions,which are left handed SU(2) doublets and right handed SU(2) singlets. In thistalk a possible way of spontaneously broken symmetries is pointed out on thelevel of canonical momentum.
