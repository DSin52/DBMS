We propose exact vacuum expectation values of local fields for a quantumgroup restriction of the $C_2^{(1)}$ affine Toda theory which corresponds totwo coupled minimal models. The central charge of the unperturbed models rangesfrom $c=1$ to $c=2$, where the perturbed models correspond to two magneticallycoupled Ising models and Heisenberg spin ladders, respectively. As anapplication, in the massive phase we deduce the leading term of the asymptoticsof the two-point correlation functions.
