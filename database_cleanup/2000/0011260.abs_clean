Title: Topological quantum field theories

Authors: Albert Schwarz

Following my plenary lecture on ICMP2000 I review my results concerning twoquantization of gauge theories. I start with old results (first examples oftopological quantum field theories were constructed in my papers in lateseventies) and I come to some new results, that were not published yet.
