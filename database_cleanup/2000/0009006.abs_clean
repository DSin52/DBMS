GroupAuthors: U. Ellwanger

Comments: 24 pages, 1 fig., based on a lecture at the LPT Orsay

The AdS/CFT correspondence is developed from classical solutions on AdS_5with two boundaries. The corresponding limits and the reduction of degrees offreedom are discussed, as well as the required renormalization on the fieldtheory side. The Hamiltonian first-order approach towards the solution ofcoupled gravitational/matter equations of motion is introduced, and the RGinterpretation is exposed. Finally we discuss a recent approach towards anaturally vanishing cosmological constant which is based on the AdS/RGcorrespondence.
