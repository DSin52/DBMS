137-142In the framework of a (2+1)-dimensional P-even massive Gross-Neveu model, anexternal magnetic field is shown to induce a parity breaking first order phasetransition. Possibility of applying the results obtained to description ofmagnetic phase transitions in high-temperature superconductors is discussed.
