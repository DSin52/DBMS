Physics", Kiev, 24-27.09.2000, to be published in Pro., Kluwer Acad. PressWe review shortly present status of quantum deformations of Poincar\'{e} andconformal supersymmetries. After recalling the $\kappa$-deformation of$\hbox{D=4}$ Poincar\'{e} supersymmetries we describe the corresponding starproduct multiplication for chiral superfields. In order to describe thedeformation of chiral vertices in momentum space the integration formula over$\kappa$-deformed chiral superspace is proposed.
