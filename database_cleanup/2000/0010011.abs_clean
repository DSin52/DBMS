Title: Antisymmetrised 2p-forms generalising curvature 2-forms II

p-hierarchy of Reissner-Nordstrom type metrics in dimensions d>2p+1Authors: A. Chakrabarti and D.H. Tchrakian

Comments: 7 pages, latex

The p-hierarchy of Schwarzschild type metrics obtained in a preceing paper isgeneralised here to a corresponding Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) type hierarchy inthe presence of a point charge q in d-dimensions. Certain special featuresarising, concerning the horizons and the interior region, are discussed.
