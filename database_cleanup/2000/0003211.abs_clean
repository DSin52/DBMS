T-duality realized on SuperD-brane effective actions probing in constant$G_{mn}$ and $b_{mn}$ backgrounds is studied from a pure world volume point ofview. It is proved that requiring {\em T-duality covariance} of such actions``fixes'' the T-duality transformations of the world volume dynamical fields,and consequently, of the NS-NS and R-R coupling superfields. The analysis isextended to uncover the mapping of the symmetry structure associated with theseSuperD-brane actions. In particular, we determine the T-duality transformationproperties of kappa symmetry and supersymmetry, which allow us to prove thatbosonic supersymmetric world volume solitons of the original theory generate,through T-duality, the expected ones in the T-dual theory. The latter proof isgeneralized to arbitrary bosonic backgrounds. We conclude with some comments onextensions of our approach to arbitrary kappa symmetric backgrounds, non-BPSD-branes and non-abelian SuperD-branes.
