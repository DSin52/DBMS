We investigate the SO(4,1) gauge-invariant theory of the Dirac fermions inthe external field of the Kaluza-Klein monopole, pointing out that the quantummodes can be recovered from a Klein-Gordon equation analogous to the Schr\"odinger equation in the Taub-NUT background. Moreover, we show that there is alarge collection of observables that can be directly derived from those of thescalar theory. These offer many possibilities of choosing complete sets ofcommuting operators which determine the quantum modes. In addition there aresome spin- like and Dirac-type operators involving the covariantly constantKilling-Yano tensors of the hyper-K\" ahler Taub-NUT space. The energyeigenspinors of the central modes in spherical coordinates are completelyevaluated in explicit, closed form.
