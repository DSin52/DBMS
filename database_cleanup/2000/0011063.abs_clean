We study a model for analyzing the effect of a principal violation of theLorentz-invariance on the structure of vacuum. The model is based on thedivergence theory developed by Salehi (1997). It is shown that the divergencetheory can be used to model an ensemble of particles. The ensemble ischaracterized by the condition that its members are basically at rest in therest frame of a preferred inertial observer in vacuum. In this way we find adirect dynamical interplay between a particle and its associated ensemble. Weshow that this effect can be understood in terms of the interaction of aparticle with a relativistic pilot wave through an associated quantumpotential.
