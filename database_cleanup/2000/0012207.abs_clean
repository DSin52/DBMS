Title: Response of an electron system to a periodic potential

Authors: S. Nagy, K. Sailer

Comments: 5 pages, 1 figure

We give a quantum field theoretical treatment of a one dimensional electronsystem with a fixed chemical potential $\mu$. The non-perturbative Lindhardresponse function is found for an electron system in a sinusoidal potential.
