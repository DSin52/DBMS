We analyze the large N supergravity descriptions of the class of type IIBmodels T-dual to elliptic type IIA brane configurations containing twoorientifold 6-planes and up to two NS 5-branes. The T-dual IIB configurationscontain N D3-branes in the background of an orientifold 7-plane and, in somemodels, a Z_2 orbifold and/or D7-branes, which give rise to four-dimensionalN=2 (or N=4) gauge theories with at most two factors. We identify the chiralprimary states of the supergravity theories, and match them to gauge invariantoperators of the corresponding superconformal theories using Maldacena'sduality.
