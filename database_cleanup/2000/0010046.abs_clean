Basics of some topics on perturbative and non-perturbative string theory arereviewed. After a mathematical survey of the Standard Model of particle physicsand GUTs, the bosonic string kinematics for the free case and with interactionis described. The effective action of the bosonic string and the spectrum isalso discussed. Five perturbative superstring theories and their spectra isbriefly outlined. Calabi-Yau three-fold compactifications of heterotic stringsand their relation to some four-dimensional physics are given. T-duality inclosed and open strings are surveyed. D-brane definition is provided and someof their properties and applications to brane boxes configurations, inparticular to the cube model are discussed. Finally, non-perturbative issueslike S-duality, M-theory, F-theory and basics of their non-perturbativeCalabi-Yau compactifications are considered.
