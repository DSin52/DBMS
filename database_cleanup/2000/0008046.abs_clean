I construct a map from the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves to$K$-homology. This results in explicit realizations of $K$-homology cyclesassociated with D-brane configurations. Non-Abelian degrees of freedom arise inthis framework from the deformation quantization of $N$-tuple cycles. The large$N$ limit of the gauge theory on D-branes wrapped on a subvariety $V$ of somevariety $X$ is geometrically interpreted as the deformation quantization of theformal completion of $X$ along $V.$
