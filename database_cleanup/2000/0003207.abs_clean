In this work an extension of the Gaussian model of the stochastic vacuum ispresented. It consists of including higher cumulants than just the second onein the cluster expansion in QCD. The influence of nonabelian fourth cumulantson the potential of a static quark-antiquarkpair is examined and the formationof flux tubes between a static $q\bar{q}$-pair is investigated. It is foundthat the fourth cumulants can contribute to chromomagnetic flux tubes.Furthermore the contribution of fourth cumulants to the total cross section ofsoft high energy hadron-hadron scattering is examined and it is found that thefourth cumulants do not change the general picture obtained in the Gaussianmodel.
