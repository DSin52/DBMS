We investigate D2-branes and D4-branes parallel to D8-branes. The low energyworld volume theory on the branes is non-supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory. Weidentify the fundamental strings as the anyons of the 2+1 Chern-Simons theoryand the D0-branes as solitons. The Chern-Simons theory with a boundary ismodeled using NS 5-branes with ending D6-branes. The brane set-up provides fora graphical description of anomaly inflow. We also model the 4+1 Chern-Simonstheory using branes and conjecture that D4-branes with a boundary describes asupersymmetric version of Kaplan's theory of chiral fermions.
