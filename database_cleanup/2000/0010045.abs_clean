We calculate the string loop corrections to the tachyon potential for stablenon-BPS Dp-branes on the orbifold T^4/Z_2. We find a non-trivial phasestructure and we show that, after tachyon condensation, the non-BPS Dp-branesare attracted to each other for p=0,1,2. We then identify the correspondingclosed string boundary states together with the massless long range fields theyexcite. For p=3,4 the string loop correction diverge. We identify the masslessclosed string fields responsible for these divergencies and regularise thepartition function using a Fischler-Susskind mechanism.
