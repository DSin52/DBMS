In most current models of inflation based on a weakly self-coupled scalarmatter field minimally coupled to gravity, the period of inflation lasts solong that, at the beginning of the inflationary period, the physicalwavelengths of comoving scales which correspond to the present large-scalestructure of the Universe were smaller than the Planck length. Thus, the usualcomputations of the spectrum of fluctuations in these models involveextrapolating low energy physics (both in the matter and gravitational sector)into regions where this physics is not applicable. In this paper we demonstratethat the usual predictions of inflation for the spectrum of cosmologicalfluctuations do indeed depend on the hidden assumptions about super-Planckscale physics. We introduce a class of modified dispersion relations to mimicpossible effects of super-Planck scale physics, and show that in some casesimportant deviations from the usual predictions of inflation are obtained. Someimplications of this result for the unification of fundamental physics andearly Universe cosmology are discussed.
