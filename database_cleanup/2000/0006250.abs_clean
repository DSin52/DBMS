Authors: Manoelito M de Souza

Comments: 18pages 1 eps figure, typos and other minor corrections

The physical meaning, the properties and the consequences of a discretescalar field are discussed; limits for a continuous mathematical description offundamental physics is a natural outcome of discrete fields with discreteinteractions. The discrete scalar field is ultimately the gravitational fieldof general relativity, necessarily, and there is no place for any otherfundamental scalar field, in this context.
