In this paper we present simplifying techniques which allow one to computethe quiver diagrams for various D-branes at (non-Abelian) orbifoldsingularities with and without discrete torsion. The main idea behind theconstruction is to take the orbifold of an orbifold. Many interesting discretegroups fit into an exact sequence $N\to G\to G/N$. As such, the orbifold $M/G$is easier to compute as $(M/N)/(G/N)$ and we present graphical rules whichallow fast computation given the $M/N$ quiver.
