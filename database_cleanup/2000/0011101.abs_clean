We study the Landau-Ginzburg (LG) mirror theory of the non-linear sigma modelon the ALE space ${\cal M}$ obtained by resolving the singularity of theorbifold ${\bf C}^2/{\bf Z}_N$. In the LG description, the data of the BPSspectrum and the lines of marginal stability are encoded in the specialLagrangian submanifolds of the mirror manifold $\hat{{\cal M}}$. Our LGdescription is quite simple as compared with the quiver gauge theory analysisnear the orbifold point. Furthermore our mirror analysis can be applied to anypoint on the moduli space of ${\cal M}$.
