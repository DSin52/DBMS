We show that a generalised reduction of D=10 IIB supergravity leads, in acertain limit, to a maximally extended SO(2) gauged supergravity in D=9. Weshow the scalar potential of this model allows both Minkowski and a new type ofdomain wall solution to the Bogomol'nyi equations. We relate these vacua totype IIB D-branes.
