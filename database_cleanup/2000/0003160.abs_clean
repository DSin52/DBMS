We find classically stable solitons (instantons) in odd (even) dimensionalscalar noncommutative field theories whose scalar potential, $V(\ph)$, has atleast two minima. These solutions are bubbles of the false vacuum whose size isset by the scale of noncommutativity. Our construction uses the correspondencebetween non-commutative fields and operators on a single particle Hilbertspace. In the case of noncommutative gauge theories we note that expandingaround a simple solution shifts away the kinetic term and results in a purelyquartic action with linearly realised gauge symmetries.
