Three dimensional SO(3) gauged Skyrme models characterised by specificpotentials imposing special asymptotic values on the chiral field areconsidered. These models are shown to support finite energy solutions withnonvanishing magnetic and electrix flux, whose energies are bounded from belowby two distinct charges - the magnetic (monopole) charge and a non-integerversion of the Baryon charge. Unit magnetic charge solutions are constructednumerically and their properties characterised by the chosen asymptotics andthe Skyrme coupling are studied. For a particular value of the chosenasymptotics, charge-2 axially symmetric solutions are also constructed and theattractive nature of the like-monopoles of this system are exhibited. As anindication towards the possible existence of large clumps of monopoles, someconsideration is given to axially symmetric monopoles of charges-2,3,4.
