Gravitation theories selected by requiring that they have a unique anti-deSitter vacuum with a fixed cosmological constant are studied. For a givendimension d, the Lagrangians under consideration are labeled by an integerk=1,2,...,[(d-1)/2]. Black holes for each d and k are found and are used torank these theories. A minimum possible size for a localized electricallycharged source is predicted in the whole set of theories, except GeneralIf d-2k=1, these solutions resemble the three dimensional black hole,otherwise, their behavior is similar to the Schwarzschild-AdS_4 geometry.
