We investigate new compactifications of OM theory giving rise to a 3+1dimensional open string theory with noncommutative $x^0$-$x^1$ and $x^2$-$x^3$coordinates. The theory can be directly obtained by starting with a D3 branewith parallel (near critical) electric and magnetic field components, in thepresence of a RR scalar field. The magnetic parameter permits to interpolatecontinuously between the $x^0$-$x^1$ noncommutative open string theory and the$x^2$-$x^3$ spatial noncommutative U(N) super Yang-Mills theory. We discuss$SL(2,Z)$ transformations of this theory. Using the supergravity description ofthe large $N$ limit, we also compute corrections to the quark-antiquark Coulombpotential arising in the NCOS theory.
