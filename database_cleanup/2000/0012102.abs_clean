We study the behavior of gravitational waves and their backreaction on thebackground in cosmological solutions of the five-dimensional Ho\v{r}ava-Wittentheory. As a dynamical background, we consider two cosmological solutions withspatially flat expanding FRW branes, called $(\uparrow)$- and$(\downarrow)$-solutions, in which the orbifold size increases and decreases intime, respectively. % For these background solutions, the wave equation for thetensor perturbation can be solved by the method of separation of variables, andthe mode functions are classified by a separation constant which can beregarded as a graviton mass. We show that the spatial behavior of the modefunctions are the same for both background solutions, but the temporal behavioris significantly different. We further show that for the $(\uparrow)$ solution,the background bulk geometry is unstable against the backreaction of theperturbation, while for the $(\downarrow)$ solution, the backreaction on thebulk geometry can be neglected. We also show that, in contrast to the effect tothe bulk geometry, the backreaction of the perturbation significantly altersthe intrinsic geometry of the brane for the $(\downarrow)$ solution.
