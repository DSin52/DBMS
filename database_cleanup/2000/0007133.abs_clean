correctedFour-dimensional N=2 gauge theories may be obtained from configurations ofD-branes in type IIA string theory. Unitary gauge theories with two-indexrepresentations, and orthogonal and symplectic gauge theories, are constructedfrom configurations containing orientifold planes. Models with two orientifoldplanes imply a compact dimension, and correspond to elliptic models. Liftingthese configurations to M-theory allows one to derive the Seiberg-Witten curvesfor these gauge theories. We describe how the Seiberg-Witten curves,necessarily of infinite order, are obtained for these elliptic models. Thesecurves are used to calculate the instanton expansion of the prepotential; weexplicitly find the one-instanton prepotential for all the elliptic modelsconsidered.
