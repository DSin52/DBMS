An approach is proposed enabling to effectively describe the behaviour of abosonic system. The approach uses the quantum group $GL_{p,q}(2)$ formalism. Ineffect, considering a bosonic Hamiltonian in terms of the $GL_{p,q}(2)$generators, it is shown that its thermodynamic properties are connected todeformation parameters $p$ and $q$. For instance, the average number ofparticles and the pressure have been computed. If $p$ is fixed to be the samevalue for $q$, our approach coincides perfectly with some results developedrecently in this subject. The ordinary results, of the present system, can befound when we take the limit $p=q=1$.
