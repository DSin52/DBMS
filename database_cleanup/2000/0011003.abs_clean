Authors: Karl Landsteiner

Comments: 12 pages, 3 figures, Talk given at NATO ARW "Non-Commutative

Structures in Mathematics and Physics", Kyiv, Ukraine, 24-27 Sep. 2000After a short introduction to the UV/IR mixing in non-commutative fieldtheories we review the properties of scalar quasi-particles in non-commutativesupersymmetric gauge theories at finite temperature. In particular we discussthe appearance of super-luminous wave propagation.
