Space-time non-commutative theories are non-local in time. We develop theHamiltonian formalism for non-local field theories in d space-time dimensionsby considering auxiliary d+1 dimensional field theories which are local withrespect to the evolution time. The Hamiltonian path integral quantization isconsidered and the Feynman rules in the Lagrangian formalism are derived. Thecase of non-commutative \phi^3 theory is considered as an example.
