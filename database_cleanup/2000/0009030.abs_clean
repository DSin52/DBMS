We show that the relation between D-branes and noncommutative tachyons leadsvery naturally to the relation between D-branes and K-theory. We also discusssome relations between D-branes and K-homology, provide a noncommutativegeneralization of the ABS construction, and give a simple physicalinterpretation of Bott periodicity. In addition, a framework for constructingNeveu-Schwarz fivebranes as noncommutative solitons is proposed.
