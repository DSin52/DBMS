We determine all D-branes in the non-tachyonic 0'B orientifold, examine theirworld-volume anomalies and study orbifold compactifications. We find that thespectrum of the D-branes contains chiral fermions in the symmetric,antisymmetric and fundamental representations of (unitary) gauge groups on thebranes. The cancellation of the world-volume anomalies requires Wess-Zuminoterms which we determine explicitly. We examine a non-tachyoniccompactification to 9D whose closed part interpolates between 0B and IIB andrevisit compactifications on orbifolds. The D3-brane allows to conjecture, viathe AdS/CFT correspondence, a supergravity dual to a non-supersymmetric andinfrared-free gauge theory. The D-string gives hints concerning the S-dual ofthe 0'B orientifold.
