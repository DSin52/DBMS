Closed bosonic string with different normal ordering constants $a \ne \bar a$for the right and the left moving sectors is considered. One immediateconsequence of this choice is absence of tachyon in the physical statespectrum. Selfconsistency of the resulting model in the "old covariantquantization" (OCQ) framework is studyed. The model is manifestly Poincareinvariant, it has non trivial massless sector and is ghost free for $D=26, ~a=1, ~\bar a=0$. A possibility to obtain the light-cone formulation for themodel is also discussed.
