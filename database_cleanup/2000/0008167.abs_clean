We study one-loop effective action of hypermultiplet theory coupled toexternal N=2 vector multiplet. We formulate this theory in N=1 superspace anddevelop a general approach to constructing derivative expansion of theeffective action based on an operator symbol technique adopted to N=1supersymmetric field models. The approach under consideration allows toinvestigate on a unique ground a general structure of effective action andobtain both N=2 superconformal invariant (non-holomorphic) corrections andanomaly (holomorphic) corrections. The leading low-energy contributions toeffective action are found in explicit form.
