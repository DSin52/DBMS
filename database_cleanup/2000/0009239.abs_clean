The quantization of the Brink-Schwarz-Casalbuoni superparticle is performedin an explicitly covariant way using the antibracket formalism. Since aninfinite number of ghost fields are required, within a suitable off-shelltwistor-like formalism, we are able to fix the gauge of each ghost sectorwithout modifying the physical content of the theory. The computation revealsthat the antibracket cohomology contains only the physical degrees of freedom.
