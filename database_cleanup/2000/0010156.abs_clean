We present solution generating techniques which permit to construct exactinhomogeneous and anisotropic cosmological solutions to a four-dimensional lowenergy limit of string theory containing non-minimally interactingelectromagnetic and dilaton fields. Some explicit homogeneous and inhomogeneouscosmological solutions are constructed. For example, inhomogeneous exactsolutions presenting Gowdy - type EMD universe are obtained. The asymptoticbehaviour of the solutions is investigated. The asymptotic form of the metricnear the initial singularity has a spatially varying Kasner form. The characterof the space-time singularities is discussed. The late evolution of thesolutions is described by a background homogeneous and anisotropic universefilled with weakly interacting gravitational, dilatonic and electromagneticwaves.
