Title: W Algebras from AdS/CFT Correspondence

Authors: S. Korden

Comments: 49 pages

We consider a system of D5/D1 branes in the supergravity backgroundAdS_3xS^3xX, where X is T^4 or K3. By investigating the structure of themissing states in the conformal description, we are able to extend the AdS/CFTcorrespondence to W algebras. As a test of this new formulation the results arecompared to Hilbert schemes and more general supergravity backgrounds asdeformations by D3-branes or six-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds.
