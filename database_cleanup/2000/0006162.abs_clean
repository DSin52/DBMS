We construct a fourth-order derivative CP(N) model in 1+1 dimensions byincorporating the topological charge density squared term into the Lagrangian.We quantize the theory by reformulating with auxiliary fields and thenperforming the path integral explicitly. We discuss the renormalizability inthe large N limit and relevance of the effective action with axion physics.
