By dimensional reduction of a massive supersymmetric B$\wedge $F theory, amanifestly N=1 supersymmetric completion of a massive antisymmetric tensorgauge theory is constructed in (2+1) dimensions. In the N=1-D=3 superspace, anew topological term is used to give mass for the Kalb-Ramond field. We haveintroduced a massive gauge invariant model using the Stuckelberg formalism andan abelian topologically massive theory for the Kalb-Ramond superfield. Anequivalence of both massive models is suggested. Further, a component fieldanalysis is performed, showing a second supersymmetry in the model.
