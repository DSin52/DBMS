In the very early Universe matter can be described as a conformal invariantultra-relativistic perfect fluid, which does not contribute, on classicallevel, to the evolution of the isotropic and homogeneous metric. However, inthis situation the vacuum effects of quantum matter fields become important.The vacuum effective action depends, essentially, on the particle content ofthe underlying gauge model. If we suppose that there is some desert in theparticle spectrum, just below the Planck mass, then the effect of conformaltrace anomaly is dominating at the corresponding energies. With some additionalconstraints on the gauge model (which favor extended or supersymmetric versionsof the Standard Model rather than the minimal one), one arrives at the stableinflation. In this article we report about the calculation of the gravitationalwaves in this model. The result for the perturbation spectrum is close to theone for the conventional inflaton model, and is in agreement with the existingCobe data.
