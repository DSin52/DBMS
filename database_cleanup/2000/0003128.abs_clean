A new local, covariant and nilpotent symmetry is shown to exist for theinteracting BRST invariant U(1) gauge theory in two dimensions of space-time.Under this new symmetry, it is the gauge-fixing term that remains invariant andthe corresponding transformations on the Dirac fields turn out to be theanalogue of chiral transformations. The extended BRST algebra is derived forthe generators of all the underlying symmetries, present in the theory. Thisalgebra turns out to be the analogue of the algebra obeyed by the de Rhamcohomology operators of differential geometry. Possible interpretations andimplications of this symmetry are pointed out in the context of BRST cohomologyand Hodge decomposition theorem.
