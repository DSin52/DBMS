Title: Generalized Fractional Supersymmetry associated to different species of

anyonsAuthors: Jamila Douari and Yassine Hassouni

Comments: 12 pages, 2 figures included

We consider multiple species of anyons characterized by different statisticalparameters. First, we redefine the anyonic algebra and then generalize thisdefinition by constructing the anyonic superalgebra. Finally, we use thesetools to generalize the fractional supersymmetry already discussed in the paper[J. Douari and Y. Hassouni, Fractional supersymmetry through generalizedanyonic algebra, hep-th/0007165, Preprint ICTP].
