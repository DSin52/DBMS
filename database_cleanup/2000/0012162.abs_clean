Title: Reduction of Coupling Parameters in Quantum Field Theories

Authors: Reinhard Oehme

Comments: 7 pages, latex, for the Encyclopedia of Supersymmetry, Kluwer

A concise survey is given of the general method of reduction in the number ofcoupling parameters. Theories with several independent couplings are related toa set of theories with a single coupling. The reduced theories may or may nothave particular symmetries. A few have asymptotic power series expansions,others contain non-integer powers and/or logarithmic factors. An example isgiven with two power series solutions, one with N = 2 Supersymmetry, and onewith no known symmetry. In a second example, the reduced Yukawa coupling of thesuperpotential in a dual magnetic supersymmetric gauge theory is uniquely givenby the square of the magnetic gauge coupling with a known factor.
