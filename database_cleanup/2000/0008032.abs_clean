Comments: 15 pages; to be published in the proceedings of Beyond the Desert

2002 (Oulu, Finland, June 2-7, 2002), edited by H. V. Klapdor-Kleingrothauset alAn action with unconventional supersymmetry was introduced in an earlierpaper. Here it is shown that this action leads to standard physics for fermionsand gauge bosons at low energy, but to testable extensions of standard physicsfor fermions at high energy and for fundamental bosons which have not yet beenobserved. For example, the Lorentz-violating equation of motion for thesebosons implies that they have spin 1/2.
