A pure Yang-Mills theory extended by addition of a quartic term is consideredin order to study the transition from the quantum tunneling regime to that ofclassical, i.e. thermal, behaviour. The periodic field configurations arefound, which interpolate between the vacuum and sphaleron field configurations.It is shown by explicit calculation that only smooth second order transitionsoccur for all permissible values of the parameter $\L$ introduced with thequartic term. The theory is one of the rare cases which can be handledanalytically.
