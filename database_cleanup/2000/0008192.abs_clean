In this paper we study brane-world scenarios with a bulk scalar field, usinga covariant formalism to obtain a 4D Einstein equation via projection onto thebrane. We discuss, in detail, the effects of the bulk on the brane and how thescalar field contribute to the gravitational effects. We also discuss choice ofconformal frame and show that the frame selected by the induced metric providesa natural choice. We demonstrate our formalism by applying it to cosmologicalscenarios of Randall-Sundrum and Horava-Witten type models. Finally we considerthe cosmology of models where the scalar field couples non-minimally to thematter on the brane. This gives rise to a novel scenario where the universeexpands from a finite scale factor with an initial period of acceleratedexpansion, thus avoiding the singularity and flatness problem of the standardbig bang model.
