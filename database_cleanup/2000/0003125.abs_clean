We show that a previous paper of Freund describing a solution to theSeiberg-Witten equations has a sign error rendering it a solution to a relatedbut different set of equations. The non-$L^2$ nature of Freund's solution isdiscussed and clarified and we also construct a whole class of solutions to theSeiberg-Witten equations.
