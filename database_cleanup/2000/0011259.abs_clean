Title: Non-Anticommutative Quantum Gravity

Authors: J. W. Moffat

Comments: 9 pages LaTex. No figures. Revised text. Conclusions remain the same

A calculation of the one loop gravitational self-energy graph innon-anticommutative quantum gravity reveals that graviton loops are damped byinternal momentum dependent factors in the modified propagator and the vertexfunctions. The non-anticommutative quantum gravity perturbation theory isfinite for matter-free gravity and for matter interactions.
