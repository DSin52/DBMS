We observe that the main feature of the Randall-Sundrum model, used to solvethe hierarchy problem, is already present in a class of Yang-Mills plus gravitytheories inspired by noncommutative geometry. Strikingly the same expressionfor the Higgs potential is found in two models which have no apparentconnection. Some speculations concerning the possible relationships are given.
