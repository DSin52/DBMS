In string theory, the consequences of replacing the measure of integration$\sqrt{-\gamma}d^2 x$ in the Polyakov's action by $\Phi d^2 x$ where $\Phi$ isa density built out of degrees of freedom independent of the metric$\gamma_{ab}$ defined in the string are studied. The string tension appears asan integration constant of the equations of motion. The string tension canchange in different parts of the string due to the coupling of gauge fields andpoint particles living in the string. The generalization to higher dimensionalextended objects is also studied. In this case there is no need of a fine tunedcosmological term, in sharp contrast to the standard formulation of thegeneralized Polyakov action for higher dimensional branes.
