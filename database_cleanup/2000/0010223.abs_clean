We study the topological zero mode sector of type II strings on a K\"ahlermanifold $X$ in the presence of boundaries. We construct two finite bases, in asense bosonic and fermionic, that generate the topological sector of theHilbert space with boundaries. The fermionic basis localizes on compactsubmanifolds in $X$. A variation of the FI terms interpolates between thedescription of these ground states in terms of the ring of chiral fields at theboundary at small volume and helices of exceptional sheaves at large volume,respectively. The identification of the bosonic/fermionic basis with the dualbases for the non-compact/compact K-theory group on $X$ gives a naturalexplanation of the McKay correspondence in terms of a linear sigma model andsuggests a simple generalization of McKay to singular resolutions. Theconstruction provides also a very effective way to describe D-brane states ongeneric, compact Calabi--Yau manifolds and allows to recover detailedinformation on the moduli space, such as monodromies and analytic continuationmatrices, from the group theoretical data of a simple orbifold.
