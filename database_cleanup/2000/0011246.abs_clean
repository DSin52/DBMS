We analyze previously proposed order parameters for the confinement -deconfinement transition in lattice SU(2) Yang-Mills theory, defined as vacuumexpectation value (v.e.v.) of monopole fields in abelian projection gauges. Weshow that they exhibit some inconsistency in the treatment of small scales, dueto a violation of Dirac quantization condition for fluxes. We propose a neworder parameter avoiding this inconsistency. It can be interpreted as v.e.v. ofthe field of a regular monopole in any abelian projection gauge, but it isindependent of the choice of the abelian projection. Furthermore, beingconstructed in terms of surfaces of center vortices, it has also a naturalinterpretation in the approach of center dominance.
