We examine the curvature expansion of a the field equations of afour-dimensional higher spin gauge theory extension of anti-de Sitter gravity.The theory contains massless particles of spin 0,2,4,... that arise in thesymmetric product of two spin 0 singletons. We cast the curvature expansioninto manifestly covariant form and elucidate the structure of the equations andobserve a significant simplification.
