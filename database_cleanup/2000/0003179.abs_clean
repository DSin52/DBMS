We argue that the second-order gauge-invariant Schwinger-Dyson operator of agauge theory is the Wheeler-DeWitt operator in the dual string theory. Usingthis identification, we construct a set of operators in the gauge theory thatcorrespond to excitations of gravity in the bulk. We show that these gaugetheory operators have the expected properties for describing the semiclassicallocal gravity theory.
