The dynamics of a thin spherically symmetric shell of zero-rest-mass matterin its own gravitational field is studied. A form of action principle is usedthat enables the reformulation of the dynamics as motion on a fixed backgroundmanifold. A self-adjoint extension of the Hamiltonian is obtained via the groupquantization method. Operators of position and of direction of motion areconstructed. The shell is shown to avoid the singularity, to bounce and tore-expand to that asymptotic region from which it contracted; the dynamics is,therefore, truly unitary. If a wave packet is sufficiently narrow and/orenergetic then an essential part of it can be concentrated under itsSchwarzschild radius near the bounce point but no black hole forms. The quantumSchwarzschild horizon is a linear combination of a black and white holeapparent horizons rather than an event horizon.
