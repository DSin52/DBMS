This survey intends to cover recent approaches to black hole entropy whichattempt to go beyond the standard semiclassical perspective. Quantumcorrections to the semiclassical Bekenstein-Hawking area law for black holeentropy, obtained within the quantum geometry framework, are treated in somedetail. Their ramification for the holographic entropy bound for boundedstationary spacetimes is discussed. Four dimensional supersymmetric extremalblack holes in string-based N=2 supergravity are also discussed, albeit morebriefly.
