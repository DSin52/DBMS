The model of nonrelativistic particles coupled to nonstandard (2+1)-gravity[1] is extended to include Abelian or non-Abelian charges coupled toChern-Simons gauge fields. Equivalently, the model may be viewed as describingthe (Abelian or non-Abelian) anyonic dynamics of Chern-Simons particlescoupled, in a reparametrization invariant way, to a translational Chern-Simonsaction. The quantum two-body problem is described by a nonstandardSchr\"{o}dinger equation with a noninteger angular momentum depending on energyas well as particle charges. Some numerical results describing the modificationof the energy levels by these charges in the confined regime are presented. Themodification involves a shift as well as splitting of the levels.
