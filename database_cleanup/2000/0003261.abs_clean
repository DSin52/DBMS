We show that the complete superalgebra of symmetries, including centralcharges, that underlies F-theories, M-theories and type II string theories indimensions 12, 11 and 10 of various signatures correspond to rewriting of thesame OSp(1|32) algebra in different covariant ways. One only has to distinguishthe complex and the unique real algebra. We develop a common framework todiscuss all signatures theories by starting from the complex form of OSp(1|32).Theories are distinguished by the choice of basis for this algebra. Weformulate dimensional reductions and dualities as changes of basis of thealgebra. A second ingredient is the choice of a real form corresponding to aspecific signature. The existence of the real form of the algebra selectspreferred spacetime signatures. In particular, we show how the real d=10 IIAand IIB superalgebras for various signatures are related by generalizedT-duality transformations that not only involve spacelike but also timelikedirections. A third essential ingredient is that the translation generator inone theory plays the role of a central charge operator in the other theory. Theidentification of the translation generator in these algebras leads to the staralgebras of Hull, which are characterized by the fact that the positivedefinite energy operator is not part of the translation generators. We applyour results to discuss different T-dual pictures of the D-instanton solution ofEuclidean IIB supergravity.
