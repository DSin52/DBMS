Nacional de Fisica de Particulas e Campos", October 2000, Sao Lourenco,BrazilThe low-energy electron-electron scattering potential is derived anddiscussed for the Maxwell-Chern-Simons model coupled to QED_3 with spontaneoussymmetry breaking. One shows that the Higgs mechanism might favourelectron-electron bound states.
