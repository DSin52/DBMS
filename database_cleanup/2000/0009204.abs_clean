The one-loop vacuum polarization tensor is computed in QED with an externalconstant, homogeneous magnetic field at finite temperature. The Schwingerproper-time formalism is used and the computations are done in Euclidian space.The well-known results are recovered when the temperature and/or the magneticfield are switched off and the effect of the magnetic field on the Debyescreening is discussed.
