We discuss the geometry and topology of the complete, non-compact, Ricci-flatStenzel metric, on the tangent bundle of S^{n+1}. We obtain explicit resultsfor all the metrics, and show how they can be obtained from first-orderequations derivable from a superpotential. We then provide an explicitconstruction for the harmonic self-dual (p,q)-forms in the middle dimensionp+q=(n+1) for the Stenzel metrics in 2(n+1) dimensions. Only the (p,p)-formsare L^2-normalisable, while for (p,q)-forms the degree of divergence grows with|p-q|. We also construct a set of Ricci-flat metrics whose level surfaces areU(1) bundles over a product of N Einstein-Kahler manifolds, and we constructexamples of harmonic forms there. As an application, we construct new examplesof deformed supersymmetric non-singular M2-branes with such 8-dimensionaltransverse Ricci-flat spaces. We show explicitly that the fractional D3-braneson the 6-dimensional Stenzel metric found by Klebanov and Strassler issupported by a pure (2,1)-form, and thus it is supersymmetric, while theexample of Pando Zayas-Tseytlin is supported by a mixture of (1,2) and (2,1)forms. We comment on the implications for the corresponding dual field theoriesof our resolved brane solutions.
