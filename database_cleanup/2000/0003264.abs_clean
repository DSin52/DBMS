Every classical sigma-model with target space a compact symmetric space $G/H$(with $G$ classical) is shown to possess infinitely many local, commuting,conserved charges which can be written in closed form. The spins of thesecharges run over a characteristic set of values, playing the role of exponentsof $G/H$, and repeating modulo an integer $h$ which plays the role of a Coxeternumber.
