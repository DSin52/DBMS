We calculate the Faddeev-Popov operator corresponding to the maximallyAbelian gauge for gauge group SU(N). Specializing to SU(2) we look for explicitzero modes of this operator. Within an illuminating toy model (Yang-Millsmechanics) the problem can be completely solved and understood. In the fieldtheory case we are able to find an analytic expression for a normalizable zeromode in the background of a single `t Hooft instanton. Accordingly, such aninstanton corresponds to a horizon configuration in the maximally Abeliangauge. Possible physical implications are discussed.
