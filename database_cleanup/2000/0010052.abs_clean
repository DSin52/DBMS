The quantization of the complex linear superfield requires an infinite towerof ghosts. Using the Batalin-Vilkovisky technique, Grisaru, Van Proeyen, andZanon have been able to define a correct procedure to construct a gauge-fixedaction. We generalize their technique by introducing the Lagrange multipliersinto the non-minimal sector and we study the characteristic BRST cohomology. Weshow how the physical subspace is singled out. Finally, we quantize the modelin the presence of a background and of a quantum gauge superfield.
