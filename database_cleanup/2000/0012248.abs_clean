We discuss some issues about the holographic interpretation of the compactRandall-Sundrum model, which is conjectured to be dual to a 4d field theorywith non-linearly realized conformal symmetry. We make several checks of thisconjecture. In particular, we show that the radion couples conformally to abackground 4d metric. We also discuss the interpretation of the Goldberger-Wisemechanism for stabilizing the radion. We consider situations where theelectroweak breaking stabilizes the radion and we discuss the issue of naturalconservation of flavor quantum numbers.
