In string theory various projections have to be imposed to ensuresupersymmetry. We study the consequences of these projections in the presenceof world sheet boundaries. A-type boundary conditions come in several classes;only boundary fields that do not change the class preserve supersymmetry. Ouranalysis takes in particular properly into account the resolution of fixedpoints under the projections. Thus e.g. the compositeness of some previouslyconsidered boundary states of Gepner models follows from chiral properties ofthe projections. Our arguments are model independent; in particular,integrality of all annulus coefficients is ensured by model independentarguments.
