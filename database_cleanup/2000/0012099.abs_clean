Chiral conformal blocks in a rational conformal field theory are a far goingextension of Gauss hypergeometric functions. The associated monodromyrepresentations of Artin's braid group capture the essence of the modern viewon the subject, which originates in ideas of Riemann and Schwarz. Physically,such monodromy representations correspond to a new type of braid groupstatistics, which may manifest itself in two-dimensional critical phenomena,e.g. in some exotic quantum Hall states. The associated primary fields satisfyR-matrix exchange relations. The description of the internal symmetry of suchfields requires an extension of the concept of a group, thus giving room toquantum groups and their generalizations. We review the appearance of braidgroup representations in the space of solutions of the Knizhnik - Zamolodchikovequation, with an emphasis on the role of a regular basis of solutions whichallows us to treat the case of indecomposable representations as well.
