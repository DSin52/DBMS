Bosonic sector of d5 gauged supergravity with specific parametrization offull scalar coset is considered (multi-dilaton gravity). Using holographic RGin the form suggested by de Boer-Verlinde-Verlinde the holographic d4 conformalanomaly (in the sector of curvature invariants) is found when bulk potential isnot constant. Its comparison with the earlier calculation done in the schemewhere expansion of metric and dilaton over radial coordinate of AdS space isused demonstrates scheme dependence of holographic conformal anomaly. InAdS/CFT correspondence where dilatons play role of coupling constants itcoincides with multi-loop conformal anomaly which depends on regularizationscheme in interacting dual QFT. Hence, scheme dependence of holographicconformal anomaly is consistent with dual QFT expectations.
