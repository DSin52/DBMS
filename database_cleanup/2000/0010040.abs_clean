We give a representation of the volume preserving diffeomorphism of $\bR^p$in terms of the noncommutative (p-2)-branes whose kinetic term is described bythe Hopf term. In the static gauge, the (p-2)-brane can be described by thefree fields and it suggests that the quantization of the algebra is possible.
