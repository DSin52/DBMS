We study theories generated by orbifolding the {\cal N}=4 super conformalU(N) Yang Mills theory with finite N, focusing on the r\^ole of the remnantU(1) gauge symmetries of the orbifold process. It is well known that the oneloop beta functions of the non abelian SU(N) gauge couplings vanish in thesetheories. It is also known that in the large N limit the beta functions vanishto all order in perturbation theory. We show that the beta functions of the nonabelian SU(N) gauge couplings vanish to two and three loop order even forfinite N. This is the result of taking the abelian U(1) of U(N)=SU(N)xU(1) intoaccount. However, the abelian U(1) gauge couplings have a non vanishing betafunction. Hence, those theories are not conformal for finite N. We analyze therenormalization group flow of the orbifold theories, discuss the suppression ofthe cosmological constant and tackle the hierarchy problem in the nonsupersymmetric models.
