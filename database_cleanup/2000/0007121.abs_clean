The Casimir energy for scalar field of two parallel conductor in twodimensional domain wall background, with Dirichlet boundary conditions, iscalculated by making use of general properties of renormalized stress tensor.Weshow that vacuum expectation values of stress tensor contain two terms whichcome from the boundary conditions and the gravitational background. In twodimensions the minimal coupling reduces to the conformal coupling and stresstensor can be obtained by the local and non-local contribution of the anomaloustrace. This work shows that there exists a subtle relation between Casimireffect and trace anomaly in curved space time.
