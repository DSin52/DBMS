We study the spatial structure of 1/4 BPS solitons in 4 dimensional N=4 gaugetheory. A weak binding approximation is used where the soliton is made ofseveral "ingredient" particles. Some spatial moduli are described which are notaccounted for in the (p,q) web picture. These moduli are counted and theireffect on the solutions is demonstrated. The potential for off BPSconfigurations is estimated by a simple expression and is found to agree withprevious expressions. We discuss the fermionic zero modes of the solitons, andfind agreement with web predictions.
