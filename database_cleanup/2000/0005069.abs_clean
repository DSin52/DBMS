The linear $\delta$ expansion is used to obtain corrections up toO$(\delta^2)$ to the self-energy for a complex scalar field theory with a$\lambda (\phi^{\star}\phi)^2$ interaction at high temperature and non-zerocharge density. The calculation is done in the imaginary-time formalism via theHamiltonian form of the path integral. Nonperturbative results are generated bya systematic order by order variational procedure and the dependence of thecritical temperature on the chemical potential $\mu$ is obtained.
