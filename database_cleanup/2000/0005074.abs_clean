In view of the recent interest in formulating a quantum theory ofRamond-Ramond p-forms, we exhibit an SL(10,Z) invariant partition function forthe chiral four-form of Type IIB string theory on the ten-torus. We follow thestrategy used to derive a modular invariant partition function for the chiraltwo-form of the M-theory fivebrane. We also generalize the calculation toself-dual quantum fields in spacetime dimension 2p=2+4k, and display theSL(2p,Z) automorphic forms for odd p>1. We relate our explicit calculation to acomputation of the B-cycle periods, which are discussed in the work of Witten.
