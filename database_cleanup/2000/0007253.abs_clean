The purpose of the present paper is twofold. In the first part, we provide analgebraic characterization of several families of $\nu= \frac{1}{2^n}$ $n\leq5$ BPS states in M theory, at threshold and non-threshold, by an analysis ofthe BPS bound derived from the ${\cal N}=1$ D=11 SuperPoincar\'e algebra. Wedetermine their BPS masses and their supersymmetry projection conditions,explicitly. In the second part, we develop an algebraic formulation to studythe way BPS states transform under $GL(32,\bR)$ transformations, the group ofautomorphisms of the corresponding SuperPoincar\'e algebra. We prove that all$\nu={1/2}$ non-threshold bound states are SO(32) related with $\nu={1/2}$ BPSstates at threshold having the same mass. We provide further examples of thisphenomena for less supersymmetric $\nu={1/4},{1/8}$ non-threshold bound states.
