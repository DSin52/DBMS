Title: Bound States of a Minimally Interacting Spin-0 and Spin-1/2 Constituent

in the Instantaneous ApproximationComments: 29 pages, LaTeX, 7 Postscript figures

Bound-state solutions are obtained numerically in the instantaneousapproximation for a spin-0 and spin-1/2 constituent that interact via minimalelectrodynamics. To solve the integral equations in momentum space, a method isdeveloped for integrating over the logarithmic singularity in kernels, makingit possible to use basis functions that essentially automatically satisfy theboundary conditions. For bound-state solutions that decrease rapidly at smalland large values of momentum, accurate solutions are obtained withsignificantly fewer basis functions when the solution is expanded in terms ofthese more general basis functions. The presence of a derivative coupling insingle-photon exchange complicates the construction of the Bethe-Salpeterequation in the instantaneous approximation and, in the nonrelativistic limit,gives rise to an additional electrostatic potential term that is second orderin the coupling constant and decreases as the square of the distance betweenconstituents.
