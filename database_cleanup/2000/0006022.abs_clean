We discuss the properties of matter in a D-dimensional anti-de-Sitter-typespace time induced dynamically by the recoil of a very heavyD(irichlet)-particle defect embedded in it. The particular form of the recoilgeometry, which from a world-sheet view point follows from logarithmicconformal field theory deformations of the pertinent sigma-models, results inthe presence of both infrared and ultraviolet (spatial) cut-offs. These arecrucial in ensuring the presence of mass gaps in scalar matter propagating inthe D-particle recoil space time. The analogy of this problem with theLiouville-string approach to QCD, suggested earlier by John Ellis and one ofthe present authors, prompts us to identify the resulting scalar masses withthose obtained in the supergravity approach based on the Maldacena'sconjecture, but without the imposition of any supersymmetry in our case. Withinreasonable numerical uncertainties, we observe that agreement is obtainedbetween the two approaches for a particular value of the ratio of the twocut-offs of the recoil geometry. Notably, our approach does not suffer from theambiguities of the supergravity approach as regards the validity of thecomparison of the glueball masses computed there with those obtained in thecontinuum limit of lattice gauge theories.
