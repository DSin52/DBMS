We generalise recent results on Hopf instantons in a Chern--Simons andFermion theory in a fixed background magnetic field. We find that theseinstanton solutions have to obey the Liouville equation in target space. As aconsequence, these solutions are given by a class of Hopf maps that consist ofthe composition of the standard Hopf map with an arbitrary rational map.
