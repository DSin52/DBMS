We make a detailed investigation of all spaces Q_{n_1... n_N}^{q_1... q_N} ofthe form of U(1) bundles over arbitrary products \prod_i CP^{n_i} of complexprojective spaces, with arbitrary winding numbers q_i over each factor in thebase. Special cases, including Q_{11}^{11} (sometimes known as T^{11}),Q_{111}^{111} and Q_{21}^{32}, are relevant for compactifications of type IIBand D=11 supergravity. Remarkable ``conspiracies'' allow consistentKaluza-Klein S^5, S^4 and S^7 sphere reductions of these theories that retainall the Yang-Mills fields of the isometry group in a massless truncation. Weprove that such conspiracies do not occur for the reductions on the Q_{n_1...n_N}^{q_1... q_N} spaces, and that it is inconsistent to make a masslesstruncation in which the non-abelian SU(n_i+1) factors in their isometry groupsare retained. In the course of proving this we derive many properties of thespaces Q_{n_1... n_N}^{q_1... q_N} of more general utility. In particular, weshow that they always admit Einstein metrics, and that the spaces whereq_i=(n_i+1)/\ell all admit two Killing spinors. We also obtain an iterativeconstruction for real metrics on CP^n, and construct the Killing vectors onQ_{n_1... n_N}^{q_1... q_N} in terms of scalar eigenfunctions on CP^{n_i}. Wederive bounds that allow us to prove that certain Killing-vector identities onspheres, necessary for consistent Kaluza-Klein reductions, are never satisfiedon Q_{n_1... n_N}^{q_1... q_N}.
