Title: Black Holes and U-duality in Diverse Dimensions

Authors: M. A. Lled\'o

Comments: Talk given at the TMR'99 meeting "Quantum aspects of gauge theories,

supersymmetry and unification. Paris, September 1999. Uses JHEP.clsIn this paper we review some properties of BPS black holes of supergravitieswith n=32,16 supersymmetries. The BPS condition, a condition on the eigenvaluesof the central charge matrix, can be shown to be U-duality invariant. Weexplicitly work out D=4, N=8 and D=5, N=4 supergravities.
