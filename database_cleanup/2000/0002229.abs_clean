We show how to map the Belavin-Polyakov instantons of the O(3)-nonlinear$\sigma-$model to a dual theory where they then appear as nontopologicalsolitons. They are stationary points of the Euclidean action in the dualtheory, and moreover, the dual action and the O(3)-nonlinear $\sigma-$modelaction agree on shell.
