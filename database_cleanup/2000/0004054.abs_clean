Comments: 17 pages, LaTeX, no figures

The energy radiated during the scattering of SU(3) monopoles is estimated asa function of their asymptotic velocity v. In a typical scattering process thetotal energy radiated is of order v^3 as opposed to v^5 for SU(2) monopoles.For charge (1,1) monopoles the dipole radiation produced is estimated for allgeodesics on the moduli space. For charge (2,1) monopoles the dipole radiationis estimated for the axially symmetric geodesic. The power radiated appears todiverge in the massless limit. The implications of this for the case ofnon-Abelian unbroken symmetry are discussed.
