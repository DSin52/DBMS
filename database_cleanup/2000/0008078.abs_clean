Polyakov's spin factor enters as a weight in the path-integral description ofparticle-like modes propagating in Euclidean space-times, accounting forparticle spin. The Fock-Feynman-Schwinger path integral applied to QCDaccomodates Polyakov's spin factor in a natural manner while, at the same time,it identifies Wilson line (loop) operators as sole agents of interactiondynamics among matter and gauge field quanta. A direct application of such aseparation between spin content and dynamics is the emergence of masterexpressions for the perturbative series involving either open or closedfermionic lines which provide new, comprehensive approaches to perturbativeQCD.
