A new family of non critical bosonic string backgrounds in arbitrary spacetime dimension $D$ and with $ISO(1,D-2)$ Poincar\'e invariance are presented.The metric warping factor and dilaton agree asymptotically with the lineardilaton background. The closed string tachyon equation of motion enjoys, in thelinear approximation, an exact solution of ``kink'' type interpolating betweendifferent expectation values. A renormalization group flow interpretation,based on a closed string tachyon potential of type $-T^{2}e^{-T}$, issuggested.
