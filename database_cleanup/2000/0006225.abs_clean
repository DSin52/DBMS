We study the compactification of OM-theory on tori and show a simpleheuristic derivation of the $S$-duals of noncommutative open string theory indiverse dimensions from the OM-theoretical point of view. In particular, weidentify the $S$-duality between noncommutative open string theory andnoncommutative Yang-Mills theory in $(3+1)$ dimensions as the exchange of twocircles of a torus on which OM-theory is compactified. Also, we briefly discuss$T$-duality between noncommutative open string theories.
