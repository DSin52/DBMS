We obtain the M5-M2-MW bound state solutions of 11-dimensional supergravitycorresponding to the 1/2 supersymmetric vacua of the M5-brane equations withconstant background fields. In the `near-horizon' case the solutioninterpolates between the $adS_7\times S^4$ Kaluza-Klein vacuum and D=11Minkowski spacetime via a Domain Wall spacetime. We discuss implications forrenormalization group flow of (2,0) D=6 field theories.
