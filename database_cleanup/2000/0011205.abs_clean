We construct an exact regular vortex solution to the self-dual equations ofthe Abelian Higgs model in non-commutative space for arbitrary values of$\theta$. To this end, we propose an ansatz which is the analogous, in Fockspace, to the one leading to exact solutions for the Nielsen-Olesen vortex incommutative space. We compute the flux and energy of the solution and discussits relevant properties.
