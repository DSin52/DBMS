We study the O(N) $\phi^4$ model compactified on $M^{D-1}\otimes S^1$, whichallows to impose twisted boundary conditions for the $S^1$-direction. The O(N)symmetry can be broken to $H$ explicitly by the boundary conditions and furtherbroken to $I$ spontaneously by vacuum expectation values of the fields. Thesymmetries $H$ and $I$ are completely classified and the model turns out tohave unexpectedly a rich phase structure. The unbroken symmetry $I$ is shown todepend on not only the boundary conditions but also the radius of $S^1$, andthe symmetry breaking patterns are found to be unconventional. The spontaneousbreakdown of the translational invariance is also discussed.
