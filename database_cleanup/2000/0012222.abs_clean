We propose a form of the effective action of the tachyon and gauge fields forbrane-antibrane systems and non-BPS Dp-branes, written in terms of thesupercurvature. Kink and vortex solutions with constant infinite gauge fieldstrength reproduce the exact tensions of the lower-dimensional D-branes. Wediscuss the relation to BSFT and other models in the literature.
