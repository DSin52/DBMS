We show that it is possible to construct a consistent model describing acurrent-carrying cosmic string endowed with torsion. The torsion contributionto the gravitational force and geodesics of a test-particle moving around theSCCS are analyzed. In particular, we point out two interesting astrophysicalphenomena in which the higher magnitude force we derived may play a criticalof matter onto it. The deficit angle associated to the SCCS can be obtained andcompared with data from the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite. Wealso derived a value for the torsion contribution to matter densityfluctuations in the early Universe.
