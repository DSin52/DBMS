We study marginal and relevant supersymmetric deformations of the N=4super-Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. Our primary innovation is theinterpretation of the moduli spaces of vacua of these theories asnon-commutative spaces. The construction of these spaces relies on therepresentation theory of the related quantum algebras, which are obtained fromF-term constraints. These field theories are dual to superstring theoriespropagating on deformations of the AdS_5xS^5 geometry. We study D-branespropagating in these vacua and introduce the appropriate notion of algebraicgeometry for non-commutative spaces. The resulting moduli spaces of D-braneshave several novel features. In particular, they may be interpreted assymmetric products of non-commutative spaces. We show how mirror symmetrybetween these deformed geometries and orbifold theories follows from T-duality.Many features of the dual closed string theory may be identified within thenon-commutative algebra. In particular, we make progress towards understandingthe K-theory necessary for backgrounds where the Neveu-Schwarz antisymmetrictensor of the string is turned on, and we shed light on some aspects ofdiscrete anomalies based on the non-commutative geometry.
