We discuss the Randall-Sundrum (RS) choice for $h_{MN}$ in the brane-world.We begin with the de Donder gauge (transverse-tracefree) includingscalar($h_{55}$), vector($h_{5\mu}$) and tensor($h_{\mu\nu}$) in fivedimensions for comparison. One finds that $h_{55}=0$ and $h_{5\mu}=0$. Thisleads to the RS choice. It appears that the RS choice is so restrictive for thefive massless states, whereas it is unique for describing the massive states.Furthermore, one can establish the stability of the RS solution with the RSchoice only.
