We consider a geometric zero-radius limit for strings on $AdS_5\times S^5$,where the anti-de Sitter hyperboloid becomes the projective lightcone. In thislimit the fifth dimension becomes nondynamical, yielding a different"holographic" interpretation than the usual "bulk to boundary" one. Whenquantized on the random lattice, the fifth coordinate acts as a new kind ofSchwinger parameter, producing Feynman rules with normal propagators at theis obtained. In the superstring case we obtain new, manifestly ${\cal N}=4$supersymmetric rules for ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills. These gluons are also"partons" that make up the usual "hadrons" of the open and closed strings inthe familiar QCD string picture. Thus, their coupling $g_{YM}$ and rank $N$ ofthe "color" gauge group are different from those of the "flavor" gauge group ofthe open string. As a result we obtain different perturbation expansions inradius, coupling, and 1/N.
