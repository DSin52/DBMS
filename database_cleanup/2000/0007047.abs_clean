journal, in particular not to Nucl.Phys.BFor Connes' spectral triples, the group of automorphisms lifted to theHilbert space is defined and used to fluctuate the metric. A few commutativeexamples are presented including Chamseddine and Connes' spectral unificationfull standard model. Here the lifted automorphisms explain O'Raifeartaigh'sreduction $SU(2)\times U(3)/\zz_2.$
