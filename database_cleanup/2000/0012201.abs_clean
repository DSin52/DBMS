Title: How much can supergravity teach us about microscopic features of BPS

black holes?Authors: M. Bertolini and M. Trigiante

Comments: 17 pages, latex. To appear in the proceedings of the IX Marcel

Grossman Meeting (Rome, July 2000), the TMR conference "IntegrabilityNonperturbative Effects And Symmetry In Quantum Field Theory" (Paris,September 2000) and the RTN conference ``The Quantum Structure of Spacetimeand the Geometric Nature of Fundamental Interactions'' (Berlin, October 2000)We review recent results in the study of regular four dimensional BPS blackholes in toroidally compactified type II (or M) theory. We discuss thegenerating solution for this kind of black holes, its microscopicdescription(s), and compute the corresponding microscopic entropy. Theseachievements, which provide a description of the fundamental degrees of freedomaccounting for the entropy of any regular BPS black hole in the theory underconsideration, are inscribed within a research project aimed to the study ofthe microscopic properties of this kind of solutions in relation to U--dualityinvariants computed on the corresponding macroscopic (supergravity)description.
