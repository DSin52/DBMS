An $S$-matrix is proposed for the two dimensional O(3) $\sigma$-model with adynamical $\theta$-term (axion model). Exploiting an Abelian T-dualitytransformation connecting the axion model to an integrable SU(2)$\times$U(1)symmetric principal $\sigma$-model, strong evidence is presented for thecorrectness of the proposed $S$-matrix by comparing the perturbativelycalculated free energies with the ones based on the Thermodynamical BetheAnsatz. This T-duality transformation also leads to a new Lax-pair for bothmodels. The quantum non-integrability of the O(3) $\sigma$-model with a {\slconstant} $\theta$-term, in contradistinction to the axion model, isillustrated by calculating the $2\to3$ particle production amplitude to lowestorder in $\theta$.
