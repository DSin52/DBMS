The holographic correspondence between 2d, N=2 quantum field theories andclassical 4d, N=2 supergravity coupled to hypermultiplet matter is proposed.The geometrical constraints on the target space of the 4d, N=2 non-linearsigma-models in N=2 supergravity background are interpreted as the exactrenormalization group flow equations in two dimensions. Our geometricaldescription of the renormalization flow is manifestly covariant under generalreparametrization of the 2d coupling constants. An explicit exact solution tothe 2d renormalization flow, based on its dual holographic description in termsof the Zamolodchikov metric, is considered in the particular case of thefour-dimensional NLSM target space described by the SU(2)-invariant (Weyl)anti-self-dual Einstein metrics. The exact regular (Tod-Hitchin) solutions tothese metrics are governed by the Painlev'e VI equation, and describe domainwalls.
