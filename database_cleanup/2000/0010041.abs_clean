Physics (ICHEP2000), July 27-August 2, Osaka, Japan. To be published in theProceedings (World Scientific, Singapore)Field theories compactified on non-simply connected spaces, which in generalallow to impose twisted boundary conditions, are found to unexpectedly have arich phase structure. One of characteristic features of such theories is theappearance of critical radii, at which some of symmetries are broken/restored.A phase transition can occur at the classical level, or can be caused byquantum effects. The spontaneous breakdown of the translational invariance ofcompactified spaces is another characteristic feature. As an illustrativeexample,the O(N) $\phi^4$ model on $M^3\otimes S^1$ is studied and the novelphase structure is revealed.
