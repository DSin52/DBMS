Calculations of reaction rates for the third-order QED process of photonsplitting in strong magnetic fields traditionally have employed either theeffective Lagrangian method or variants of Schwinger's proper-time technique.Recently, Mentzel, Berg and Wunner (1994) presented an alternative derivationvia an S-matrix formulation in the Landau representation. Advantages of such aformulation include the ability to compute rates near pair resonances abovepair threshold. This paper presents new developments of the Landaurepresentation formalism as applied to photon splitting, providing significantadvances beyond the work of Mentzel et al. by summing over the spin quantumnumbers of the electron propagators, and analytically integrating over thecomponent of momentum of the intermediate states that is parallel to field. Theensuing tractable expressions for the scattering amplitudes are satisfyinglycompact, and of an appearance familiar to S-matrix theory applications. Suchdevelopments can facilitate numerical computations of splitting considerablyboth below and above pair threshold. Specializations to two regimes of interestare obtained, namely the limit of highly supercritical fields and the domainwhere photon energies are far inferior to that for the threshold ofsingle-photon pair creation. In particular, for the first time thelow-frequency amplitudes are simply expressed in terms of the Gamma function,its integral and its derivatives. In addition, the equivalence of theasymptotic forms in these two domains to extant results from effectiveLagrangian/proper-time formulations is demonstrated.
