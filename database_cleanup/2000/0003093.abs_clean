our previous solutions after the correction of a numerical error, consistentthat the completeness relation is always satisfied, contrary to the claim byChu, et alJournal-ref: J.Korean Phys.Soc. 41 (2002) 290-297

We study U(1) and U(2) instanton solutions on noncommutative R^4 based on thenoncommutative version of ADHM equation proposed by Nekrasov and Schwarz. It isshown that the anti-self-dual gauge fields on self-dual noncommutative R^4correctly give integer instanton numbers for all cases we consider. We alsoshow that the completeness relation in the ADHM construction is generallysatisfied even for noncommutative spaces.
