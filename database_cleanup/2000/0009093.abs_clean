We study, to one loop order, the behavior of the gluon self-energy in the noncovariant Coulomb gauge at finite temperature. The cancellation of the peculiarenergy divergences, which arise in such a gauge, is explicitly verified in thecomplete two point function of the Yang-Mills theory. At high temperatures, theleading T^2 term is determined to be transverse and nonlocal, in agreement withthe results obtained in covariant gauges. The coefficient of the sub-leadingln(T) contribution, is non transverse but local and coincides (up to amultiplicative constant) with that of the ultraviolet pole term of the zerotemperature amplitude.
