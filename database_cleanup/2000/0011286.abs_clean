2000We briefly review the microscopic modeling of black holes as bound states ofbranes in the context of the soluble D1-D5 system. We present a discussion ofthe low energy brane dynamics and account for black hole thermodynamics andHawking radiation rates. These considerations are valid in the regime ofsupergravity due to the non-renormalization of the low energy dynamics in thismodel. Using Maldacena duality and standard statistical mechanics methods onecan account for black hole thermodynamics and calculate the absorption crosssection and the Hawking radiation rates. Hence, at least in the case of thismodel black hole, since we can account for black hole properties within aunitary theory, there is no information paradox.
