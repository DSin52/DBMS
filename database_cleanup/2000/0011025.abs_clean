Title: Regularization of Non-Linear Spinor Field Models by Discrete Symmetries

Authors: Bertfried Fauser and Heinz Dehnen

Comments: 6 pages, no figures, talk at GROUP23 conference, DUBNA

We generalize a regularization method of Stumpf 1984 in the case ofnon-linear spinor field models to fourth order theories and to non-scalarinteractions. The involved discrete symmetries can be connected with C,P,Ttransformations.
