In this paper some properties of the irreducible multiplets of representationfor the N = (p, q) - extended supersymmetry in one dimension are discussed.Essentially two results are here presented. At first a peculiar property of theone dimension is exhibited, namely that any multiplet containing 2d (d bosonicand d fermionic) particles in M different spin states, is equivalent to a (d,d)multiplet of just 2 spin states (all bosons and all fermions being grouped inthe same spin). Later, it is shown that the classification of all multiplets ofthis kind carrying an irreducible representation of the N - extendedsupersymmetry is in one-to-one correspondence with the classification ofreal-valued Clifford Gamma-matrices of Weyl type. In particular, p+q is mappedinto D, the space-time dimensionality, while 2d is determined to be thedimensionality of the corresponding Gamma-matrices. The implications of theseresults to the theory of spinning particles are analyzed.
