We apply negative dimensional integration method (NDIM) to three outstandinga very suitable technique to deal with loop integrals, being them originatedfrom any gauge choice. In Feynman gauge we perform scalar two-loop four-pointmassless integrals; in the light-cone gauge we calculate scalar two-loopintegrals contributing for two-point functions without any kind ofprescriptions, since NDIM can abandon such devices -- this calculation is thefirst test of our prescriptionless method beyond one-loop order; finally, forthe Coulomb gauge we consider a four propagator massless loop integral, in thesplit dimensional regularization context.
