We consider the supersymmetric field theories on the noncommutative $R^4$using the superspace formalism on the commutative space. The terms depending onthe parameter of the noncommutativity $\Theta$ are regarded as theinteractions. In this way we construct the N=1 supersymmetric action for theU(N) vector multiplets and chiral multiplets of the fundamental,anti-fundamental and adjoint representations of the gauge group. The action forvector multiplets of the products gauge group and its bi-fundamental matters isalso obtained. We discuss the problem of the derivative terms of the auxiliaryfields.
