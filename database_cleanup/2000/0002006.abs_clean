Title: The tale of gravitational sphaleron

Comments: 14 pages, LaTeX, Talk presented at the International Workshops

``Supersymmetry and Quantum Symmetries'' and ``Quantum Gravity and Strings'',Dubna 99Type I string theory can be dimensionally reduced on group manifolds. Thecompactification on $S^3\times S^3$ leads to the N=4 gauged SU(2)$\times$SU(2)supergravity in four dimensions, which admits the BPS monopole type non-Abelianvacuum. The reduction on $S^3\times AdS_3$ gives the Euclidean N=4 gaugedSU(2)$\times$SU(1,1) supergravity admitting a globally regular supersymmetricnon-Abelian background. The latter can be analytically continued to theLorentzian sector, which gives the regular, unstable particle-likeconfiguration known as gravitational sphaleron. When lifted to D=10, theEuclidean vacuum describes a deformation of the D1--D5 brane system.
