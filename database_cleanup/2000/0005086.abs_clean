The double tensor multiplet of D=4, N=2 supersymmetry, relevant to type IIBsuperstring vacua, is derived and its gauge invariant and N=2 supersymmetricinteractions are analysed, both self-interactions and interactions with vectormultiplets and hypermultiplets. Using deformation theory, it is shown that thelowest dimensional nontrivial interaction vertices of this type have dimension5 and all dimension 5 vertices are determined. They give rise to new N=2supersymmetric gauge theories of the `exotic' type which are local butnonpolynomial in some of the fields and coupling constants. Explicit examplesof such models are constructed.
