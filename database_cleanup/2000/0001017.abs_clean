This Letter deals with topological solitons in an O(3) sigma model in threespace dimensions (with a Skyrme term to stabilize their size). The solitons areclassified topologically by their Hopf number N. The N=2 sector is studied; inparticular, for two solitons far apart, there are three ``attractivechannels''. Viewing the solitons as dipole pairs enables one to predict theforce between them. Relaxing in the attractive channels leads to various static2-soliton solutions.
