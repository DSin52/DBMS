Title: Cosmology and Modulus Stabilization in the Randall-Sundrum Setup with

Bulk MatterAuthors: Bumseok Kyae

Comments: 10 pages, Proceeding of the talk at COSMO-2000, 4-th International

Workshop on Particle physics and the Early Universe, at Cheju-Island, Korea,Sept. 4-8, 2000We provide the exact time-dependent cosmological solutions in theRandall-Sundrum (RS) setup with bulk matter, which may be smoothly connected tothe static RS metric. In the static limit of the extra dimension, the solutionsare reduced to the standard Friedmann equations. In view of our solutions, wealso propose an explanation for how the extra dimension is stabilized in spiteof a flat modulus potential at the classical level.
