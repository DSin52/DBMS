Title: Beyond Eikonal Scattering in M(atrix)-Theory

Authors: Robert Helling (AEI Potsdam)

We study the problem of more general kinematics for the finite NM(atrix)-Model than the simple straight line motion that has been used before.This is supposed to be related to momentum transferring processes in the dualsuper-gravity description. We find a negative result for classical,perturbative processes and discuss briefly the possibility of instianton likequantum mechanical tunneling processes.
