We obtain three new solvable, real, shape invariant potentials starting fromthe harmonic oscillator, P\"oschl-Teller I and P\"oschl-Teller II potentials onthe half-axis and extending their domain to the full line, while taking specialcare to regularize the inverse square singularity at the origin. Theregularization procedure gives rise to a delta-function behavior at the origin.Our new systems possess underlying non-linear potential algebras, which canalso be used to determine their spectra analytically.
