Flat connections for unitary gauge groups on a 3--torus with twisted boundaryconditions as well as recently discovered periodic nontrivial flat connectionswith ``nondiagonalizable'' triples of holonomies for higher orthogonal andexceptional groups are constructed explicitly in terms of Jacobi thetafunctions with rational characteristics. The (fractional) Chern-Simons numbersof these vacuum gauge field configurations are verified by direct computation.
