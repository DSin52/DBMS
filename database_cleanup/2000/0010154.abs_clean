In this note we reexamine the possibility of constructing stablenon-supersymmetric theories that exhibit an exponential density of states. Forweakly coupled closed strings there is a general theorem, according to whichstable theories with an exponential density of states must exhibit an almostexact cancellation of spacetime bosons and fermions (not necessarily level bylevel). We extend this result to open strings by showing that if the abovecancellation between bosons and fermions does not occur, the open strings donot decouple from a closed string tachyon even in the NCOS scaling limit. Weconclude with a brief comment on the proposed generalization of the AdS/CFTcorrespondence to non-supersymmetric theories.
