It has been known for some time that topological geons in quantum gravity maymay exist no connection between spin and statistics for a pair of geons. Wepresent an algebraic description of quantum gravity in (2 + 1)d based on thefirst order formalism of general relativity and show that, although the usualspin-statistics theorem is not valid, statistics is completely determined byspin. Hence, a new spin-statistics theorem can be formulated.
