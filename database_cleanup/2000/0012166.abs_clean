Explicit exact formulas are presented, up to fourth order in a strict chiralcovariant derivative expansion, for the normal parity component of theEuclidean effective action of even-dimensional Dirac fermions. The bosonicbackground fields considered are scalar, pseudo-scalar, vector and axialvector. No assumptions are made on the internal symmetry group and, inparticular, the scalar and pseudo-scalar fields need not be on the chiralcircle.
