We obtain the supergravity solution which describes a bound state ofD-string/anti-D-string pairs attached to different fixed planes of an orbifold,in type IIB string theory compactified on T^4/Z_2. For parameters at which theconformal field theory point of view predicts stability, the solution displaysa repulson-like singularity. However, we observe that a D-string/anti-D-stringpair probe in this background becomes tensionless before reaching thesingularity, suggesting a resolution by the enhancon mechanism. Moreover, theforce feels by this probe is attractive, in contrast to the repulsive behaviourobserved in the non-BPS D-brane description.
