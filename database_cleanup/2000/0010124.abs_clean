We consider supersymmetry algebras in space-times with arbitrary signatureand minimal number of spinor generators. The interrelation between superPoincar\'e and super conformal algebras is elucidated. Minimal super conformalalgebras are seen to have as bosonic part a classical semimisimple algebranaturally associated to the spin group. This algebra, the Spin$(s,t)$-algebra,depends both on the dimension and on the signature of space time. We alsoconsider maximal super conformal algebras, which are classified by theorthosymplectic algebras.
