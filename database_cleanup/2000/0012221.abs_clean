We consider a brane world residing in the interior region inside the horizonof the D3-brane. The horizon size then can be interpreted as thecompactification size. The macroscopically large size of extra dimensions canbe derived from the underlying string theory that has only one physical scale,{\it i.e.,} the string scale. Then, the hierarchy between the string scale andthe Planck scale is provided by Ramon-Ramon charge of the D3-brane. Thispicture also offers a new perspective on various issues associated with thebrane world scenarios including the cosmological constant.
