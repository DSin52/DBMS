We discuss the role of the dilaton tadpole in the holographic description ofnon-supersymmetric gauge theories that are conformal in the planar limit. Onthe string theory side, the presence of the dilaton tadpole modifies the AdSbackground inducing a logarithmic running for the radius and the dilaton. Usingthe holographic prescription we compute the Wilson loop on the gravity side andfind a smooth interpolating potential between asymptotic freedom andconfinement, as expected from field theory.
