One of the key properties of Dirac operators is the possibility of adegeneracy of zero modes. For the Abelian Dirac operator in three dimensionsthe construction of multiple zero modes has been sucessfully carried out onlyvery recently. Here we generalise these results by discussing a much widerclass of Dirac operators together with their zero modes. Further we show thatthose Dirac operators that do admit zero modes may be related to Hopf maps,where the Hopf index is related to the number of zero modes in a simple way.
