We show that the NCOS (noncommutative open string) theories on torus $T^p$($p\leq 5$) are U-dual to matrix theory on torus with electric flux background.Under U-duality, the number of D-branes and the number of units of electricflux get interchanged. Furthermore under the same U-duality the decouplinglimit taken in the NCOS theory maps to the decoupling limit taken in the matrixtheory, thus ensure the U-duality between those two class of theories. Weconsider the energy needed for Higgsing process and some bound states withfinite energy and find agreements in both theories.
