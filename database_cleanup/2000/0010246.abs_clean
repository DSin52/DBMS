We show how particle-vortex duality implies the existence of a largenon-abelian discrete symmetry group which relates the electromagnetic responsefor dual two-dimensional systems in a magnetic field. For conductors withcharge carriers satisfying Fermi statistics (or those related to fermions bythe action of the group), the resulting group is known to imply many, if notall, of the remarkable features of Quantum Hall systems. For conductors withboson charge carriers (modulo group transformations) a different group ispredicted, implying equally striking implications for the conductivities ofthese systems, including a super-universality of the critical exponents forconductor/insulator and superconductor/insulator transitions in two dimensionsand a hierarchical structure, analogous to that of the quantum Hall effect butdifferent in its details. Our derivation shows how this symmetry emerges at lowenergies, depending only weakly on the details of dynamics of the underlyingsystems.
