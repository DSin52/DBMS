Supergravity solutions related to large N SU(N) pure gauge theories witheight supercharges have recently been shown to give rise to an ``enhancon'', anew type of hypersurface made of D-branes. We show that enhancons also arise insimilar situations pertaining to SO(2N+1), USp(2N) and SO(2N) gauge theories,using orientifolds. Enhancons therefore appear to come in types A, B, C, and D.The latter three differ globally from type A by having an extra Z_2identification, and are distinguished locally by their subleading behaviour inlarge N. We focus mainly on 2+1 dimensional gauge theory, where a relation toM-theory and the Atiyah-Hitchin and Taub-NUT manifolds enables the constructionof the smooth supergravity solution and the study of some of the 1/Ncorrections. The role of the enhancon in eleven dimensional supergravity isalso uncovered. There is a close relation to certain multi-monopole modulispace problems.
