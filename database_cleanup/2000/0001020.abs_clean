Title: Some uses of moduli spaces in particle and field theory

Authors: ST Tsou (Oxford)

Comments: 17 pages, Latex, 5 figures using eps; invited talk at the European

Women in Mathematics Workshop on Moduli Spaces, Oxford 1998; in Proceedings,Oxford University Mathematical Institute December 1999In this talk I shall try to give an elementary introduction to certain areasof mathematical physics where the idea of moduli space is used to help solveproblems or to further our understanding. In the wide area of gauge theory, Ishall mention instantons, monopoles and duality. Then, under the generalheading of string theory, I shall indicate briefly the use of moduli space inconformal field theory and $M$-theory.
