We consider brane-world universe where an arbitrary large $N$ quantum CFT isliving on the domain wall. This corresponds to implementing of Randall-Sundrumcompactification within the context of AdS/CFT correspondence. Using anomalyinduced effective action for domain wall CFT the possibility of self-consistentquantum creation of 4d de Sitter wall Universe (inflation) is demonstrated. Incase of maximally SUSY Yang-Mills theory the exact correspondence with radiusand effective tension found by Hawking-Hertog-Reall is obtained. The hyperbolicwall Universe may be induced by quantum effects only for exotic matter (higherderivatives conformal scalar) which has unusual sign of central charge.
