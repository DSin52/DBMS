The Schwinger proper-time method is an effective calculation method,explicitly gauge invariant and nonperturbative. We make use of this method toinvestigate the radiatively induced Lorentz and CPT-violating effects inquantum electrodynamics when an axial vector interaction term is introduced inthe fermionic sector. The induced Lorentz and CPT-violating Chern-Simons termcoincides with the one obtained using a covariant derivative expansion butdiffers from the result usually obtained in other regularization schemes. Apossible ambiguity in the approach is also discussed.
