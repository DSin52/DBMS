In the context of the noncommutative QED we consider few phenomena whichreflect the noncommutativity. In all of them the new interactions in theFeynmann diagrams that are responsible for the deviation from the standard QEDresults. These deviations appear as the violations of Lorentz symmetry. Wesuggest experimental situations where these effects may be observed. The extraphases have far reaching consequences including violation of crossing symmetry.Considering the e-p scattering and Compton scattering the electric dipolemoments of the electron and the photon is calculated.
