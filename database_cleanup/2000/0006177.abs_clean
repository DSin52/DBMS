The BRST-antiBRST invariant path integral formulation of classical mechanicsof Gozzi et al is generalized to pseudomechanics. It is shown that projectionsto physical propagators may be obtained by BRST-antiBRST invariant boundaryconditions. The formulation is also viewed from recent group theoreticalresults within BRST-antiBRST invariant theories. A natural bracket expressed interms of BRST and antiBRST charges in the extended formulation is shown to beequal to the Poisson bracket. Several remarks on the operator formulation aremade.
