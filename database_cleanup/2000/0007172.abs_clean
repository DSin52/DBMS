In this paper we analyse the quantum correction for Schwarzschild black holein the Unruh state in the framework of spherically symmetric gravity (SSG)model. SSG is a two-dimensional dilaton model which is obtained by sphericallysymmetric reduction from the four-dimensional theory. We find the one-loopgeometry of the (anti)-evaporating black hole and corrections for mass, entropyand apparent horizon.
