In this paper we study the invariance of the noncmmutative gauge theoriesunder C, P and T transformations. For the noncommutative space (when only thespatial part of $\theta$ is non-zero) we show that NCQED is Parity invariant.In addition, we show that under charge conjugation the theory on noncommutative$R^4_{\theta}$ is transformed to the theory on $R^4_{-\theta}$, so NCQED is aCP violating theory. The theory remains invariant under time reversal if,together with proper changes in fields, we also change $\theta$ by $-\theta$.Hence altogether NCQED is CPT invariant. Moreover we show that the CPTinvariance holds for general noncommutative space-time.
