We discuss the vacuum structure of type IIA/B Calabi-Yau stringcompactifications to four dimensions in the presence of n-form H-fluxes. Thesewill lift the vacuum degeneracy in the Calabi-Yau moduli space, and for genericpoints in the moduli space, N=2 supersymmetry will be broken. However, forcertain `aligned' choices of the H-flux vector, supersymmetric ground statesare possible at the degeneration points of the Calabi-Yau geometry. We willinvestigate in detail the H-flux induced superpotential and the correspondingscalar potential at several degeneration points, such as the Calabi-Yau largevolume limit, the conifold loci, the Seiberg-Witten points, the strong couplingpoint and the conformal points. Some emphasis is given to the question whetherpartial supersymmetry breaking can be realized at those points. We also relatethe H-flux induced superpotential to the formalism of gauged N=2 supergravity.Finally we point out the analogies between the Calabi-Yau vacuum structure dueto H-fluxes and the attractor formalism of N=2 black holes.
