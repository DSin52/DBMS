We investigate the `giant gravitons' of McGreevy, Susskind and Toumbas[hep-th/0003075]. We demonstrate that these are BPS configurations whichpreserve precisely the same supersymmetries as a `point-like' graviton. We alsoshow that there exist `dual' giant gravitons consisting of spherical branesexpanding into the AdS component of the spacetime. Finally, we discuss therealization of the stringy exclusion principle within this expanded framework.
