Equivalent relations between quantum mechanical systems in theRobertson-Walker (RW) background metric and quantum dynamics with an inducedquadratic background potential are derived in this work. Two elementaryapplications, which include an algebraic derivation of the evolution operatorfor a simple harmonic oscillator without using any special function or the pathintegral technique, and a moving soliton solution of a free particle in anoscillating universe, are presented to illustrate the use of these equivalentrelations.
