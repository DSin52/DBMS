We consider the cosmological evolution of the three-brane in the backgroundof type IIB string theory. For two different backgrounds which give nontrivialdilaton profile we have derived the Friedman-like equations. These give thecosmological evolution which is similar to the one by matter density on theuniverse brane. The effective density blows up as we move towards thesingularity showing the initial singularity problem. The analysis shows thatwhen there is axion field in the ambient space the recollapsing of the universeoccurs faster compared with the case without axion field.
