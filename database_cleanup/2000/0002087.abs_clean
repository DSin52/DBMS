If there is a single underlying "theory of everything" which in some limitsof its "moduli space" reduces to the five weakly coupled string theories in10D, and 11D SUGRA, then it is possible that all six of them have some commondomain of validity and that they are in the same universality class, in thesense that the 4D low energy physics of the different theories is the same. Wecall this notion String Universality. This suggests that the true vacuum ofstring theory is in a region of moduli space equally far (in some sense) fromall perturbative theories, most likely around the self-dual point with respectto duality symmetries connecting them. We estimate stringy non-perturbativeeffects from wrapped brane instantons in each perturbative theory, show howthey are related by dualities, and argue that they are likely to lead to modulistabilization only around the self-dual point. We argue that modulistabilization should occur near the string scale, and SUSY breaking shouldoccur at a much lower intermediate scale, and that it originates from differentsources. We discuss the problems of moduli stabilization and SUSY breaking incurrently popular scenarios, explain why these problems are generic, anddiscuss how our scenario can evade them. We show that String Universality isnot inconsistent with phenomenology but that it is in conflict with somepopular versions of brane world scenarios.
