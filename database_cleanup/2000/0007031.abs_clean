Title: Remarks on the existence of Spinning Membrane Actions

Comments: 35 page, revised Tex file. Correction of minor typos and an one

reference is addedIt has been recently argued by some authors that is impossible to construct aWeyl invariant spinning membrane action, where the $S$-supersymmetry associatedwith the 3D superconformal algebra, is relinquished without gauge fixing.Contrary to those assertions, we show why it is possible to construct aWeyl-invariant spinning polynomial membrane action, without curvatureterms,where $both$ the conformal boost symmetry and $S$-supersymmetry areexplicitly broken by the action. It is shown that the gauge algebra $closes$despite that the two latter symmetries are broken . For this to happen, amodifed $Q$-supersymmetry transformation, a sort of new $Q+K+S$ ``sum `` rule,is required that generates the compensating terms to cancel the spuriouscontributions fromthe $S$ and conformal boost anomalous transformations. Asubstantial discussion of the quantization of the spinning membrane andanomalies is given. We review briefly the role that this spinning membraneaction may have in the theory of $D$-branes, Skyrmions and BPS monopoles in thelarge $N$-limit of SU(N) Yang-Mills .
