Using noncommutative geometry we do U(1) gauge theory on the permutationgroup $S_3$. Unlike usual lattice gauge theories the use of a nonAbelian grouphere as spacetime corresponds to a background Riemannian curvature. In thisbackground we solve spin 0, 1/2 and spin 1 equations of motion, including thespin 1 or `photon' case in the presence of sources, i.e. a theory of classicalelectromagnetism. Moreover, we solve the U(1) Yang-Mills theory (this differsfrom the U(1) Maxwell theory in noncommutative geometry), including the modulispaces of flat connections. We show that the Yang-Mills action has a simpleform in terms of Wilson loops in the permutation group, and we discuss aspectsof the quantum theory.
