The classical first law of thermodynamics for a Kerr-Newman black hole (KNBH)is generalized to a law in quantum form on the event horizon. Then four quantumconservation laws on the KNBH equilibrium radiation process are derived. TheBekenstein-Hawking relation ${\cal{S}}={\cal{A}}/4$ is exactly established. Itcan be inferred that the classical entropy of black hole arises from thequantum entropy of field quanta or quasi-particles inside the hole.
