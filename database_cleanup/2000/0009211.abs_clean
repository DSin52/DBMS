We consider warped type IIB supergravity solutions with three-form flux and${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry, which arise as the supergravity duals of confininggauge theories. We first work in a perturbation expansion around $AdS_5 \timesS^5$, as in the work of Polchinski and Strassler, and from the ${\cal N}=1$conditions and the Bianchi identities recover their first-order solutiongeneralized to an arbitrary ${\cal N}=1$ superpotential. We find the secondorder dilaton and axion by the same means. We also find a simple family ofexact solutions, which can be obtained from solutions found by Becker andBecker, and which includes the recent Klebanov--Strassler solution.
