Title: Black Hole Radiation On and Off the Brane

Authors: Roberto Emparan

Comments: 6 pages, JHEP Proceedings style. Contribution to the Proceedings of

the TMR Conference "Non-Perturbative Quantum Effects 2000," Paris, September2000. Based on work in collaboration with G.T. Horowitz and R.C. Myers,After a brief review of the description of black holes on branes, we examinethe evaporation of a small black hole on a brane in a world with large extradimensions. We show that, contrary to previous claims, most of the energy isradiated into the modes on the brane. This raises the possibility of observingHawking radiation in future high energy colliders if there are large extradimensions.
