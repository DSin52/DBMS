The perturbative dynamics of noncommutative field theory (NCFT) is discussedfrom a point view of string field theory. As in the commutative case it isinevitable to introduce a closed string, which may be described as a boundstate of two noncommutative open strings. We point out that the closed string,interacting nontrivially with the open string, plays an essential role in theultraviolet region. The contribution of the closed string is responsible forthe discrepancy between the NCFT and the string field theory. It clarifies thecontroversial issues associated with the ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) behaviourof the perturbative dynamics of the NCFT.
