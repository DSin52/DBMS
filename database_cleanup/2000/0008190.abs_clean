We consider the theory of higher derivative gravity with non-factorizableRandall-Sundrum type space-time and obtain the metric solutions whichcharacterize the $p$-brane world-volume as a curved or planar defect embeddedin the higher dimensions. We consider the string inspired effective actions ofthe dilatonic Gauss-Bonnet type in the brane background and show itsconsistency with the RS brane-world scenario and the conformal weight of thedilaton couplings in the string theory with apppropriate choice of Regge slope($\alpha'$) or Gauss-Bonnet coupling ($\alpha$) or both. We also discuss a timedependent dilaton solution for a string-inspired fourth-derivative gravity.
