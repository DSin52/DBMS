Title: Mass generation with Gauss-Bonnet term

discontinuity in AdS spaceComments: 5 pages, comments and references added

We prove that in anti de Sitter space, there is no van Dam-Veltman-Zakharovdiscontinuity in the graviton propagator. Here we obtain the mass term of$M^2\propto \Lambda^2$ from the Gauss-Bonnet term, which is a ghost-free one.The condition that the massless limit is smooth is automatically satisfied forthis case.
