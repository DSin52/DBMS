This paper is devoted to a systematic discussion of the supersymmetric indexTr (-1)^F for the minimal supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory -- with any simplegauge group G -- primarily in four spacetime dimensions. The index hasrefinements that probe confinement and oblique confinement and the possiblespontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and of global symmetries, such ascharge conjugation, that are derived from outer automorphisms of the gaugegroup. Predictions for the index and its refinements are obtained on the basisof standard hypotheses about the infrared behavior of gauge theories. Thepredictions are confirmed via microscopic calculations which involve aBorn-Oppenheimer computation of the spectrum as well as mathematical formulasinvolving triples of commuting elements of G and the Chern-Simons invariants offlat bundles on the three-torus.
