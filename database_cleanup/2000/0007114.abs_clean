We construct a q-deformed version of the conformal quantum mechanics model ofde Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan for which the deformation parameter is complex andthe unitary time evolution of the system is preserved. We also studydifferential calculus on the q-deformed quantum phase space associated withsuch system.
