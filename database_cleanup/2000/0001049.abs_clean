We study the gauge and gravitational interactions of the stable non-BPSD-particles of the type I string theory. The gravitational interactions areobtained using the boundary state formalism while the SO(32) gauge interactionsare determined by evaluating disk diagrams with suitable insertions of boundarychanging (or twist) operators. In particular the gauge coupling of a D-particleis obtained from a disk with two boundary components produced by the insertionof two twist operators. We also compare our results with the amplitudes amongthe non-BPS states of the heterotic string which are dual to the D-particles.After taking into account the known duality and renormalization effects, wefind perfect agreement, thus confirming at a non-BPS level the expectationsbased on the heterotic/type I duality.
