Using a synthesis of the functional integral and operator approaches wediscuss the fermion-boson mapping and the role played by the Bose field algebrain the Hilbert space of two-dimensional gauge and anomalous gauge fieldtheories with massive fermions. In the $QED_2$ with quartic self-interactionamong massive fermions, the use of an auxiliary vector field introduces aredundant Bose field algebra that should not be considered as an element of theintrinsic algebraic structure defining the model. In the anomalous chiral$QED_2$ with massive fermions the effect of the chiral anomaly leads to theappearance in the mass operator of a spurious Bose field combination. Thisphase factor carries no fermion selection rule and the expected absence of$\theta$-vacuum in the anomalous model is displayed from the operator solution.Even in the anomalous model with massive Fermi fields, the introduction of theWess-Zumino field replicates the theory, changing neither its algebraic contentnor its physical content.
