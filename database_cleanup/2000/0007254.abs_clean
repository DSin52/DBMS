We investigate constraints for including bulk and brane matter in theRandall- Sundrum model. In static configurations with two zero thicknessbranes, we find that no realistic brane matter is possible. We also considerthe possibility that the radion has stabilized by dissipating its energy intothe bulk in the form of some unspecified matter, and find the Randall-Sundrumcosmological solutions in the presence of bulk ideal fluid. We discover thatthe metric is necessarily in a static configuration. We also discover thatthere is only one allowed equation of state for the bulk fluid, $p=\rho $,corresponding to the stiff ideal fluid. We find the corresponding branecosmologies and compare them with the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model.
