We extend the topological Kerr-Newman-aDS solutions by including NUT chargeand find generalizations of the Robinson-Bertotti solution to the negativecosmological constant case with different topologies. We show how all thesesolutions can be obtained as limits of the general Plebanski-Demianskisolution. We study the supersymmetry properties of all these solutions in thecontext of gauged N=2,d=4 supergravity. Generically they preserve at most 1/4of the total supersymmetry. In the Plebanski-Demianski case, although gaugedN=2,d=4 supergravity does not have electric-magnetic duality, we find that thefamily of supersymmetric solutions still enjoys a sort of electric-magneticduality in which electric and magnetic charges and mass and Taub-NUT charge arerotated simultaneously.
