In this paper, starting from pure group-theoretical point of view, we developa regular approach to describing particles with different spins in theframework of a theory of scalar fields on the Poincare group. Such fields canbe considered as generating functions for conventional spin-tensor fields. Thecases of 2, 3, and 4 dimensions are elaborated in detail. Discretetransformations $C,P,T$ are defined for the scalar fields as automorphisms ofthe Poincare group. Doing a classification of the scalar functions, we obtainrelativistic wave equations for particles with definite spin and mass. Thereexist two different types of scalar functions (which describe the same mass andspin), one related to a finite-dimensional nonunitary representation andanother one related to an infinite-dimensional unitary representation of theLorentz subgroup. This allows us to derive both usual finite-component waveequations for spin-tensor fields and positive energy infinite-component waveequations.
