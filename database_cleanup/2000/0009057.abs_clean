We study the massive spectrum of fully wrapped branes in warped M-theorycompactifications, including regimes where these states are parametricallylighter than the Planck scale or string scale. We show that many such statesbehave classically as extended objects in the noncompact directions in thesense that their mass grows with their size as measured along the Poincareslices making up the noncompact dimensions. On the other hand these states canexcitations in a limited regime can be obtained by a warped Kaluza-Kleinreduction from ten dimensions. We briefly discuss scattering processes and loopeffects involving these states, and also note the possibility of an exponentialgrowth in the number of bound states of these objects as a function of energy.
