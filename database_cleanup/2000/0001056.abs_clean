It was recently shown, using the AdS/CFT correspondence, that the low energyeffective action of a large $N$ open string theory satisfies a holographic RGflow equation closely related to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of 5-dsupergravity. In this paper we re-obtain the same flow equation in the dualregime of small 't Hooft coupling $\lambda\ll 1$. Our derivation makes use ofthe conformal equivalence between planar open string diagrams and closed stringtree diagrams. This equivalence can be viewed as a microscopic explanation ofthe open/closed string duality that underlies the AdS/CFT correspondence.
