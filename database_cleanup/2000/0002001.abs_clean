corrected, Eq. (5.6) corrected, minor changes of expression in section 5, afootnote on Eq.(5.6) and one reference addedWe propose relativistic second quantization of matrix model of D particles ina general framework of nonlocal field theory based on Snyder-Yang's quantizedspace-time. Second-quantized nonlocal field is in general noncommutative withquantized space-time, but conjectured to become commutative with light conetime $X^+$. This conjecture enables us to find second-quantized Hamiltonian ofD particle system and Heisenberg's equation of motion of second-quantized {\bfD} field in close contact with Hamiltonian given in matrix model. We proposeHamilton's principle of Lorentz-invariant action of {\bf D} field andinvestigate what conditions or approximations are needed to reproduce the aboveHeisenberg's equation given in light cone time. Both noncommutativitiesappearing in position coordinates of D particles in matrix model and inquantized space-time will be eventually unified through second quantization ofmatrix model.
