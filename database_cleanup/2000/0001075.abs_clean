Authors: Matthew D. E. Szyndel

Comments: LaTeX 2e, 22 pages including 11 figures

We investigate the sigma and baby Skyrme models with an RP^2 target space. Wecompare these models to models with an S^2 target space. We investigate theinteractions between solitons and defects in the RP^2 sigma model.
