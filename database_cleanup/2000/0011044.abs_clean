We consider the first subleading terms in the low-energy cross section forthe absorption of dilaton partial waves by D3-branes. We demonstrate that thesecorrections, computed previously via supergravity, can be reproduced exactly ina worldvolume calculation using a deformation of N=4 SYM theory by a dimensioneight chiral operator. The calculation does not depend on how the theory isregularized. This result provides another hint that holographic duality betweenthe D3-brane worldvolume theory and the corresponding supergravity solution maybe valid beyond the near horizon limit.
