We show that two-dimensional (2D) AdS gravity induces on the spacetimeboundary a conformally invariant dynamics that can be described in terms of ade Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan model coupled to an external source with conformaldimension two. The external source encodes the information about the gaugesymmetries of the 2D gravity system. Alternatively, there exists a descriptionin terms of a mechanical system with anholonomic constraints. The consideredsystems are invariant under the action of the conformal group generated by aVirasoro algebra, which occurs also as asymptotic symmetry algebra oftwo-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. We calculate the central charge of thealgebra and find perfect agreement between statistical and thermodynamicalentropy of AdS_2 black holes.
