A generalization of the Akulov-Volkov effective Lagrangian governing the selfinteractions of the Nambu-Goldstone fermions associated with spontaneouslybroken extended supersymmetry as well as their coupling to matter is presentedand scrutinized. The resulting currents associated with R-symmetry,supersymmetry and space-time translations are constructed and seen to form asupermultiplet structure.
