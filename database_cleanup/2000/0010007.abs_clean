Title: Gauge Symmetry Breaking and Generalized Monopole in Non-BPS D-Brane

ActionComments: 11 pages, LaTeX2e, no figures

Based on the DBI action for the four coincident non-BPS D9-branes in the typeIIA string theory we demonstrate that the gauge symmetry breaking through thetachyon condensation into the generalized monopole of codimension five producesa pair of two coincident BPS D4-branes. The nontrivial gauge fieldconfiguration is studied and shown to yield the non-zero generalized magneticcharge. We discuss how this explicit demonstration is related with the higherK-theory group.
