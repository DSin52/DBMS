We consider a deformation of three dimensional BF theory by means of theantifield BRST formalism. Possible deformations for the action and the gaugesymmetries are analyzed. We find a new class of gauge theories which includenonabelian BF theory, higher dimensional nonlinear gauge theory and topologicalmembrane theory.
