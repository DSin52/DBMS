Conformally invariant quantum field theories develop trace anomalies whendefined on curved backgrounds. We study again the problem of identifying allpossible trace anomalies in d=6 by studying the consistency conditions toderive their 10 independent solutions. It is known that only 4 of thesesolutions represent true anomalies, classified as one type A anomaly, given bythe topological Euler density, and three type B anomalies, made up by threeindependent Weyl invariants. However, we also present the explicit expressionsof the remaining 6 trivial anomalies, namely those that can be obtained by theWeyl variation of local functionals. The knowledge of the latter is in generalnecessary to disentangle the universal coefficients of the type A and Banomalies from calculations performed on concrete models.
