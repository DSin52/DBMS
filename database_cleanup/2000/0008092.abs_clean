We employ the ADHM method to derive the moduli space of two instantons inU(1) gauge theory on a noncommutative space. We show by an explicithyperK\"ahler quotient construction that the relative metric of the modulispace of two instantons on $R^4$ is the Eguchi-Hanson metric and find a uniquethreshold bound state. For two instantons on $R^3\times S^1$, otherwise knownas calorons, we give the asymptotic metric and conjecture a completion. Wefurther discuss the relationship of caloron moduli spaces of A, D and E groupsto the Coulomb branches of three dimensional gauge theory. In particular, weshow that the Coulomb branch of SU(2) gauge group with a single massive adjointhypermultiplet coincides with the above two caloron moduli space.
