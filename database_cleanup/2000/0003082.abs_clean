The matrix elements of local operators such as the electromagnetic current,the energy momentum tensor, angular momentum, and the moments of structurefunctions have exact representations in terms of light-cone Fock statewavefunctions of bound states such as hadrons. We illustrate all of theseproperties by giving explicit light-cone wavefunctions for the two-particleFock state of the electron in QED, thus connecting the Schwinger anomalousmagnetic moment to the spin and orbital momentum carried by its Fock stateconstituents. We also compute the QED one-loop radiative corrections for theform factors for the graviton coupling to the electron and photon. Although theunderlying model is derived from elementary QED perturbative couplings, it infact can be used to simulate much more general bound state systems by applyingspectral integration over the constituent masses while preserving all of theLorentz properties, giving explicit realization of the spin sum rules and otherlocal matrix elements. The role of orbital angular momentum in understandingthe "spin crisis" problem for relativistic systems is clarified. We also provethat the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment B(0) vanishes for any compositesystem. This property is shown to follow directly from the Lorentz boostproperties of the light-cone Fock representation and holds separately for eachFock state component. We show how the QED perturbative structure can be used tomodel bound state systems while preserving all Lorentz properties. We thusobtain a theoretical laboratory to test the consistency of formulae which havebeen proposed to probe the spin structure of hadrons.
