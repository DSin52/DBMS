I discuss the symmetry structure of the N=2 supersymmetric extension of theBorn-Infeld action in four dimensions, and confirm its interpretation as theGoldstone-Maxwell action associated with partial breaking of N=4 extendedsupersymmetry down to N=2, by revealing a hidden invariance of the action withrespect to two non-linearly realized supersymmetries and two spontaneouslybroken translations. I also argue about the uniqueness of supersymmetricextension of the Born-Infeld action, and its possible relation tononcommutative geometry.
