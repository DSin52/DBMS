The particle Fock space of the matter fields in QED can be constructed usingthe free creation and annihilation operators. However, these particle operatorsare not, even at asymptotically large times, the modes of the matter fieldsthat enter the QED Lagrangian. In this letter we construct the fields which dorecover such particle modes at large times. We are thus able to demonstrate forthe first time that, contrary to statements found in the literature, arelativistic description of charged particles in QED exists.
