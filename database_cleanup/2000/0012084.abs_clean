A relation between the Schroedinger wave functional and the Clifford-valuedwave function which appears in what we call precanonical quantization of fieldsand fulfills a Dirac-like generalized covariant Schroedinger equation on thespace of field and space-time variables is discussed. The Schroedinger wavefunctional is argued to be the trace of the positive frequency part of thecontinual product over all spatial points of the values of the aforementionedwave function restricted to a Cauchy surface. The standard functionaldifferential Schroedinger equation is derived as a consequence of theDirac-like covariant Schroedinger equation.
