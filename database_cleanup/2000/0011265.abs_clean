The hypercharge-isospin-color symmetry of the standard model interaction isdrastically reduced to a remaining Abelian electromagnetic $\U(1)$-symmetry forthe particles. It is shown that such a symmetry reduction comes as aconsequence of the central correlation in the internal group as represented bythe standard fields where the hypercharge properties are given by the centralisospin-color properties. A maximal diagonalizable symmetry subgroup (Cartantorus) of the interaction group for the particles as eigenvectors has todiscard either color (confinement) or isospin. An additional diagonalizationfor the external spin properties which come centrally correlated with theisospin properties enforces the weak isospin breakdown.
