We investigate the distribution of instanton sizes in the framework of asimplified model for ensembles of instantons. This model takes into account thenon-diluteness of instantons. The infrared problem for the integration overinstanton sizes is dealt with in a self-consistent manner by approximatinginstanton interactions by a repulsive hard core potential. This leads to adynamical suppression of large instantons. The characteristic features of theinstanton size distribution are studied by means of analytic and Monte Carlomethods. In one dimension exact results can be derived. In any dimension wefind a power law behaviour for small sizes, consistent with the semi-classicalresults. At large instanton sizes the distribution decays exponentially. Theresults are compared with those from lattice simulations.
