We investigate the replica trick for the microscopic spectral density,$\rho_s(x)$, of the Euclidean QCD Dirac operator. Our starting point is thelow-energy limit of the QCD partition function for $n$ fermionic flavors (orreplicas) in the sector of topological charge $\nu$. In the domain of thesmallest eigenvalues, this partition function is simply given by a U(n) unitarymatrix integral. We show that the asymptotic behavior of $\rho_s(x)$ for $x \to\infty$ is obtained from the $n\to 0$ limit of this integral. The smoothcontributions to this series are obtained from an expansion about the replicasymmetric saddle-point, whereas the oscillatory terms follow from an expansionabout a saddle-point that breaks the replica symmetry. For $\nu =0$ we recoverthe small-$x$ logarithmic singularity of the resolvent by means of the replicatrick. For half integer $\nu$, when the saddle point expansion of the U(n)integral terminates, the replica trick reproduces the exact analytical result.In all other cases only an asymptotic series that does not uniquely determinethe microscopic spectral density is obtained. We argue that bosonic replicasfail to reproduce the microscopic spectral density. In all cases, the exactanswer is obtained naturally by means of the supersymmetric method.
