Representations of four-dimensional superconformal groups on harmonicsuperfields are discussed. It is shown how various short representations can beobtained by parabolic induction. It is also shown that such short multipletsmay admit several descriptions as superfields on different superspaces. Inparticular, this is the case for on-shell massless superfields. This allows adescription of short representations as explicit products of fundamentalfields. Superconformal transformations of analytic fields in real harmonicsuperspaces are given explicitly.
