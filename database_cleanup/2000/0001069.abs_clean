corrected, in particular in the final expression for the propagatorConnection of the invariant Dirac equation over the de Sitter space withirreducible representations of the de Sitter group is ascertained. The set ofsolutions of this equation is obtained in the form of the product of twodifferent systems of generalized coherent states for the de Sitter group. Usingthese solutions the quantized Dirac field over de Sitter space is constructedand its propagator is found. It is a result of action of some de Sitterinvariant spinor operator onto the spin zero propagator with an imaginary shiftof a mass.
