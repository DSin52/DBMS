We solve the non-linear monopole equation of the Born-Infeld theory to allorders in the NS 2-form and give physical implications of the result. Thesolution is constructed by extending the earlier idea of rotating the braneconfiguration of the Dirac monopole in the target space. After establishing thenon-linear monopole, we explore the non-commutative monopole by theSeiberg-Witten map.
