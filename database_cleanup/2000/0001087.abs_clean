Title: The commutativity principle and lagrangian symmetries

Authors: R. Banerjee

Comments: Revtex, 4 pages, no figures

Using the commutativity of a general variation with the time differentiationwe discuss both global and local (gauge) symmetries of a lagrangian from aunified point of view. The Noether considerations are thereby applicable forboth cases. A complete equivalence between the hamiltonian and lagrangianformulations is established.
