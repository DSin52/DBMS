Title: Conformality, Particle Phenomenology and the Cosmological Constant

Comments: 11 pages LaTeX. Talk at ORBIS-99, Fort Lauderdale. December 1999

Conformality is the idea that at TeV scales enrichment of the standard modelparticle spectrum leads to conformal invariance at a fixed point of therenormalization group. Some aspects of conformality in particle phenomenologyand cosmology are discussed.
