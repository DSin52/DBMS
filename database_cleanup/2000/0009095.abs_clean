We study four-dimensional U(1) on a non-commutative T^2 with rational Theta.This theory has dual descriptions as ordinary SYM or as NCOS. We identify a setof massive non-interacting KK states in the SYM theory and track them throughthe various dualities. They appear as stretched strings in the non-commutativeU(1) providing another example of the IR/UV mixing in non-commutative fieldtheories. In the NCOS these states appear as D-strings with winding andmomentum. They form an unconventional type of 1/4 BPS state with the 3-brane.To obtain a consistent picture of S-duality for compactified theories it isessential to keep track of both the NS and the RR B-fields.
