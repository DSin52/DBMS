We use the method of Banerjee, Banerjee and Mitra and minimal homotopy pathsto compute the consistent gauge anomaly for several superspace models of SSYMcoupled to matter. We review the derivation of the anomaly for N=1 in fourdimensions and then discuss the anomaly for two-dimensional models with (2,0)supersymmetry.
