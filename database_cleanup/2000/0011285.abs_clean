We discuss various aspects of the description of branes as topologicalsolitons in unstable brane systems of higher dimensions. We first describe aclassification of all the possible realisations of branes of M and type IItheories as topological solitons of a brane-antibrane system. We then present adescription of type IIB NS-NS p-branes in terms of topological solitons insystems of spacetime-filling NS9, anti-NS9 pairs and discuss the implicationsof these constructions in the description of BPS and non-BPS states in thestrongly coupled Heterotic SO(32) theory. We finally present briefly theconstruction of a conjectured spacetime-filling non-BPS M10-brane, startingpoint for a brane descent construction of the branes of M-theory.
