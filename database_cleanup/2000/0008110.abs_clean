Title: Understanding Skyrmions using Rational Maps

Authors: N.S. Manton and B.M.A.G. Piette

Comments: 11 pages, 2 figures. To appear in the proceedings of the 3rd European

Congress of Mathematics, Barcelona 2000 (Birkhouser)We discuss an ansatz for Skyrme fields in three dimensions which usesrational maps between Riemann spheres, and produces shell-like structures ofpolyhedral form. Houghton, Manton and Sutcliffe showed that a single rationalmap gives good approximations to the minimal energy Skyrmions up to baryonnumber of order ten. We show how the method can be generalised by using two ormore rational maps to give a double-shell or multi-shell structure.Particularly interesting examples occur at baryon numbers twelve and fourteen.
