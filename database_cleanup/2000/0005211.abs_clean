The tree-level amplitude for the scattering of two gauge particlesconstrained to move on the two distinct boundaries of eleven-dimensionalspace-time in the Horava-Witten formulation of M-theory is constructed. At lowmomenta this reproduces the corresponding tree-level scattering amplitude ofthe E_8xE_8 heterotic string theory. After compactification to nine dimensionson a large circle with a suitable Wilson line to break the symmetry toSO(16)xSO(16) this amplitude is used to describe the scattering of two massiveSO(16) spinor states - one from each factor of the unbroken symmetry group. Theamplitude contains a component that is associated with the exchange of aKaluza-Klein charge between the boundaries, which is interpreted as theexchange of a D-particle between orientifold planes in the Type IA theory. Thisis related by T-duality to the effect of a non-BPS D-instanton in the Type Itheory which is only invariant under those elements of O(16)xSO(16) that are inSO(16)xSO(16).
