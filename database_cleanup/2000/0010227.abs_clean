We show that nodal points of ground states of some quantum systems withmagnetic interactions can be identified in simple geometric terms. We analysenon-trivial magnetic flux $\Phi$, ii) Hall effect on a torus. In the case ofthe planar rotor we show that the level repulsion generated by any reflectioninvariant potential $V$ is encoded in the nodal structure of the unique vacuumfor $\theta=\pi$. In the second case we prove that the nodes of the firstLandau level for unit magnetic charge appear at the crossing of the twonon-contractible circles $\alpha_-$, $\beta_-$ with holonomies$h_{\alpha_-}(A)= h_{\beta_-}(A)=-1$ for any reflection invariant potential$V$. This property illustrates the geometric origin of the quantum translationanomaly.
