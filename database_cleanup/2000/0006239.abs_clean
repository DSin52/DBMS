We present direct arguments for non-commutativity of spheres in the AdS/CFTcorrespondence. The discussion is based on results for the $S_N$ orbifold SCFT.Concentrating on three point correlations (at finite $N$) we exhibit acomparison with correlations on a non-commutative sphere. In this manner anessential signature of non-commutativity is identified giving further supportfor the original proposal of hep-th/9902059.
