Open string field theory is considered as a tool for deriving the effectiveaction for the massless or tachyonic fields living on D-branes. Some simplecalculations are performed in open bosonic string field theory which validatethis approach. The level truncation method is used to calculate successiveapproximations to the quartic terms \phi^4, (A^\mu A_\mu)^2 and [A_\mu,A_\nu]^2 for the zero momentum tachyon and gauge field on one or many bosonicD-branes. We find that the level truncation method converges for these termswithin 2-4% when all massive fields up to level 20 are integrated out, althoughthe convergence is slower than exponential. We discuss the possibility ofextending this work to determine the structure of the nonabelian Born-Infeldtheory describing the gauge field on a system of many parallel bosonic orsupersymmetric D-branes. We also describe a brane configuration in whichtachyon condensation arises in both the gauge theory and string field theorypictures. This provides a natural connection between recent work of Sen andZwiebach on tachyon condensation in string field theory and unstable vacua insuper Yang-Mills and Born-Infeld field theory.
