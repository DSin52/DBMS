The fermion generation puzzle has survived into this century as one of thegreat mysteries in particle physics. We consider here a possible solutionwithin the Standard Model framework based on a nonabelian generalization ofelectric-magnetic duality. First, by constructing in loop space a nonabeliangeneralization of the abelian dual transform (Hodge *), one finds that a``magnetic'' symmetry exists also in classical Yang-Mills theory dual to theoriginal (``electric'') gauge symmetry. Secondly, from a result of 't Hooft's,one obtains that for confined colour SU(3), the dual symmetry$\widetilde{SU}(3)$ is spontaneously broken and can play the role of the``horizontal symmetry'' for generations. Thirdly, such an identification notonly offers an explanation why there should be three and apparently only threegenerations of fermions with the remarkable mass and mixing patterns seen inexperiment, but allows even a calculation of the relevant parameters givingvery sensible results. Other testible predictions follow ranging from rarehadron decays to cosmic ray air showers.
