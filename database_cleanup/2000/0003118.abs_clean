We examine the evaporation of a small black hole on a brane in a world withlarge extra dimensions. Since the masses of many Kaluza-Klein modes are muchsmaller than the Hawking temperature of the black hole, it has been claimedthat most of the energy is radiated into these modes. We show that this isincorrect. Most of the energy goes into the modes on the brane. This raises thepossibility of observing Hawking radiation in future high energy colliders ifthere are large extra dimensions.
