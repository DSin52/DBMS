We present five dimensional gauged supergravity with universal hypermultipleton M_4 \times S^1 / Z_2 coupled supersymmetrically to three-branes located atthe fixed points. The construction is extended to the smooth picture withauxiliary singlet and four-form fields. The model admits the Randall-Sundrumsolution as a BPS vacuum with vanishing energy. We give the form of allKK-tower modes for fields present in the model.
