We study the N = 2 supersymmetric analog of the Klebanov-Strassler system. Wefirst review the resolution of singularities by the enhancon mechanism, and thephysics of fractional branes on an orbifold. We then describe the exact N = 2solution. This exhibits a duality cascade as in the N = 1 case, but thesingularity resolution is the characteristic N = 2 enhancon. We discuss somerelated solutions and open issues.
