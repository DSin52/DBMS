We present a detailed analysis of the 4-point functions of the lowest weightchiral primary operators $O^{I} \sim \tr \phi^{(i}\phi^{j)}$ in $\N =4$ SYM$_4$at strong coupling and show that their structure is compatible with thepredictions of AdS/CFT correspondence. In particular, all power-singular termsin the 4-point functions exactly coincide with the contributions coming fromthe conformal blocks of the CPOs, the R-symmetry current and the stress tensor.Operators dual to string modes decouple at strong coupling. We compute theanomalous dimensions and the leading $1/N^2$ corrections to the normalizationconstants of the 2- and 3-point functions of scalar and vector double-traceoperators with approximate dimensions 4 and 5 respectively. We also find thatthe conformal dimensions of certain towers of double-trace operators in the{\bf 105}, {\bf 84} and {\bf 175} irreps are non-renormalized. We show that,despite the absence of a non-renormalization theorem for the double-traceoperator in the {\bf 20} irrep, its anomalous dimension vanishes. Asby-products of our investigation, we derive explicit expressions for theconformal block of the stress tensor, and for the conformal partial waveamplitudes of a conserved current and of a stress tensor in $d$ dimensions.
