A universal framework is proposed, where all laws are regularities ofrelations between things or agents. Parts of the world at one or all times aremodeled as networks called SYSTEMS with a minimum of axiomatic properties. Anotion of locality is introduced by declaring some relations direct (or links).Dynamics is composed of "atomic" constituents called mechanisms. They areindirect relations become direct (friend of friend becomes friend), links areremoved, objects copied. This defines a kind of universal chemistry.I show how to model basic life processes in a self contained fashion as akind of enzymatic computation. The framework also accommodates the gaugetheories of fundamental physics. Emergence creates new functionality bycooperation - nonlocal phenomena arise out of local interactions. I explain howthis can be understood in a reductionist way by multiscale analysis (e.g.renormalization group).
