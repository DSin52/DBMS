String equations for the vertex operators of type IIB on $AdS_3\times S^3$background with NS-NS flux are calculated using Berkovits-Vafa-Wittenformalism. With suitable field definitions, the linearized field equations forsix-dimensional supergravity and a tensor multiplet on $AdS_3\times S^3$ arerecovered from these. We also discuss the massless degrees of freedom thatsurvive the $S^3$ Kaluza-Klein compactification and how our vertex operatorsare related to the vertex operators introduced by Giveon, Kutasov and Seiberg.
