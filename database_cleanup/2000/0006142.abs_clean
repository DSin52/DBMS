Title: Some Comments on Wheeler De Witt Equation for Gravitational Collapse and

the Problem of TimeAuthors: Carlos Pinheiro (UFES, Brazil); F.C. Khanna (UofA, Canada)

Comments: 9 pages, AMStex

We write the Hamiltonian for a gravitational spherically symmetric scalarfield collapse with massive scalar field source, and we discuss the applicationof Wheeler De Witt equation as well as the appearence of time in this context.Using an Ansatz for Wheeler De Witt equation, solutions are discussed includingthe appearence of time evolution.
