Extending earlier results on the duality symmetries of three-brane probetheories we define the duality subgroup of SL(2,Z) as the symmetry group of thebackground 7-branes configurations. We establish that the action of Weylreflections is implemented on junctions by brane transpositions that amount toexchanging branes that can be connected by open strings. This enables us tocharacterize duality groups of brane configurations by a map to the symmetrygroup of the Dynkin diagram. We compute the duality groups and their actionsfor all localizable 7-brane configurations. Surprisingly, for the case ofaffine configurations there are brane transpositions leaving them invariant butacting nontrivially on the charges of junctions.
