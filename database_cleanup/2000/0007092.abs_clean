Using the technique of finite field dependent BRST transformations we showthat the classical massive Yang-Mills theory and the pure Yang-Mills theorywhose gauge symmetry is broken by a gauge fixing term are identical from theview point of quantum gauge symmetry. The explicit infinitesimaltransformations which leave the massive Yang-Mills theory BRST invariant aregiven.
