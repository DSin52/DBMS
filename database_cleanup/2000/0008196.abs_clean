The purpose of this paper is twofold. The first purpose is to review asystematic construction of Noether currents for supersymmetric theories,especially effective supersymmetric theories. The second purpose is to usethese currents to derive the mass-formula for the quantized Seiberg-Wittenmodel from the supersymmetric algebra. We check that the mass-formula of thelow-energy theory agrees with that of the full theory (in the broken phase).
