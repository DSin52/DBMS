We show how to extend the usual black string instability of vacuum or chargedblack p-branes to the anti-de Sitter background. The string fragments in ananalogous fashion to the $\Lambda=0$ case, the main difference being thatinstead of a periodic array of black holes forming, an accumulation of ``mini''black holes occurs towards the AdS horizon. In the case where the AdS space isof finite extent, such as an orbifold compactification, we show how theinstability switches off below a certain compactification scale.
