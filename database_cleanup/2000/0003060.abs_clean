We consider cosmological solutions to type II supergravity theories where thespacetime is split into a FRW universe and a K\"ahler space, which may be takento be Calabi-Yau. The various 2-forms present in the theories are taken to beproportional to the K\"ahler form associated to the K\"ahler space.
