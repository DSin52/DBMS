Authors: J.G. Russo

Comments: latex, 27 pages. Lectures at SILAFAE III, Cartagena, Colombia (april

2000)These are introductory lectures on the correspondence between SU(N) gaugetheories and Superstring Theory in anti-de Sitter geometries (AdS). The subjectcombines a number of different topics, including supersymmetric field theory,classical and quantum physics of black holes, string theory, string dualities,conformal field theories (CFT), and quantum field theory in anti-de Sitterspaces. We also discuss applications of this AdS/CFT correspondence to thelarge $N$ dynamics of pure QCD.
