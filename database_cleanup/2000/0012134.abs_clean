In the standard methodology for evaluating the Hawking radiation emanatingfrom a black hole, the background geometry is fixed. Trying to be morerealistic we consider a dynamical geometry for a two-dimensional charged blackhole and we evaluate the Hawking radiation as tunneling process. Thismodification to the geometry gives rise to a nonthermal part in the radiationspectrum. We explore the consequences of this new term for the extremal case.
