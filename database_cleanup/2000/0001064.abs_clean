Recently it was shown how to regularize the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV)field-antifield formalism of quantization of gauge theories with the non-localregularization (NLR) method. The objective of this work is to make an analysisof the behaviour of this NLR formalism, connected to the BV framework, usingFujikawa-like regulator. This analysis has been made in the light of the wellknown fact that different regulators can generate different expressions foranomalies that are related by a local couterterm, or that are equivalent aftera reparametrization. This has been done by computing precisely the anomaly ofthe chiral Schwinger model.
