There has been spectacular progress in the development of string andsuperstring theories since its inception thirty years ago. Development in thisarea has never been impeded by the lack of experimental confirmation. Indeed,numerous bold and imaginative strides have been taken and the sheer eleganceand logical consistency of the arguments have served as a primary motivationfor string theorists to push their formulations ahead. In fact the developmentin this area has been so rapid that new ideas quickly become obsolete. On theother hand, this rapid development has proved to be the greatest hindrance fornovices interested in this area. These notes serve as a gentle introduction tothis topic. In these elementary notes, we briefly review the RNS formulation ofsuperstring theory, GSO projection, $D$-branes, bosonic strings, dualities,dynamics of $D$-branes and the microscopic description of Bekenstein entropy ofa black hole.
