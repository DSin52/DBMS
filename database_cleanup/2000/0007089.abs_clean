We examine several aspects of S-duality of four-dimensional noncommutativegauge theory. By making duality transformation explicit, we find that S-dual ofnoncommutative gauge theory is defined in terms of dual noncommutativedeformation. In `magnetic' noncommutative U(1) gauge theory, we show that, inaddition to gauge bosons, open D-strings constitute important low-energynoncritical open F-strings. We propose that, in dual `electric' noncommutativeU(1) gauge theory, the latters are identified with gauge-invariant, open Wilsonlines. We argue that the open Wilson lines are chiral due to underlying paritynoninvariance and obey spacetime uncertainty relation. We finally argue that,at high energy-momentum limit, the `electric' noncommutative gauge theorydescribes correctly dynamics of delocalized multiple F-strings.
