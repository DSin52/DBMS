The one loop quantum corrections to the classical reflection factor of thesinh-Gordon model are calculated partially for general boundary conditions. Themodel is studied under boundary conditions which are compatible withintegrability, and in the framework of the conventional perturbation theorygeneralized to the affine Toda field theory. It is found that the general formof the related quantum corrections are hypergeometric functions.
