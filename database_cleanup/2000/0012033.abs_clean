We study the localization of gravity on string-like defects in codimensiontwo. We point out that the gravity-localizing `local cosmic string' spacetimehas an orbifold singularity at the horizon. The supergravity embedding and theAdS/CFT correspondence suggest ways to resolve the singularity. We find tworesolutions of the singularity that have a semiclassical gravity descriptionand study their effect on the low-energy physics on the defect. The firstresolution leads, at long distances, to a codimension one Randall-Sundrumscenario. In the second case, the infrared physics is like that of aconventional finite-size Kaluza-Klein compactification, with no power-lawcorrections to the gravitational potential. Similar resolutions apply also inhigher codimension gravity-localizing backgrounds.
