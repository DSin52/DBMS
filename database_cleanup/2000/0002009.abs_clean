We study a new class of matrix models, the simplest of which is based on anSp(2) symmetry and has a compactification which is equivalent to Chern-Simonstheory on the three-torus. By replacing Sp(2) with the super-algebra Osp(1|32),which has been conjectured to be the full symmetry group of M theory, we arriveat a supercovariant matrix model which appears to contain within it thepreviously proposed M theory matrix models. There is no background spacetime sothat time and dynamics are introduced via compactifications which break thefull covariance of the model. Three compactifications are studied correspondingto a hamiltonian quantization in D=10+1, a Lorentz invariant quantization inD=9+1 and a light cone gauge quantization in D=11=9+1+1. In all casesconstraints arise which eliminate certain higher spin fields in terms of lowerspin dynamical fields. In the SO(9,1) invariant compactification we argue thatthe one loop effective action reduces to the IKKT covariant matrix model. Inthe light cone gauge compactification the theory contains the standard M theorylight cone gauge matrix model, but there appears an additional transverse fiveform field.
