We introduce a calculus of the Lie algebra valued functions present inTseytlin's proposal for the nonabelian DBI action, and apply it to show thatthe recently found dyonic instanton is a solution of the full nonabelian DBIaction. The geometry of this solution exhibits a new effect of ``blowing-up''of the brane, which was not present in the case of the brane realisation ofmonopoles. We interpret this solution as the superposition of the D0 brane andfundamental string F1 which connects two separated D4 branes. Both F1 and D0are delocalised in the ``blown-up'' region between two separated D4 branes.
