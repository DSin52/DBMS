The Hopf algebra of undecorated rooted trees has tamed the combinatorics ofperturbative contributions, to anomalous dimensions in Yukawa theory and scalar$\phi^3$ theory, from all nestings and chainings of a primitive self-energysubdivergence. Here we formulate the nonperturbative problems which theseresummations approximate. For Yukawa theory, at spacetime dimension $d=4$, weobtain an integrodifferential Dyson-Schwinger equation and solve itparametrically in terms of the complementary error function. For the scalartheory, at $d=6$, the nonperturbative problem is more severe; we transform itto a nonlinear fourth-order differential equation. After intensive use ofsymbolic computation we find an algorithm that extends both perturbation seriesto 500 loops in 7 minutes. Finally, we establish the propagator-couplingduality underlying these achievements making use of the Hopf structure ofFeynman diagrams.
