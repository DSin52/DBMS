Consistent interactions among a set of two-form gauge fields in fourdimensions are derived along a Hamiltonian cohomological procedure. It is shownthat the deformation of the BRST charge and BRST-invariant Hamiltonian for thefree model leads to the Freedman-Townsend interaction vertex. The resultinginteraction deforms both the gauge transformations and reducibility relations,but not the algebra of gauge transformations.
