We study the magnetic analogue of Myers' Dielectric Effect and, in somecases, relate it to the blowing up of particles into branes, first investigatedby Greevy, Susskind and Toumbas. We show that $D0$ branes or gravitons in Mtheory, moving in a magnetic four-form field strength background expand into anon-commutative two sphere. Both examples of constant magnetic field andnon-constant fields in curved backgrounds generated by branes are considered.We find, in all cases, another solution, consisting of a two-brane wrapping aclassical two-sphere, which has all the quantum numbers of the $D0$ branes.Motivated by this, we investigate the blowing up of gravitons into branes inbackgrounds different from $AdS_m \times S^n$. We find the phenomenon is quitegeneral. In many cases with less or even no supersymmetry we find a braneconfiguration which has the same quantum numbers and the same energy as amassless particle in supergravity.
