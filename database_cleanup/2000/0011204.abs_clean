We obtain the spectrum of glueball masses for the N=1 non-conformal cascadetheory whose supergravity dual was recently constructed by Klebanov andStrassler. The glueball masses are calculated by solving the supergravityequations of motion for the dilaton and the two-form in the deformed conifoldbackground.
