We give a detailed study of the critical points of the potentials of thesimplest non-trivial N=2 gauged Yang-Mills/Einstein supergravity theories withtensor multiplets. The scalar field target space of these examples isSO(1,1)XSO(2,1)/SO(2). The possible gauge groups are SO(2)XU(1)_R andSO(1,1)XU(1)_R, where U(1)_R is a subgroup of the R-symmetry group SU(2)_R, andSO(2) and SO(1,1) are subgroups of the isometry group of the scalar manifold.The scalar potentials of these theories consist of a contribution from theU(1)_R gauging and a contribution that is due to the presence of the tensorfields. We find that the latter contribution can change the form of thesupersymmetric extrema from maxima to saddle points. In addition, it leads tonovel critical points not present in the corresponding gaugedYang-Mills/Einstein supergravity theories without the tensor multiplets. Forthe SO(2)XU(1)_R gauged theory these novel critical points correspond toanti-de Sitter ground states. For the non-compact SO(1,1)XU(1)_R gauging, thenovel ground states are de Sitter. The analysis of the critical points of thepotential carries over in a straightforward manner to the generic family of N=2gauged Yang-Mills/Einstein supergravity theories coupled to tensor multipletswhose scalar manifolds are of the form SO(1,1)XSO(n-1,1)/SO(n-1).
