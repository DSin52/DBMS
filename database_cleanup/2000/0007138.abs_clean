We show that the dissipation term in the Hamiltonian for a couple ofclassical damped-amplified oscillators manifests itself as a geometric phaseand is actually responsible for the appearance of the zero point energy in thequantum spectrum of the 1D linear harmonic oscillator. We also discuss thethermodynamical features of the system. Our work has been inspired by 't Hooftproposal according to which information loss in certain classical systems maylead to ``an apparent quantization of the orbits which resembles the quantumstructure seen in the real world".
