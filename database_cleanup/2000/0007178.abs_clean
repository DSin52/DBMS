By generalizing the auxiliary field term in the Lagrangian of simplicialchiral models on a (d-1)-dimensional simplex, the generalized simplicial chiralmodels has been introduced in \c{Ali}. These models can be solved analyticallyonly in d=0 and d=2 cases at large-N limit. In d=0 case, we calculate theeigenvalue density function in strong regime and show that the partitionfunction computed from this density function is consistent with one calculatedby path integration directly. In d=2 case, it is shown that all $V= {\rmTr}(AA^{\d})^n$ models have a third order phase transition, same as the2-dimensional Yang-Mills theory.
