"Physical Variables in Gauge Theories", Dubna (Russia), 21-25 September 1999(to appear in the proceedings)We investigate the Poisson-Sigma model on the classical and quantum level. Inthe classical analysis we show how this model includes various knowntwo-dimensional field theories. Then we perform the calculation of the pathintegral in a general gauge, and demonstrate that the derived partitionfunction reduces to the familiar form in the case of 2d Yang-Mills theory.
