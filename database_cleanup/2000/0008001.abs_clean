We find the gravity solution corresponding to a large number of NS or Dfivebranes wrapped on a two sphere so that we have pure ${\cal N}=1$ superYang-Mills in the IR. The supergravity solution is smooth, it shows confinementand it breaks the $U(1)_R$ chiral symmetry in the appropriate way. When thegravity approximation is valid the masses of glueballs are comparable to themasses of Kaluza Klein states on the fivebrane, but if we could quantizestrings on this background it looks like we should be able to decouple the KKstates.
