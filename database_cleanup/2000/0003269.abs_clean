We consider Randall-Sundrum model with localized gravity, replacing the extracompact space-like dimension by a time-like one. In this way the solution tothe hierarchy problem can be reconciled with a correct cosmological expansionof the visible universe, just as a trivial result of the sign flip ofcosmological constants in the bulk and on the 3-branes relative to the case ofextra space-like dimension. Some phenomenological aspects of the proposedscenario related to the tachyonic nature of Kaluza-Klein states of graviton arealso discussed.
