Comments: 13 pages. Talk presented at the Nordic Network On String Theory held

at the Niels Bohr Institute, Copenhagen in May 2000We study a bosonic open string coupled to a tachyonic background field $T[X]$and find that the tachyon field can effectively be replaced by a configurationof D-branes placed at either the zeros or the critical points of $T[X]$,depending on our choice of boundary conditions. This dual picture of the openstring tachyon is explored in detail for the explicit case when the tachyonicfield is quadratic.
