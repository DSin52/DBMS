It is a general belief that the only possible way to consistently deform thePauli-Fierz action, changing also the gauge algebra, is general relativity.Here we show that a different type of deformation exists in three dimensions ifone allows for PT non-invariant terms. The new gauge algebra is different fromthat of diffeomorphisms. Furthermore, this deformation can be generalized tothe case of a collection of massless spin-two fields. In this case it describesa consistent interaction among them.
