Authors: Seif Randjbar-Daemi and Mikhail Shaposhnikov

Comments: Latex, 5 pages. A factor "2" mistake that propagated through a number

of equations is corrected. Conclusions unchangedJournal-ref: Phys.Lett. B492 (2000) 361-364

We study localization of bulk fermions on a brane with inclusion ofYang-Mills and scalar backgrounds in higher dimensions and give the conditionsunder which localized chiral fermions can be obtained.
