We give a path integral derivation of the annulus diagram in a supersymmetrictheory of open and closed strings with Dbranes. We compute the pair correlationfunction of Wilson loops in the generic weakly coupled supersymmetric flatspacetime background with Dbranes. We obtain a -u^4/r^9 potential between heavynonrelativistic sources in a supersymmetric gauge theory at short distances.
