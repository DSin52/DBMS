We investigate how much a first-quantized charged bosonic test string getsexcited after crossing a shock wave generated by a charged particle with mass$\tilde{M}$ and charge $\tilde{Q}$. On the basis of Kaluza-Klein theory, we payattention to a closed string model where charge is given by a momentum along acompactified extra-dimension. The shock wave is given by a chargedAichelburg-Sexl (CAS) spacetime where $\tilde{Q}=0$ corresponds to the ordinaryAichelburg-Sexl one. We first show that the CAS spacetime is a solution to theequations of motion for the metric, the gauge field, and the axion field in thelow-energy limit. Secondly, we compute the mass expectation value of thecharged test string after passing through the shock wave in the CAS spacetime.In the case of small $\tilde{Q}$, gravitational and Coulomb forces arecanceled out each other and hence the excitation of the string remains verysmall. This is independent of the particle mass $\tilde{M}$ or the strength ofthe shock wave. In the case of large $\tilde{Q}$, however, every charged stringgets highly excited by quantum fluctuation in the extra-dimension caused byboth the gauge and the axion fields. This is quite different from classical"molecule", which consists of two electrically charged particles connected by aclassical spring.
