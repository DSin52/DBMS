Recently it was shown that NCOS theories are part of a ten-dimensional theoryknown as Non-relativistic Wound string theory. We clarify the sense in whichgravity is present in this theory. We show that Wound string theory containsexceptional unwound strings, including a graviton, which mediate the previouslydiscovered instantaneous long-range interactions, but are negligible asasymptotic states. Unwound strings also provide the expected collectivecoordinates for the transverse D-branes in the theory. These and other resultsare shown to follow both from a direct analysis of the effect of the NCOS limiton the parent string theory, and from the worldsheet formalism developed byGomis and Ooguri, about which we make some additional remarks. We also devotesome attention to supergravity duals, and in particular show that the open andclosed strings of the theory are respectively described by short and longstrings on the supergravity side.
