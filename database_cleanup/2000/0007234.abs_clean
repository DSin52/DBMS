We find the Holographic Renormalization Group equations for the holographicduals of generic gravity theories coupled to form fields and spin-1/2 fermions.Using Hamilton-Jacobi theory we discuss the structure of Ward identities,anomalies, and the recursive equations for determining the divergent terms ofthe generating functional. In particular, the Ward identity associated todiffeomorphism invariance contains an anomalous contribution that, however, canbe solved either by a suitable counter term or by imposing a condition on theboundary fields. Consistency conditions for the existence of the dual arise, ifone requires that a Callan-Symanzik type equation follows from the Hamiltonianconstraint. Under mild assumptions we are able to find a class of solutions tothe constraint equations. The structure of the fermionic phase space andconstraints is treated extensively for any dimension and signature.
