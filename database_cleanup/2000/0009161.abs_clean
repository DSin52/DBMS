In the previous paper, we generalized the method of Abelian decomposition tothe case of SO(N) Yang-Mills theory. This method that was proposed by Faddeevand Niemi introduces a set of variables for describing the infrared limit of aYang-Mills theory. Here, we extend the decomposition method further to thegeneral case of four-dimensional Sp(2N) Yang-Mills theory. We find that theSp(2N) connection decomposes according to irreducible representations of SO(N).
