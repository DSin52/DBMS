Title: Regularization of 2d supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory via non

commutative geometryJournal-ref: Class.Quant.Grav. 17 (2000) 4491-4514

The non commutative geometry is a possible framework to regularize QuantumField Theory in a nonperturbative way. This idea is an extension of the latticeapproximation by non commutativity that allows to preserve symmetries. Thesupersymmetric version is also studied and more precisely in the case of theSchwinger model on supersphere [14]. This paper is a generalization of thislatter work to more general gauge groups.
