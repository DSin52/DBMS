We compute the one loop Casimir energy of an interacting scalar field in acompact noncommutative space of $R^{1,d}\times T^2_\theta$, where we haveordinary flat $1+d$ dimensional Minkowski space and two dimensionalnoncommuative torus. We find that next order correction due to thenoncommutativity still contributes an attractive force and thus will have aquantum instability. However, the case of vector field in a periodic boundarycondition gives repulsive force for $d>5$ and we expect a stabilized radius.This suggests a stabilization mechanism for a senario in Kaluza-Klein theory,where some of the extra dimensions are noncommutative.
