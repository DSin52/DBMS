We propose a new ``bigravity'' model with two positive tension AdS_4 branesin AdS_5 bulk and no negative tension branes. The bounce of the ``warp'' factormimics the effect of a negative brane and thus gives rise to an anomalouslylight graviton KK mode. This configuration satisfies the weak energy conditionand has no ghost state. In addition, the extra polarization states of themassive graviton practically decouple and thus it does not contradict toEinsteinian gravity. However, the model has certain phenomenologicaldifficulties associated with the presence of a negative cosmological constanton the branes.
