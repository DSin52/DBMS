Faddeev and Niemi have proposed a decomposition of SU(N) Yang-Mills theory interms of new variables, appropriate for describing the theory in the infraredlimit. We extend this method to SO(2N) Yang-Mills theory. We find that theSO(2N) connection decomposes according to irreducible representations of SO(N).The low energy limit of the decomposed theory is expected to describesoliton-like configurations with nontrivial topological numbers. How the methodof decomposition generalizes for $SO(2N+1)$ Yang-Mills theory is alsodiscussed.
