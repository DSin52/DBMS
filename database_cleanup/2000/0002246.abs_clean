Title: Reflexive Polyhedra and their Applications in String and F-theory

Authors: Harald Skarke

Comments: Contribution to the proceedings of the TMR meeting "Quantum Aspects

of Gauge Theories, Supersymmetry and Unification" held in Paris in September1999; 8 pagesThis is an informal introduction to the concept of reflexive polyhedra andsome of their most important applications in perturbative and non-perturbativestring physics. Following the historical development, topics like mirrorsymmetry, gauged linear sigma models, and the geometrical structures relevantto string and F-theory dualities are discussed. Finally some recentdevelopments concerning the classification of reflexive polyhedra arementioned.
