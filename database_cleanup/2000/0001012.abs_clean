Liouville conformal field theory is considered with conformal boundary. Thereis a family of conformal boundary conditions parameterized by the boundarycosmological constant, so that observables depend on the dimensional ratios ofboundary and bulk cosmological constants. The disk geometry is considered. Wepresent an explicit expression for the expectation value of a bulk operatorinside the disk and for the two-point function of boundary operators. Wecomment also on the properties of the degenrate boundary operators. Possibleapplications and further developments are discussed. In particular, we presentexact expectation values of the boundary operators in the boundary sin-Gordonmodel.
