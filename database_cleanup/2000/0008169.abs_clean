Title: Low-Energy Effective Action in N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theories

Authors: I.L. Buchbinder

Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX, Talk given at the Conference "Quantization, Gauge

Theory, and Strings" dedicated to the memory of Professor Efim Fradkin, June5-10, 2000, Moscow, to be published in the ProceedingsWe review a recent progress in constructing low-energy effective action inN=4 super Yang-Mills theories. Using harmonic superspace approach we considerN=4 SYM in terms of unconstrained N=2 superfield and apply N=2 background fieldmethod to finding effective action for N=4 SU(n) SYM broken down toU(n)$^{n-1}$. General structure of leading low-energy corrections to effectiveaction is discussed.
