We derive nonperturbative classical solutions of noncommutative U(1) gaugetheory, with or without a Higgs field, representing static magnetic flux tubeswith arbitrary cross-section. The fields are nonperturbatively different fromthe vacuum in at least some region of space. The flux of these tubes isquantized in natural units. We also point out that magnetic monopole charge canbe fractionized by embedding the monopoles in a constant magnetic field.
