In this paper we address various issues connected with transverse spin inlight front QCD. The transverse spin operators, in $A^+ = 0$ gauge, expressedin terms of the dynamical variables are explicitly interaction dependent unlikethe helicity operator which is interaction independent in the topologicallytrivial sector of light-front QCD. Although it cannot be separated into anorbital and a spin part, we have shown that there exists an interestingdecomposition of the transverse spin operator. We discuss the physicalrelevance of such a decomposition. We perform a one loop renormalization of thefull transverse spin operator in light-front Hamiltonian perturbation theoryfor a dressed quark state. We explicitly show that all the terms dependent onthe center of mass momenta get canceled in the matrix element. The entirenon-vanishing contribution comes from the fermion intrinsic -like part of thetransverse spin operator as a result of cancellation between the gluonicintrinsic-like and the orbital-like part of the transverse spin operator. Wecompare and contrast the calculations of transverse spin and helicity of adressed quark in perturbation theory.
