Title: BPS D-branes after Tachyon Condensation

Authors: Takao Suyama

Comments: 12 pages, references added

We construct an effective action describing brane-antibrane system containingN D-branes and N \bar{D}-branes. BPS equations for remaining D-branes aftertachyon condensation are derived and their properties are investigated. Thevalue of the D-brane tension and the number of brane bound states arediscussed.
