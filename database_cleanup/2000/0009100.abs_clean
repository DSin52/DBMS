We construct explicitly the open descendants of some exceptional automorphisminvariants of U(2N) orbifolds. We focus on the case N=pq, p and q prime, and onthe automorphisms of the diagonal and charge conjugation invariants that existfor these values of N. These correspond to orbifolds of the circle with radiusR^2=2p/q. For each automorphism invariant we find two consistent Klein bottles,and for each Klein bottle we find a complete (and probably unique) set ofboundary states. The two Klein bottles are in each case related to each otherby simple currents, but surprisingly for the automorphism of the chargeconjugation invariant neither of the Klein bottle choices is the canonical(symmetric) one.
