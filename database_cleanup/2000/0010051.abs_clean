We consider a new momentum cut-off scheme for sums over zero-point energies,containing an arbitrary function f(k) which interpolates smoothly between thezero-point energies of the modes around the kink and those in flat space. Aterm proportional to df(k)/dk modifies the result for the one-loop quantum massM^(1) as obtained from naive momentum cut-off regularization, which now agreeswith previous results, both for the nonsusy and susy case. We also introduce anew regularization scheme for the evaluation of the one-loop correction to thecentral charge Z^(1), with a cut-off K for the Dirac delta function in thecanonical commutation relations and a cut-off \Lambda for the loop momentum.The result for Z^(1) depends only on whether K>\Lambda or K<\Lambda orK=\Lambda. The last case yields the correct result and saturates the BPS bound,M^(1)=Z^(1),in agreement with the fact that multiplet shortening does occur inthis N=(1,1) system. We show how to apply mode number regularization byconsidering first a kink-antikink system, and also obtain the correct resultwith this method. Finally we discuss the relation of these new schemes toprevious approaches based on the Born expansion of phase shifts andhigher-derivative regularization.
