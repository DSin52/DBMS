A review of various aspects of superstrings in background electromagneticfields is presented. Topics covered include the Born-Infeld action, spectrum ofopen strings in background gauge fields, the Schwinger mechanism,finite-temperature formalism and Hagedorn behaviour in external fields, Debyescreening, D-brane scattering, thermodynamics of D-branes, and noncommutativefield and string theories on D-branes. The electric field instabilities areemphasized throughout and contrasted with the case of magnetic fields. A newderivation of the velocity-dependent potential between moving D-branes ispresented, as is a new result for the velocity corrections to the one-loopthermal effective potential.
