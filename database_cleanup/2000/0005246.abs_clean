We obtain a large class of AdS spacetimes warped with certain internal spacesin eleven-dimensional and type IIA/IIB supergravities. The warp factors dependonly on the internal coordinates. These solutions arise as the near-horizongeometries of more general semi-localised multi-intersections of $p$-branes. Weachieve this by noting that any sphere (or AdS spacetime) of dimension greaterthan 3 can be viewed as a foliation involving S^3 (or AdS_3). Then the S^3 (orAdS_3) can be replaced by a three-dimensional lens space (or a BTZ black hole),which arises naturally from the introduction of a NUT (or a pp-wave) to theM-branes or the D3-brane. We then obtain multi-intersections by performing aKaluza-Klein reduction or Hopf T-duality transformation on the fibre coordinateof the lens space (or the BTZ black hole). These geometries provide furtherpossible examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence and of consistent embeddings oflower-dimensional gauged supergravities in D=11 or D=10.
