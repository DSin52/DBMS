We derive Brown-Henneaux's commutation relation and central charge in theframework of the path integral. If we use the leading part of the asymptoticsymmetry to derive the Ward-Takahashi identity, we can see the central chargearises from the fact that the boundary condition of the path integral is notinvariant under the transformation.
