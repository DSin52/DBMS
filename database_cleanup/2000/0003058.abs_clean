A necessary condition for the validity of the holographic principle is theof the area of a circumscribing surface measured in Planck areas. This boundcannot be derived at present from consensus fundamental theory. We show withsuitable {\it gedanken} experiments that the holographic bound follows from thegeneralized second law of thermodynamics for both generic weakly gravitatingisolated systems and for isolated, quiescent and nonrotating stronglygravitating configurations well above Planck mass. These results justifySusskind's early claim that the holographic bound can be gotten from the secondlaw.
