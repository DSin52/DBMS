The near boundary limit of string theory in AdS_3 is analysed using theWakimoto free field representation of SL(2,R). The theory is considered as adirect product of the SL(2,R)/U(1) coset and a free boson. Correlationfunctions are constructed generalizing to the non-compact case the integralrepresentation of conformal blocks introduced by Dotsenko in the compact SU(2)CFT. Sectors of the theory obtained by spectral flow manifestly appear. Theformalism naturally leads to consider scattering processes violating windingnumber conservation. The consistency of the procedure is verified in thefactorization limit.
