We discuss questions related to renormalization group and to nonperturbativeaspects of non-Abelian gauge theories with N=2 and/or N=1 supersymmetry.Results on perturbative and nonperturbative $\beta$ functions of these theoriesare reviewed, and new mechanisms of confinement and dynamical symmetry breakingrecently found in a class of $SU(n_c)$, $USp(2n_c)$ and $SO(n_c)$ theories arediscussed.
