Searching for space/time noncommutativity we reconsider open strings in aconstant background electric field. The main difference between this situationand its magnetic counterpart is that here there is a critical electric fieldbeyond which the theory does not make sense. We show that this critical fieldprevents us from finding a limit in which the theory becomes a field theory ona noncommutative spacetime. However, an appropriate limit toward the criticalfield leads to a novel noncritical string theory on a noncommutative spacetime.
