We find a class of exact solutions of noncommutative gauge theoriescorresponding to unstable non-BPS solitons. In the two-dimensional euclidean(or 2+1 dimensional lorentzian) U(1) theory we find localized solutionscarrying nonzero magnetic flux. In four euclidean dimensions we find non-BPSsolutions with the same Pontrjagin charge but greater energy than the usualself-dual Yang-Mills instanton. We conjecture that these solutions andgeneralizations thereof correspond to nonsupersymmetric configurations ofD-(p-2k) branes (or intersections thereof) in a D-p brane in the noncommutativescaling limit of large B-field. In the particular case of a 0-brane on a2-brane the analysis of small fluctuations reveals an infinite tower of stateswhich agrees exactly with that of the 0-2 CFT in the scaling limit. Thespectrum contains a tachyon, and we show explicitly that the endpoint oftachyon condensation corresponds to the 0-brane dissolved in the 2-brane.
