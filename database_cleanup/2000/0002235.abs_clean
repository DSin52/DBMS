Title: Aspects of holography and rotating AdS black holes

Authors: D. S. Berman

Comments: 6 pages latex, Talk given at the TMR conference ``Quantum aspects of

gauge theories, supersymmetry and unification", Paris Sept. 1999A comparison is made between the thermodynamics of weakly and stronglycoupled Yang-Mills with fixed angular momentum. The free energy of the stronglycoupled Yang-Mills is calculated by using a dual supergravity descriptioncorresponding to a rotating black hole in an Anti de Sitter (AdS) background.All thermodynamic quantities are shown have the same ratio of 3/4 (independentof angular momentum) between strong and weak coupling.
