It has been conjectured that an extremum of the tachyon potential of abosonic D-brane represents the vacuum without any D-brane, and that varioustachyonic lump solutions represent D-branes of lower dimension. We show thatthe tree level effective action of p-adic string theory, the expression forwhich is known exactly, provides an explicit realisation of these conjectures.
