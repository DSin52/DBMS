A deSitter brane-world bounding regions of anti-deSitter space has amacroscopic entropy given by one-quarter the area of the observer horizon. Aproposed variant of the AdS/CFT correspondence gives a dual description of thiscosmology as conformal field theory coupled to gravity in deSitter space. Inthe case of two-dimensional deSitter space this provides a microscopicderivation of the entropy, including the one-quarter, as quantum entanglementof the conformal field theory across the horizon.
