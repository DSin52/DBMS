The exact renormalisation group equation is studied for a two-dimensionaltheory with exponential interaction and a background charge at infinity. Themotivation for studying this interaction is the flow between unitary minimalmodels perturbed by Phi_{(1,3)}, and their realisation in terms of a quantumgroup restricted sine-Gordon model.
