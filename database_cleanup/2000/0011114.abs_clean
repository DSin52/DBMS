In this note we consider compactifications of ${\cal M}$-theory on$Spin(7)$-holonomy manifolds to three-dimensional Minkowski space. In thesecompactifications a warp factor is included. The conditions for unbroken N=1supersymmetry give rise to determining equations for the 4-form field strengthin terms of the warp factor and the self-dual 4-form of the internal manifold.
