The generalized *-products, or the $*_N$-products, appear both in theone-loop effective action of noncommutative Yang-Mills theories and in thecoupling of a closed string to N open strings on a disk when the D-braneworld-volume is noncommutative. Factorization of the string amplitudes providesa uniform understanding of the $*_N$-products and a hint to obtain a simple,explicit formula (in the momentum space) for arbitrary N in the non-Abeliancase. Possible extension to a more general ${}_M *_{N}$-product in the M-loopcontext is discussed.
