We construct unitary representations of (1,0) and (2,0) superconformalalgebras in six dimensions by using superfields defined on harmonic superspaceswith coset manifolds USp(2n)/[U(1)]^n, n=1,2. In the spirit of the AdS_7/CFT_6correspondence massless conformal fields correspond to "supersingletons" inAdS_7. By tensoring them we produce all short representations corresponding to1/2 and 1/4 BPS anti-de Sitter bulk states of which "massless bulk"representations are particular cases.
