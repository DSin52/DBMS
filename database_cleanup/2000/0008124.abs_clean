Title: Induced gravity with complex metric field

Authors: W.F. Kao

Comments: 4 pages, some typos corrected

The possible existence of a complex metric tensor field is studied. We showthat an effective scalar field is induced by an overall phase component of thecomplex metric tensor. The corresponding gauge field is shown to be a tachyon.Possible implications of this scalar field to the no hair theorem in aspherically symmetric space is also analyzed. We also study its impact on theevolution of the early universe.
