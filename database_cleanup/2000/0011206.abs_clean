We analyze open and mixed sector tree-level amplitudes of N=2 strings in aspace-time with (2,2) signature, in the presence of constant B field. Theexpected topological nature of string amplitudes in the open sector is shown toimpose nontrivial constraints on the corresponding noncommutative field theory.In the mixed sector, we first compute a 3-point function and show that thecorresponding field theory is written in terms of a generalized *-product. Wealso analyze a 4-point function (A_{oooc}) of the mixed sector in Theta --->infinity limit.
