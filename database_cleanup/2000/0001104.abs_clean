The role of the (dynamical) dilaton in the vortices associated with thespontaneous breaking of an anomalous U(1) from heterotic string theory isexamined. We demonstrate how the anomaly (and the coupling to thedilaton/axion) can appear in the Lagrangian and associated field equations as acontrolled perturbation about the standard Nielsen-Olesen equations. In such apicture, the additional field equation for the dilaton becomes a series ofcorrections to a constant dilaton vev as the anomaly is turned on. Inparticular we find that even the first nontrivial correction to a constantdilaton generically leads to a (positive) logarithmic divergence of theheterotic dilaton near the vortex core. Since the dilaton field governs thestrength of quantum fluctuations in string theory, this runaway behaviourimplies that anomalous U(1) vortices in string theory are intrinsically quantummechanical objects.
