Title: Seiberg-Witten theory and duality in integrable systems

Comments: 27 pages, LaTeX (for Proceedings of the XXXIV PNPI Winter School);

misprints and LaTeX errors are correctedThese lectures are devoted to the low energy limit of \N2 SUSY gaugetheories, which is described in terms of integrable systems. A special emphasisis on a duality that naturally acts on these integrable systems. The dualityturns out to be an effective tool in constructing the double ellipticintegrable system which describes the six-dimensional Seiberg-Witten theory. Atthe same time, it implies a series of relations between other Seiberg-Wittensystems.
