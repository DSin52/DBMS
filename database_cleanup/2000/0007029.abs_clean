A five-dimensional solution to Einstein's equations coupled to a scalar fieldthe effect of arbitrary vacuum energy (tension) of a 3-brane is cancelled;however, the scalar field becomes singular at some finite proper distance inthe extra dimension. We show that in the original model with a vanishing bulkpotential for the scalar, the solution is a saddle point which is unstable toexpansion or contraction of the brane world. We construct exact time-dependentsolutions which generalize the static solution, and demonstrate that they donot conserve energy on the brane; thus they do not have an effective 4-D fieldtheoretic description. When a bulk scalar field potential is added, theboundary conditions on the brane cannot be trivially satisfied, raising hopethat the self-tuning mechanism may still give some insight into thecosmological constant problem in this case.
