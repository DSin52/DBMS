The vanishing cosmological constant in the four dimensional space-time isobtained in a 5D Randall-Sundrum model with a brane (B1) located at $y=0$. Thematter fields can be located at the brane. For settling any vacuum energygenerated at the brane to zero, we need a three index antisymmetric tensorfield $A_{MNP}$ with a specific form for the Lagrangian. For the self-tuningmechanism, the bulk cosmological constant should be negative.
