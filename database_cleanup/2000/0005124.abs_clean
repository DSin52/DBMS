We study the bulk effective theory of a class of orbifolds of the type IIBstring with D5-branes, compactified to four dimensions. These constructions areconnected, in a region of their moduli space, to some orbifolds of the type Iand heterotic string. We compare the effective actions through the coupling ofthe R^2 term, and we argue that these orbifolds provide non-perturbativedeformations of the latter, in which the gauge group is entirelynon-perturbative.
