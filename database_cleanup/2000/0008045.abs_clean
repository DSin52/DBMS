We extend dimensional regularization to the case of compact spaces. Contraryto previous regularization schemes employed for nonlinear sigma models on afinite time interval (``quantum mechanical path integrals in curved space'')dimensional regularization requires only a covariant finite two-loopcounterterm. This counterterm is nonvanishing and given by R/8.
