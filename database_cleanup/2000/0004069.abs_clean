We investigate how a dynamical mass of a fermion is affected by a topologicalmass of a gauge field in a Maxwell-Chern-Simons $QED_3$ coupled with atwo-component fermion. The dynamical mass and also a parity condensate areestimated by using a non-perturbative Schwinger-Dyson method. In particular, westudy a limit of vanishing the topological mass in detail and clarify a linkingbetween theories with and without a Chern-Simons term in a non-perturbativelevel.
