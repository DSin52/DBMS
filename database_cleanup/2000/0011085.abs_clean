Conformal invariant new forms of $p$-brane and D$p$-brane actions arefields, an auxiliary metric and an auxiliary scalar field that implements theWeyl invariance. This scalar field transforms with a conformal weight thatdepends on the brane dimension. The proposed actions are Weyl invariant in anydimension and the elimination of the auxiliary metric and the scalar fieldreproduces the Nambu-Goto action for $p$-branes and the Born-Infeld action forD$p$-branes. As a consequence of the fact that in the $p$-brane case, theaction is quadratic in $\partial_0 X$, we develop a complete construction forthe associated canonical formalism, solving the problem in previousformulations of conformal $p$-brane actions where the Hamiltonian can not beconstructed. We obtain the algebra of constraints and identify the generator ofthe Weyl symmetry. In the construction of the corresponding supersymmetricgeneralization of this conformal $p$-brane action we show that the associated$\kappa$-symmetry is consistent with the conformal invariance. In theD$p$-brane case, the actions are quadratic in the gauge fields. These actionscan be used to construct new conformal couplings in any dimension $p$ to theauxiliary scalar field now promoted as a dynamical variable.
