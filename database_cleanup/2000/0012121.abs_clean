We discuss the interactions of Goldstone particles with solitonic states. Weobserve that, contrary to the familiar situation in the vacuum sector, theGoldstone particles can have non-derivative interactions with the solitons.This result is applied to brane physics and in particular leads to thepossibility that neutrinos in brane world scenarios are Goldstone particles forbroken supersymmetry.
