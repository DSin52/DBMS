We compute the conserved charges for Kerr anti-de Sitter spacetimes invarious dimensions using the conformal and the counterterm prescriptions. Weshow that the conserved charge corresponding to the global timelike killingvector computed by the two methods differ by a constant dependent on therotation parameter and cosmological constant in odd spacetime dimensions,whereas the charge corresponding to the rotational killing vector is the samein either approach. We comment on possible implications of our results to theAdS/CFT correspondence.
