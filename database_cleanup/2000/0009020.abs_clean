In this paper we give a general introduction to supersymmetric spin networks.Its construction has a direct interpretation in context of the representationtheory of the superalgebra. In particular we analyze a special kind of spinnetworks with superalgebra $Osp(1|2n)$. It turns out that the set ofcorresponding spin network states forms an orthogonal basis of the Hilbertspace $\cal L\mit^2(\cal A\mit/\cal G)$, and this argument holds even in theq-deformed case. The $Osp(n|2)$ spin networks are also discussed briefly. Weexpect they could provide useful techniques to quantum supergravity and gaugefield theories from the point of non-perturbative view.
