Title: Integrable hierarchies from BRST-anti-BRST gauge-fixing

Authors: V. Calian

Comments: 7 pages

The BRST formulation is used in order to derive the existence criterion forclassical bi-Hamiltonian systems, based on non-anomalous deformation of thegauge-fixing structure. The recursion operator is then used to provide theentire hierarchy of integrable models associated to the original BRST andanti-BRST charges.
