It is shown that the reduced particle dynamics of 2+1 dimensional gravity inthe maximally slicing gauge has hamiltonian form. This is proved directly forthe two body problem and for the three body problem by using the Garnierequations for isomonodromic transformations. For a number of particles greaterthan three the existence of the hamiltonian is shown to be a consequence of aconjecture by Polyakov which connects the auxiliary parameters of the fuchsiandifferential equation which solves the SU(1,1) Riemann-Hilbert problem, to theLiouville action of the conformal factor which describes the space-metric. Wegive the exact diffeomorphism which transforms the expression of the spinningcone geometry in the Deser, Jackiw, 't Hooft gauge to the maximally slicinggauge. It is explicitly shown that the boundary term in the action, written inhamiltonian form gives the hamiltonian for the reduced particle dynamics. Thequantum mechanical translation of the two particle hamiltonian gives rise tothe logarithm of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a cone whose angular deficitis given by the total energy of the system irrespective of the masses of theparticles thus proving at the quantum level a conjecture by 't Hooft on the twoparticle dynamics. The quantum mechanical Green's function for the two bodyproblem is given.
