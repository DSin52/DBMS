We analyze the nature of space-time nonlocality in string theory. Aftergiving a brief overview on the conjecture of the space-time uncertaintyprinciple, a (semi-classical) reformulation of string quantum mechanics, inwhich the dynamics is represented by the noncommutativity between temporal andspatial coordinates, is outlined. The formalism is then compared to thespace-time noncommutative field theories associated with nonzero electricB-fields.
