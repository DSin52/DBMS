We discuss some formal aspects of quantum anomalies with an emphasis on theregularization of field theory. We briefly review how ambiguities inperturbation theory have been resolved by various regularization schemes. Tosingle out the true quantum anomaly among ambiguities, the combined ideas ofPCAC, soft pion limit and renormalizability were essential. As for the formaltreatment of quantum anomalies, we mainly discuss the path integral formulationboth in continuum and lattice theories. In particular, we discuss in somedetail the recent development in the treatment of chiral anomalies in latticegauge theory.
