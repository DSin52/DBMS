Title: Gravity as Lorentz Force

Authors: Yu.M. Zinoviev

Comments: 22 pages

The main object of the proposed theory is not a pseudometric, but a symmetricaffine connection on the Minkowski space. The coefficients of this connectionhave one upper and two lower indices. These coefficients are symmetric withrespect to the permutation of the lower indices. We identify the convolution ofthe connection coefficients with the vector - potential of the electromagneticfield. Then the gravity is the Lorentz force of this electromagnetic field.
