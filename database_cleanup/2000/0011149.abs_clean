We find the analogue of the Boillat metric of Born-Infeld theory for theM5-brane. We show that it provides the propagation cone of {\sl all} 5-branedegrees. In an arbitrary background field, this cone never lies outside theEinstein cone. An energy momentum tensor for the three-form is defined andshown to satisfy the Dominant Energy Condition. The theory is shown to be welldefined for all values of the magnetic field but there is a limiting electricfield strength. We consider the strong coupling limit of the M5-brane and showthat the corresponding theory is conformally invariant and admits infinitelymany conservation laws. On reduction to the Born-Infeld case this agrees withthe work of Bia{\l}nicki-Birula.
