We discuss here the possibility to write the Liouville-Vlasov equation forthe Wigner-function of a spinor field coupled to a gauge field with fieldstrength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ in a curved space-time versus a local Lorentzmanifold (introduction of local Lorentz coordinates) with an appropriatedefinition of a covariant derivative carried out using a spin connection$B_{\mu}^{ab}(x)$.
