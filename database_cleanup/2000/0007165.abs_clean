Title: Fractional Supersymmetry through Generalized Anyonic algebra

Authors: J.Douari and Y.Hassouni

Comments: 8 pages

The construction of anyonic operators and algebra is generalized by usingquons operators. Therefore, the particular versionof fractional supersymmetryis constructed on the two-dimensional lattice by associating two generalizedanyons of different kinds. The fractional supersymmetry Hamiltonian operator isobtained on the two-dimensional lattice and the quantum algebra $U_{q}(sl_{2})$is realized.
