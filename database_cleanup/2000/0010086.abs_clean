Title: Rank 48 gauge group in heterotic string

Authors: Andrea Gregori

Comments: 10 pages, latex, one section with comments added

We discuss the existence of a non-perturbative gauge sector that can raisethe rank of the gauge group of the N_4=2 heterotic string up to 48. These gaugebosons, that don't exist in six dimensions, co-exist with those originatingfrom small instantons shrinking to zero size.
