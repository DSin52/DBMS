Consideration of the Noether variational problem for any theory whose actionis invariant under global and/or local gauge transformations leads to threedistinct theorems. These include the familiar Noether theorem, but also twoequally important but much less well-known results. We present, in a generalform, all the main results relating to the Noether variational problem forgauge theories, and we show the relationships between them. These results holdfor both Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories.
