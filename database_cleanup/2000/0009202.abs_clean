We review (mainly) quantum effects in the theories where gravity sector isdescribed by metric and dilaton. The one-loop effective action for dilatonicgravity in two and four dimensions is evaluated. Renormalization groupequations are constructed. The conformal anomaly and induced effective actionfor 2d and 4d dilaton coupled theories are found. It is applied to study ofquantum aspects of black hole thermodynamics, like calculation of Hawkingradiation and quantum corrections to black hole parameters and investigation ofquantum instability for such objects with multiple horizons. The use of aboveeffective action in the construction of non-singular cosmological models inEinstein or Brans-Dicke (super)gravity and investigation of induced wormholesin supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory are given.5d dilatonic gravity (bosonic sector of compactified IIB supergravity) isdiscussed in connection with bulk/boundary (or AdS/CFT) correspondence. Runninggauge coupling and quark-antiquark potential for boundary gauge theory at zeroor non-zero temperature are calculated from d=5 dilatonic Anti-de Sitter-likebackground solution which represents Anti-de Sitter black hole for periodictime.
