We derive general low energy dynamics of monopoles and dyons in N=2 and N=4supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories by utilising a collective coordinateexpansion. The resulting new kind of supersymmetric quantum mechanicsincorporates the effects of multiple Higgs fields, both in the N=2 vectormultiplet and hypermultiplets, having non-vanishing expectation values.
