These are notes based on lectures given at TASI99. We review the geometry ofthe moduli space of N=2 theories in four dimensions from the point of view ofsuperstring compactification. The cases of a type IIA or type IIB stringcompactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold and the heterotic string compactified onK3xT2 are each considered in detail. We pay specific attention to thedifferences between N=2 theories and N>2 theories. The moduli spaces of vectormultiplets and the moduli spaces of hypermultiplets are reviewed. In the caseof hypermultiplets this review is limited by the poor state of our currentunderstanding. Some peculiarities such as ``mixed instantons'' and thenon-existence of a universal hypermultiplet are discussed.
