We reformulate maximal D=5 supergravity in the consistent approach uniquelybased on Free Differential Algebras and the solution of their Bianchiidentities (= rheonomic method). In this approach the lagrangian is unnecessarysince the field equations follow from closure of the supersymmetry algebra.This enables us to explicitly construct the non-compact gaugings correspondingto the non--semisimple algebras CSO(p,q,r), irrespectively from the existenceof a lagrangian. The use of Free Differential Algebras is essential to clarify,within a cohomological set up, the dualization mechanism between one-forms andtwo-forms. Our theories contain 12-r self-dual two-forms and 15+r gaugevectors, r of which are abelian and neutral. These theories, whose existence isproved and their supersymmetry algebra constructed hereby, have potentiallyinteresting properties in relation with domain wall solutions and the trappingof gravity.
