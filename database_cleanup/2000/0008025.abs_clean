It was recently proposed that there exist stable supersymmetric phases forfinite temperature superstings. This issue was investigated using an effectivesupergravity which takes into account massive winding modes. Such a theoryadmits BPS solutions that do not suffer from Hagedorn-type instabilities. Weextend several aspects of this work. First we restrict to the real-field sectorof the theory and allow, in general, for unequal right and left winding fields.Then, by further specializing to type-II theories (IIA, IIB and a self-dualhybrid) we construct the most general 1/2-BPS solution and reveal several newfeatures arising in various consistent truncations. In the heterotic case weinvestigate the general properties of the solution which is presented in aclosed form in the limit of infinitely large left-winding field.
