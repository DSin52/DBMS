Title: Bosonized supersymmetric quantum mechanics and supersymmetry of

parabosons (parafermions)Comments: 12 pages. Talk given at the International Workshop ``Supersymmetry

and Quantum Symmetries", JINR, Dubna, Russia, July 26-31,1999 (to appear inProceedings)We review the construction of minimally bosonized supersymmetric quantummechanics and its relation to hidden supersymmetries in pure parabosonic(parafermionic) systems.
