The classical solution of bosonic d-brane in (d+1,1) space-time is studied.We work with light-cone gauge and reduce the problem into Chaplygin gasproblem. The static equation is equivalent to vanishing of extrinsic meancurvature, which is similar to Einstein equation in vacuum. We show that thed-brane problem in this gauge is closely related to Plateau problem, and wegive some non-trivial solutions from minimal surfaces. The solutions ofd-1,d,d+1 spatial dimensions are obtained from d-dimensional minimal surfacesas solutions of Plateau problem. In addition we discuss on the relation toHamiltonian-BRST formalism for d-branes.
