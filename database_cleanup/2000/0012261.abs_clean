This study proposes that the longstanding problems of quantum chromodynamics(QCD) as an SU(3)_C gauge theory, the confinement mechanism and \Theta vacuum,can be resolved by dynamical spontaneous symmetry breaking (DSSB) through thecondensation of singlet gluons and quantum nucleardynamics (QND) as an SU(2)_Nx U(1)_Z gauge theory is produced. The confinement mechanism is the result ofmassive gluons and the Yukawa potential provides hadron formation. Theevidences for the breaking of discrete symmetries (C, P, T, CP) during DSSBconservation of vector current and the partial conservation of the axial vectorcurrent, the baryon asymmetry \delta_B \simeq 10^{-10}, and the neutronelectric dipole moment \Theta < 10^{-9}. Hadron mass generation mechanism issuggested in terms of DSSB due to the \Theta vacuum.
