We study the generalization of S-duality to non-commutative gauge theories.For rank one theories, we obtain the leading terms of the dual theory byLegendre transforming the Lagrangian of the non-commutative theory expressed interms of a commutative gauge field. The dual description is weakly coupled whenthe original theory is strongly coupled if we appropriately scale thenon-commutativity parameter. However, the dual theory appears to benon-commutative in space-time when the original theory is non-commutative inspace. This suggests that locality in time for non-commutative theories is anartifact of perturbation theory.
