We show that the recently found quartic action for the scalars from themassless graviton multiplet of type IIB supergravity compactified onAdS_5\times S^5 background coincides with the relevant part of the action ofthe gauged N=8 5d supergravity on AdS_5. We then use this action to compute the4-point function of the lowest weight chiral primary operators$\tr(\phi^{(i}\phi^{j)})$ in N=4 SYM_4 at large $N$ and at strong `t Hooftcoupling.
