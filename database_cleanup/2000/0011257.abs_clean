Title: Instanton amplitudes in open-closed topological string theory

Authors: C. I. Lazaroiu

Comments: 34 pages, 4 figures

I use the universal instanton formalism to discuss quantum effects in theopen-closed topological string theory of a Calabi-Yau A-model, in the presenceof a multiply-wrapped `Floer' D-brane. This gives a precise meaning (up to theissue of compactifying the relevant moduli spaces) to the instanton correctionswhich affect sigma model and topological string amplitudes. The cohomologicalformalism I use recovers the homological approach used by Fukaya andcollaborators in the singly-wrapped case, even though it is not a naivegeneralization of the latter. I also prove some non-renormalization theoremsfor amplitudes with low number of insertions. The non-renormalization argumentis purely geometric and based on the universal instanton formulation, and thusit does not assume that the background satisfies the string equations ofmotion. These results are valid even though the D-brane background typicallyreceives worldsheet instanton corrections. I also point out that the localizedform of the boundary BRST operator receives instanton corrections and make afew comments on the consequences of this effect.
