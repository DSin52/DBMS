We find and prove relationships between Riemann zeta values and centralbinomial sums. We also investigate alternating binomial sums (also calledAp\'ery sums). The study of non-alternating sums leads to an investigation ofdifferent types of sums which we call multiple Clausen values. The study ofalternating sums leads to a tower of experimental results involvingpolylogarithms in the golden ratio. In the non-alternating case, there is astrong connection to polylogarithms of the sixth root of unity, encountered inthe 3-loop Feynman diagrams of {\tt hep-th/9803091} and subsequently inhep-ph/9910223, hep-ph/9910224, cond-mat/9911452 and hep-th/0004010.
