We consider the nonrelativistic field theory with a quartic interaction on anoncommutative plane. We compute the four point scattering amplitude withinperturbative analysis to all orders and identify the beta function and therunning of the coupling constant. Since the theory admits an equivalentdescription via the N particle Schrodinger equation, we regain the scatteringamplitude by finding an exact scattering wavefunction of the two body equation.The wave function for the bound state is also identified. These wave functionsunusually have two center positions in the relative coordinates. The separationof the centers is in the transverse direction of the total momentum and growslinearly with the noncommutativity scale and the total momentum, exhibiting thestringy nature of the noncommutative field theory.
