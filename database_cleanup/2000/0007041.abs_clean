Title: A Variational Principle for Radial Flows in Holographic theories

Comments: 28 pages, Latex

We develop furthur the correspondence between a d+1 dimensional theory and ad dimensional one with the "radial" (d+1)th corodinate \rho playing the role ofan evolution parameter. We discuss the evolution of an effective action definedon a d dimensional surface charactarized by \rho by means of a new variationalprinciple. The conditions under which the flow equations are valid arediscussed in detail as is the choice of boundary conditions. It is explainedhow domain walls may be incorporated in the framework and some generalizedjunction conditions are obtained. The general principles are illustrated on theexample of a supergravity theory on AdS_{d+1}.
