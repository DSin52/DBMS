We explore the applicability of the exact renormalization group to the studyof tunnelling phenomena. We investigate quantum-mechanical systems whose energyeigenstates are affected significantly by tunnelling through a barrier in thepotential. Within the approximation of the derivative expansion, we find thatthe exact renormalization group predicts the correct qualitative behaviour forthe lowest energy eigenvalues. However, quantitative accuracy is achieved onlyfor potentials with small barriers. For large barriers, the use of alternativemethods, such as saddle-point expansions, can provide quantitative accuracy.
