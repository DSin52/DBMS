International Workshop on the Fundamental Problems of HEP&FT, Protvino,Russia [June 21-23, 2000]We present an extension of quantum field theory to the case when thespacetime topology fluctuates (spacetime foam). In this extension the number ofbosonic fields becomes a variable and the ground state is characterized by afinite particle number density. It is shown that when the number of fieldsremains a constant, the standard field theory is restored. However, in thecomplete theory the ground state has a nontrivial properties. In particular, itproduces an increase in the level of quantum fluctuations in the fieldpotentials and an additional renormalization of masses of particles. We examinefluctuations of massless fields and show that in the presence of a temperature(thermal state) these fluctuations has 1/f spectrum. Thus, the main predictionof the theory is that our universe should be filled with a randomelectromagnetic field which should produce an additional 1/f - noise inelectric circuits.
