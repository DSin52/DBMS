A thin shell of light-like dust with its own gravitational field is studiedin the special case of spherical symmetry. The action functional for thisnew variables are embeddings, their conjugate momenta, and Dirac observables.The concepts of background manifold and covariant gauge fixing, that underliethese variables, are reformulated in a way that implies the uniqueness andgauge invariance of the background manifold. The reduced dynamics describesmotion on this background manifold.
