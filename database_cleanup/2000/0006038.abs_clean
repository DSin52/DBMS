We investigate geometrical structures and low-energy theorems of N=1supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models in four dimensions. When a globalsymmetry spontaneously breaks down to its subgroup, the low-energy effectiveLagrangian of massless particles is described by a supersymmetric nonlinearsigma model whose target manifold is parametrized by Nambu-Goldstone (NG)bosons and quasi-NG (QNG) bosons. The unbroken symmetry changes at each pointin the target manifold and some QNG bosons change to NG bosons when unbrokensymmetry become smaller. The QNG-NG change and their interpretation is shown ina simple example, the O(N) model. We investigate low-energy theorems at generalpoints.
