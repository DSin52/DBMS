The vacuum sector of the Brans-Dicke theory is studied from the viewpoint ofa non-conformally invariant gravitational model. We show that, this theory canbe conformally symmetrized using an appropriate conformal transformation. Theresulting theory allows a particle interpretation, and suggests that thequantum aspects of matter may be geometrized.
