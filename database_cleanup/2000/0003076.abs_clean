We study the long distance behaviour of brane theories with quasi-localizedgravity. The 5D effective theory at large scales follows from a holographicrenormalization group flow. As intuitively expected, the graviton iseffectively four dimensional at intermediate scales and becomes fivedimensional at large scales. However in the holographic effective theory theessentially 4D radion dominates at long distances and gives rise to scalaranti-gravity. The holographic description shows that at large distances the GRSmodel is equivalent to the model recently proposed by Dvali, Gabadadze andPorrati (DGP), where a tensionless brane is embedded into 5D Minkowski space,with an additional induced 4D Einstein-Hilbert term on the brane. In theholographic description the radion of the GRS model is automatically localizedon the tensionless brane, and provides the ghost-like field necessary to cancelthe extra graviton polarization of the DGP model. Thus, there is a holographicduality between these theories. This analysis provides physical insight intohow the GRS model works at intermediate scales; in particular it sheds light onthe size of the width of the graviton resonance, and also demonstrates how theholographic RG can be used as a practical tool for calculations.
