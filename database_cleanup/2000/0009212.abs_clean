A supersymmetric Randall-Sundrum brane-world demands that not merely thegraviton but the entire supergravity multiplet be trapped on the brane. Todemonstrate this, we present a complete ansatz for the reduction of (D=5,N=4)gauged supergravity to (D=4,N=2) ungauged supergravity in the Randall-Sundrumgeometry. We verify that it is consistent to lowest order in fermion terms. Inparticular, we show how the graviphotons avoid the `no photons on the brane'result because they do not originate from Maxwell's equations in D=5 but ratherfrom odd-dimensional self-duality equations. In the case of the fivebrane, theRandall-Sundrum mechanism also provides a new Kaluza-Klein way of obtainingchiral supergravity starting from non-chiral.
