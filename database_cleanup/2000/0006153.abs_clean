Energy in the Broken-Symmetry Phase of phi^4-Theory and Their RecursiveGraphical SolutionAuthors: A. Pelster, H. Kleinert

Comments: Author Information under

Extending recent work on QED and the symmetric phase of the euclideanmulticomponent scalar \phi^4-theory, we construct the vacuum diagrams of thefree energy and the effective energy in the ordered phase of \phi^4-theory. Byregarding them as functionals of the free correlation function and theinteraction vertices, we graphically solve nonlinear functional differentialequations, obtaining loop by loop all connected and one-particle irreduciblevacuum diagrams with their proper weights.
