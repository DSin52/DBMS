The concept of particle weights has been introduced by Buchholz and theauthor in order to obtain a unified treatment of particles as well as (charged)infraparticles which do not permit a definition of mass and spin according toWigner's theory. Particle weights arise as temporal limits of physical statesin the vacuum sector and describe the asymptotic particle content. Following athorough analysis of the underlying notion of localizing operators, we give aprecise definition of this concept and investigate the characteristicproperties. The decomposition of particle weights into pure components whichare linked to irreducible representations of the quasi-local algebra has been along-standing desideratum that only recently found its solution. We set out twoapproaches to this problem by way of disintegration theory, making use of aphysically motivated assumption concerning the structure of phase space inquantum field theory. The significance of the pure particle weights ensuingfrom this disintegration is founded on the fact that they exhibit features ofimproper energy-momentum eigenstates, analogous to Dirac's conception, andpermit a consistent definition of mass and spin even in an infraparticlesituation.
