It is known that when there are several D-branes, their space-timecoordinates in general become noncommutative. From the point of view ofnoncommutative geometry, it reflects noncommutativity of the world volume ofthe D-branes. On the other hand, as we showed in the previous work, in thepresence of the constant antisymmetric tensor field the momentum operators ofthe D-branes have noncommutative structure. In the present paper, weinvestigate a relation between these noncommutativities and the description ofD-branes in terms of the noncommutative Yang-Mills theory recently proposed bySeiberg and Witten. It is shown that the noncommutativity of the Yang-Millstheory, which implies that of the world volume coordinates, originates fromboth noncommutativities of the transverse coordinates and momenta from theviewpoint of the lower-dimensional D-branes. Moreover, we show that thisnoncommutativity is transformed by coordinate transformations on the worldvolume and thereby can be chosen in an arbitrary fixed value. We also make abrief comment on a relation between this fact and a hidden symmetry of the IIBmatrix models.
