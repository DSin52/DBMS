Following the conjectured duality between near-horizon NS5-branes and littlestring theory, the string-corrected thermodynamics of near-horizon NS5-branesis studied and found to agree with the statistical thermodynamics of a 5+1dimensional supersymmetric string theory near the Hagedorn temperature.Specifically, tree-level corrections to the temperature are argued to vanish,in accordance with the duality, while the one-loop string correction to theNS5-brane thermodynamics is shown to generate the correct temperaturedependence of the entropy.
