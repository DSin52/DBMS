We propose a geometrized Higgs mechanism based on the gravitational sector inthe Connes-Lott formulation of the standard model, which has been constructedby Chamseddine, Fr$\ddot{o}$hlic and Grandjean. The point of our idea is thatHiggs-like couplings depend on the local coordinates of the four-dimensionalcontinuum,$M_4$. The localized couplings can be calculated by the Wilson loopsof the $U(1)_{EM}$ gauge field and the connection, which is defined on$Z_2\times{M_4}$.
