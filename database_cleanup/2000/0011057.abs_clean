We show how the T-duality is realized for D-branes with noncommutativeworld-volume coordinates. We discuss D-branes wrapped on tori and the result isthat the recently found noncommutative actions form a consistent collection dueto the T-duality mapping between noncommutative D-branes and rotatedcommutative D-branes on deformed tori.
