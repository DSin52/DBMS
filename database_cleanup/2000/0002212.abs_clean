Deformation quantization of bosonic strings is considered. We show that thelight-cone gauge is the most convenient classical description to perform thequantization of bosonic strings in the deformation quantization formalism.Similar to the field theory case, the oscillator variables greatly facilitatesthe analysis. The mass spectrum, propagators and the Virasoro algebra arefinally described within this deformation quantization scheme.
