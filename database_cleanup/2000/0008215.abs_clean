The calculation of absorption cross sections for minimal scalars insupergravity backgrounds is an important aspect of the investigation of AdS/CFTcorrespondence and requires a matching of appropriate wave functions. The lowenergy case has attracted particular attention. In the following the dependenceof the cross section on the matching point is investigated. It is shown thatthe low energy limit is independent of the matching point and hence exhibitsuniversality. In the high energy limit the independence is not maintained, butthe result is believed to possess the correct energy dependence.
