Using a geometric realization of the $SU(2)_R$ symmetry and a procedure offactorisation of the gauge and $SU(2)_R$ charges, we study the small instantonsingularities of the Higgs branch of supersymmetric $U(1)^r$ gauge theorieswith eight supercharges. We derive new solutions for the moduli space of vacuapreserving manifestly the eight supercharges. In particular, we obtain anextension of the ordinary ADE singularities for hyperKahler manifolds and showthat the classical moduli space of vacua is in general given by cotangentbundles of compact weighted projective spaces.
