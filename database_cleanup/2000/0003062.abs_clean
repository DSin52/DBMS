We renormalize at two loops the axial current and $F \tilde{F}$ in masslessQED, using the recently proposed semi-naive dimensional renormalization scheme.We show that the results are in agreement with those in theBreitenlohner-Maison-'t Hooft-Veltman scheme, previously obtained indirectly bymaking a three-loop computation.
