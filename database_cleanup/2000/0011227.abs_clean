We investigate some aspects of N=2 twisted theories with matterhypermultiplets in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. Aconsistent formulation of these theories on a general four-manifold requiresturning on a particular magnetic flux, which we write down explicitly in thecase of SU(2k). We obtain the blowup formula and show that the blowup functionis given by a hyperelliptic sigma-function with singular characteristic. Wecompute the contact terms and find, as a corollary, interesting identitiesbetween hyperelliptic Theta functions.
