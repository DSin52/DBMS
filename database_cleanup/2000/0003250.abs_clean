We numerically examine the self-dual solutions of self-intersecting stringsimmersed in four dimensions. We find that open torus knots have topologies thatcan support monopole/anti-monopole as well as q-qbar production andannihilation. We give an estimate of the string tension from quark productionrates, show that the intersection number for torus-knots is 4(p-q), and discussa chiral symmetry breaking mechanism due to self-intersections. We supply aMAPLE program that can annimate the torus-knot solutions. These annimations can``Animation Control Panel''.
