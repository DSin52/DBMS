Starting from the geometric calculus based on Clifford algebra, the idea thatphysical quantities are Clifford aggregates ("polyvectors") is explored. Ageneralized point particle action ("polyvector action") is proposed. It isshown that the polyvector action, because of the presence of a scalar (moreprecisely a pseudoscalar) variable, can be reduced to the well known,unconstrained, Stueckelberg action which involves an invariant evolutionparameter. It is pointed out that, starting from a different direction, DeWittand Rovelli postulated the existence of a clock variable attached to particleswhich serve as a reference system for identification of spacetime points. Theaction they postulated is equivalent to the polyvector action. Relativisticdynamics (with an invariant evolution parameter) is thus shown to be based oneven stronger theoretical and conceptual foundations than usually believed.
