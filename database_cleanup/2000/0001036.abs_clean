We study dynamical flavor symmetry breaking in the context of a class of N=1supersymmetric SU(n_c) and USp(2 n_c) gauge theories, constructed from theexactly solvable N=2 theories by perturbing them with small adjoint and genericbare hypermultiplet (quark) masses. We find that the flavor U(n_{f}) symmetryin SU(n_{c}) theories is dynamically broken to $U(r)\times U(n_{f}-r)$ groupsfor $n_f \leq n_c$. In the r=1 case the dynamical symmetry breaking is causedby the condensation of monopoles in the $\underline{n_{f}}$ representation. Forgeneral r, however, the monopoles in the $\underline{{}_{n_{f}}C_{r}}$representation, whose condensation could explain the flavor symmetry breakingbut would produce too-many Nambu--Goldstone multiplets, actually ``break up''into ``magnetic quarks'' which condense and induce confinement and the symmetrybreaking. In USp(2n_c) theories with $n_f \leq n_c + 1$, the flavor SO(2n_f)symmetry is dynamically broken to U(n_f), but with no description in terms of aweakly coupled local field theory. In both SU(n_c) and USp(2 n_c) theories,with larger numbers of quark flavors, besides the vacua with these properties,there exist also vacua with no flavor symmetry breaking.
