Massless fields of generic Young symmetry type in $AdS_d$ space are analyzed.It is demonstrated that in contrast to massless fields in Minkowski space whosephysical degrees of freedom transform in irreps of $o(d-2)$ algebra, $AdS$massless mixed symmetry fields reduce to a number of irreps of $o(d-2)$algebra. From the field theory perspective this means that not every masslessfield in flat space admits a deformation to $AdS_d$ with the same number ofdegrees of freedom, because it is impossible to keep all of the flat spacegauge symmetries unbroken in the AdS space. An equivalent statement is that,generic irreducible AdS massless fields reduce to certain reducible sets ofmassless fields in the flat limit. A conjecture on the general pattern of theflat space limit of a general $AdS_d$ massless field is made. The example ofthe three-cell ``hook'' Young diagram is discussed in detail. In particular, itis shown that only a combination of the three-cell flat-space field with agraviton-like field admits a smooth deformation to $AdS_d$.
