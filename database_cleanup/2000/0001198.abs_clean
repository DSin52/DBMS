Authors: A.N. Schellekens

Comments: 21 pages, Latex. Invited talk at the Wigner Symposium, 16-22 August

1999, Istanbul, TurkeySome applications of simple current techniques and fixed point resolution totheories of open strings are discussed. In addition to a brief review of workpresented in two recent papers with L. Huiszoon and N. Sousa, some new resultsconcerning uniqueness of crosscap coefficients are presented, as well as astrange sum rule for the modular matrix implied by the existence of crosscaps.
