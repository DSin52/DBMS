We consider the strong coupling limit of conformal gauge theories in 4dimensions. The action of the loop operator on the minimal area in the AdSspace is analyzed, and the Schwinger-Dyson equations of gauge theory arechecked. The general approach to the loop dynamics developed here goes beyondthe special case of conformal theories.
