``Group-Theoretical Methods in Physics'', Dubna, 2000We analyze the superfield constraints of the D=4, N=3 SYM-theory usinglight-cone gauge conditions. The SU(3)/U(1)xU(1) harmonic variables areinterpreted as auxiliary spectral parameters, and the transform to theharmonic-superspace representation is considered. Our nilpotent gauge for thebasic harmonic superfield simplifies the SYM-equations of motion. A partialGrassmann decomposition of these equations yields the solvable linear system ofiterative equations.
