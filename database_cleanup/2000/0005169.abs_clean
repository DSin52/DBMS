Title: On string theory in AdS_3 backgrounds

Authors: Yuji Satoh

Comments: 16 pages, no figures, latex; talk given at YITP workshop, Kyoto,

Japan, October 27-29, 1999We discuss the string theory on AdS_3. In the first half of this talk, wereview the SL(2,R) and the SL(2,C)/SU(2) WZW models which describe the stringson the Lorentzian and Euclidean AdS_3 without RR backgrounds, respectively. Anemphasis is put on the fundamental issues such as the unitarity, the modularinvariance and the closure of the OPE. In the second half, we discuss someattempts at clarifying such problems. In particular, we discuss the modularinvariance of the SL(2,R) WZW model and the calculation of the correlationfunctions of the SL(2,C)/SU(2) WZW model using the path-integral approach.
