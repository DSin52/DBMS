We compute the 4--dimensional cosmological constant in stringcompactifications in which the Standard Model fields live on anon-supersymmetric brane inside a supersymmetric bulk. The cosmologicalconstant receives contributions only from the vacuum energy of the bulksupergravity fields, but not from the vacuum energy of the brane fields. Thelatter is absorbed in a warp factor. Supersymmetry breaking on the brane at theTeV scale implies supersymmetry breaking in the bulk at the micrometer scale.This produces a tiny cosmological constant that agrees with experiment within afew orders of magnitude. Our argument predicts superpartners of the gravitonwith mass of order $10^{-3}$ eV. They should be observable in short-distancetests of Einstein Gravity.
