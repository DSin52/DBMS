We study T-duality in the Green-Schwarz formalism to all orders in superspacecoordinates. We find two analogs of Buscher rules for the supervielbein andclarify their meaning from the superstring point of view. The transformationrules for the dilaton, spin 1/2 fermions and Ramond-Ramond superfields are alsoderived.
