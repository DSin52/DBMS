European Physics Conference on High Energy Physics, Tampere, Finland, 15-21,July 1999Softly broken dual magnetic theory of N=1 supersymmetric SU(N_c) QCD with N_fflavours is investigated with the inclusion of trilinear coupling term ofscalar fields in the case of N_f>N_c+1. It is found that the trilinear softsupersymmetric breaking term greatly change the phase and the vacuum structure.
