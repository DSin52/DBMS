An associative algebra of holomorphic differential forms is constructedassociated with pure N=2 Super-Yang-Mills theory for the Lie algebra F4.Existence and associativity of this algebra, combined with the generalarguments in the work of Marshakov, Mironov and Morozov, proves that theprepotential of this theory satisfies the generalized WDVV system.
