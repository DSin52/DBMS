The Ising limit of a conventional Hermitian parity-symmetric scalar quantumfield theory is a correlated limit in which two bare Lagrangian parameters, thecoupling constant $g$ and the {\it negative} mass squared $-m^2$, both approachinfinity with the ratio $-m^2/g=\alpha>0$ held fixed. In this limit therenormalized mass of the asymptotic theory is finite. Moreover, the limitingtheory exhibits universal properties. For a non-Hermitian $\cal PT$-symmetricLagrangian lacking parity symmetry, whose interaction term has the form$-g(i\phi)^N/N$, the renormalized mass diverges in this correlated limit.Nevertheless, the asymptotic theory still has interesting properties. Forexample, the one-point Green's function approaches the value$-i\alpha^{1/(N-2)}$ independently of the space-time dimension $D$ for $D<2$.Moreover, while the Ising limit of a parity-symmetric quantum field theory isdominated by a dilute instanton gas, the corresponding correlated limit of a$\cal PT$-symmetric quantum field theory without parity symmetry is dominatedby a constant-field configuration with corrections determined by aweak-coupling expansion in which the expansion parameter (the amplitude of thevertices of the graphs in this expansion) is proportional to an inverse powerof $g$. We thus observe a weak-coupling/strong-coupling duality in that whilethe Ising limit is a strong-coupling limit of the quantum field theory, theexpansion about this limit takes the form of a conventional weak-couplingexpansion. A possible generalization of the Ising limit to dimensions $D<4$ isbriefly discussed.
