In this note we reconsider linearised metric perturbations in the one-braneRandall-Sundrum Model. We present a simple formalism to describe metricperturbations caused by matter perturbations on the brane and remedy somemisconceptions concerning the constraints imposed on the metric and matterperturbations by the presence of the brane.
