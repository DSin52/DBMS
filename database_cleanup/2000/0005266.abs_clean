The quantum theory of near horizon regions of spacetimes with classicalspatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic Friedman-Robertson-Walker geometrycan be approximately described by a two dimensional conformal field theory. Thecentral charge of this theory and expectation value of its Hamiltonian are bothproportional to the horizon area in units of Newton's constant. The statisticalentropy of horizon states, which can be calculated using two dimensional statecounting methods, is proportional to the horizon area and depends on anumerical constant of order unity which is determined by Planck scale physics.This constant can be fixed such that the entropy is equal to a quarter of thehorizon area in units of Newton's constant, in agreement with thermodynamicconsiderations.
