Here we place the TeX-typeset version of the old preprint SMC-PHYS-66 (1982),which was published in K. Akama, "Pregeometry", in Lecture Notes in Physics,176, Gauge Theory and Gravitation, Proceedings, Nara, 1982, edited by K.Kikkawa, N. Nakanishi and H. Nariai, (Springer-Verlag) 267--271. In the paper,we presented the picture that we live in a "brane world" (in the present-dayterminology) i.e. in a dynamically localized 3-brane in a higher dimensionalspace. We adopt, as an example, the dynamics of the Nielsen-Olesen vortex typein six dimensional spacetime to localize our space-time within a 3-brane. Atlow energies, everything is trapped in the 3-brane, and the Einstein gravity isinduced through the fluctuations of the 3-brane. The idea is important becauseit provides a way basically distinct from the "compactification" to hide theextra dimensions which become necessary for various theoretical reasons.
