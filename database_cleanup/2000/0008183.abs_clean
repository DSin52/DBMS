We consider a spacetime formed by several pieces having common timelikeboundary which plays the role of a junction between them. We establish junctionconditions for fields of various spin and derive the resulting laws of wavepropagation through the junction, which turn out to be quite similar for fieldsof all spins. As an application, we consider the case of branchingfour-dimensional spacetime that may arise in the context of the theory ofquantum creation of a closed universe on the background of a big motheruniverse. The theory developed can also be applied to brane-world models and tothe superstring theory.
