We study a central charge Z of a one parameter family of Calabi-Yau d-foldembedded in CP^{d+1}. For a d-fold case, we construct the Z concretely andanalyze charge vectors of D-branes and intersection forms of associated cycles.We find the charges are described as some kinds of Mukai vectors. They arerepresented as products of Chern characters of coherent sheaves restricted onthe Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces and square roots of A-roof genera of the d-folds.By combining results of the topological sigma model and the data of the CFTcalculations in the Gepner model, we find that the Z is determined and isspecified by a set of integers. It labels boundary states in special classeswhere associated states are represented as tensor products of boundary statesfor constituent minimal models. The Z has a moduli parameter t that describes adeformation of a moduli space in the open string channel with B-type boundaryconditions. Also monodromy matrices and homology cycles are investigated.
