Static solutions with a bulk dilaton are derived in the context of sixdimensional warped compactification. In the string frame, exponentiallydecreasing warp factors are identified with critical points of the low energy$\beta$-functions truncated at a given order in the string tension corrections.The stability of the critical points is discussed in the case of the firststring tension correction. The singularity properties of the obtained solutionsare analyzed and illustrative numerical examples are provided.
