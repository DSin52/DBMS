We study vector perturbations about four-dimensional brane-world cosmologiesembedded in a five-dimensional vacuum bulk. Even in the absence of matterperturbations, vector perturbations in the bulk metric can support vectormetric perturbations on the brane. We show that during de Sitter inflation onthe brane vector perturbations in the bulk obey the same wave equation for amassless five-dimensional field as found for tensor perturbations. However, wepresent the second-order effective action for vector perturbations and find nonormalisable zero-mode in the absence of matter sources. The spectrum ofnormalisable states is a continuum of massive modes that remain in the vacuumstate during inflation.
