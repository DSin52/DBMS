In a gravitational field, we analyze the Maxwell equations, the correpondingelectromagnetic wave and continuity equations. A particular solution forparellel electric and magnetic fields in a gravitational background ispresented. These solutions also satisfy the free-wave equations and thephenomenology suggested by plasma physics.
