Title: Kaluza-Klein Black Holes in String Theory

Authors: Finn Larsen

Comments: 11 pages; to appear in the proceedings of PASCOS'99

Non-supersymmetric black holes carrying both electric and magnetic chargewith respect to a single Kaluza-Klein gauge field have much in common withsupersymmetric black holes. Angular momentum conservation and other generalphysics principles underlies some of their basic features. Kaluza-Klein blackholes are interpreted in string theory as bound states of D6-branes andD0-branes. The microscopic theory reproduces the full nonlinear mass formula ofthe extremal black holes.
