Title: Reissner-Nordstrom Black Hole in Gravity Localized Models

Comments: 11 pages, LaTex 2e, no figures

We investigate the possibility of having the electrically chargedReissner-Nordstrom black hole in the gravity localized models in a brane world.It is shown that the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole exists as a solution in the5D Randall-Sundrum domain wall model if there is the U(1) bulk gauge field. Wefind that the charged black hole is localized on a 3-brane even if zero mode ofthe bulk gauge field is not in general localized on the brane in the domainwall model. Moreover, we extend these observations to the higher-dimensionaltopological defect models with codimension more than one in a generalspace-time dimension such as the string-like defect model with codimension 2 insix dimensions and the monopole-like defect model with codimension 3 in sevendimensions e.t.c.
