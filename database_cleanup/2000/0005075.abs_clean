In this note we calculate the spectrum of two-dimensional QCD. We formulatethe theory with SU(N_c) currents rather than with fermionic operators. Weconstruct the Hamiltonian matrix in DLCQ formulation as a function of theharmonic resolution K and the numbers of flavors N_f and colors N_c. Theresulting numerical eigenvalue spectrum is free from trivial multi-particlestates which obscured previous results. The well-known 't Hooft and large N_fspectra are reproduced. In the case of adjoint fermions we present some newresults.
