For certain dimensionally-regulated one-, two- and three-loop diagrams,problems of constructing the epsilon-expansion and the analytic continuation ofthe results are studied. In some examples, an arbitrary term of theepsilon-expansion can be calculated. For more complicated cases, only a fewhigher terms in epsilon are obtained. Apart from the one-loop two- andthree-point diagrams, the examples include two-loop (mainly on-shell)propagator-type diagrams and three-loop vacuum diagrams. As a by-product, somenew relations involving Clausen function, generalized log-sine integrals andcertain Euler--Zagier sums are established, and some useful results for thehypergeometric functions of argument 1/4 are presented.
