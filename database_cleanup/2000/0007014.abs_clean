Solitonic brane cosmologies are found where the world-volume is curved due tothe evolution of the dilaton field on the brane. In many cases, these may berelated to the solitonic Dp- and M5-branes of string and M-theory. Aneleven-dimensional interpretation of the D8-brane cosmology of the massive typeIIA theory is discussed in terms of compactification on a torus bundle.Braneworlds are also found in Horava-Witten theory compactified on a Calabi-Yauthree-fold. The possibility of dilaton-driven inflation on the brane isdiscussed.
