In Parts I and II we showed that e, $\nu$ propagators can be derived fromrotation invariant projection operators, thereby providing examples of howquantities with spacetime symmetry can be obtained by constraining rotationallysymmetric objects. One constraint is the restriction of the basis; only twokinds of bases were considered, one for the electron and one for the neutrino.In this part, we find that, of a wide range of bases each consistent with theconstraint process, only the two kinds of bases considered in Parts I and IIgive spacetime symmetric propagators. We interpret the result geometrically.The spinor representation is unfaithful in four dimensional Euclidean spacewhich explains why spin 1/2 wave functions have four, not two, components. Thenwe show how a basis relates to two planes in four dimensional Euclidean space.A pair of planes spanning two or three dimensions does not allow spacetimesymmetry. Spacetime symmetry requires two planes that span four dimensions.
