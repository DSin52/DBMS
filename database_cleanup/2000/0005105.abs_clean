In this note $D9$- and anti-$D9$-brane annihilation in type I string theoryis probed by a $D1$-brane. We consider the covariant Green-Schwarz or twistorformulation of the probe theory. We expect the theory to be $\kappa$-invariantafter the annihilation is completed. Conditions of the $\kappa$-invariance ofthe theory impose constraints on the background tachyon field. Solutions to theconstraints define tachyon values which correspond to type I $D5$-branes asremnants of the annihilation. As a byproduct we get a theory which lies in thesame universality class as the non-linear $\sigma$-model for theAtiyah-Drinfeld-Hitchin-Manin construction.
