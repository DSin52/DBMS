Type IIB supergravity can be consistently truncated to the metric and theself-dual 5-form. We obtain the complete non-linear Kaluza-Klein S^5 reductionAnsatz for this theory, giving rise to gravity coupled to the fifteenYang-Mills gauge fields of SO(6) and the twenty scalars of the cosetSL(6,R)/SO(6). This provides a consistent embedding of this subsector of N=8,D=5 gauged supergravity in type IIB in D=10. We demonstrate that theself-duality of the 5-form plays a crucial role in the consistency of thereduction. We also discuss certain necessary conditions for a theory of gravityand an antisymmetric tensor in an arbitrary dimension D to admit a consistentsphere reduction, keeping all the massless fields. We find that it is onlypossible for D=11, with a 4-form field, and D=10, with a 5-form. Furthermore,in D=11 the full bosonic structure of eleven-dimensional supergravity isrequired, while in D=10 the 5-form must be self-dual. It is remarkable thatjust from the consistency requirement alone one would discover D=11 and typeIIB supergravities, and that D=11 is an upper bound on the dimension.
