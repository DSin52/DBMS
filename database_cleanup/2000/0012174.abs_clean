Explicit exact formulas are presented, for the leading order term in a strictchiral covariant derivative expansion, for the abnormal parity component of theeffective action of two- and four-dimensional Dirac fermions in presence ofscalar, pseudo-scalar, vector and axial vector background fields. The formulashold for completely general internal symmetry groups and generalconfigurations. In particular the scalar and pseudo-scalar fields need not beon the chiral circle.
