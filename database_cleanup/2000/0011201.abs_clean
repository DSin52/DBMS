We study in details on how gauge bosons can acquire mass when the chiralsymmetry dynamically breaks down for massless gauge theory without scalars.Introducing dynamical scalar fields into the original gauge theory, we showthat when the chiral symmetry breaks down, the theory gives gauge boson massesdifferent from what would be obatained if an elemetary Higgs is included. Weclarify the reason and propose one method how to calculate gauge boson massesin the case of dynamical gauge symmtry breakdown. We explain the method byusing an example in which SU(5) massless gauge theory breaks down to SU(4) withmassless fermions in appropriate representations.
