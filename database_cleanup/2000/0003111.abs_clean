We study the representation ${\cal D}$ of a simple compact Lie algebra $\g$of rank l constructed with the aid of the hermitian Dirac matrices of a (${\rmdim} \g$)-dimensional euclidean space. The irreducible representations of $\g$contained in ${\cal D}$ are found by providing a general construction onsuitable fermionic Fock spaces. We give full details not only for the simplestodd and even cases, namely su(2) and su(3), but also for the next (${dim}$\g$-invariant quantum mechanical system containing ${\rm dim} \g$ fermions.Another reason for undertaking this study is to examine the role of the$\g$-invariant fermionic operators that naturally arise. These are given interms of products of an odd number of gamma matrices, and include, besides acubic operator, (l-1) fermionic scalars of higher order. The latter areconstructed from the Lie algebra cohomology cocycles, and must be considered tobe of theoretical significance similar to the cubic operator. In the (${\rmdim} \g$)-even case, the product of all l operators turns out to be thechirality operator $\gamma_q, q=({{\rm dim} \g+1})$.
