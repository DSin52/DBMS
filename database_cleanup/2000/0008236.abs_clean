Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and axial anomaly are studied in thelight-front formulation. The existence of multiple vacua and a Nambu-Goldstoneboson, both related to dynamical fermion zero modes, are demonstrated within asimple sigma model with fermions. The Weyl gauge formulation and a consistentgauge invariant point-splitting regularization, which includes the light fronttime, are crucial for obtaining the anomaly in the massive Schwinger model andQED(3+1).
