We compute the one-loop four-point function in {\cal N}=4 supersymmetricYang-Mills theory with gauge group U(N). We perform the calculation in {\calN}=1 superspace using the background field method and obtain the completeoff-shell contributions to the effective action from planar and non planarsupergraphs. In the low-energy approximation the result simplifies and we canstudy its properties under gauge transformations. It appears that the nonplanarcontributions do not maintain the gauge invariance of the classical action.
