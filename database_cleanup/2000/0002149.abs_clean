We show that massless RR tadpoles in vacuum configurations with open andunoriented strings are always related to anomalies. RR tadpoles arising fromsectors of the internal SCFT with non-vanishing Witten index are in one-to-onecorrespondence with conventional irreducible anomalies. The anomalous contentof the remaining RR tadpoles can be disclosed by considering anomalousamplitudes with higher numbers of external legs. We then provide an explicitparametrization of the anomaly polynomial in terms of the boundary reflectioncoefficients, i.e. one-point functions of massless RR fields on the disk. Afterfactorization of the reducible anomaly, we extract the relevant WZ couplings inthe effective lagrangians.
