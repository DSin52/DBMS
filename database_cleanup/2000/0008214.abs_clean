On a noncommutative space of rank-1, we construct a codimension-one solitonexplicitly and, in the context of noncommutative bosonic open string fieldtheory, identify it with the D24-brane. We compute the tension of the proposedD24-brane, yielding an exact value and show that it is related to the tensionof the codimension two D23-brane by the string T-duality. This resolves anapparent puzzle posed by the result of Harvey, Kraus, Larsen and Martinec andproves that the T-duality is a gauge symmetry; in particular, at strongnoncommutativity, it is part of the U(oo) gauge symmetry on the worldvolume. Wealso apply the result to non-BPS D-branes in superstring theories and arguethat the codimension-one soliton gives rise to new descent relation among thenon-BPS D-branes in Type IIA and Type IIB string theories via T-duality.
