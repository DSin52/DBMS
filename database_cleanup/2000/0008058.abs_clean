The boundary terms in the Hamiltonian, in the presence of horizons, arecarefully analyzed in a simple 2D theory admitting AdS black holes. Theagreement between the euclidean approach and Cardy's formula is obtained modulocertain assumptions on the spectrum of the Virasoro's algebra. There is nodiscrepancy factor "square root of 2" once the appropriate boundary conditionsare properly recognized. The peculiar features of gravity, that the on-shellHamiltonian is determined by boundary terms, is the reason of the mentionedagreement.
