We show that a new expansion which sums seagull and bubble graphs to allorders, can be applied to the O(N) linear sigma model at finite temperature. Weprove that this expansion can be renormalised with the usual counterterms in amass independent scheme and that Goldstone's theorem is satisfied at eachorder. At the one loop order of this expansion, the Hartree result for theeffective potential (daisy and superdaisy graphs) is recovered. We show that atone loop 2PPI order, the self energy of the sigma meson can be calculatedexactly and that diagrams are summed beyond the Hartree approximation.
