We extend 2n-dim biconformal gauge theory by including Lorentz-scalar matterfields of arbitrary conformal weight. For a massless scalar field of conformalweight zero in a torsion-free biconformal geometry, the solution is determinedby the Einstein equation on an n-dim submanifold, with the stress-energy tensorof the scalar field as source. The matter field satisfies the n-dimKlein-Gordon equation.
