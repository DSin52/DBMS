We study discrete (duality) symmetries of functional determinants. An exacttransformation of the effective action under the inversion of background fields$\beta (x) \to \beta^{-1}(x)$ is found. We show that in many cases thisinversion does not change functional determinants. Explicitly studied modelsinclude a matrix theory in two dimensions, the dilaton-Maxwell theory in fourdimensions on manifolds without a boundary, and a two-dimensional dilatontheory on manifolds with boundaries. Our results provide an exact relationbetween strong and weak coupling regimes with possible applications to stringtheory, black hole physics and dimensionally reduced models.
