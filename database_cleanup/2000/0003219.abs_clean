We describe a tachyon-free stable non-BPS brane configuration in type IIAstring theory. The configuration is an elliptic model involving rotated NS5branes, D4 branes and anti-D4 branes, and is dual to a fractionalbrane-antibrane pair placed at a conifold singularity. This configurationexhibits an interesting behaviour as we vary the radius of the compactdirection. Below a critical radius the D4 and anti-D4 branes are aligned, butas the radius increases above the critical value the potential between themdevelops a minimum away from zero. This signals a phase transition to aconfiguration with finitely separated branes.
