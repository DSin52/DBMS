Title: The Reeh-Schlieder property for ground states

Authors: Christian Jaekel

Comments: plain tex, 11 pages, An unnecessary strong assumption has been

replaced by a more adequate one in Definition 2.1Recently it has been shown that the Reeh-Schlieder property w.r.t. thermalequilibrium states is a direct consequence of locality, additivity and therelativistic KMS condition. Here we extend this result to ground states.
