We show how string theory can be used to reproduce the one-loop two-pointphoton amplitude in noncommutative U(1) gauge theory. Using a simplerealization of the gauge theory in bosonic string theory, we extract from astring cylinder computation in the decoupling limit the exact one loop fieldtheory result. The result is obtained entirely from the region of moduli spacewhere massless open strings dominate. Our computation indicates that theunusual IR/UV singularities of noncommutative field theory do not come fromclosed string modes in any simple way.
