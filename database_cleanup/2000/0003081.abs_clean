We present an exact one-loop calculation of the tunneling process inEuclidean quantum gravity describing creation of black hole pairs in a deSitter universe. Such processes are mediated by $S^2\times S^2$ gravitationalinstantons giving an imaginary contribution to the partition function. Therequired energy is provided by the expansion of the universe. We utilize thethermal properties of de Sitter space to describe the process as the decay of ametastable thermal state. Within the Euclidean path integral approach togravity, we explicitly determine the spectra of the fluctuation operators,exactly calculate the one-loop fluctuation determinants in the $\zeta$-functionregularization scheme, and check the agreement with the expected scalingbehaviour. Our results show a constant volume density of created black holes atlate times, and a very strong suppression of the nucleation rate for smallvalues of $\Lambda$.
