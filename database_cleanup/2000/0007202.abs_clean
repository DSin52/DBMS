Title: Absorption by Nonextremal D3-branes

Authors: J.F. Vazquez-Poritz

Comments: Latex, 14 pages

We calculate the absorption probabilities for a class of massless fieldswhose linear perturbations leave the near-extremal D3-brane background metricunperturbed. It has previously been found that, for extremal D3-branes, thesefields share the same absorption probability as that of the dilaton-axion. Wefind that these absorption probabilities diverge from each other as we moveaway from extremality. The form of the corresponding effective Schrodingerpotentials leads us to conjecture that the absorption of various fields bynonextremal D3-branes depends on the polarization of angular momentum.
