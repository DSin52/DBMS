We study the symmetry of the one-loop effective action of bosonic stringtheory under non-Abelian T-duality transformations. It is shown that theoriginal Lagrangian and its dual are proportional. This result implies that thecorresponding reduced low energy effective actions are equivalent and leads toa functional relation between the Weyl anomaly coefficients of the original anddual two-dimensional non-linear sigma models. {}Finally, we apply thisformalism to some simple examples.
