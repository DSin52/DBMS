We describe generally deformed Heisenberg algebras in one dimension. Thecondition for a generalized Leibniz rule is obtained and solved. We analyzeconditions under which deformed quantum-mechanical problems have a Fock-spacerepresentation. One solution of these conditions leads to a q-deformedoscillator already studied by Lorek et al., and reduces to the harmonicoscillator only in the infinite-momentum frame. The other solution leads to theCalogero model in ordinary quantum mechanics, but reduces to the harmonicoscillator in the absence of deformation.
