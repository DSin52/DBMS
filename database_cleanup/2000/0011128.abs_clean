In this note we study bulk timelike geodesics in the presence of abrane-world black hole, where the brane-world is a two-brane moving in a3+1-dimensional asymptotically $adS_4$ spacetime. We show that for a certainrange of the parameters measuring the black hole mass and bulk cosmologicalconstant, there exist stable timelike geodesics which orbit the black hole andremain bound close to the two-brane.
