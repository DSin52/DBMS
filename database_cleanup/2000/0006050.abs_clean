We study Bogomolny equations on $R^2\times S^1$. Although they do not admitnontrivial finite-energy solutions, we show that there are interestinginfinite-energy solutions with Higgs field growing logarithmically at infinity.We call these solutions periodic monopoles. Using Nahm transform, we show thatperiodic monopoles are in one-to-one correspondence with solutions of Hitchinequations on a cylinder with Higgs field growing exponentially at infinity. Themoduli spaces of periodic monopoles belong to a novel class of hyperk\"ahlermanifolds and have applications to quantum gauge theory and string theory. Forexample, we show that the moduli space of $k$ periodic monopoles provides theexact solution of ${\cal N}=2$ super Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $SU(k)$compactified on a circle of arbitrary radius.
