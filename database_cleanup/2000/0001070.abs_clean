Non-perturbative effect of the formation of a chiral symmetry breakingcondensate <\bar\psi\psi> and of a dynamically generated fermion mass in QED inthe presence of an external magnetic field is considered. The dynamical mass ofa fermion (energy gap in the fermion spectrum) is shown to depend essentiallynonanalytically on the renormalized coupling constant \alpha in a strongmagnetic field. Possible applications of this effect are discussed.
