We construct dual supergravity descriptions of D3-branes wrapping associative3-cycles $L$. We analyse the conditions for having five-dimensional backgroundsolutions of the form $AdS_2 \times L$ and show that they require $L$ to be ofconstant negative curvature type. This provides $AdS_2$ background solutionswhen $L$ is the hyperbolic space $H^3$ or its quotients by subgroups of itsisometry group. We construct a regular numerical solution interpolating between$AdS_5$ in the UV and $AdS_2 \times H^3$ in the IR. The IR fixed point existsat the ``intersection'' of the Coulomb and Higgs branches. We analyse thesingular supergravity solutions which correspond to moving into the Higgs andthe Coulomb branches. For negative constant curvature spaces the singularity isof a ``good'' type in the Higgs branch and of a ``bad'' type in the Coulombbranch. For positive constant curvature spaces such as $S^3$ the singularity isof a ``bad'' type in both the Higgs and the Coulomb branches. We discuss themeaning of these results.
