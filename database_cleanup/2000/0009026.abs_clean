"Geometrical Aspects of Quantum Fields", Londrina-Parana, April 2000, to beWe discuss the problem of consistent description of higher spin massivefields coupled to external gravity. As an example we consider massive field ofspin 2 in arbitrary gravitational field. Consistency requires the theory tohave the same number of degrees of freedom as in flat spacetime and to describecausal propagation. By careful analysis of lagrangian structure of the theoryand its constraints we show that there exist at least two possibilities ofachieving consistency. The first possibility is provided by a lagrangian onspecific manifolds such as static or Einstein spacetimes. The secondpossibility is realized in arbitrary curved spacetime by a lagrangianrepresenting an infinite series in curvature. In the framework of string theorywe derive equations of motion for background massive spin 2 field coupled togravity from the requirement of quantum Weyl invariance. These equations appearto be a particular case of the general consistent equations obtained from thefield theory point of view.
