bob@spectral.comWe propose that the principles of relativistic quantum mechanics areincomplete for simultaneous measurement of non-commuting operators. Consistentjoint measurement of incompatible observables at a single point in space-timerequires that the system be in an entangled state with vacuum meters. Wesuggest that entagled simultaneous mesurement for noncommuting observables isthe basis for the observed fermionic multiplets. This generalizes the standardspin representations for particles arising from Lorentz invariance. We showthat operator entanglement for all quantum observables in the Poincare algebra,coupled with Fermi-Dirac statistics, mandates six fermions. We propose that thequark and lepton generations form a super-structure of the Poincare algebrabased on the principles of entangled simultaneity. Mathematically, thatsuper-structure is known as a Naimark extension. The required entanglementbetween particle generations for left-handed quarks is observed in theCabbibo-Kobayashi-maskawa matrix. We show that the Naimark-extended von Neumannlattice is ditributive, thereby suggesting the principle of entangledsimultaneous quantum measurement, Naimark extension, Lepton/quark generations.
