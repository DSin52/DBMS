We show that a partition function of topological twisted N=4 Yang-Millstheory is given by Seiberg-Witten invariants on a Riemannian four manifoldsunder the condition that the sum of Euler number and signature of the fourmanifolds vanish. The partition function is the sum of Euler number ofinstanton moduli space when it is possible to apply the vanishing theorem. Andwe get a relation of Euler number labeled by the instanton number $k$ withSeiberg-Witten invariants, too. All calculation in this paper is done withoutassuming duality.
