Title: Localization of Various Bulk Fields on a Brane

Comments: 7 pages, LaTex 2e, The expanded version of an invited paper which

appears in "Concise Encyclopedia on Supersymmetry and NoncommutativeStructures in Mathematics and Physics", edited by J. Bagger, S. Duplij and W.Siegel, Kluwer Academic Publishers, DordrechtWe report the issues of localization of various bulk fields on a brane in acurved background from a local field-theoretic viewpoint where a specialattention is paid to a warp geometry in a general space-time dimension. Wepoint out that spin 0 scalar field and spin 2 graviton are naturally localizedon a brane with the exponentially decreasing warp factor, while spin 1/2 and3/2 fermionic fields can be localized on the brane by introducing a bulk massterm with a 'kink' profile. {}For the localization of spin 1 vector field onthe brane with the exponentially decreasing warp factor, it is shown that thereare essentially two ways. One way is to appeal to the Dvali-Shifman methodwhich is based on a peculiar feature of the non-abelian gauge dynamics such asbulk confinement, whereas the other way is to look for a solution of Einsteinequations in such a way that the geometry has a property of confining thevector field to the brane by a gravitational interaction as in six dimensions.We point out that the latter way is more universal.
