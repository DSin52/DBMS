417-437We propose the light-front Lagrangian and the corresponding Hamiltonian thatproduce a theory perturbatively equivalent to the conventional QCD in theLorentz coordinates after the regularization is removed. The regularizationused is nonstandard and breaks the gauge invariance. But after theregularization is removed, this invariance is restored by the introduction of afinite number of counterterms with coefficients dependent on the regularizationparameters.
