In the low-energy limit, M-theory compactified on S1/Z2 is formulated interms of Bianchi identities with sources localized at orbifold singularitiesand anomaly-cancelling counterterms to the Wilson effective Lagrangian.Compactifying to four dimensions on a Calabi-Yau space leads to N=1 localsupersymmetry. We derive a formulation of the effective supergravity whichexplicitly relates four-dimensional supergravity multiplets and field equationswith these fundamental M-theory aspects. This formulation proves convenient forthe introduction in the effective supergravity of non-perturbative M-theorycontributions. It also applies to the universal sector of genericcompactifications with N=1 supersymmetry.
