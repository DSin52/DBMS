Constrained hamiltonian structure of noncommutative gauge theory for thegauge group U(1) is discussed. Constraints are shown to be first class,although, they do not give an Abelian algebra in terms of Poisson brackets. Therelated BFV-BRST charge gives a vanishing generalized Poisson bracket by itselfdue to the associativity of *-product. Equivalence of noncommutative andordinary gauge theories is formulated in generalized phase space by usingBFV-BRST charge and a solution is obtained. Gauge fixing is discussed.
