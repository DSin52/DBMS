The "measurability" of the non-minimal coupling is discussed in the contextof the effective field theory of gravity. Although there is no obvious motivefor excluding a non-minimal scalar coupling from the theory, we conclude thatfor reasonable values of the coupling constant it makes only a very smallcorrection.
