Title: SO and Sp Chern-Simons at Large N

Authors: S. Sinha and C. Vafa

Comments: 19 pages

We study the large N limit of SO(N) and Sp(N) Chern-Simons gauge theory onS^3 and identify its closed string dual as topological strings on anorientifold of the small resolution of the conifold. Applications to large Ndualities for N=1 supersymmetric gauge systems in 4 dimensions are alsodiscussed.
