We describe a simple volcano potential, which is supersymmetric and has ananalytic, zero-energy, ground state. (The KK modes are also analytic.) It is aninterior harmonic oscillator potential properly matched to an exterior angularmomentum-like tail. Special cases are given to elucidate the physics, which maybe intuitively useful in studies of higher-dimensional gravity.
