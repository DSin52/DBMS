Title: Our wall as the origin of CP violation

Comments: LaTeX file, 23 pages, 11 eps figures, title has been changed and some

discussions are includedA possibility that the origin of the CP violation in our world is a domainwall itself, on which we are living, is investigated in the context of thebrane world scenario. We estimate the amount of the CP violation on our wall,and show that either of order one or suppressed CP phases can be realized. Aninteresting case where CP is violated due to the {\it coexistence} of thewalls, which conserve CP individually, is also considered. We also propose auseful approximation for the estimation of the CP violation in the double-wallbackground.
