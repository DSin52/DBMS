Title: Zero-point field induced mass vs. QED mass renormalization

Comments: LaTeX, 5 pages. To appear in the proceedings of the 18th Advanced

ICFA Beam Dynamics Workshop on "Quantum Aspects of Beam Physics", Capri,Italy, October 15-20, 2000Haisch and Rueda have recently proposed a model in which the inertia ofcharged particles is a consequence of their interaction with theelectromagnetic zero-point field. This model is based on the observation thatin an accelerated frame the momentum distribution of vacuum fluctuations is notisotropic. We analyze this issue through standard techniques of relativisticfield theory, first by regarding the field A_mu as a classical random field,and then by making reference to the mass renormalization procedure in QuantumElectrodynamics and scalar-QED.
