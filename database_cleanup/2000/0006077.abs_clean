Generalized Wess-Zumino models which admit topologically non-trivial BPSsaturated configurations along one compact, spatial dimension are investigatedin various dimensions of space-time. We show that, in a representative modeland for sufficiently large circumference, there are BPS configurations alongthe compact dimension containing an arbitrary number of equidistant,well-separated domain walls. We analyze the spectrum of the bosonic andfermionic light and massless modes that are localized on these walls. Themasses of the light modes are exponentially suppressed by the ratio of thedistance between the walls and their width. States that are initially localizedon one wall oscillate in time between all the walls. In (2+1) dimensions the``chirality'' of localized, massless fermions is determined. In the(1+1)-dimensional case we show how the mass of certain classically BPSsaturated solitons is lifted above the BPS bound by instanton tunneling.
