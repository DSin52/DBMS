This note focuses on the coupling of a type IIA D2-brane to a background Bfield. It is shown that the D0-brane charge arising from the integral over theD2-brane of the pullback of the B field is cancelled by bulk contributions, fora compact D2-brane wrapping a homotopically trivial cycle in space-time. InM-theory this cancellation is a straightforward consequence of momentumconservation. This result resolves a puzzle recently posed by Bachas, Douglasand Schweigert related to the quantization of R-R charges on stable sphericalD2-branes on the group manifold SU(2).
