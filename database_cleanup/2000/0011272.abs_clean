Repino, St.Petersburg, Russia, February 14-20, 2000, version to appear in theProceedingsWe explain what is the challenge of light-front quantisation, and how we cannow answer it because of recent progress in solving the problem of zero modesin the case of non-Abelian gauge theories. We also give a description of thelight-front Hamiltonian for SU(2) finite volume gluodynamics resulting fromthis recent solution to the problem of light-front zero modes.
