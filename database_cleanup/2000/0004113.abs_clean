In this note we obtain the discrete spectrum of the rotating ellipsoidalmembrane, the solution to classical equations of motion in the matrix mechanicsof N D0-branes. This solution has the interpretation of a closed D2-brane withthe D0-branes bound to its surface. The semi-classical quantization isperformed on the rotational modes with the result that both radii and energyare quantized. We also argue that the quantum mechanics of this system is welldefined, with a unique ground state of positive energy in each sector with anon-zero angular momentum. The scaling of the size and energy of these statesallows us to identify our rotating brane excited states with the previouslyconjectured resonances in the scattering of D0-branes.
