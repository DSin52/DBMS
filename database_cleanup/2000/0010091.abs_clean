We develop techniques to construct general discrete Wilson lines infour-dimensional N=1 Type IIB orientifolds, their T-dual realizationcorresponds to branes positioned at the orbifold fixed points. The explicitorder two and three Wilson lines along with their tadpole consistencyconditions are given for D=4 N=1 Z_6 Type IIB orientifold. The systematicsearch for all models with general order three Wilson lines leads to a smallclass of inequivalent models. There are only two inequivalent classes of apotentially phenomenologically interesting model that has a possibleSU(3)_{color} x SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_{B-L} gauge structure, arising from aset of branes located at the Z_6 orbifold fixed point. We calculate thespectrum and Yukawa couplings for this model. On the other hand, introductionof anti-branes allows for models with three families and realistic gauge groupassignment, arising from branes located at the Z_3 orbifold fixed points.
