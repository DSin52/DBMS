It is conjectured that strongly coupled, spatially noncommutative $\CN=4$Yang-Mills theory has a dual description as a weakly coupled open string theoryin a near critical electric field, and that this dual theory is fully decoupledfrom closed strings. Evidence for this conjecture is given by the absence ofphysical closed string poles in the non-planar one-loop open string diagram.The open string theory can be viewed as living in a geometry in which space andtime coordinates do not commute.
