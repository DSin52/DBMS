The one-loop correction to the spectrum of Kaluza-Klein system for the$\phi^3$ model on $R^{1,d}\times (T_\theta^2)^L$ is evaluated in the hightemperature limit, where the $1+d$ dimensions are the ordinary flat Minkowskispacetimes and the $L$ extra two-dimensional tori are chosen to be thenoncommutative torus with noncommutativity $\theta$. The corrections to theKaluza-Klein mass formula are evaluated and used to compute the Casimir energywith the help of the Schwinger perturbative formula in the zeta-functionregularization method. The results show that the one-loop Casimir energy isindependent of the radius of torus if L=1. However, when $L>1$ the Casimirenergy could give repulsive force to stabilize the extra noncommutative torusif $d-L$ is a non-negative even integral. This therefore suggests a possiblestabilization mechanism of extra radius in high temperature, when the extraspaces are noncommutative.
