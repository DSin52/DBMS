Connes' gauge theory on $M_4\times Z_2$ is reformulated in the Lagrangianlevel. It is pointed out that the field strength in Connes' gauge theory is notunique. We explicitly construct a field strength different from Connes' one andprove that our definition leads to the generation-number independent Higgspotential. It is also shown that the nonuniqueness is related to the assumptionthat two different extensions of the differential geometry are possible whenthe extra one-form basis $\chi$ is introduced to define the differentialgeometry on $M_4\times Z_2$. Our reformulation is applied to the standard modelbased on Connes' color-flavor algebra. A connection between the unimodularitycondition and the electric charge quantization is then discussed in thepresence or absence of $\nu_R$.
