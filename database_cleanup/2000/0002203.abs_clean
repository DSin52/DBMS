The Wilsonian renormalization group implies that an arbitrary fourdimensional field theory with an ultraviolet cutoff is equivalent to a theorywhich is renormalizable by power counting at energy scales much below thecutoff. This applies to any theory including those with non-renormalizableinteractions as long as we fine-tune the mass parameters. We analyze two simplemodels with current-current interactions but without elementary gauge fieldsfrom this viewpoint. We show how to tune the parameters of the models so thatthey become equivalent to QED at energies much below the cutoff.
