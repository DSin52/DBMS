The microscopic spectral correlators of the Dirac operator inthree-dimensional Yang-Mills theory coupled to fundamental fermions and withthree or more colours are derived from the supersymmetric formulation ofpartially quenched effective Lagrangians. The flavour supersymmetry breakingpatterns are appropriately identified and used to calculate the correspondingfinite volume partition functions from Itzykson-Zuber type integrals oversupersymmetric cosets. New and simple determinant expressions for the spectralcorrelators in the mesoscopic scaling region are thereby found. The microscopicspectrum derived from the effective finite volume partition function ofthree-dimensional QCD agrees with earlier results based on the unitary ensembleof random matrix theory and extends the corresponding calculations for QCD infour dimensions.
