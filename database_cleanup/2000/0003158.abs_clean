We apply the background field method and the effective action formalism todescribe the four-dimensional dynamical Casimir effect. Our picture correspondsto the consideration of quantum cosmology for an expanding FRW universe (theboundary conditions act as a moving mirror) filled by a quantum massless GUTwhich is conformally invariant. We consider cases in which the static Casimirenergy is repulsive and attractive. Inserting the simplest possible inertialterm, we find, in the adiabatic (and semiclassical) approximation, thedynamical evolution of the scale factor and the dynamical Casimir stressanalytically and numerically (for SU(2) super Yang-Mills theory). Alternativekinetic energy terms are explored in the Appendix.
