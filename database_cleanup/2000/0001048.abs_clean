Combining a local gauge principle, the Pauli Exclusion Principle, and theprinciples of General Relativity in a particular way, we obtain themathematical framework for the formulation of a new type of variationalprinciple in space-time. The postulate that physics can be formulated withinthis framework is called the "principle of the fermionic projector."The principle of the fermionic projector is introduced and discussed. Wedescribe a limiting process with which our variational principles can beanalyzed in the setting of relativistic quantum mechanics and classical fieldtheory.
