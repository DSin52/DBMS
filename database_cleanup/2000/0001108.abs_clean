We study the impact of Aharonov-Bohm solenoid on the radiation of a chargedparticle moving in a constant uniform magnetic field. With this aim in view,exact solutions of Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations are found in themagnetic-solenoid field. Using such solutions, we calculate exactly all thecharacteristics of one-photon spontaneous radiation both for spinless andspinning particle. Considering non-relativistic and relativisticapproximations, we analyze cyclotron and synchrotron radiations in detail.Radiation peculiarities caused by the presence of the solenoid may beconsidered as a manifestation of Aharonov-Bohm effect in the radiation. Inparticular, it is shown that new spectral lines appear in the radiationspectrum. Due to angular distribution peculiarities of the radiation intensity,these lines can in principle be isolated from basic cyclotron and synchrotronradiation spectra
