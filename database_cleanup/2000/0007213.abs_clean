domain walls included. Corrected analysis in section twoVarious aspects of low energy M theory compactified to four dimensions areconsidered. If the supersymmetry parameter is parallel in the unwarped metric,then supersymmetry requires that the warp factor is trivial, the backgroundfour-form field strength is zero and that the internal 7-manifold has $G_2$holonomy (we assume the absence of boundaries and other impurities). A proposalof Gukov - extended here to include M2-brane domain walls - for thesuperpotential of the compactified theory is shown to yield the same result.Finally, we make some speculative remarks concerning higher derivativecorrections and supersymmetry breaking.
