We study the thermodynamical and geometrical behaviour of the black holesthat arise as solutions of the heterotic string action. We discuss thenear-horizon scaling behaviour of the solutions that are described bytwo-dimensional Anti-de Sitter Space AdS(2). We find that finite-energyexcitations of AdS(2) are suppressed only for scaling limits characterised by adilaton which is constant near the horizon, whereas this suppression does notoccur when the dilaton is non constant.
