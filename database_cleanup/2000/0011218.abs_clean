Using background field perturbation theory we study Wilsonian effectiveactions of noncommutative gauge theories with an arbitrary matter content. Wedetermine the Wilsonian coupling constant and the gauge boson polarizationtensor as functions of the momentum scale k at the one-loop level and studytheir short-distance behaviour as theta k ->0, where theta is thenoncommutativity parameter. The mixing between the short-distance and thelong-distance degrees of freedom characteristic of noncommutative fieldtheories violates the universality of the Wilsonian action and leads toIR-singularities. We find, in agreement with known results, that the quadraticIR divergencies cancel in supersymmetric gauge theories. The logarithmicdivergencies disappear in mass-deformed N=4 theories, but not in other finiteN=2 theories. We next concentrate on finite N=2 and mass-deformed N=4supersymmetric U(1) gauge theories with massive hypermultiplets. The Wilsonianrunning coupling exhibits a non-trivial threshold behaviour at and well belowthe noncomutativity scale, eventually becoming flat in the extreme infrared inN=4 theories, but not in N=2 theories. This is interpreted as the(non)-existence of a non-singular commutative limit where the theory isdescribed by a commutative N=2 pure U(1) theory. We expect that our analysis offinite theories is exact to all orders in perturbation theory.
