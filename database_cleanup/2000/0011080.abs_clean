Title: Connes' Gauge Theory on Noncommutative Space-Times

Comments: LaTeX file, 20 pages

Connes' gauge theory is defined on noncommutative space-times. It is appliedto formulate a noncommutative Glashow-Weinberg-Salam (GWS) model in theleptonic sector. It is shown that the model has two Higgs doublets and thegauge bosons sector after the Higgs mechanism contains the massive chargedgauge fields, two massless and two massive neutral gauge fields. It is alsoshown that, in the tree level, the neutrino couples to one of two `photons',the electron interacts with both `photons' and there occurs a nontrivial$\nu_R$-interaction on noncommutative space-times. Our noncommutative GWS modelis reduced to the GWS theory in the commutative limit. Thus in the neutralgauge bosons sector there are only one massless photon and only one $Z^0$ inthe commutative limit.
