Tachyon condensation on a bosonic D-brane was recently demonstratednumerically in Witten's open string field theory with level truncationapproximation. This non-perturbative vacuum, which is obtained by solving theequation of motion, has to satisfy furthermore the requirement of BRSTinvariance. This is indispensable in order for the theory around thenon-perturbative vacuum to be consistent. We carry out the numerical analysisof the BRST invariance of the solution and find that it holds to a goodaccuracy. We also mention the zero-norm property of the solution. Theobservations in this paper are expected to give clues to the analyticexpression of the vacuum solution.
