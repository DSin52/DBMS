We show that N=1, D=4 Einstein-frame supergravity is inconsistent at one loopbecause of an anomaly in local supersymmetry transformations. A Jacobian mustbe added to the Einstein-frame Lagrangian to cancel this anomaly. We show howthe Jacobian arises from the super-Weyl field redefinition that takes thesuperspace Lagrangian to the Einstein frame. We present an explicit examplewhich demonstrates that the Jacobian is necessary for one-loop scatteringamplitudes to be frame independent.
