In the present paper we introduce a hierarquical class of self-dual models inthree dimensions, inspired in the original self-dual theory ofTowsend-Pilch-Nieuwenhuizen. The basic strategy is to explore the powerfulproperty of the duality transformations in order to generate a new field. Thegeneralized propagator can be written in terms of the primitive one (firstorder), and also the respective order and disorder correlation functions. Someconclusions about the ``charge screening'' and magnetic flux were established.
