We study worldsheet and spacetime properties of the p-p' (p < p') open stringsystem with constant B_{ij} field viewed from the Dp' brane. The description ofthis system in terms of the CFT with spin and twist fields leads us to considerthe renormal ordering procedure from the SL(2,R) invariant vacuum to theoscillator vacuum. We compute the attendant two distinct superspace two-pointfunctions as well as their difference (the subtracted two-point function).These bring us an integral (Koba-Nielsen) representation for the multiparticletree scattering amplitudes consisting of N-2 vectors and two tachyons. Weevaluate them explicitly for the N=3,4 cases. Several novel features areobserved which include a momentum dependent multiplicative factor to eachexternal vector leg and the emergence of a symplectic tensor multiplying thepolarization vectors. In the zero slope limit, the principal parts of theamplitudes translate into a noncommutative field theory in p'+1 dimensions inwhich a scalar field decaying exponentially in (p'-p) dimensions and anoncommutative U(1) gauge field interact via the minimal coupling and a newinteraction. A large number of nearly massless states noted before are shown topropagate in the t-channel.
