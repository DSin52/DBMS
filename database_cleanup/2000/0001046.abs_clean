In the semiclassical approximation in which the electric charges of scalarparticles are described by Grassmann variables ($Q_i^2=0, Q_iQ_j\ne 0$), it ispossible to re-express the Lienard-Wiechert potentials and electric fields inthe radiation gauge as phase space functions, because the difference amongretarded, advanced, and symmetric Green functions is of order Q_i^2. By workingin the rest-frame instant form of dynamics, the elimination of theelectromagnetic degrees of freedom by means of suitable second classscontraints leads to the identification of the Lienard-Wiechert reduced phasespace containing only N charged particles with mutual action-at-a-distancevector and scalar potentials. A Darboux canonical basis of the reduced phasespace is found. This allows one to re-express the potentials for arbitrary N asa unique effective scalar potential containing the Coulomb potential and thecomplete Darwin one, whose 1/c^2 component agrees for with the knownexpression. The effective potential gives the classical analogue of all staticand non-static effects of the one-photon exchange Feynman diagram of scalarelectrodynamics.
