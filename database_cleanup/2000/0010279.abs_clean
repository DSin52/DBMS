Title: Type-I vacua and brane transmutation

Comments: 13 pages. Latex. Contribution to the Conference on ``Quantisation,

Gauge Theory, and Strings'' dedicated to the memory of Professor Efim S.FradkinIn a classic paper, Fradkin and Tseytlin showed how magnetic deformations canbe introduced in open strings. In this contribution we review some recent workon type-I vacua with magnetised branes and describe the role of additionaldiscrete deformations, related to quantised values of the NS-NS antisymmetrictensor B_ab.
