The purpose of this review is to discuss recent developments occurring at theinterface of cosmology with string and M-theory. We begin with a short reviewof 1980s string cosmology and the Brandenberger-Vafa mechanism for explainingspacetime dimensionality. It is shown how this scenario has been modified toinclude the effects of p-brane gases in the early universe. We then introducethe Pre-Big-Bang scenario (PBB), Ho\v{r}ava-Witten heterotic M-theory and thework of Lukas, Ovrut and Waldram, and end with a discussion of large extradimensions, the Randall-Sundrum model and Brane World cosmologies.
