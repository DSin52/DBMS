some minor misprints correctedAbelian and center gauges are considered in continuum Yang-Mills theory inorder to detect the magnetic monopole and center vortex content of gauge fieldconfigurations. Specifically we examine the Laplacian Abelian and centergauges, which are free of Gribov copies, as well as the center gauge analog ofthe (Abelian) Polyakov gauge. In particular, we study meron, instanton andinstanton-anti-instanton field configurations in these gauges and determinetheir monopole and vortex content. While a single instanton does not give riseto a center vortex, we find center vortices for merons. Furthermore we provideevidence, that merons can be interpreted as intersection points of centervortices. For the instanton-anti-instanton pair, we find a center vortexenclosing their centers, which carries two monopole loops.
