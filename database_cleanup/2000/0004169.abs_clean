Title: Turbulence as a constrained system

Authors: A. C. R. Mendes, W. Oliveira and F. I. Takakura

Hydrodynamic turbulence is studied as a constrained system from the point ofview of metafluid dynamics. We present a Lagrangian description for this newtheory of turbulence inspired from the analogy with electromagnetism.Consequently it is a gauge theory. This new approach to the study of turbulencetends to renew the optimism to solve the difficult problem of turbulence. As aconstrained system, turbulence is studied in the Dirac and Faddeev-Jackiwformalisms giving the Dirac brackets. An important result is that we show thesebrackets are the same in and out of the inertial range, giving the way toquantize turbulence.
