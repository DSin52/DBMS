Both, spin and statistics of a quantum system can be seen to arise fromunderlying (quantum) group symmetries. We show that the spin-statistics theoremis equivalent to a unification of these symmetries. Besides covering theBose-Fermi case we classify the corresponding possibilities for anyonic spinand statistics. We incorporate the underlying extended concept of symmetry intoquantum field theory in a generalised path integral formulation capable ofhandling general braid statistics. For bosons and fermions the different pathintegrals and Feynman rules naturally emerge without introducing Grassmannvariables. We also consider the anyonic example of quons and obtain the pathintegral counterpart to the usual canonical approach.
