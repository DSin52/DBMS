In this paper, the low-energy effective dynamics of M-theory,eleven-dimensional supergravity, is taken off-shell in a manifestlysupersymmetric formulation. We show that a previously proposed relaxation ofthe superspace torsion constraints does indeed accommodate a currentsupermultiplet which lifts the equations of motion corresponding to theordinary second order derivative supergravity lagrangian. Whether the auxiliaryfields obtained this way can be used to construct an off-shell lagrangian isnot yet known. We comment on the relation and application of this completelygeneral formalism to higher-derivative (R^4) corrections. Some details of thecalculation are saved for a later publication.
