Title: Supersymmetric Field Theories on Deformed Space-Time

Authors: M. A. Lled\'o

Comments: Talk given at the IX Marcel Grossmann Meeting. July 2000, Rome

Field theories on "quantum" or deformed space-time are considered here. TheMoyal-Weyl deformation breaks the Lorentz invariance of the theory, but one canstill require invariance under the supertranslation algebra. We investigatesome aspects of the Wess-Zumino model, super Yang-Mills theories and analyzethe correspondence of the later with the supersymmetric Born-Infeld action.
