We discuss the possibility of having gravity ``localized'' in dimension d ina system where gauge bosons propagate in dimension d+1. In such a circumstancemight expect the gauge symmetry in d+1 dimensions to behave like a globalsymmetry in d dimensions, despite the presence of gravity. Naive extrapolationof warped long-wavelength solutions of general relativity coupled to scalarsand gauge fields suggests that such an effect might be possible. However, insome basic realizations of such solutions in M theory, we find that this effectdoes not persist microscopically. It turns over either to screening or theHiggs mechanism at long distances in the d-dimensional description of thesystem. We briefly discuss the physics of charged objects in this type ofsystem.
