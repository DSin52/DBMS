Title: On The BRST Formulation of Diffeomorphism Invariant 4D Quantum Gravity

Comments: Latex, 11 pages

In this note we give some remarks on the BRST formulation of a renormalizableand diffemorphism invariant 4D quantum gravity recently proposed by the author,which satisfies the integrability condition by Riegard, Fradkin and Tseytlin atthe 2-loop level. Diffeomorphism invariance requires an addition of theWess-Zumino action, from which the Weyl action can be induced by expandingaround a vacuum expectation value of the conformal mode. This fact suggests thetheory has in itself a mechanism to remove extra negative-metric statesdynamically.
