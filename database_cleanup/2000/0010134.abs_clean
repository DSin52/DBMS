Title: Chaotic Quantization of Classical Gauge Fields

Authors: T.S. Biro, S.G. Matinyan and B. Muller

Comments: Talk presented at the 24th John Hopkins Workshop, aug.19-21, 2000,

Budapest, Hungary. 10 pages LaTeXWe argue that higher dimensional classical, nonabelian gauge theory may leadto a lower dimensional quantum field theory due to its inherent chaoticdynamics which acts like stohastic quantization. The dimensional reduction isbased upon magnetic screening effects analagous to that in nonabelian plasmas.
