We study the localization of various bulk fields on an $AdS_4$ brane in$AdS_5$. In this case, for a small brane cosmological constant, all the bulkfields ranging from scalar to graviton are naturally confined to the brane onlythrough the gravitational interaction. In particular, for the vector field wecan find an interesting zero mode solution which satisfies the box boundarycondition. In the cases of spin 1/2 spinor and 3/2 gravitino fields, the formof zero modes is very similar to as in a flat Minkowski brane, but they aretrapped on the $AdS_4$ brane even without introducing a mass term with a 'kink'profile.
