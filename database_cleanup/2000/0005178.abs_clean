We discuss scalar quantum field theories in a Lorentz-invariantthree-dimensional noncommutative space-time. We first analyze the one-loopdiagrams of the two-point functions, and show that the non-planar diagrams arefinite and have infrared singularities from the UV/IR mixing. The scalarquantum field theories have the problem that the violation of the momentumconservation from the non-planar diagrams does not vanish even in thecommutative limit. A way to obtain an exact translational symmetry byintroducing an infinite number of tensor fields is proposed. The translationalsymmetry transforms local fields into non-local ones in general. We alsodiscuss an analogue of thermodynamics of free scalar field theory in thenoncommutative space-time.
