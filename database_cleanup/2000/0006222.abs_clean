All high-temperature phases of the known N=4 superstrings in five dimensionscan be described by the universal thermal potential of an effectivefour-dimensional supergravity. This theory, in addition to three moduli s, t,u, contains non-trivial winding modes that become massless in certain regionsof the thermal moduli space, triggering the instabilities at the Hagedorntemperature. In this context, we look for exact domain wall solutions of firstorder BPS equations. These solutions preserve half of the supersymmetries, incontrast to the usual finite-temperature weak-coupling approximation, and assuch may constitute a new phase of finite-temperature superstrings. We presentexact solutions for the type-IIA and type-IIB theories and for a self-dualhybrid type-II theory. While for the heterotic case the general solution cannotbe given in closed form, we still present a complete picture and a detailedanalysis of the behaviour around the weak and strong coupling limits and aroundcertain critical points. In all cases these BPS solutions have no instabilitiesat any temperature. Finally, we address the physical meaning of the resultinggeometries within the contexts of supergravity and string theory.
