A consistent truncation of IIB on S^5 has been obtained in the sector of themetric and the 4-form potential. The ansatz contains 20 scalars and all 15gauge fields of ${\cal N}=8$ gauged supergravity in five dimensions. With thisfully non-linear ansatz, the calculations for n-point correlators of superYang-Mills (SYM) theory via AdS/CFT are simpler than those in the literaturethat use {\em linear} ansatz followed by non-linear field redefinitions. Wework out the SYM operators that couple to the scalars by expanding theDirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action plus Wess-Zumino (WZ) terms around an$AdS_5\timesS^5$ background with the metric fluctuations. The resultingoperators agree with those based on a superconformal symmetry argument. Wediscuss the significance of our results.
