Starting from Generating functional for Green Function (GF), constracted fromLagrangian action in Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) theory (L-approach) we strictlyprove that the physical matrix elements of S-matrix in DKP andKlein-Gordon-Fock (KGF) theories coincide in cases of interaction spin Oparticles with external and quantized Maxwell and Yang-Mills fields and in caseof external gravitational field (without or with torsion). For the proof we usereduction formulas of Lehmann Symanzik, Zimmermann (LSZ). We prove that manyphotons and Yang-Mills particles GF coincide in the both theories, too.
