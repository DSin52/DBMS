Static vortices close together are studied for two different models in2-dimen- sional Euclidean space. In a simple model for one complex field anexpansion in the parameters describing the relative position of two vorticescan be given in terms of trigonometric and exponential functions. The resultsare then compared to those of the Ginzburg-Landau theory of a superconductor ina magnetic field at the point between type-I and type-II superconductivity. Forthe angular dependence a similar pattern emerges in both models. Thedifferences for the radial functions are studied up to third order.
