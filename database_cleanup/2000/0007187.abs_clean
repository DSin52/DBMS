Dynamical R-matrix relations are derived for the group-valued chiral vertexoperators in the SU(n) WZNW model from the KZ equation for a general four-pointfunction including two step operators. They fit the exchange relations for theU_q(sl_n) covariant quantum matrix derived previously by solving the dynamicalYang-Baxter equation. As a byproduct, we extend the regular basis introducedearlier for SU(2) chiral fields to SU(n) step operators and display thecorresponding triangular matrix representation of the braid group.
