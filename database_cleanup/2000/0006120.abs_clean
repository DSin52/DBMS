Deformations of topological open string theories are described, with anemphasis on their algebraic structure. They are encoded in the mixedbulk-boundary correlators. They constitute the Hochschild complex of the openstring algebra -- the complex of multilinear maps on the boundary Hilbertspace. This complex is known to have the structure of a Gerstenhaber algebra(Deligne theorem), which is also found in closed string theory. Generalisingthe case of function algebras with a B-field, we identify the algebraicoperations of the bulk sector, in terms of the mixed correlators. This gives aphysical realisation of the Deligne theorem. We translate to the language ofcertain operads (spaces of d-discs with gluing) and d-algebras, and comment ongeneralisations, notably to the AdS/CFT correspondence. The formalism isapplied to the topological A- and B-models on the disc.
