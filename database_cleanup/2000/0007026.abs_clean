We calculate the R-R zero-norm states of type II string spectrum. To fitthese states into the right symmetry charge parameters of the gaugetransformations of the R-R tensor forms, one is forced to T-dualize some type Iopen string space-time coordinates and thus to introduce D-branes into thetheory. We also demonstrate that the constant T-dual R-R 0-form zero-normstate, together with the NS-NS singlet zero-norm state are responsible for theSL(2,Z) S-duality symmetry of the type II B string theory.
