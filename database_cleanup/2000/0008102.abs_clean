In this paper we consider some constraints on brane-world cosmologies. In thefirst part we analyze different behaviors for the expansion of our universe byimposing constraints on the speed of sound. In the second part, we study thenature of matter on the brane world by means of the well-known energyconditions. We find that the strong energy condition must be completelyviolated at late stages of the universe.
