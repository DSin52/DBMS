Comments: revtex, 8 pages, 2 figures. The conclusion is changed to claim that

there is no instanton. Discussions on the supersymmetry of the classicalsolution and the non-relativistic limit are removed and added, respectively.The simulations can now be done atJournal-ref: Phys.Rev. D64 (2001) 046012

I consider the giant gravitons in AdS5 x S5. By numerical simulation, I showa strong indication that there is no instanton solution describing the directtunneling between the giant graviton in the S5 and its dual counterpart in theAdS5. I argue that it supports the supersymmetry breaking scenario suggested inhep-th/0008015
