We argue that traditional methods of compactification of string theory makeit very difficult to understand how the cosmological constant becomes zero.String inspired models can give zero cosmological constant after fine tuningbut since string theory has no free parameters it is not clear that this isallowed. Brane world scenarios on the other hand while they do not answer thequestion as to why the cosmological constant is zero do actually allow a choiceof integration constants that permit flat four space solutions. In this paperwe discuss gauged supergravity realizations of such a world. To the extent thatthis starting point can be considered a low energy effective action of stringtheory (and there is some recent evidence supporting this) our model may beconsidered a string theory realization of this scenario.
