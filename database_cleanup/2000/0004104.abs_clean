We present a supersymmetric version of Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) theory innoncommutative space-time, both for Abelian and non-Abelian gauge groups. Weshow, using the superfield formalism, that the definition of a certain orderingwith respect to the * product leads naturally to a DBI action both in the U(1)as well as in the U(N) case. BPS equations are analysed in this context andproperties of the resulting theory are discussed.
