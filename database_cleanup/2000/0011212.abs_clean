Title: A Linear-confined Particle and the Dirac Equation

Authors: J. Weiss

Comments: AMS-TeX, 12 pages

The model of a classical particle with the weak linear AAD potential issubjected to path integral quantization. The light cone constraints andpeculiar properies of its internal variables permit to use in calculationscommutative dynamics and apply path integrals for a matrix form of thetransition amplitude. Quantization leads to description of a Dirac particle.
