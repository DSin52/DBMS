Starting from a recently proposed abelian topological model in (2+1)dimensions, we use the method of the consistent deformations to prove that atopologically massive model involving the Kalb-Ramond two form field does notadmit a nonabelian generalization. The introduction of a connection-type oneform field keeps the previous result. However we show that the goal is achievedif we introduce a vectorial auxiliary field, exhibiting a nonabeliantopological mass generation mechanism in D=3, that provides mass for theKalb-Ramond field. Further, we find the complete set of BRST and anti-BRSTequations using the horizontality condition, suggesting a connection betweenthis formalism and the method of the consistent deformations.
