Title: The String Dual of a Confining Four-Dimensional Gauge Theory

Authors: Joseph Polchinski and Matthew J. Strassler

Comments: 66 pages, three figures

We study N=1 gauge theories obtained by adding finite mass terms to N=4vacua, there is an extended brane source, arising from Myers' dielectriceffect. The source consists of one or more (p,q) 5-branes. In particular, theconfining vacuum contains an NS5-brane; the confining flux tube is afundamental string bound to the 5-brane. The system admits a simplequantitative description as a perturbation of a state on the N=4 Coulombbranch. Various nonperturbative phenomena, including flux tubes, baryonvertices, domain walls, condensates and instantons, have new, quantitativelyprecise, dual descriptions. We also briefly consider two QCD-like theories. Ourmethod extends to the nonsupersymmetric case. As expected, the N=4 mattercannot be decoupled within the supergravity regime.
