Title: Some Reflections on Moduli, Their Stabilization and Cosmology

Comments: 22 pp. latex. Invited talk presented at ITP Conference on New

Dimensions in Field Theory and String Theory, ITP Nov, 1999. Some typos andrefs. fixedWe review some aspects of moduli in string theory. We argue that one shouldfocus on {\it approximate moduli spaces}, and that there is evidence that suchspaces exist non-perturbatively. We ask what it would mean for string theory topredict low energy supersymmetry. Aspects of two proposed mechanisms for fixingthe moduli are discussed, and solutions to certain cosmological problemsassociated with moduli are proposed.
