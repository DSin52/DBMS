In this paper we continue the study of the model proposed in the previouspaper hep-th/0002077. The model consist of a system of extended objects ofdiverse dimensionalities, with or without boundaries, with actions of theChern-Simons form for a supergroup. We also discuss possible connections withSuperstring/M-theory.
