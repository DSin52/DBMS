The effective action for the Polyakov loop serving as an order parameter fordeconfinement is obtained in one-loop approximation to second order in aderivative expansion. The calculation is performed in $d\geq 4$ dimensions,mostly referring to the gauge group SU(2). The resulting effective action isonly capable of describing a deconfinement phase transition for$d>d_{\text{cr}}\simeq 7.42$. Since, particularly in $d=4$, the system isstrongly governed by infrared effects, it is demonstrated that an additionalinfrared scale such as an effective gluon mass can change the physicalproperties of the system drastically, leading to a model with a deconfinementphase transition.
