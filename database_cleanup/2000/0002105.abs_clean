We present some results about the interplay between the chiral anddeconfinement phase transitions in parity-conserving QED3 (with N flavours ofmassless 4 component fermions) at finite temperature. Following Grignani et al(Phys. Rev. D53, 7157 (1996), Nucl. Phys. B473, 143 (1996)), confinement isdiscussed in terms of an effective Sine-Gordon theory for the timelikecomponent of the gauge field A_0. But whereas in the references above thefermion mass m is a Lagrangian parameter, we consider the m=0 case and askwhether an effective S-G theory can again be derived with m replaced by thedynamically generated mass Sigma which appears below T_{ch}, the criticaltemperature for the chiral phase transition. The fermion and gauge sectors arestrongly interdependent, but as a first approximation we decouple them bytaking Sigma to be a constant, depending only on the constant part of the gaugefield. We argue that the existence of a low-temperature confining phase may beassociated with the generation of Sigma; and that, analogously, the vanishingof Sigma for T > T_{ch} drives the system to its deconfining phase. The effectof the gauge field dynamics on mass generation is also indicated. (38kb)
