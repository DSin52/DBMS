We propose a non-Abelian generalization of the Clebsch parameterization for avector in three dimensions. The construction is based on a group-theoreticalreduction of the Chern-Simons form on a symmetric space. The formalism is thenused to give a canonical (symplectic) discussion of non-Abelian fluidmechanics, analogous to the way the Abelian Clebsch parameterization allows acanonical description of conventional fluid mechanics.
