In the Kaluza - Klein approach the (4+d)-dimensional Einstein--Hilbertgravity action is considered. The extra d-dimensional manifold V_d is a Riemannspace with the d-parametric group of isometry $G_d$ which acts on V_d by theleft shifts and with arbitrary nondegenerated left-invariant metric g_{ab}. Thegauge fields A_{\mu} are introduced as the affine connection coefficients ofthe fibre bundle with V_d being the fibre. The effective Lagrangian asinvariant integral over extra-dimensional manifold of the curvative scalar ofmentioned structure is obtained. It is shown that such effective Lagrangiancontains beside the square of gauge field strength tensor also quadratic formof A_{\mu} and all other fields have only pure gauge degrees of freedom wheng_{ab}. satisfy some conditions. This conditions may be regarded asgeneralization of the General Relativity Principle to the extra dimensions. Theeigenvalues of the quadratic form of A_{\mu} are calculated for the case ofgauge group SO(3). It is shown that they are not equal to zero in the case wheng_{ab} is not proportional to the unit matrix.
