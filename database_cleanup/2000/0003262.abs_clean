We discuss a model in which our universe is pictured as a recoiling Dirichletsupersymmetry obstruction on the four-dimensional world. An essential featureof our approach is the fact that the underlying worldsheet sigma model isnon-critical, and the Liouville mode plays the role of the target time. Also,the extra bulk dimensions are viewed as sigma model couplings, and as such haveto be averaged by appropriate summation over worldsheet genera. The recoilingbrane is in an excited state rather than its ground state, to which it relaxesasymptotically in time, restoring supersymmetry. We also find that theexcitation energy, which is considered as the observable effective cosmological`constant' on the brane, is naturally small and can accommodate upper boundsfrom observations.
