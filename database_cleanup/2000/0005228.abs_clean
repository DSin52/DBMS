We study the mechanism of enhanced gauge symmetry of bosonic open stringcompatified on torus by analyzing the zero-norm soliton (nonzero winding ofwilson line) gauge states in the spectrum. Unlike the closed string case, wefind that the soliton gauge state exists only at massive levels. These solitongauge states correspond to the existence of enhanced massive gauge symmetrieswith transformation parameters containing both Einstein and Yang-Mills indices.In the T-dual picture, these symmetries exist only at some discrete values ofcompatified radii when N D-branes are coincident.
