Bangalore, IndiaWe consider electric-magnetic duality(S-duality) in IIB matrix model with aD3-brane background. We propose the duality transformation by considering thatof noncommutative Yang-Mills theory(NCYM) in four dimension. NCYM derived fromthe matrix model has a Yang-Mills coupling related to the noncommutativity ofthe spacetime. We argue that open strings bits as bi-local fields on thespacetime are decoupled from the bulk in NCOS decoupling limits as it is instring theory approach. We also discuss how our four dimensional spacetimerelates to higher, by applying the decoupling and the commutative limits of thebackgrounds of the matrix model.
