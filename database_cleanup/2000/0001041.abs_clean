We compute the conformal anomaly of free d=6 superconformal (2,0) tensormultiplet on generic curved background. Up to a trivial covarianttotal-derivative term, it is given by the sum of the type A part proportionalto the 6-d Euler density, and the type B part containing three independent Weylinvariants. Multiplied by factor 4N^3, the type B part of the anomalyreproduces exactly the corresponding part of the conformal anomaly of large Nmultiple M5-brane (2,0) theory as predicted (hep-th/9806087) by the AdS/CFTcorrespondence. The coefficients of the type A anomaly differ by the factor 4/7x 4 N^3, so that the free tensor multiplet anomaly does not vanish on aRicci-flat background. The coefficient 4N^3 is the same as found(hep-th/9703040) in the comparison of the tensor multiplet theory and the d=11supergravity results for the absorption cross-sections of gravitons by M5branes, and in the comparison (hep-th/9911135) of 2- and 3-point stress tensorcorrelators of the free tensor multiplet with the AdS_7 supergravitypredictions. The reason for this coincidence is that the three Weyl-invariantterms in the anomaly are related to the $h^2$ and $h^3$ terms in the near flatspace expansion of the corresponding non-local effective action, and thus tothe 2-point and 3-point stress tensor correlators in flat background. At thesame time, the type A anomaly is related to the $h^4$ term in the non-localpart of the effective action, i.e. to a certain structure in the 4-pointcorrelation function of stress tensors.
