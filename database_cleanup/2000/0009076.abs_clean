By using the background field method of QCD in a path integral approach, wederive the equation of motion for the classical chromofield and for the gluonin a system containing the gluon and the classical chromofield simultaneously.This inhomogeneous field equation contains a current term, which is theexpectation value of a composite operator including linear, square and cubicterms of the gluon field. We also derive identities which the current shouldobey from the gauge invariance. We calculate the current at the leading orderwhere the current induced by the gluon is opposite in sign to that induced bythe quark. This is just the feature of the non-Abelian gauge field theory whichhas asymptotic freedom. Physically, the induced current can be treated as the'displacement' current in the polarized vacuum, and its effect is equivalent toredefining the field and the coupling constant.
