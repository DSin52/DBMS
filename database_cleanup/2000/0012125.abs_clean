We review the main algebraic aspects that characterize and determine thedomain wall solutions of maximal gauged supergravity in various spacetimedimensions by considering consistent truncations that retain a number ofcomponents in the diagonal of the coset space scalar manifold of the theory.Starting from the algebraic classification of domain walls in D=4 gaugedsupergravity, we also derive the corresponding solutions in D=5 and D=7dimensions. From a higher dimensional point of view, these solutions describethe gravitatonal field, in the field theory limit, of a large number of M2-,D3- and M5-branes that are distributed on hypersurfaces in the transverse spaceto the branes. As a new result we employ a smearing procedure as well asvarious dualities to list the irreducible curves and the symmetry groups ofp-brane distributions for all values of p that are of interest in currentapplications of string theory. Some emphasis is placed on the presentation ofnew results in the case of NS5-branes.
