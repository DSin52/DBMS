Some aspects of the $D=6, (2,0)$ tensor multiplet are discussed. Itsformulation as an analytic superfield on a suitably defined superspace and itssuperconformal properties are reviewed. Powers of the field strength superfielddefine a series of superconformal fields which correspond to the KK multipletsof D=11 supergravity on an $AdS_7\xz S^4$ background. Correlation functions ofthese operators are briefly discussed.
