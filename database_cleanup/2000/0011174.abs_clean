The Wess-Zumino model is analysed in the framework of the causal approach ofEpstein-Glaser. The condition of invariance with respect to supersymmetrytransformations is similar to the gauge invariance in the Z\"urich formulation.We prove that this invariance condition can be implemented in all orders ofperturbation theory, i.e. the anomalies are absent in all orders. This resultis of purely algebraic nature. We work consistently in the quantum frameworkbased on Bogoliubov axioms of perturbation theory so no Grassmann variables arenecessary.
