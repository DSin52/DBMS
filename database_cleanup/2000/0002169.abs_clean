We continue to explore the conjectural expressions of the Gromov-Wittenpotentials for a class of elliptically and K3 fibered Calabi-Yau 3-folds in thelimit where the base P^1 of the K3 fibration becomes infinitely large. At leastin this limit we argue that the string partition function (=the exponentialgenerating function of the Gromov-Witten potentials) can be expressed as aninfinite product in which the Kahler moduli and the string coupling are treatedsomewhat on an equal footing. Technically speaking, we use the exponentiallifting of a weight zero Jacobi form to reach the infinite product as in thecelebrated work of Borcherds. However, the relevant Jacobi form is associatedwith a lattice of Lorentzian signature. A major part of this work is devoted toan attempt to interpret the infinite product or more precisely the Jacobi formin terms of the bound states of D2- and D0-branes using a vortex descriptionand its suitable generalization.
