The Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin (BFT) scheme, which is an improved version ofDirac quantization, is applied to the $CP^1$ model, and the compact form of anontrivial first-class Hamiltonian is directly obtained by introducing the BFTphysical fields. We also derive a BRST-invariant gauge fixed Lagrangian throughthe standard path-integral procedure. Furthermore, performing collectivecoordinate quantization we obtain energy spectrum of rigid rotator in the$CP^1$ model. Exploiting the Hopf bundle, we also show that the $CP^1$ model isexactly equivalent to the O(3) nonlinear sigma model at the canonical level.
