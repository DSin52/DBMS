We discuss the large N limit of Calogero-Moser models for the classicalinfinite families of simple Lie algebras A_N, B_N, C_N and D_N. We show thatthe limit defines two different Conformal Field Theories with central chargec>1. The value of c and the dimension of the primary field are dictated by theunderlying algebraic symmetries of the model.
