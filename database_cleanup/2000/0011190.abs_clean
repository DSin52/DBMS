We construct supergravity solutions corresponding to fivebranes wrappingassociative three-cycles of constant curvature in manifolds of G_2-holonomy.The solutions preserve 2 supercharges and are first constructed in D=7 gaugedsupergravity and then lifted to D=10,11. We show that the low-energy theory ofM-fivebranes wrapped on a compact hyperbolic three-space is dual to asuperconformal field theory in D=3 by exhibiting a flow to an AdS_4 region. ForIIB-fivebranes wrapped on a three-sphere we speculate on a connection withspontaneous supersymmetry breaking of pure N=1 super Yang-Mills theory in D=3.
