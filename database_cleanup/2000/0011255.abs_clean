Title: On Isolated Vacua and Background Independence

Authors: T.Banks

Comments: JHEP LaTeX, 13 pages. Various comments added in response to

correspondents' questions. In particular, generality of the result beyond thecontext of N=1 SUSY is given more emphasisI argue that isolated vacua of M-theory, cannot in any conventional way besaid to live in the same theory as other disconnected parts of the modulispace. The usual field theoretic mechanisms, which allow an observer in onedisconnected component of a moduli space to verify the existence of othercomponents, fail. The failure is a consequence of robust properties of blackholes. When barriers between components are much smaller than the Planck scale,the usual field theoretic picture is approximately valid.
