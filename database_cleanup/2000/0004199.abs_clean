In a recent paper, we have pointed out a relation between the Killing spinorand Einstein equations. Using this relation, new brane solutions of D=11 andD=10 type IIB supergravity theories are constructed. It is shown that in abrane solution, the flat world-volume directions, the smeared transversedirections and the sphere located at a fixed radial distance can be replacedwith any Lorentzian Ricci flat, Euclidean Ricci flat and Einstein manifolds,respectively. The solution obtained in this fashion is supersymmetric when theRicci flat and Einstein manifolds have Killing spinors. We generalizeintersecting brane solutions, in which M5, M2 and D3-branes also wrap over thecycles determined by the K\"{a}hler forms of Ricci flat K\"{a}hler manifolds.New, singular, Ricci flat manifolds as (generalized) cones over the U(1)bundles over Ricci flat K\"{a}hler spaces are constructed. These manifolds havecovariantly constant spinors and give rise to new, supersymmetric, Ricci flatcompactifications of non-gauged supergravity theories. We find M2 and D3-branesolutions, which asymptotically approach these singular vacua.
