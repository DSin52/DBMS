and grammatical errors removed. No changes were made in the physical contentsWithout invalidating quantum mechanics as a principle underlying the dynamicsof a fundamental theory, it is possible to ask for even more basic dynamicallaws that may yield quantum mechanics as the machinery needed for itsstatistical analysis. In conventional systems such as the Standard Model forquarks and leptons, this would lead to hidden variable theories, which areknown to be plagued by problems such as non-locality. But Planck scale physicsis so different from field theories in some flat background space-time thatonly be restored by postulating a deterministic underlying theory. A price tobe paid may be that the underlying theory exhibits dissipation of information.
