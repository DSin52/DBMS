The noncommutative soliton is characterized by the use of the projectionoperators in non-commutative space. By using the close relation with theK-theory of $C^*$-algebra, we consider the variations of projection operatorsalong the commutative directions and identify their topological charges. Whenapplied to the string theory, it gives the modification of the brane chargesdue to tachyon background.
