We extend the previous work and study the renormalisability of the SU$_L$(2)$\times$ U$_Y$(1) electroweak theory with massive W Z fields and massive matterfields. We expound that with the constraint conditions caused by the W Z massterm and the additional condition chosen by us we can still performed thequantization in the same way as before. We also show that when the $\delta-$functions appearing in the path integral of the Green functions andrepresenting the constraint conditions are rewritten as Fourier integrals withLagrange multipliers $\lambda_a$ and $\lambda_y$, the total effective actionconsisting of the Lagrange multipliers, ghost fields and the original fields isBRST invariant. Furthermore, with the help of the the renormalisability of thetheory without the the mass term of matter fields, we find the general form ofthe divergent part of the generating functional for the regular vertexfunctions and prove the renormalisability of the theory with the mass terms ofthe W Z fields and the matter fields.
