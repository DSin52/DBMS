It has recently been shown that the equation of motion of a massless scalarfield in the background of some specific p branes can be reduced to a modifiedMathieu equation. In the following the absorption rate of the scalar by a D3brane in ten dimensions is calculated in terms of modified Mathieu functions ofthe first kind, using standard Mathieu coefficients. The relation of the latterto Dougall coefficients (used by others) is investigated. The S-matrix obtainedin terms of modified Mathieu functions of the first kind is easily evaluated ifknown rapidly convergent low energy expansions of these in terms of products ofBessel functions are used. Leading order terms, including the interestinglogarithmic contributions, can be obtained analytically.
