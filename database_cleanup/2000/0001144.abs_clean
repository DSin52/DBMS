Title: Noncommutative Open String

Authors: Chong-Sun Chu

Comments: 11 pages. Talk presented at the Anttila winter school and workshop on

``String theory and Gauge theory'' (Anttila, Sweden, Feb 1999), and theInternational Workshop ``Supersymmetries and Quantum Symmetries'' (Dubna,Russia, July 1999), to appear in the proceedingsWe review the quantization of open string in NS-NS background and demonstratethat its endpoint becomes noncommutative. The same approach allows us todetermine the noncommutativity that arises for a charged open string inbackground gauge fields. While NS-NS background is relevant for ``worldvolume''noncommutativity, a simple argument suggests that RR background is likely to berelevant for ``spacetime'' noncommutativity.
