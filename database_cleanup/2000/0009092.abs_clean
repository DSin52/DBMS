The symmetries of the general Euler equations of fluid dynamics withpolytropic exponent are determined using the Kaluza-Klein type framework ofDuval et $\it{al}$. In the standard polytropic case the recent results ofO'Raifeartaigh and Sreedhar are confirmed and generalized. Similar results areproved for polytropic exponent $\gamma=-1$, which corresponds to thedimensional reduction of $d$-branes. The relation between the dualitytransformation used in describing supernova explosion and Cosmology isexplained.
