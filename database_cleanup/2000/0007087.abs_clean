We construct compact type IIB orientifolds with discrete groups Z_4, Z_6,Z_6', Z_8, Z_12 and Z_12'. These models are N=1 supersymmetric in D=4 and havevector structure. The possibility of having vector structure in Z_Norientifolds with even N arises due to an alternative Omega-projection in thetwisted sectors. Some of the models without vector structure are known to beinconsistent because of uncancelled tadpoles. We show that vector structureleads to a sign flip in the twisted Klein bottle contribution. As aconsequence, all the tadpoles can be cancelled by introducing D9-branes andD5-branes.
