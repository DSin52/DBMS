We show that a class of spacetimes introduced by Fayyazuddin and Smith todescribe intersecting M5-branes admit a generalized Kahler calibration.Equipped with this understanding, we are able to construct spacetimescorresponding to further classes of calibrated $p$-brane world-volume solitons.We note that these classes of spacetimes also describe the fields of $p$-braneswrapping certain supersymmetric cycles of Calabi-Yau manifolds.
