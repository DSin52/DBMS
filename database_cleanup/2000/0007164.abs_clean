Title: On generalizations of Verlinde's formula

Authors: P. Bantay

Comments: 6 pages

It is shown that traces of mapping classes of finite order may be expressedby Verlinde-like formulae. The 3D topological argument is explained, and theresulting trace identities for modular matrix elements are presented.
