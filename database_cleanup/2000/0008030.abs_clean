T-duality of gauge theories on a noncommutative $T^d$ can be extended toinclude fields with twisted boundary conditions. The resulting T-dual theoriescontain novel nonlocal fields. These fields represent dipoles of constantmagnitude. Several unique properties of field theories on noncommutative spaceshave simpler counterparts in the dipole-theories.
