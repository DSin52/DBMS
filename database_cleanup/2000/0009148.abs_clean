The study of open string tachyon condensation in string field theory can bedrastically simplified by making an appropriate choice of coordinates on thespace of string fields. We show that a very natural coordinate system issuggested by the connection between the worldsheet renormalization group andspacetime physics. In this system only one field, the tachyon, condenses whileall other fields have vanishing expectation values. These coordinates are alsowell-suited to the study of D-branes as solitons. We use them to show that thetension of the D25-brane is cancelled by tachyon condensation and computeexactly the profiles and tensions of lower dimensional D-branes.
