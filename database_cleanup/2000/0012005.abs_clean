Title: Path Integral Quantization of Dual Abelian Gauge Theory

Authors: Mark S. Swanson

Comments: LaTeX file, 7 pages

The path integral for 3+1 abelian gauge theory is rewritten in terms of areal antisymmetric field allowing a dual action that couples the electric andmagnetic currents to the photon and each other in a gauge invariant manner.Standard perturbative abelian quantum electrodynamics reemerges when themonopole current vanishes. For certain simple relationships between themonopole current and the electric current, the altered photon propagator canexhibit abelian charge confinement or develop mass, modeling effects believedto be present in non-abelian theories.
