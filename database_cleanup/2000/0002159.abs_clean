The world volume theory on N regular and M fractional D3-branes at theconifold singularity is a non-conformal n=1 supersymmetric SU(N+M) x SU(N)gauge theory. In previous work the Type IIB supergravity dual of this theorybackground with NS-NS and R-R 2-form fields turned on. Far in the UV this dualdescription was shown to reproduce the logarithmic flow of couplings found inthe field theory. In this paper we study the supersymmetric RG flow at allscales. We introduce an ansatz for the 10-d metric and other fields and showthat the equations of motion may be derived in first order form from a simplesuperpotential. This allows us to explicitly solve for the gravity dual of theRG trajectory.
