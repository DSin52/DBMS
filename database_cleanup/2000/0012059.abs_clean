Structures in Mathematics and Physics (September 2000 Kiev, Ukraine); 16pages, 4 figures, minor editsThe superstring/M-theory suggests the Born-Infeld type modification of theclassical gauge field lagrangian. We discuss how this changes topologicalissues related to vacuum periodicity in the SU(2) theory in four spacetimedimensions. A new feature, which is due to the breaking of scale invariance bythe non-Abelian Born-Infeld (NBI) action, is that the potential barrier betweenthe neighboring vacua is lowered to a finite height. At the top of the barrierone finds an infinite family of sphaleron-like solutions mediating transitionsbetween different topological sectors. We review these solutions for twoshow the existence of sphaleron excitations of monopoles in the NBI theory withthe triplet Higgs. Soliton solutions in the constant external Kalb-Ramond fieldare also discussed which correspond to monopoles in the gauge theory onnon-commutative space. A non-perturbative monopole solution for thenon-commutative U(1) theory is presented.
