We obtain the full 5D graviton propagator in the Randall-Sundrum model withthe Gauss-Bonnet interaction. From the decomposition of the graviton propagatoron the brane, we show that localization of gravity arises in the presence ofthe Gauss-Bonnet term. We also obtain the metric perturbation for observers onthe brane with considering the brane bending and compute the amplitude of onemassless graviton exchange. For the positive definite amplitude or no ghoststates, the sign of the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient should be negative in ourconvention, which is compatible with string amplitude computations. In thatcase, the ghost-free condition is sufficient for obtaining the Newtoniangravity. For a vanishing Gauss-Bonnet coefficient, the brane bending allows usto reproduce the correct graviton polarizations for the effective 4D Einsteingravity.
