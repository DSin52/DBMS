`Physical Variables in Gauge Theories'Descriptions of the ground state in unbroken gauge theories with chargedparticles are discussed. In particular it is shown that the on-shell Green'sfunctions and S-matrix elements corresponding to the scattering of thesevariables in QED are free of soft and phase infra red divergences and thatthese variables may be multiplicatively renormalised.
