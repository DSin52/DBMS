We apply a soft version of the BPHZ subtraction scheme to the computation oftwo-loop corrections from an Abelian Chern-Simons field coupled to (massive)scalar matter with a $\lambda(\Phi^\dag\Phi)^2$ and $\nu(\Phi^\dag\Phi)^3$self-interactions. The two-loop renormalization group functions are calculated.We compare our results with those in the literature.
