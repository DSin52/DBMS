Title: On the correspondence between D-branes and stationary supergravity

solutions of type II Calabi-Yau compactificationsAuthors: Frederik Denef

Comments: 27 pages, 10 figures, talk presented at the Workshop on Strings,

Duality and Geometry, CRM Montreal, March 2000In this talk, I review how four dimensional stationary supergravity solutionsthat are more general than spherically symmetric black holes emerge naturallyin the low energy description of BPS states in type II Calabi-Yaucompactifications. An explicit construction of multicenter solutions usingsingle center attractor flows as building blocks is presented, and someinteresting properties of these solutions are examined. We end with a briefremark on non-BPS configurations.
