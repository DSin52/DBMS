Title: Integrable Many-Body Systems and Gauge Theories

Authors: A.Gorsky and A.Mironov

Comments: 134 pages, LaTeX (references added)

The review studies connections between integrable many-body systems and gaugetheories. It is shown how the degrees of freedom in integrable systems arerelated with topological degrees of freedom in gauge theories. The relationsbetween families of integrable systems and N=2 supersymmetric gauge theoriesare described. It is explained that the degrees of freedom in the many-bodysystems can be identified with collective coordinates of D-branes, solitons instring theory.
