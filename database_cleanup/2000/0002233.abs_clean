Taking advantage of the two-parameter central extension of the planar Galileigroup, we construct a non relativistic particle model in the plane. Owing tothe extra structure, the coordinates do not commute. Our model can be viewed asthe non-relativistic counterpart of the relativistic anyon considered before byJackiw and Nair. For a particle moving in a magnetic field perpendicular to theplane, the two parameters combine with the magnetic field to provide aneffective mass. For vanishing effective mass the phase space admits atwo-dimensional reduction, which represents the condensation to collective``Hall'' motions and justifies the rule called ``Peierls substitution''.Quantization yields the wave functions proposed by Laughlin to describe theFractional Quantum Hall Effect.
