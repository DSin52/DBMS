It is shown, that the reduction of the circular quantum oscillator by theand a ``charge - charged magnetic vortex" one, with the spin $\frac 12$.Analogously, the $Z_N$-reduction of the two-dimensional system with the centralpotential $r^{2(N-1)}$ results into $N$ bound ``charge - magnetic vertex"systems with the interaction potential $r^{2(1/N-1)}$ and spins $\sigma=\frackN$, $k =0,1,..., (N-1)$.
