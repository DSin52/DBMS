We discuss $w_\infty$ and $sl_q(2)$ symmetries in Chern-Simons theory andLandau problem on a torus. It is shown that when the coefficient of theChern-Simons term, or when the total flux passing through the torus is arational number, there exist in general two $w_\infty$ and two $sl_q(2)$algebras, instead of one set each discussed in the literature. The generalwavefunctions for the Landau problem with rational total flux is alsopresented.
