The phase structure of $d=3$ Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in curved spacetimewith magnetic field is investigated in the leading order of the $1/N$-expansionand in linear curvature approximation (an external magnetic field is treatedexactly). The possibility of the chiral symmetry breaking under the combinedaction of the external gravitational and magnetic fields is shown explicitly.At some circumstances the chiral symmetry may be restored due to thecompensation of the magnetic field by the gravitational field.
