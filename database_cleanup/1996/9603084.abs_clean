We show that the replacement of the ``instantaneous'' 't Hooft's potentialwith the causal form suggested by equal time canonical quantization inlight-cone gauge, which entails the occurrence of negative probability states,does not change the bound state spectrum when the difference is treated as asingle insertion in the kernel.
