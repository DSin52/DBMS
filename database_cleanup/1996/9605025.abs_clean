We consider 4D quantum gravity with N-dilatons with the most generalcouplings. Especially, on constant dilaton and arbitrary metric background, weshow the structure of the divergent terms. We show the constraint between thecouplings necessary to cancel the coefficient of the square of the Wyle tensor.Next we show the N dependence of a non-renormalizable divergent term, and foundthat it cannot be canceled in the case of $N \geq 1$ with any fine-tuning ofthe couplings.
