We extend the notion of space shifts introduced by L. D. Faddeev and A. Yu.Volkov (Phys. Lett. B 315 (1993)) for certain quantum light cone latticeequations of sine-Gordon type at root of unity. As a result we obtain acompatibility equation for the roots of central elements within the algebra ofobservables (also called current algebra). The equation which is obtained byexponentiating these roots is exactly the evolution equation for the "classicalbackground" as described in V. Bazhanov, A. Bobenko, N. Reshetikhin (Comm.Math. Phys. 175 (1996)).As an application for the introduced constructions, a one to onecorrespondence between a special case of the quantum light cone latticeequations of sine-Gordon type and free massive fermions on a lattice asconstructed in Destri and de Vega (Nucl. Phys. B 290 (1987)) is derived.
