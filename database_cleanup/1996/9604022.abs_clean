A residue formula which evaluates any correlation function of topological$SU_n$ Yang-Mills theory with arbitrary magnetic flux insertion in twodimensions are obtained. Deformations of the system by two form operators areinvestigated in some detail. The method of the diagonalization of a matrixvalued field turns out to be useful to compute various physical quantities. Asan application we find the operator that contracts a handle of a Riemannsurface and a genus recursion relation.
