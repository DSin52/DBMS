Title: Super--Toda Models Associated to Any (super--)Lie Algebras

Comments: 13 pages, LaTex. Talk given at "X Born Symposium" held in Karpacz

(Poland), September 1996. To appear in the ProceedingsIt is shown how to obtain superconformal Toda models as reductions of WZNWtheories based on any Lie or super--Lie algebra.
