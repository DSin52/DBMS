Recently the existence of certain SU(2) BPS monopoles with the symmetries ofthe Platonic solids has been proved. Numerical results in an earlier papersuggest that one of these new monopoles, the tetrahedral 3-monopole, has aremarkable new property, in that the number of zeros of the Higgs field isgreater than the topological charge (number of monopoles). As a consequence,zeros of the Higgs field exist (called anti-zeros) around which the localwinding number has opposite sign to that of the total winding. In this letterwe investigate the presence of anti-zeros for the other Platonic monopoles.Other aspects of anti-zeros are also discussed.
