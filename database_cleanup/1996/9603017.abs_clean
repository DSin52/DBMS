The RST model is augmented by the addition of a scalar field and a boundaryterm so that it is well-posed and local. Expressing the RST action in terms ofthe ADM formulation, the constraint structure can be analysed completely. It isshown that from the view point of local field theories, there exists a hiddendynamical field in the RST model. Thanks to the presence of this hiddendynamical field, we can reconstruct the closed algebra of the constraints whichguarantee the general invariance of the RST action. The resulting stresstensors are recovered to be true tensor quantities. At the quantum level, thecancellation condition for the total central charge is reexamined. Finally,with the help of the hidden dynamical field, the fact that the semi-classicalstatic solution of the RST model has two independent parameters (P,M), whereasfor the classical CGHS model there is only one, can be explained.
