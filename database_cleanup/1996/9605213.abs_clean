It is shown that the non-trivial cocycles on simple Lie algebras may be usedto introduce antisymmetric multibrackets which lead to higher-order Liealgebras, the definition of which is given. Their generalised Jacobi identitiesturn out to be satisfied by the antisymmetric tensors (or higher-order`structure constants') which characterise the Lie algebra cocycles. Thisanalysis allows us to present a classification of the higher-order simple Liealgebras as well as a constructive procedure for them. Our results aresynthesised by the introduction of a single, complete BRST operator associatedwith each simple algebra.
