It is shown that two of the $SL(2,c)$ spinors are invariantunder gauge transformations while the remaining two are not. The Dirac equationcontains only the gauge-invariant spinors leading to polarized neutrinos. It isshown that the gauge-dependent $SL(2,c)$ spinor is the origin of the gaugedependence of electromagnetic four-potentials.
