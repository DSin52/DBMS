The tunneling effect of a periodic potential with an asymmetric twin barrierper period is calculated using the instanton method. The model is derived fromthe Hamiltonian of a small ferromagnetic particle in an external magnetic fieldusing the spin-coherent-state path integral. The instantons in twoneighbouring barriers differ and lead to different level shifts$\triangle\epsilon_1, \triangle\epsilon_2$. We derive with Bloch theory theenergy spectrum which has formally the structure of an energy band. Thespectrum depends on both level shifts. The removal of Kramer's degeneracy by anexternal magnetic field is discussed. In addition we find a new kind ofquenching of macroscopic quantum coherence which is irrelevant to Kramer'sdegeneracy.
