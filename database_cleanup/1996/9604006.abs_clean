The Green--Schwarz superstring action is modified to include some set ofadditional (on-shell trivial) variables. A complete constraints system of thetheory turns out to be reducible both in the original and in additionalvariable sectors. The initial $8s$ first class constraints and $8c$ secondclass ones are shown to be unified with $8c$ first and $8s$ second classconstraints from the additional variables sector, resulting with$SO(1,9)$-covariant and linearly independent constraint sets. Residualreducibility proves to fall on second class constraints only.
