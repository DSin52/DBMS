The path integral for the hydrogen atom, for example, is formulated as aone-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to matter fields representing theelectron coordinates. The (renormalized) cosmological constant, whichcorresponds to the energy eigenvalue, is thus quantized in this model. Possibleimplications of the quantized cosmological constant are briefly discussed.
