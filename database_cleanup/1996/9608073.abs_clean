Recently Olesen has shown the existence of dual string solutionsto the equations of ideal Magnetohydrodynamics that describe the longwavelength properties of electrically charged plasmas. Here, we extend thesesolutions to include the case of plasmas consisting of point like dyons, whichcarry both electric and magnetic charge. Such strings are dyonic in that theyconsist of both magnetic and electric flux. We contrast some physical featuresof dyonic plasmas with those of the purely electric or magnetic type,particularly in relation to the validity of the ideal approximation.
