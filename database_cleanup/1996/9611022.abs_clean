Title: On the BRST approach to the description of a Regge trajectory

Authors: A. Pashnev and M. Tsulaia

Comments: 9 pages LaTeX. The preprint number is added, the words Lagrangian

and angian are replaced by the word lagrangianThe free field theory for Regge trajectory is described in the framework ofthe BRST - quantization method. The physical spectrum includes daugthertrajectories along with parent one. The applicability of the BRST approach tothe description of a single Regge trajectory without its daughter trajectoriesis discussed. The simple example illustrates the appropriately modified BRSTconstruction for the needed second class constraints.
