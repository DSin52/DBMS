We show that the usual dilaton dominance scenario, derived from the treelevel K\"ahler potential, can never correspond to a global minimum of thepotential at $V=0$. Similarly, it cannot correspond to a local minimum either,unless a really big conspiracy of different contributions to the superpotential$W(S)$ takes place. These results, plus the fact that the K\"ahler potential islikely to receive sizeable string non-perturbative contributions, stronglysuggest to consider a more general scenario, leaving the K\"ahler potentialarbitrary. In this way we obtain generalized expressions for the soft breakingterms but a predictive scenario still arises. Finally, we explore thephenomenological capability of some theoretically motivated forms fornon-perturbative K\"ahler potentials, showing that it is easy to stabilize thedilaton at the realistic value $S\sim 2$ with just one condensate and nofine-tuning.
