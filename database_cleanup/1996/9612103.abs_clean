We consider several aspects of `confining strings', recently proposed todescribe the confining phase of gauge field theories.We perform the exact duality transformation that leads to the confining stringaction and show that it reduces to the Polyakov action in the semiclassicalapproximation. In 4D we introduce a `$\theta$-term' and compute the low-energyeffective action for the confining string in a derivative expansion. We findthat the coefficient of the extrinsic curvature (stiffness) is negative,confirming previous proposals. In the absence of a $\theta$-term, the effectivestring action is only a cut-off theory for finite values of the coupling e,whereas for generic values of $\theta$, the action can be renormalized and toleading order we obtain the Nambu-Goto action plus a topological `spin' termthat could stabilize the system.
