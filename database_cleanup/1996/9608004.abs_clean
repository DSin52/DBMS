The quantization of circular strings in an anti-de Sitter backgroundspacetime is performed, obtaining a discrete spectrum for the string mass. Acomparison with a four-dimensional homogeneous and isotropic spacetime coupledto a conformal scalar field shows that the string radius and the scale factorhave the same classical solutions and that the quantum theories of these twomodels are formally equivalent. However, the physically relevant observables ofthese two systems have different spectra, although they are related to eachother by a specific one-to-one transformation. We finally obtain a discretespectrum for the spacetime size of both systems, which presents a nonvanishinglower bound.
