We study mirror symmetry of Calabi-Yau manifolds within the framework of theGauss-Manin system. Applying the flat coordinates to the Gauss-Manin system forthe periods, we derive differential equations for the mirror map in addition tothe ordinary Picard-Fuchs equations for the periods. These equations areobtained for a class of one-parameter models and a two-parameter model ofFermat type Calabi-Yau manifolds.
