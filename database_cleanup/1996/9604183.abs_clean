Title: Grand Unified Theories From Superstrings

Comments: New version containing updated and expanded references, 14 pages,

standard latexI review how traditional grand unified theories, which require adjoint (orhigher representation) Higgs fields for breaking to the standard model, can becontained within string theory. The status (as of January 1996) of the searchfor stringy free fermionic three generation SO(10) SUSY--GUT models isdiscussed. Progress in free fermionic classification of both SO(10)$_2$ chargedand uncharged embeddings and in $N=1$ spacetime solutions is presented. Basedon talks presented at the Workshop on SUSY Phenomena and SUSY GUTs, SantaBarbara, California, Dec. 7-11, 1995, and at the Orbis Scientiae, Coral Gables,Florida, January 25-28, 1996. Appearing in the Proceedings of Orbis Scientiae,1996.
