We investigate the properties of a dressed electron which reduces, in aparticular class of gauges, to the usual fermion. A one loop calculation of thepropagator is presented. We show explicitly that an infra-red finite,multiplicative, mass shell renormalisation is possible for this dressedelectron, or, equivalently, for the usual fermion in the abovementioned gauges.The results are in complete accord with previous conjectures.
