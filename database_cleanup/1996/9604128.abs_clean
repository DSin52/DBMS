Title: On the enumeration of irreducible k-fold Euler sums and their roles in

knot theory and field theoryComments: 34 pages, LaTeX

A generating function is given for the number, $E(l,k)$, of irreducible$k$-fold Euler sums, with all possible alternations of sign, and exponents\sum_{d|k}\mu(d) (1-x^d)^{-k/d}/k$, where $\mu$ is the M\"obius function.Equivalently, the size of the search space in which $k$-fold Euler sums oflevel $l$ are reducible to rational linear combinations of irreducible basisterms is $S(l,k) = \sum_{n<k}{\lfloor(l+n-1)/2\rfloor\choose n}$. Analyticalmethods, using Tony Hearn's REDUCE, achieve this reduction for the 3698convergent double Euler sums with $l\leq44$; numerical methods, using DavidBailey's MPPSLQ, achieve it for the 1457 convergent $k$-fold sums with$l\leq7$; combined methods yield bases for all remaining search spaces with$S(l,k)\leq34$. These findings confirm expectations based on Dirk Kreimer'sconnection of knot theory with quantum field theory. The occurrence inperturbative quantum electrodynamics of all 12 irreducible Euler sums with$l\leq 7$ is demonstrated. It is suggested that no further transcendentaloccurs in the four-loop contributions to the electron's magnetic moment.Irreducible Euler sums are found to occur in explicit analytical results, forcounterterms with up to 13 loops, yielding transcendental knot-numbers, up to23 crossings.
