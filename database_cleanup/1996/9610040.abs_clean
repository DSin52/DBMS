RG96, JINR, Dubna (Russia)We consider relative entropy in Field Theory as a well defined(non-divergent) quantity of interest. We establish a monotonicity property withrespect to the couplings in the theory. As a consequence, the relative entropyin a field theory with a hierarchy of renormalization group fixed points ranksthe fixed points in decreasing order of criticality. We argue from ageneralized $H$ theorem that Wilsonian RG flows induce an increase in entropyand propose the relative entropy as the natural quantity which increases fromone fixed point to another in more than two dimensions.
