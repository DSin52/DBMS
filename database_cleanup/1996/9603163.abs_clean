The general features of the degeneracy structure of ($p=2$)parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics are employed to yield a classificationscheme for the form of the parasupersymmetric Hamiltonians. The method isapplied to parasupersymmetric systems whose Hamiltonian is the square root of aforth order polynomial in the generators of the parasupersymmetry. Thesesystems are interesting to study for they lead to the introduction of a set oftopological invariants very similar to the Witten indices of ordinarysupersymmetric quantum mechanics. The topological invariants associated withparasupersymmetry are shown to be related to a pair of Fredholm operatorssatisfying two compatibility conditions. An explicit algebraic expression forthe topological invariants of a class of parasupersymmetric systems isprovided.
