We analyse approximate solutions to an exact renormalisation group equationwith particular emphasis on their dependence on the regularisation scheme,which is kept arbitrary. Physical quantities related to the coarse-grainedpotential of scalar QED display universal behaviour for strongly first-orderphase transitions. Only subleading corrections depend on the regularisationscheme and are suppressed by a sufficiently large UV scale. We calculate therelevant coarse-graining scale and give a condition for the applicability ofLanger's theory of bubble nucleation.
