Park et al's recent comment (hep-th/9605132) that for detectors with largeenergy gap in comparison with the temperature of the background thermal bath,the maximum excitation rate is obtained for some non-zero detector's velocityis correct but was previously discussed by ourselves elsewhere, and moreoverdoes not affect in our paper above any mathematical formula, numerical result,and consequently our final conclusion that the background thermal bath doesnot contribute substantially in the depolarization of electrons at LEP.
