Title: An Auxiliary 'Differential Measure' for $SU(3)$

Authors: J. S. Prakash

Comments: RevTex 3.0, 30 pages, no figures; Latex error corrected

A 'differential measure' is used to cast our calculus for the group $SU(3)$into a form similar to Schwinger's boson operator calculus for the group$SU(2)$. It is then applied to compute (i) the inner product between the basisstates and (ii) an algebraic formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Thesewere obtained earlier by us using Gaussian integration techniques.
