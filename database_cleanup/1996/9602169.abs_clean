We study the low-energy approximation for calculation of the heat kernelwhich is determined by the strong slowly varying background fields in stronglycurved quasi-homogeneous manifolds. A new covariant algebraic approach, basedon taking into account a finite number of low-order covariant derivatives ofthe background fields and neglecting all covariant derivatives of higherorders, is proposed. It is shown that a set of covariant differential operatorstogether with the background fields and their low-order derivatives generates afinite dimensional Lie algebra. This algebraic structure can be used to presentthe heat semigroup operator in the form of an average over the correspondingLie group. Closed covariant formulas for the heat kernel diagonal are obtained.These formulas serve, in particular, as the generating functions for the wholesequence of the Hadamard-\-Minakshisundaram-\-De~Witt-\-Seeley coefficients inall symmetric spaces.
