Supersymmetric $p$-branes that carry a single electric or magnetic charge andpreserve $1/2$ of the supersymmetry have been interpreted as the constituentsfrom which all supersymmetric $p$-branes can be constructed as bound states,albeit with zero binding energy. Here we extend the discussion tonon-supersymmetric $p$-branes, and argue that they also can be interpreted asbound states of the same basic supersymmetric constituents. In general, thebinding energy is non-zero, and can be either positive or negative depending onthe specific choice of constituents. In particular, we find that the $a=0$Reissner-Nordstr\o{m} black hole in $D=4$ can be built from different sets ofconstituents such that it has zero, positive or negative binding energy.
