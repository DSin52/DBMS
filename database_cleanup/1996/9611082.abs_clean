The macroscopic dynamics of a rotating superfluid deviates from that of asimple perfect fluid due to the effect of vorticity quantisation, which givesrise to a substructure of cosmic string type line defects that results in alocal anisotropy whereby the effective average pressure in the direction of thevortex lines is reduced below its value in lateral directions. Whereas previousdescriptions of this effect have been restricted to a non-relativisticframework that is adequate for the treatment of liquid helium in a laboratorycontext, the present work provides a fully relativistic description of the kindrequired for application to rotating neutron star models. To start with, thegeneral category of vortex fibration models needed for this purpose is set upon the basis of a Kalb-Ramond type variational principle. The appropriatespecification of the particular model to be chosen within this category willultimately be governed by the conclusions of microscopic investigations thathave not yet been completed, but the results available so far suggest that auniquely simple kind of model with an elegant dilatonic formulation should betentatively adopted as a provisional choice so long as there is no indicationthat a more complicated alternative is needed.
