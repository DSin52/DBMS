In this paper we introduce a new class of theories which dynamically breaksupersymmetry based on the gauge group SU(n)xSU(3)xU(1) for even n. Thesetheories are interesting in that no dynamical superpotential is generated inthe absence of perturbations. For the example SU(4)xSU(3)xU(1) we explicitlydemonstrate that all flat directions can be lifted through a renormalizablesuperpotential and that supersymmetry is dynamically broken. We derive theexact superpotential for this theory, which exhibits new and interestingdynamical phenomena. For example, modifications to classical constraints can befield dependent. We also consider the generalization to SU(n)xSU(3)xU(1) models(with even n>4). We present a renormalizable superpotential which lifts allflat directions. Because SU(3) is not confining in the absence ofperturbations, the analysis of supersymmetry breaking is very different inthese theories from the n=4 example. When the SU(n) gauge group confines, theYukawa couplings drive the SU(3) theory into a regime with a dynamicallygenerated superpotential. By considering a simplified version of these theorieswe argue that supersymmetry is probably broken.
