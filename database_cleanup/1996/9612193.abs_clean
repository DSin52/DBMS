The Standard MS renormalization prescription is inadequate for dealing withmulti-scale problems. To illustrate this we consider the computation of theeffective potential in the Higgs-Yukawa model. It is argued that it is naturalto employ a two-scale renormalization group. We give a modified version of atwo-scale scheme introduced by Einhorn and Jones. In such schemes the betafunctions necessarily contain potentially large logarithms of the RG scaleratios. For credible perturbation theory one must implement a large logarithmsresumation on the beta functions themselves. We show how the integrabilitycondition for the two RG equations allows one to perform this resummation.
