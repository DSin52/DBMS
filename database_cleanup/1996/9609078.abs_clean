A class of solutions of the low energy string theory in four dimensions isstudied. This class admits a geodesic, shear-free null congruence which isnon-twisting but in general diverging and the corresponding solutions inEinstein's theory form the Robinson-Trautman family together with a subset ofthe Kundt's class. The Robinson-Trautman conditions are found to be frameinvariant in string theory. The Lorentz Chern-Simons three form of the stringyRobinson-Trautman solutions is shown to be always closed. The stringygeneralizations of the vacuum Robinson-Trautman equation are obtained and threesubclasses of solutions are identified. One of these subclasses exists, amongall the dilatonic theories, only in Einstein's theory and in string theory.Several known solutions including the dilatonic black holes, the pp- waves, thestringy C-metric and certain solutions which correspond to exact conformalfield theories are shown to be particular members of the stringyRobinson-Trautman family. Some new solutions which are static or asymptoticallyflat and radiating are also presented. The radiating solutions have a positiveBondi mass. One of these radiating solutions has the property that it settlesdown smoothly to a black hole state at late retarded times.
