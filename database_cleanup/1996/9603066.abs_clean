We examine the Kac-Schwarz problem of specification of point in Grassmannianin the restricted case of gap-one first-order differential Kac-Schwarzoperators. While the pair of constraints satisfying $[{\cal K}_1,W] = 1$ alwaysleads to Kontsevich type models, in the case of $[{\cal K}_1,W] = W$ thecorresponding KP $\tau$-functions are represented as more sophisticated matrixintegrals.
