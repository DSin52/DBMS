Title: Superstring Dualities, Dirichlet Branes and the Small Scale Structure of

SpaceAuthors: Michael R. Douglas

Comments: To appear in the proceedings of the LXIV Les Houches session on

`Quantum Symmetries', August 1995. latex, 29 ppWe give a broad overview of superstring duality, Dirichlet branes, and someimplications of both for questions about the structure of space-time at shortdistances.
