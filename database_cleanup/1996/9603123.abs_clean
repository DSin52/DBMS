We show how the $T$--duality between $D$--branes is realized (i) on$p$--brane solutions $(p=0,\cdots ,9)$ of IIA/IIB supergravity and (ii) on the$D$--brane actions ($p=0,\cdots ,3)$ that act as source terms for the$p$--brane solutions. We point out that the presence of a cosmological constantin the IIA theory leads, by the requirement of gauge invariance, to atopological mass term for the worldvolume gauge field in the 2--brane case.
