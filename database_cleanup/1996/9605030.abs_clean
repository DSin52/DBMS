Journal-ref: Phys.Rev. D57 (1998) 971-985

A scale--dependent effective action for gravity is introduced and an exactnonperturbative evolution equation is derived which governs its renormalizationgroup flow. It is invariant under general coordinate transformations andsatisfies modified BRS Ward--Identities. The evolution equation is solved for asimple truncation of the space of actions. In 2+epsilon dimensions,nonperturbative corrections to the beta--function of Newton's constant arederived and its dependence on the cosmological constant is investigated. In 4dimensions, Einstein gravity is found to be ``antiscreening'', i.e., Newton'sconstant increases at large distances.
