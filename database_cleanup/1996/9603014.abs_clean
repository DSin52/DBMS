The arguments of statistical nature for the existence of constituents ofactive gravitational masses are presented. The present paper proposes a basisfor microscopic theory of universal gravitation. Questions like the relation ofcosmological constant and quantum theory, black hole radiance and the nature ofinertia are addressed. This paper is the second in the series of paperspublished in Acta Physica Polonica {\bf B}.
