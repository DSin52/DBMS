discussion on new phase transitions in six dimensions. The appearance oftensionless strings in the spectrum leads to new phase transitions in sixdimensions similarly to the appearance of massless particles at specialpoints in the moduli space in four dimensional theoriesJournal-ref: Nucl.Phys.

T-duality is used to extract information on an instanton of zero size in the$E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string. We discuss the possibility of the appearanceof a tensionless anti-self-dual non-critical string through an implementationof the mechanism suggested by Strominger of two coincident 5-branes. It isargued that when an instanton shrinks to zero size a tensionless non-criticalstring appears at the core of the instanton. It is further conjectured thatappearance of tensionless strings in the spectrum leads to new phasetransitions in six dimensions in much the same way as massless particles do infour dimensions.
