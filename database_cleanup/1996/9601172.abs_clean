Title: Vortex Pairs in Charged Fluids

compressed file. Minor correction in formula (4.3). Some spelling mistakescorrectedThe motion of a vortex-(anti)vortex pair is studied numerically in theframework of a dynamical Ginzburg-Landau model, relevant to the description ofa superconductor or of an idealized bosonic plasma. It is shown that up to afine "cyclotron" internal motion, also studied in detail, two vortices broughttogether, rotate around each other, while a vortex and an antivortex move information parallel to each other. The velocities of the vortices in both casesare measured to be in remarkable agreement with recent theoretical predictions,down to intervortex distances as small as their characteristic diameter.
