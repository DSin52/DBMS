Title: Generalized Action Principle and Geometric Approach for superstrings and

super-p-branesComments: 4 pages. LATEX. Talk presented at the Conference on Quantum Field

Theory, Alushta, May 1996. To be published in Proc. of the ConferenceIn this short printed version of my talk I consider the generalized actionfor super-p-branes proposed previously in collaboration with D. Sorokin andDmitrij V. Volkov. I describe briefly, the derivation doubly supersymmetricgeometric approach from the generalized action and discuss one of the directionof its possible application.
