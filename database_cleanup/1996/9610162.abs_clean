We study aspects of Calabi-Yau four-folds as compactification manifolds ofF-theory, using mirror symmetry of toric hypersurfaces. Correlation functionsof the topological field theory are determined directly in terms of a naturalring structure of divisors and the period integrals, and subsequently used toextract invariants of moduli spaces of rational curves subject to certainconditions. We then turn to the discussion of physical properties of thespace-time theories, for a number of examples which are dual to $E_8\times E_8$heterotic N=1 theories. Non-critical strings of various kinds, with low tensionfor special values of the moduli, lead to interesting physical effects. We givea complete classification of those divisors in toric manifolds that contributeto the non-perturbative four-dimensional superpotential; the physicalsingularities associated to it are related to the apppearance of tensionlessstrings. In some cases non-perturbative effects generate an everywhere non-zeroquantum tension leading to a combination of a conventional field theory withlight strings hiding at a low energy scale related to supersymmetry breaking.
