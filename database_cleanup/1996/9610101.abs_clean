We investigate 't Hooft-Mandelstam monopoles in QCD in the presence of asingle classical instanton configuration. The solution to the Maximal Abelianprojection is found to be a circular monopole trajectory with radius $R$centered on the instanton. At zero loop radius, there is a marginally stable(or flat) direction for loop formation to $O(R^4 logR)$. We argue that loopswill form, in the semi-classical limit, due to small perturbations such as thedipole interaction between instanton anti-instanton pairs. As the instanton gasbecomes a liquid, the percolation of the monopole loops may therefore provide asemi-classical precursor to the confinement mechanism.
