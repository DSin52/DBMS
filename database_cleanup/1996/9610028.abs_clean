A review of old inconsistencies of Classical Electrodynamics (CED) and ofsome new ideas that solve them is presented. Problems with causality violatingsolutions of the wave equation and of the electron equation of motion, andproblems with the non-integrable singularity of its self-field energy tensorare well known. The correct interpretation of the two (advanced and retarded)Lienard-Wiechert solutions are in terms of creation and annihilation ofparticles in classical physics. They are both retarded solutions. Previous workon the short distance limit of CED of a spinless point electron are based on adiverging self-energy (the non-integrable singularity of its self-field energytensor) and a causality-violating third order equation of motion (theLorentz-Dirac equation). The correct assumption fixes these problems withoutany change in the Maxwell's equations and let exposed, in the zero-distancediscrete in time. CED cannot have a true equation of motion but only aneffective one, as a consequence of the intrinsic meaning of the Faraday-Maxwellconcept of field that does not correspond to the classical description ofphoton exchange, but only to the smearing of its effects in the space aroundthe charge. This, in varied degrees, is transferred to QED and to other fieldtheories that are based on the same concept of fields as space-smearedinteractions.
