We derive an infinite sequence of Schwinger-Dyson equations for $N=1$supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The fundamental and the only variableorganizes an infinite number of supersymmetrizing insertions into the ordinaryWilson-loop as a single entity. In the large $N_{c}$ limit, our equationbecomes a closed loop equation for the one-point function of the Wilson-loopaverage.
