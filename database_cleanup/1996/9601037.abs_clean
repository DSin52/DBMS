In the context of a recently proposed method for computing exactly stringloop corrections regularized in the infra-red, we determine and calculate theuniversal moduli-dependent part of the threshold corrections to the gaugecouplings for the symmetric $Z_2\times Z_2$ orbifold model. We show that thesecorrections decrease the unification scale of the underlying effective fieldtheory. We also comment on the relation between this infra-red regularizationscheme and other proposed methods.
