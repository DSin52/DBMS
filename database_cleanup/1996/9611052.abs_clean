We consider a configuration of strings and solitons in the type IIBsuperstring theory on $M^5\times T^5$, which is composed of a set ofarbitrarily-wound D-fivebranes on $T^5$ and a set of arbitrarily-woundD-strings on $S^1$ of the torus. For the configuration, it is shown that numberof microscopic states is bounded from above by the exponential of theHawking-Bekenstein entropy of the corresponding black hole and the temperatureof closed string radiation from the D-branes is bounded from below by theHawking temperature of the black hole. After discussing the necessary andsufficient condition to saturate these bounds, we give some speculations aboutblack hole thermodynamics.
