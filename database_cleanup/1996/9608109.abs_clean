The low-energy limit of the 6D non-critical string theory with $N=1$ SUSY and$E_8$ chiral current algebra compactified on $T^2$ is generically an $N=2$$U(1)$ vector multiplet. We study the analog of the Seiberg-Witten solution forthe low-energy effective action as a function of $E_8$ Wilson lines on thecompactified torus and the complex modulus of that torus. The moduli spaceincludes regions where the Seiberg-Witten curves for $SU(2)$ QCD are recoveredas well as regions where the newly discovered 4D theories with enhanced$E_{6,7,8}$ global symmetries appear.
