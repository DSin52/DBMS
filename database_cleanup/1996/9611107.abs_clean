In this letter we show how string winding modes can be constructed usingtopological membranes. We use the fact that monopole-instantons in compacttopologically massive gauge theory lead to charge non-conservation inside themembrane which, in turn, enables us to construct vertex operators withdifferent left and right momenta. The amount of charge non-conservation insidethe membrane is interpreted as giving the momentum associated with the stringwinding mode and is shown to match precisely the full mass spectrum ofcompactified string theory.
