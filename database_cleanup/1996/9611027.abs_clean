We determine the |p|/m expansion of the two body scattering amplitude of thequantum theory of a Chern-Simons field minimally coupled to a scalar field withquartic self-interaction. It is shown that the existence of a critical value ofthe self-interaction parameter for which the 2-particle amplitude reduces tothe Aharonov-Bohm one is restricted to the leading, nonrelativistic, order. Thesubdominant terms correspond to relativistic corrections to the Aharonov-Bohmscattering.
