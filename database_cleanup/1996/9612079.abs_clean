Quantum field theories and Matrix models have a far richer solution set thanis normally considered, due to the many boundary conditions which must be setto specify a solution of the Schwinger-Dyson equations. The complete set ofsolutions of these equations is obtained by generalizing the path integral toinclude sums over various inequivalent contours of integration in the complexplane. We discuss the importance of these exotic solutions. While naively thecomplex contours seem perverse, they are relevant to the study of theta vacuaand critical phenomena. Furthermore, it can be shown that within certain phasesof many theories, the physical vacuum does not correspond to an integrationover a real contour. We discuss the solution set for the special case of onecomponent zero dimensional scalar field theories, and make remarks about matrixmodels and higher dimensional field theories that will be developed in moredetail elsewhere. Even the zero dimensional examples have much structure, andshow some analogues of phenomena which are usually attributed to the effects oftaking a thermodynamic limit.
