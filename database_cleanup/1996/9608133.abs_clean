In two space-time dimensions, we write down the exact and closedSchwinger-Dyson equation for the gauged Thirring model which has been proposedrecently by the author. The gauged Thirring model is a natural gauge-invariantextension of the Thirring model and reduces to the Schwinger model (in theAbelian case) in the strong four-fermion coupling limit. The exact SD equationis derived by making use of the transverse Ward-Takahashi identity as well asthe usual (longitudinal) Ward-Takahashi identity. Moreover the exact solutionof the SD equation for the fermion propagator is obtained together with thevertex function in the Abelian gauged case. Finally we discuss the dynamicalfermion mass generation based on the solution of the SD equation.
