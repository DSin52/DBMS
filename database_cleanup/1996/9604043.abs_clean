Title: Integrability, Duality and Strings

Authors: C. Gomez, R. Hernandez and E. Lopez

Comments: 43 pages, Latex, lecture notes based on a talk of C. Gomez at the

"Quantum Field Theory Workshop", Aug. 1996, BulgaryIn these notes evidence is presented for intepreting the moduli space of theintegrable model associated to $N\!=\!2$ gauge theories with $N\!=\!4$ mattercontent, in terms of Calabi-Yau manifolds. We restrict to the case of gaugegroup $SU(2)$, which is compared with the moduli space of the Calabi-Yaumanifold $WP_{11226}^{12}$ appearing in the rank three dual pair $(K^{3}\timesT^{2} / WP_{11226}^{12})$. The singularity loci of both spaces are maped in aone to one way and, in the weak coupling limit, $N\!=\!2$ $SU(2)$ pureYang-Mills is obtained in both cases by the same type of blow up. Comments onthe interpretation of the strong coupling locus from the perspective of theintegrable system are done.
