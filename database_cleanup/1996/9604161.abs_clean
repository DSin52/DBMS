The two-point functions of the energy-momentum tensor and the Noether currentare used to probe the O(3) nonlinear sigma model in an energy range below10^4 in units of the mass gap $m$. We argue that the form factor approach,with the form factor series trunctated at the 6-particle level, provides analmost exact solution of the model in this energy range. The onset of the(2-loop) perturbative regime is found to occur only at energies around $100m$.
