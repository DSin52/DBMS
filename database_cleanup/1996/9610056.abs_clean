We derive a path integral expression for the transition amplitude in1+1-dimensional QCD starting from canonically quantized QCD. Gauge fixing afterquantization leads to a formulation in terms of gauge invariant but curvilinearvariables. Remainders of the curved space are Jacobians, an effectivepotential, and sign factors just as for the problem of a particle in a box.Based on this result we derive a Faddeev-Popov like expression for thetransition amplitude avoiding standard infinities that are caused byintegrations over gauge equivalent configurations.
