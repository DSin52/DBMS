Noncommutative geometric gauge theory is reconstructed based on thesuperconnection concept. The bosonic action of the Connes-Lott model includingthe symmetry breaking Higgs sector is obtained by using a new generalizedderivative, which consists of the usual 1-form exterior derivative plus anextra element called the matrix derivative, for the curvatures. We first derivethe matrix derivative based on superconnections and then show how the matrixderivative can give rise to spontaneous symmetry breaking. We comment on thecorrespondence between the generalized derivative and the generalized Diracoperator of the Connes-Lott model.
