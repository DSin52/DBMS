Title: Different Aspects of Relativistic Toda Chain

Authors: S. Kharchev, A. Mironov, A. Zhedanov

Comments: LaTeX, 14 pages

We demonstrate that the generalization of the relativistic Toda chain (RTC)is a special reduction of two-dimensional Toda Lattice hierarchy (2DTL). Wealso show that the RTC is gauge equivalent to the discrete AKNS hierarchy andthe unitary matrix model. Relativistic Toda molecule hierarchy is alsoconsidered, along with the forced RTC. The simple approach to the discrete RTChierarchy based on Darboux-B\"acklund transformation is proposed.
