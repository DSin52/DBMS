The properties of a generalized version of the Borel Transform in infraredunstable theories with dynamical mass generation are studied. Thereconstruction of the nonperturbative structure is unambiguous in this version.Various methods for extracting the singularity structure of the Borel Transformfor lattice formulations of such theories are explored, and illustratedexplicitly with the O(N) sigma model. The status of the first infraredrenormalon in QCD is discussed. The feasibility of a proposed technique foranalytically continuing from the left hand Borel plane (where nonperturbativeinformation is available via simulation of lattice field theory) to thepositive real axis is examined using the sigma model.
