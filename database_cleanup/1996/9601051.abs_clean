We present new diagonal solutions of the reflection equation for ellipticsolutions of the star-triangle relation. The models considered are related tothe affine Lie algebras $A_n^{(1)},B_n^{(1)},C_n^{(1)},D_n^{(1)}$ and$A_n^{(2)}$. We recover all known diagonal solutions associated with thesealgebras and find how these solutions are related in the elliptic regime.Furthermore, new solutions of the reflection equation follow for the associatedvertex models in the trigonometric limit.
