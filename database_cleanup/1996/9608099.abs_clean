We discuss the transformation properties of classical extremal N=2 black holesolutions in S-T-U like models under S and T duality. Using invariants of(subgroups of) the triality group, which is the symmetry group of the classicalBPS mass formula, the transformation properties of the moduli on the eventhorizon and of the entropy under these transformations become manifest. We alsocomment on quantum corrections and we make a conjecture for the one-loopcorrected entropy.
