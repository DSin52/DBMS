The multicritical points of the $O(N)$ invariant $N$ vector model in thelarge $N$ limit are reexamined. Of particular interest are the subtletiesinvolved in the stability of the phase structure at critical dimensions. In thelimit $N \to \infty$ while the coupling $g \to g_c$ in a correlated manner (thedouble scaling limit) a massless bound state $O(N)$ singlet is formed andpowers of $1/N$ are compensated by IR singularities. The persistence of the $N\to \infty$ results beyond the leading order is then studied with particularinterest in the possible existence of a phase with propagating small massvector fields and a massless singlet bound state. We point out that undercertain conditions the double scaled theory of the singlet field isnon-interacting in critical dimensions.
