The notion of the optimized perturbation, which has been successfully appliedto energy eigenvalues, is generalized to treat wave functions of quantumsystems. The key ingredient is to construct an envelope of a set ofperturbative wave functions. This leads to a condition similar to that obtainedfrom the principle of minimal sensitivity. Applications of the method toquantum anharmonic oscillator and the double well potential show that uniformlyvalid wave functions with correct asymptotic behavior are obtained in thefirst-order optimized perturbation even for strong couplings.
