We define, in a consistent way, non-local pseudo-differential operatorsacting on a space of analytic functionals. These operators include thefractional derivative case. In this context we show how to solve homogeneousand inhomogeneous equations associated with these operators. We also extend theformalism to d-dimensional space-time solving, in particular, the fractionalWave and Klein-Gordon equations.
