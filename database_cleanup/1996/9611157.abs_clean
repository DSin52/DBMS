Title: Dimensional reduction in supersymmetric field theories

Comments: 11 pages, Latex ,no figures

A class of quantum field theories invariant with respect to the action ofan odd vector field Q on a source supermanifold $\Sigma$ is considered. Wesuppose that Q satisfies the conditions under which an integral of anyQ-invariant function over $\Sigma$ localizes to the zero locus of Q. TheQ-invariant sector of a field theory from the class above is shown then to beequivalent to the quantum field theory defined on zero locus of the vectorfield Q.
