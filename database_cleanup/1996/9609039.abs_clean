Title: Thermofield Dynamics of the Closed Bosonic String - Physical Aspects of

the Thermal Duality -Authors: H. Fujisaki and K. Nakagawa

Comments: 7 pages, Latex, YITP Workshop

The thermofield dynamics of the D=26 closed bosonic thermal string theory isdescribed in proper reference to the thermal duality symmetry as well as thethermal stability of modular invariance in association with the global phasestructure of the bosonic thermal string ensemble.
