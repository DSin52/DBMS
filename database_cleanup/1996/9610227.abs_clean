Flux-string models can be used to study the deconfining phase transition. Inthis note, we study the models proposed by Patel. We also study the large N_climits of Patel's model. To discuss the validity of the mean field theoryresults, the one-loop Coleman-Weinberg effective potential is calculated forN_c=3. We argue that the quantum corrections vanish at large N_c when theenergy of the so-called baryonic vertices scale with N_c.
