We review and summarize recent works on the relation between form factors inintegrable quantum field theory and deformation of geometrical data associatedto hyper-elliptic curves. This relation, which is based on a deformation of theRiemann bilinear identity, in particular leads to the notion of null vectors inintegrable field theory and to a new description of the KdV hierarchy.
