This paper studies the normalizability criterion for the one-loop wavefunction of the universe in a de Sitter background, when various unified gaugemodels are considered. It turns out that, in the absence of interaction betweeninflaton field and other matter fields, the supersymmetric version of suchunified models is preferred. By contrast, the interaction of inflaton andmatter fields, jointly with the request of normalizability at one-loop order,picks out non-supersymmetric versions of unified gauge models.
