Comments: Talk given at the IInd International Sakharov Conference on Physics,

May, 20--24, 1996, Moscow, Russia, 5 pages, LaTeXSystemsOn the base of Lie algebraic and differential geometry methods, a wide classof multidimensional nonlinear integrable systems is obtained, and theintegration scheme for such equations is proposed.
