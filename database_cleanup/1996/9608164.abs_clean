Title: N-Extended Local Supersymmetry of Massless Particles in Spaces of

Constant CurvatureAuthors: S.M. Kuzenko

Comments: 5 pages, LaTeX, sprocl style, Talk given at the 2nd International

Sakharov Conference on Physics, Lebedev Physical Institute, Moscow, May20-24, 1996We review the unified description of massless spinning particles, living inspaces of constant curvature, in the framework of the pseudoclassical approachwith a gauged $N$-extended worldline supersymmetry and a local $O(N)$invariance.
