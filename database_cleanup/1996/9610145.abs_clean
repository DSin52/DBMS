Title: Classical Fields and the Quantum Concept

Comments: Some minor spelling and typesetting corrections

We do a critical review of the Faraday-Maxwell concept of classical field andof its quantization process. With the hindsight knowledge of the essentiallyquantum character of the interactions, we use a naive classical model of field,based on exchange of classical massless particles, for a comparative andqualitative analysis of the physical content of the Coulomb's and Gauss's laws.It enlightens the physical meaning of a field singularity and of a staticfield. One can understand the problems on quantizing a classical field but notthe hope of quantizing the gravitational field right from General Relativity.
