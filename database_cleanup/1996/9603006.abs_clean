Abelian Gauge Theories are quantized in a geometric representation thatgeneralizes the Loop Representation and treates electric and magnetic operatorson the same footing. The usual canonical algebra is turned into a topologicalalgebra of non local operators that resembles the order-disorder dual algebraof 't Hooft. These dual operators provide a complete description of thephysical phase space of the theories.
