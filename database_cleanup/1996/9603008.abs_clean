One-string-loop (torus topology) corrections to black-string backgroundscorresponding to gauged ${SL(2,R)\times R}/R$ WZW model are calculated using$\beta$-function equations derived from string-loop-corrected effective action.Loop-corrected backgrounds are used to calculate ADM mass of the black string.
