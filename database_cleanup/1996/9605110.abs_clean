We compute an analogue of the Itzykson-Zuber integral for the case ofarbitrary complex matrices. The calculation is done for both ordinary andsupermatrices by transferring the Itzykson-Zuber diffusion equation method tothe space of arbitrary complex matrices. The integral is of interest forapplications in Quantum Chromodynamics and the theory of two-dimensionalQuantum Gravity.
