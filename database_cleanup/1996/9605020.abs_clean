Title: On Zhu's Associative Algebra as a Tool in the Representation Theory of

Vertex Operator AlgebrasComments: 60 pages, Latex

We describe an approach to classify (meromorphic) representations of a givenvertex operator algebra by calculating Zhu's algebra explicitly. We demonstratethis for FKS lattice theories and subtheories corresponding to the Z_2reflection twist and the Z_3 twist. Our work is mainly offering a noveluniqueness tool, but, as shown in the Z_3 case, it can also be used to extractenough information to construct new representations. We prove the existence andsome properties of a new non-unitary representation of the Z_3-invariantsubtheory of the (two dimensional) Heisenberg algebra.
