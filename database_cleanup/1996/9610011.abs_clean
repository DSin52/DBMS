The spherical domains $S^d_\beta$ with conical singularities are a convenientarena for studying the properties of tensor Laplacians on arbitrary manifoldswith such a kind of singular points. In this paper the vector Laplacian on$S^d_\beta$ is considered and its spectrum is calculated exactly for anydimension $d$. This enables one to find the Schwinger-DeWitt coefficients ofthis operator by using the residues of the $\zeta$-function. In particular,the second coefficient, defining the conformal anomaly, is explicitlycalculated on $S^d_\beta$ and its generalization to arbitrary manifolds isfound. As an application of this result, the standard renormalization of theone-loop effective action of gauge fields is demonstrated to be sufficient toremove the ultraviolet divergences up to the first order in the conical deficitangle.
