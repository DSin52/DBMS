We consider theories with degenerate kinetic terms such as those that ariseat strong coupling in $N=2$ super Yang-Mills theory. We compute the componentsof generalized $N=1,2$ supersymmetric sigma model actions in two dimensions.The target space coordinates may be matter and/or Yang-Mills superfieldstrengths.
