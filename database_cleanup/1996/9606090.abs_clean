We give generalizations of extended Poincar\'e supergravity with {\itarbitrarily many} supersymmetries in the absence of central charges inthree-dimensions by gauging its intrinsic global $~SO(N)$~ symmetry. We callthese \alephnull (Aleph-Null) supergravity theories. We further couple anon-Abelian supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory and an Abelian topological BFtheory to \alephnull supergravity. Our result overcomes the previous difficultyfor supersymmetrization of Chern-Simons theories beyond $~N=4$. This feature ispeculiar to the Chern-Simons and BF theories including supergravity inthree-dimensions. We also show that dimensional reduction schemes forfour-dimensional theories such as $~N=1$~ self-dual supersymmetric Yang-Millstheory or $~N=1$~ supergravity theory that can generate \alephnull globally andlocally supersymmetric theories in three-dimensions. As an interestingapplication, we present \alephnull supergravity Liouville theory intwo-dimensions after appropriate dimensional reduction from three-dimensions.
