We study compactifications of F-theory on certain Calabi--Yau threefolds. Wefind that $N=2$ dualities of type II/heterotic strings in 4 dimensions getpromoted to $N=1$ dualities between heterotic string and F-theory in 6dimensions. The six dimensional heterotic/heterotic duality becomes a classicalgeometric symmetry of the Calabi--Yau in the F-theory setup. Moreover theF-theory compactification sheds light on the nature of the strong couplingtransition and what lies beyond the transition at finite values of heteroticstring coupling constant.
