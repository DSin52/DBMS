Title: Matrix Models, Open Strings and Quantization of Membranes

Authors: Antal Jevicki (Brown University)

Comments: A talk given at the Argonne Duality Institute, June 27-July 12, 1996,

8 pages, Latex. Replaced version contains corrections of minor typos andadded referencesWe present an approach to membrane quantization using matrix quantummechanics at large N. We show that this leads (through a simple field theory oftwo-dimensional open strings and the associated SU(\infty) current algebra) toa 4-D dynamics of self-dual gravity plus matter.
