We discuss the connection between different entropies introduced for blackhole. It is demonstrated on the two-dimensional example that the (quantum)thermodynamical entropy of a hole coincides (including UV-finite terms) withits statistical-mechanical entropy calculated according to 't Hooft andregularized by Pauli-Villars.
