Comments: 18 pages, harvmac, no figures (Talk delivered at the Workshop on "New

Trends in Quantum Field Theory", 28 August - 1 September 1995, Razlog,Bulgaria)The microscopic theories of quantum gravity related to integrable latticemodels can be constructed as special deformations of pure gravity. Each suchdeformation is defined by a second order differential operator acting on thecoupling constants. As a consequence, the theories with matter fields satisfy aset of constraints inherited from the integrable structure of pure gravity. Inparticular, a set of bilinear functional equations for each theory with matterfields follows from the Hirota equations defining the KP (KdV) structure ofpure gravity.
