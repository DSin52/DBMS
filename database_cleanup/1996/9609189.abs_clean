We present analytical methods for investigating the interaction of two heavyquarks in QCD_3 using the effective action approach. Our findings result inexplicit expressions for the static potentials in QCD_3 for long and shortdistances. With regard to confinement, our conclusion reflects many featuresfound in the more realistic world of QCD_4.
