In this paper we numerically demonstrate that massless two-dimensional QCD isnot integrable. To this aim, we explicitly solve the 't Hooft integral equationfor bound states by an adaptive spline procedure, and compute the decayamplitudes. These amplitudes significantly differ from zero except in all casesin which the decay also produces a pion.
