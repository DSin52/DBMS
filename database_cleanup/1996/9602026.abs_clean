We study the space-time CPT properties of string theories formulated in aflat Minkowski background of even dimension. We define CPT as a world-sheettransformation acting on the vertex operators and we prove the CPT invarianceof the string $S$-matrix elements. Some related issues, including theconnection between spin and statistics of physical string states, are alsoconsidered.
