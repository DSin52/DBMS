Title: Light-Front Quantization of Field Theory

Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil)Comments: 18 pages, Tex, published in ``Lightfront quantization of field

theory'' in ``Topics in Theoretical Physics'', ``Festschrift for Paulo LealFerreira'', eds. V.C. Aguilera-Navarro et. al., pgs. 206-217, IFT-SP, SaoPaulo, Brasil, 1995Some basic topics in Light-Front (LF) quantized field theory are reviewed.Poincar\`e algebra and the LF Spin operator are discussed. The local scalarfield theory of the conventional framework is shown to correspond to anon-local Hamiltonian theory on the LF in view of the constraint equations onthe phase space, which relate the bosonic condensates to the non-zero modes.This new ingredient is useful to describe the spontaneous symmetry breaking onthe LF. The instability of the symmetric phase in two dimensional scalar theorywhen the coupling constant grows is shown in the LF theory renormalized to oneloop order. Chern-Simons gauge theory, regarded to describe excitations withfractional statistics, is quantized in the light-cone gauge and a simple LFHamiltonian obtained which may allow us to construct renormalized theory ofanyons.
