Familiar nonlinear and in particular soliton equations arise as zerocurvature conditions for GL(1,R) connections with noncommutative differentialcalculi. The Burgers equation is formulated in this way and the Cole-Hopftransformation for it attains the interpretation of a transformation of theconnection to a pure gauge in this mathematical framework. The KdV, modifiedKdV equation and the Miura transformation are obtained jointly in a similarsetting and a rather straightforward generalization leads to the KP and amodified KP equation.Furthermore, a differential calculus associated with the Boussinesq equationis derived from the KP calculus.
