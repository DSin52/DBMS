In 4D non-perturbative Regge calculus a positive value of the effectivecosmological constant characterizes the collapsed phase of the system. If alocal term of the form $S'=\sum_{h \epsilon \{h_1,h_2,...\} } \lambda_h V_h$ isadded to the gravitational action, where $\{h_1,h_2,...\}$ is a subset of thehinges and $\{\lambda_h\}$ are positive constants, one expects that the volumes$V_{h_1}$, $V_{h_2}$, ... tend to collapse and that the excitations of thelattice propagating through the hinges $\{h_1,h_2,...\}$ are damped. We studythe continuum analogue of this effect. The additional term $S'$ may representthe coupling of the gravitational field to an external Bose condensate.
