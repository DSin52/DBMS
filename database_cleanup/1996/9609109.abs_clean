Title: Renormalized Path Integral in Quantum Mechanics

Authors: R.J. Henderson and S.G. Rajeev

Comments: 13 pgs, plain TEX file

We obtain direct, finite, descriptions of a renormalized quantum mechanicalsystem with no reference to ultraviolet cutoffs and running coupling constants,in both the Hamiltonian and path integral pictures. The path integraldescription requires a modification to the Wiener measure on continuous pathsthat describes an unusual diffusion process wherein colliding particlesoccasionally stick together for a random interval of time before going theirseparate ways.
