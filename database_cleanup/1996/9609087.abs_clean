We discuss a particular stringy modular cosmology with two axion fields inseven space-time dimensions, decomposable as a time and two flat three-spaces.The effective equations of motion for the problem are those of the $SU(3)$ Todamolecule, and hence are integrable. We write down the solutions, and show thatall of them are singular. They can be thought of as a generalization of thePre-Big-Bang cosmology with excited internal degrees of freedom, and stillsuffering from the graceful exit problem. Some of the solutions however show aspite of winding modes wrapped around them. We also comment how more general,anisotropic, solutions, with fewer Killing symmetries can be obtained with thehelp of STU dualities.
