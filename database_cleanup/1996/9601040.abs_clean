We continue the investigation of massive integrable models by means of thebootstrap fusion procedure, started in our previous work on O(3) nonlinearsigma model. Using the analogy with SU(2) Thirring model and the O(3) nonlinearsigma model we prove a similar relation between sine-Gordon theory and aone-parameter deformation of the O(3) sigma model, the sausage model. Thisallows us to write down a free field representation for theZamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra of the sausage model and to construct an integralrepresentation for the generating functions of form-factors in this theory. Wealso clear up the origin of the singularities in the bootstrap construction andthe reason for the problem with the kinematical poles.
