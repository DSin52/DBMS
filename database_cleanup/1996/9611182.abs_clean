Relying on the geometrical set up of Special K\"ahler Geometry andQuaternionic Geometry, which I discussed at length in my Lectures at the 1995edition of this Spring School, I present here the recently obtained fullygeneral form of N=2 supergravity with completely arbitrary couplings. Thisnotably the partial breaking of supersymmetry and various extremal black--holesolutions. My emphasis, however, is only on providing the reader with acompletely explicit and ready to use component expression of the supergravityaction. All the details of the derivation are omitted but all the definitionsof the items entering the lagrangian and the supersymmetry transformation rulesare given.
