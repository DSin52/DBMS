We consider the wave equation for spinors in ${\cal D}$-dimensional Weylgeometry. By appropriately coupling the Weyl vector $\phi _{\mu}$ as well asthe spin connection $\omega _{\mu a b } $ to the spinor field, conformalinvariance can be maintained. The one loop effective action generated by thecoupling of the spinor field to an external gravitational field is computed intwo dimensions. It is found to be identical to the effective action for thecase of a scalar field propagating in two dimensions.
