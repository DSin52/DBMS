The paper provides a framework for a systematic analysis of the local BRSTcohomology in a large class of gauge theories. The approach is based on thecohomology of s+d in the jet space of fields and antifields, s and d being theBRST operator and exterior derivative respectively. It relates the BRSTcohomology to an underlying gauge covariant algebra and reduces its computationto a compactly formulated problem involving only suitably defined generalizedconnections and tensor fields. The latter are shown to provide the buildingblocks of physically relevant quantities such as gauge invariant actions,Noether currents and gauge anomalies, as well as of the equations of motion.
