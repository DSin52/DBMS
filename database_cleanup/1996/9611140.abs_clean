In this paper we discuss the M-brane description for a N=2 black hole. Thissolution is a result of the compactification of M-5-brane configurations over aCalabi-Yau threefold with arbitrary intersection numbers $C_{ABC}$. In analogyto the D-brane description where one counts open string states we count hereopen 2-branes which end on the M-5-brane.
