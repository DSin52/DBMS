A multidimensional gravitational model on the manifold $M = M_0 \times\prod_{i=1}^{n} M_i$, where M_i are Einstein spaces ($i \geq 1$), is studied.For $N_0 = dim M_0 > 2$ the $\sigma$ model representation is considered and itis shown that the corresponding Euclidean Toda-like system does not satisfy theAdler-van-Moerbeke criterion. For $M_0 = R^{N_0}$, $N_0 = 3, 4, 6$ (and thetotal dimension $D = dim M = 11, 10, 11$, respectively) nonsingular sphericallysymmetric solutions to vacuum Einstein equations are obtained and theirgeneralizations to arbitrary signatures are considered. It is proved that for anon-Euclidean signature the Riemann tensor squared of the solutions diverges oncertain hypersurfaces in $R^{N_0}$.
