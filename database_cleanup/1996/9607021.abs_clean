We show that theories in the confining, free magnetic, and conformal phasescan break supersymmetry through dynamical effects. To illustrate this, wepresent theories based on the gauge groups $SU(n)\times SU(4)\times U(1)$ and$SU(n) \times SU(5) \times U(1)$ with the field content obtained by decomposingan $SU(m)$ theory with an antisymmetric tensor and $m-4$ antifundamentals.
