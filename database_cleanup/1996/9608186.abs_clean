We study some aspects of enhanced gauge symmetries in F-theory compactifiedon K3. We find open string configurations connecting various 7-branes whichrepresent stable BPS states. In this approach we recover $D_n$ and $E_n$ gaugegroups previously found from an analysis of sigularities of the moduli space ofelliptically fibered K3 manifolds as well as examples of non-perturbativerealizations of $A_n$ groups.
