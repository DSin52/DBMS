Massive spinning particle in $6d$-Minkowski space is described as amechanical system with the configuration space $R^{5,1} \times CP^3$.The action functional of the model is unambiguously determined by therequirement of identical (off-shell) conservation for the phase-spacecounterparts of three Casimir operators of Poincar\'e group. The model provesto be completely solvable. Its generalization to the constant curvaturebackground is presented. Canonical quantization of the theory leads to therelativistic wave equations for the irreducible $6d$ fields.
