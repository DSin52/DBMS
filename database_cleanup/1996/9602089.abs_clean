We consider zeta functions and heat-kernel expansions on the bounded,generalized cone in arbitrary dimensions using an improved calculationaltechnique. The specific case of a global monopole is analysed in detail andsome restrictions thereby placed on the $A_{5/2}$ coefficient. The computationof functional determinants is also addressed. General formulas are given andknown results are incidentally, and rapidly, reproduced.
