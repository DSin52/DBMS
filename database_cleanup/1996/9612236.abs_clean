An algebraic method for a general construction of intersecting p-branesolutions in diverse spacetime dimensions is discussed. An incidence matrixdescribing configurations of electric and magnetic fields is introduced.Intersecting p-branes are specified by solutions of a system of characteristicalgebraic equations for the incidence matrix. This set of characteristicequations generalizes a single characteristic equation found before for aspecial "flower" ansatz. The characteristic equations admit solutions only forquantized values of scalar coupling parameters. A wide list of examplesincluding solutions with regular horizons and non-zero entropy in D=11 and D=10theories is presented.
