We study two dimensional freely decaying magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. Weinvestigate the time evolution of the probability law of the gauge field andthe stream function. Assuming that this probability law is initially defined bya statistical field theory in the basin of attraction of a renormalisationgroup fixed point, we show that its time evolution is generated byrenormalisation transformations. In the long time regime, the probability lawis described by non-unitary conformal field theories. In that case, we provethat the kinetic and magnetic energy spectra are proportional. We thenconstruct a family of fixed points using the $(p,p+2)$ non-unitary minimalmodels of conformal field theories.
