ConferenceIt is pointed out that any conformally transformed of a flat space-timemetric $\ball g_{ij} = f(x)\;\eta_{ij}$ is a solution to Witten's equation ofChern-Simons gravity, which holds outside matter in (2+1) dimensions. It isalso shown that a simultaneous exterior solution to both Witten's andEinstein's equations, yields the lensing effect of an isolated cosmic string,if $f(x)$ is reduced to an arbitrary dimensionless constant. However, thesolution to Witten's equation with $f(x)$ being an arbitrary and continuousfunction of space-time coordinates, also leads to an open circular path for alight ray near the string.
