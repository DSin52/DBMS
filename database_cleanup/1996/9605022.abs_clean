A technique for evaluating the electromagnetic Casimir energy in situationsinvolving spherical or circular boundaries is presented. Zeta functionregularization is unambiguously used from the start and the properties ofBessel and related zeta functions are central. Nontrivial results concerningthese functions are given. While part of their application agrees with previousknowledge, new results like the zeta-regularized electromagnetic Casimir energyfor a circular wire are included.
