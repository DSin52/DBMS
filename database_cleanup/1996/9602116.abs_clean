We introduce a gauge group of internal symmetries of an ambient algebra as anew tool for investigating the superselection structure of WZW theories and therepresentation theory of the corresponding affine Lie algebras. The relevantambient algebra arises from the description of these conformal field theoriesin terms of free fermions. As an illustration we analyze in detail the \son\WZW theories at level two. In this case there is actually a homomorphism fromthe representation ring of the gauge group to the WZW fusion ring, even thoughthe level-two observable algebra is smaller than the gauge invariant subalgebraof the field algebra.
