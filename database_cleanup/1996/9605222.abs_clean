In contrast to the familiar (2,2) case, the singularities which arise in the(0,2) setting can be associated with degeneration of the base Calabi-Yaumanifold {\it and/or}\/ with degenerations of the gauge bundle. We study avariety of such singularities and give a procedure for resolving those whichcan be cured perturbatively. Among the novel features which emerge are modelsin which smoothing singularities in the base yields a gauge {\it sheaf}\/ asopposed to a gauge bundle as the structure to which left moving fermionscouple. Supersymmetric $\sigma$-models with target data being an appropriatesheaf on a Calabi-Yau space therefore appear to be the natural arena for N=1string models in four dimensions. We also indicate a variety of singularitieswhich would require a nonperturbative treatment for their resolution andbriefly discuss applications to heterotic models on K3.
