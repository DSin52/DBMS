We discuss the field theory of 3-brane probes in F-theory compactificationsin two configurations, generalizing the work of Sen and of Banks, Douglas andSeiberg. One configuration involves several parallel 3-brane probes in F-theorycompactified on $T^4/Z_2$, while the other involves a compactification ofF-theory on $T^6/Z_2 x Z_2$ (which includes intersecting $D_4$ singularities).In both cases string theory provides simple pictures of the spacetime theory,whose implications for the three-brane world-volume theories are discussed. Inthe second case the field theory on the probe is an unusual N=1superconformal theory, with exact electric-magnetic duality. Several openquestions remain concerning the description of this theory.
