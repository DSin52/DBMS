Based on our earlier work on free field realizations of conformal blocks forconformal field theories with $SL(2)$ current algebra and with fractional leveland spins, we discuss in some detail the fusion rules which arise. By a carefulanalysis of the 4-point functions, we find that both the fusion rulespreviously found in the literature are realized in our formulation. Since thisis somewhat contrary to our expectations in our first work based on 3-pointfunctions, we reanalyse the 3-point functions and come to the same conclusion.We compare our results on 4-point conformal blocks in particular with adifferent realization of these found by O. Andreev, and we argue for theequivalence. We describe in detail how integration contours have to be chosento obtain convenient bases for conformal blocks, both in his and in our ownformulation. We then carry out the rather lengthy calculation to obtain thecrossing matrix between s- and t-channel blocks, and we use that to determinethe monodromy invariant 4-point greens functions. We use the monodromycoefficients to obtain the operator algebra coefficients for theories based onadmissible representations.
