The main definitions and properties of Lie superalgebras are proposed a lafacon de a short dictionary, the different items following the alphabeticalorder. The main topics deal with the structure of simple Lie superalgebras andtheir finite dimensional representations; rather naturally, a few pages areelementary and easy to use. The beginner is supposed to find out here the mainconcepts on superalgebras, while a more experimented theorist should recognizethe necessary tools and informations for a specific use.
