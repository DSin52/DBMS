Title: A Supermembrane Description of String-String Duality

Comments: Latex

Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B404 (1997) 271-275

We show that the open membrane action on $T^3\times S^1/Z^2$ is equivalent tothe closed membrane action on K3. The main difference between the two actionsis that one generates the KK modes in the worldvolume action which is thestrong coupling limit of \IIA\ while the other action generates the KK modes ina worldsheet action. Thus explaining membrane-string duality in D=7, whichnaturally leads to string-string duality in D=6.
