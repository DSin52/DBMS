149-161The structure of the reduced phase space arising in the Hamiltonian reductionof the phase space corresponding to a free particle motion on the group ${\rmSL}(2, {\Bbb R})$ is investigated. The considered reduction is based on theconstraints similar to those used in the Hamiltonian reduction of theWess--Zumino--Novikov--Witten model to Toda systems. It is shown that thereduced phase space is diffeomorphic either to the union of twotwo--dimensional planes, or to the cylinder $S^1 \times {\Bbb R}$. Canonicalcoordinates are constructed for the both cases, and it is shown that in thefirst case the reduced phase space is symplectomorphic to the union of twocotangent bundles $T^*({\Bbb R})$ endowed with the canonical symplecticstructure, while in the second case it is symplectomorphic to the cotangentbundle $T^*(S^1)$ also endowed with the canonical symplectic structure.
