Last week, A. Sen found an explicit type I string compactification dual tothe eight-dimensional F-theory construction with SO(8)^4 nonabelian gaugesymmetry. He found that the perturbations around the enhanced symmetry pointwere described by the mathematics of the solution of N=2, d=4 SU(2) gaugetheory with four flavors, and argued more generally that global symmetryenhancement in CN=2, d=4 gauge theories corresponded to gauge symmetryenhancement in F-theory. We show that these N=2, d=4 gauge theories have aphysical interpretation in the theory. They are the world-volume theories of3-branes parallel to the 7-branes. They can be used to probe the structure ofthe exact quantum F-theory solutions. On the Higgs branch of the moduli space,the objects are equivalent to finite size instantons in the 7-brane gaugetheory.
