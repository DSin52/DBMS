We consider quantum corrections to classical real time correlation functionsat finite temperature. We derive a semi-classical expansion in powers of$\hbar$ with coefficients including all orders in the coupling constant. Wegive explicit expressions up to order $\hbar^2$. We restrict ourselves to ascalar theory. This method, if extended to gauge theories, might be used tocompute quantum corrections to the high temperature baryon number violationrate in the Standard Model.
