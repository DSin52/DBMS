"XXI. Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics" in Goslar, July1996As an application of the renormalization method introduced by the secondauthor we give a causal definition of the phase of the quantum scatteringmatrix for fermions in external Yang-Mills potentials. The phase is definedusing parallel transport along the path of renormalized time evolutionoperators. The time evolution operators are elements of the restricted unitarygroup $U_{res}$ of Pressley and Segal. The central extension of $U_{res}$ playsa central role.
