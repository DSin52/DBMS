We study classical and quantum aspects of D=4, N=2 BPS black holes for T_2compactification of D=6, N=1 heterotic string vacua. We extend dynamicalrelaxation phenomena of moduli fields to background consisting of a BPS solitonor a black hole and provide a simpler but more general derivation of theFerrara-Kallosh's extremized black hole mass and entropy. We study quantumeffects to the BPS black hole mass spectra and to their dynamical relaxation.We show that, despite non-renormalizability of string effective supergravity,quantum effect modifies BPS mass spectra only through coupling constant andmoduli field renormalizations. Based on target-space duality, we establish aperturbative non-renormalization theorem and obatin exact BPS black hole massand entropy in terms of renormalized string loop-counting parameter andrenormalized moduli fields. We show that similar conclusion holds, in the largeT_2 limit, for leading non- perturbative correction. We finally discussimplications to type-I and type-IIA Calabi -Yau black holes.
