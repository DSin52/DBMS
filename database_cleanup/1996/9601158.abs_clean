school and workshops on elementary particle physics, Corfu, 3-24 September1995We investigate field theory puzzles occuring in the interplay betweensupersymmetry and duality in the presense of rotational isometries (also knownas non-triholomorphic in hyper-Kahler geometry). We show that T-duality isalways compatible with supersymmetry, provided that non-local world-sheeteffects are properly taken into account. The underlying superconformal algebraremains the same, and T-duality simply relates local with non-localrealizations of it. The non-local realizations have a natural description usingparafermion variables of the corresponding conformal field theory. We alsocomment on the relevance of these ideas to a possible resolution of longstanding problems in the quantum theory of black holes.
