We discuss the dependence of superpotential terms in 4D F-theory on modulipositions and the dependence on 2-form VEVs. In the first case there is a zerowhen the 3-brane hits the divisor responsible for the superpotential. In thesecond case, which has been extensively discussed by Witten in 3D M-theory,there is a zero for special values of 2-form VEVs when the M-theory divisorcontains non-trivial 3-cycles. We give an alternative derivation of this factfor the special case of F-theory.
