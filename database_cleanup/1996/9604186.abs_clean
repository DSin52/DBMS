We define the $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ harmonic superspace analogs of tensor andnonlinear $(4,4)$, $2D$ supermultiplets. They are described by constrainedanalytic superfields and provide an off-shell formulation of a class oftorsionful $(4,4)$ supersymmetric sigma models with abelian translationalisometries on the bosonic target. We examine their relation to $(4,4)$ twistedmultiplets and discuss different types of $(4,4)$ dualities associated withthem. One of these dualities implies the standard abelian $T$-duality relationsbetween the bosonic targets in the initial and dual sigma model actions. Weshow that $N=4$, $2D$ superconformal group admits a simple realization on thesuperfields introduced, and present a new superfield form of the $(4,4)$$SU(2)\times U(1)$ WZNW action.
