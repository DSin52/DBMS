The local SUSY symmetry of the loop dynamics of QCD is found. The remarkablething is, there is no einbein-gravitino on this theory, which makes it a 1Dtopological supergravity, or locally SUSY quantum mechanics. Using thissymmetry, we derive the large $N_c$ loop equation in momentum superloop space.Introducing as before the position operator $\X{\mu}$ we argue that thesuperloop equation is equivalent to invariance of correlation functions ofproducts of these operators with respect to certain quadrilineartransformation. The applications to meson and glueball sectors as well as thechiral symmetry breaking are discussed. The 1D field theory with Quarkpropagating around the loop in superspace is constructed.
