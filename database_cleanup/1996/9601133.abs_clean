The effective Lagrangian of QED coupled to dyons is calculated. The resultinggeneralization of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian contains non-linear $P$- and$T$-nonivariant (but $C$ invariant) terms corresponding to the virtual paircreation of dyons. As examples, the amplitudes for photon splitting and photoncoalescence are calculated.
