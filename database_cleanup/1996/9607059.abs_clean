Models that provide experimentally testable violations of ordinary QuantumMechanics have been recently proposed. These models are based on non-unitarytime evolutions of density matrices that are generated by linear positive maps.We discuss the consequences of imposing a stronger condition on those maps,known as complete positivity. It turns out that experimental data on theneutral kaon system giving upper bounds to the parameters characterizingpositive maps, also give bounds to those determining completely positive ones.
