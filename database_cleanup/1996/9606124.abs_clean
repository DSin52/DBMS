Title: The string solution in SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs theory

Authors: Vladimir Dzhunushaliev and Alexej Fomin

Comments: LATEX, Fig. on the request, p.5

The tube solutions in Yang - Mills - Higgs theory are received, in which theHiggs field has the negative energy density. This solutions make up thediscrete spectrum numered by two integer and have the finite linear energydensity. Ignoring its transverse size, such field configuration is the restinfinity straight string.
