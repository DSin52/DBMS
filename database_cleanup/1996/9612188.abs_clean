We study supersymmetric compactifications of type II strings on eightfolds totwo dimensions. It is demonstrated that the type IIB string on an eightfold isfree of gravitational anomalies. T-duality requires that this theory whenfurther compactified on a circle must have a vacuum momentum; this isexplicitly shown to be present and to have the right value. A subtlety in therelation of IIB compactifications and M-Theory orientifolds to two dimensionsis pointed out.
