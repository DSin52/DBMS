We compute vacuum expectation values of products of fermion bilinears fortwo-dimensional Quantum Chromodynamics at finite flavored fermion densities. Weintroduce the chemical potential as an external charge distribution within thepath-integral approach and carefully analyse the contribution of differenttopological sectors to fermion correlators. We show the existence of chiralcondensates exhibiting an oscillatory inhomogeneous behavior as a function of achemical potential matrix. This result is exact and goes in the same directionas the behavior found in QCD_4 within the large N approximation.
