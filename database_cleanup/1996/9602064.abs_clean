D-brane actions depend on a world-volume abelian vector field and aredescribed by Born-Infeld-type actions. We consider the vector field dualitytransformations of these actions. Like the usual 2d scalar duality rotations ofisometric string coordinates imply target space T-duality, this vector dualityis intimately connected with SL(2,Z)-symmetry of type IIB superstring theory.We find that in parallel with generalised 4-dimensional Born-Infeld action, theaction of 3-brane of type IIB theory is SL(2,Z) self-dual. This indicates that3-brane should play a special role in type IIB theory and also suggests apossibility of its 12-dimensional reformulation.
