We show that a class of extremal four-dimensional supersymmetric``high-branes'', i.e. string and domain wall solutions, can be interpreted asintersections of four ten-dimensional Dirichlet branes. These $d=4$ solutionsare related, via $T$-duality in ten dimensions, to the four-dimensionalextremal Maxwell/scalar black holes that are characterized by a scalarcoupling parameter $a$ with $a=0,1/\sqrt{3}, 1, \sqrt{3}$.
