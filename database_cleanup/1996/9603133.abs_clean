Recent developments in string duality suggest that the string scale may notbe irrevocably tied to the Planck scale. Two explicit but unrealistic examplesare described where the ratio of the string scale to the Planck scale isarbitrarily small. Solutions which are more realistic may exist in theintermediate coupling or ``truly strong coupling'' region of the heteroticstring. Weak scale superstrings have dramatic experimental consequences forboth collider physics and cosmology.
