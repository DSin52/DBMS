A new action of the Yangians in the WZW models is displayed. Its structure isgeneric and level independent. This Yangian is the natural extension at theconformal point of the one unravelled in massive theories with currentalgebras. Expectingly, this new symmetry of WZW models will lead to a deeperunderstanding of the integrable structure of conformal field theories and theirdeformations.
