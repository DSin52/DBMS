We show that the two sets of self-dual Yang-Mills equations in 8-dimensionsproposed in (E.Corrigan, C.Devchand, D.B.Fairlie and J.Nuyts, {\it NuclearPhysics} {\bf B214}, 452-464, (1983)) form respectively elliptic andoverdetermined elliptic systems under the Coulomb gauge condition. In theoverdetermined case, the Yang-Mills fields can depend at most on $N$ arbitraryconstants, where $N$ is the dimension of the gauge group. We describe asubvariety ${\cal P}_8 $ of the skew-symmetric $8\times 8$ matrices by aneigenvalue criterion and we show that the solutions of the elliptic equationsof Corrigan et al. are among the maximal linear submanifolds of ${\cal P}_8$.We propose an eight order action for which the elliptic set is a maximum.
