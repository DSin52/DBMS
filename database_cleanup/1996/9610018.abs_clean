The supermembrane theory on $R^{10}x S^1$ is investigated, for membranes thatwrap once around the compact dimension. The Hamiltonian can be organized asdescribing $N_s$ interacting strings, the exact supermembrane corresponding to$N_s\to \infty$. The zero-mode part of $N_s-1$ strings turn out to beprecisely the modes which are responsible of instabilities. For sufficientlylarge compactification radius $R_0$, interactions are negligible and thelowest-energy excitations are described by a set of harmonic oscillators. Wecompute the physical spectrum to leading order, which becomes exact in thelimit $ g^2 \to \infty $, where $g^2\equiv 4\pi^2 T_3 R_0^3$ and $T_3$ is themembrane tension. As the radius is decreased, more strings become stronglyinteracting and their oscillation modes get frozen. In the zero-radius limit,the spectrum is constituted of the type IIA superstring spectrum, plus aninfinite number of extra states associated with flat directions of the quarticpotential.
