We describe a few properties of the non semi-simple associative algebra H =M_3 + (M_{2|1}(Lambda2))_0, where Lambda2 is the Grassmann algebra with twogenerators. We show that H is not only a finite dimensional algebra but also a(non co-commutative) Hopf algebra, hence a finite dimensional quantum group. Byselecting a system of explicit generators, we show how it is related with thequantum enveloping algebra of SLq(2) when the parameter q is a cubic root ofunity. We describe its indecomposable projective representations as well as theirreducible ones. We also comment about the relation between this object andthe theory of modular representations of the group SL(2,F3), i.e. the binarytetrahedral group. Finally, we briefly discuss its relation with the Lorentzgroup and, as already suggested by A.Connes, make a few comments about thepossible use of this algebra in a modification of the Standard Model ofparticle physics (the unitary group of the semi-simple algebra associated withH is U(3) x U(2) x U(1)).
