Title: New Approach to Induced QCD

Authors: Andrei Shuvaev

Comments: 15 pages, LaTex, no figures

Matrix model approach to multicolor induced QCD based on the quenchedmomentum prescription is presented. It is shown that this model exhibits theby the solution of one dimensional quantum mechanical problem while theD-dimensional scalar field correlators coinside with the same type correlatorsin the two-dimensional induced QCD.
