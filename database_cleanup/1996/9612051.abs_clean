We perform the classical gravity calculations of the fixed scalar absorptioncross-sections by D=5 black holes with three charges and by D=4 black holeswith four charges. We obtain analytic results for the cases where the energyand the left and right moving temperatures are sufficiently low but havearbitrary ratios. In D=5 the greybody factor is in perfect agreement with therecent calculation performed in the context of the effective string model forblack holes. In D=4 the formula for the greybody factor in terms of theenergy and the temperatures differs from that in D=5 only by the overallnormalization. This suggests that the fixed scalar coupling to the effectivestring in D=4 is identical to that in D=5.
