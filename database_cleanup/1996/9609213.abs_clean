Title: On the Casimir of the group ISL(n,R) and its algebraic decomposition

In this article a formula for the Casimir of ISL(n,R) is given. Thisalgebraic expression is useful in the classification of particles in a theorybased on ISL(n,R). It is also proven that the Casimir of ISL(n,R) can bedecomposed in terms of the Casimir of its little groups, a key point in theposterior construction of its irreducible representations.
