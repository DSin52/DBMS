We discuss the evaluation of observables in two-dimensional conformal fieldtheory using the topological membrane description. We show that the spectrum ofanomalous dimensions can be obtained perturbatively from the topologicallymassive quantum field theories by computing radiative corrections toAharonov-Bohm scattering amplitudes for dynamical charged matter fields. Theone-loop corrections in the case of topologically massive Yang-Mills theory areshown to coincide with the scaling dimensions of the induced ordinary andsupersymmetric WZNW models. We examine the effects of the dressing of atopologically massive gauge theory by topologically massive gravity and showthat the one-loop contributions to the Aharonov-Bohm amplitudes coincide withthe leading orders of the KPZ scaling relations for two-dimensional quantumgravity. Some general features of the description of conformal field theoriesvia perturbative techniques in the three-dimensional approach are alsodiscussed.
