The Casimir energy corresponding to a massive scalar field with Dirichletboundary conditions on a spherical bag is obtained. The field is considered,separately, inside and outside the bag. The renormalization procedure that isnecessary to apply in each situation is studied in detail, in particular thedifferences occurring with respect to the case when the field occupies thewhole space. The final result contains several constants that experiencerenormalization and can be determined only experimentally. The non-trivialfinite parts that appear in the massive case are found exactly, providing aprecise determination of the complete, renormalized zero-point energy for thefirst time.
