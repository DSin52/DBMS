Superstring field theory was recently used to derive a four-dimensionalMaxwell action with manifest duality. This action is related to theMcClain-Wu-Yu Hamiltonian and can be locally coupled to electric and magneticsources.In this letter, the manifestly dual Maxwell action is supersymmetrized usingN=1 and N=2 superspace. The N=2 version may be useful for studyingSeiberg-Witten duality.
