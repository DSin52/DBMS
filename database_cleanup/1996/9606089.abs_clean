Title: Exact Computations in the Burgers Problem

Comments: 7 pages, LATEX, the interpretations of the results is completely

changed in the replaced versionWe complete the program outlined in the paper of the author with A. Migdaland sum up exactly all the fluctuations around the instanton solution of therandomly large scale driven Burgers equation. We choose the force correlationfunction $\kappa$ to be exactly quadratic function of the coordinatedifference. The resulting probability distribution satisfy the differentialequation proposed by Polyakov without an anomaly term. The result shows thatunless the anomaly term is indeed absent it must come from other possibleinstanton solutions, and not from the fluctuations.
