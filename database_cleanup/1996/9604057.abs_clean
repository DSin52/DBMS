Title: Integrability, Jacobians and Calabi-Yau Threefolds

Authors: C. Gomez, R. Hernandez and E. Lopez

Comments: 8 pages, Latex, based on a talk given by C. Gomez at the "VIII

Regional Meeting on Mathematical Physics", Oct. 1995, IranThe integrable systems associated with Seiberg-Witten geometry are consideredboth from the Hitchin-Donagi-Witten gauge model and in terms of intermediateJacobians of Calabi-Yau threefolds. Dual pairs and enhancement of gaugesymmetries are discussed on the basis of a map from the Donagi-Witten``moduli'' into the moduli of complex structures of the Calabi-Yau threefold.
