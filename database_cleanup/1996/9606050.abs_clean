We analyse the fusion of representations of the triplet algebra, themaximally extended symmetry algebra of the Virasoro algebra at c=-2. It isshown that there exists a finite number of representations which are closedunder fusion. These include all irreducible representations, but also somereducible representations which appear as indecomposable components in fusionproducts.
