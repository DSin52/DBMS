We derive the low energy effective action of the heterotic superstring insuperspace. This is achieved by coupling the covariantly quantizedGreen-Schwarz superstring of Berkovits to a curved background and requiringthat the sigma model has superconformal invariance at tree level and at oneloop in $\a'$. Tree level superconformal invariance yields the completesupergravity algebra, and one-loop superconformal invariance the equations ofmotion of the low energy theory. The resulting low energy theory is old-minimalsupergravity coupled to a tensor multiplet. The dilaton is part of thecompensator multiplet.
