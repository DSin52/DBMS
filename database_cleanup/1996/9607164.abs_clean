We examine $(D-2)$-brane solutions in supergravities, showing that they fallinto four categories depending on the details of the dilaton coupling. Ingeneral they describe domain walls, although in one of the four categories themetric describes anti-de Sitter spacetime. We study this case, and its $S^1$dimensional reduction to a more conventional domain wall in detail, focussingin particular on the manner in which the unbroken supersymmetry of the anti-deSitter solution is partially broken by the dimensional reduction to the domainwall.
