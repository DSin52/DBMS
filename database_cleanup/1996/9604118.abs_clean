We apply the method of conical singularities to calculate the tree-levelentropy and its one-loop quantum corrections for a charged Kerr black hole. TheEuclidean geometry for the Kerr-Newman metric is considered. We show that foran arbitrary periodization in Euclidean space there exists a conicalsingularity at the horizon. Its $\delta$-function like curvatures arecalculated and are shown to behave similar to the static case. The heat kernelexpansion for a scalar field on this conical space background is derived andthe (divergent) quantum correction to the entropy is obtained. It is arguedthat these divergences can be removed by renormalization of couplings in thetree-level gravitational action in a manner similar to that for a static blackhole.
