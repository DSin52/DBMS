We study supersymmetric Sp(2N) gauge theories with matter in theantisymmetric tensor representation and F fundamentals. For F=6 we solve thetheory exactly in terms of confined degrees of freedom and a superpotential. Byadding mass terms we obtain the theories with F<6 which we find to exhibit awith N constraints, instanton-induced superpotentials and non-equivalentdisjoint branches of moduli spaces. We find a simple dual for F=8 and nosuperpotential. We show how the F=4 and F=2 theories can be modified to breaksupersymmetry spontaneously and point out that the Sp(6) theory with F=6 may bevery interesting for model builders.
