We construct a four-dimensional BPS saturated heterotic string solution fromthe Taub-NUT solution. It is a non-extremal black hole solution since its Eulernumber is non-zero. We evaluate its black hole entropy semiclassically. Wediscuss the relation between the black hole entropy and the degeneracy ofstring states. The entropy of our string solution can be understood as themicroscopic entropy which counts the elementary string states without anycomplications.
