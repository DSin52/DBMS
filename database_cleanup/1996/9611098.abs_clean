Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B394 (1997) 170-178

We study the relationship between the continuum overlap and its correspondingchiral determinant, showing that the former amounts to an unregularised versionof the latter. We then construct a regularised continuum overlap, and considerthe chiral anomalies that follow therefrom. The relation between theseanomalies and the ones derived from the formal (i.e., unregularised) overlap iselucidated.
