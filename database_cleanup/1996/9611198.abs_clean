Based on the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equation, the fermion mass generation isfurther studied in the D(2<D<4)-dimensional Thirring model as a gauge theorypreviously proposed. By using a certain approximation to the kernel, weanalytically obtained explicit form of the dynamical mass of fermion and thecritical line in (N,1/g) space, where N is the number of fermions and g is thedimensionless vector-type four-fermion coupling constant. This analyticalresult is confirmed by the numerical solution for the SD equation with exactform of the kernel in (2+1) dimensions.
