Title: The Preferred Frame and Poincare Symmetry

Comments: LaTeX file, 7 pp., no figures

In this paper we describe a covariant canonical formalism for a freetime-like (massive) as well as space-like (tachyonic) particle in the frameworkof nonstandard synchronization scheme. In this scheme one is able to introduceabsolute causality without breaking the Poincar\'e invariance.
