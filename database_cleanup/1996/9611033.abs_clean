We present a new integrable extension of the a=-2, N=2 SKdV hierarchy, withthe "small" N=4 superconformal algebra (SCA) as the second hamiltonianstructure. As distinct from the previously known N=4 supersymmetric KdVhierarchy associated with the same N=4 SCA, the new system respects only N=2rigid supersymmetry. We give for it both matrix and scalar Lax formulations andconsider its various integrable reductions which complete the list of knownSKdV systems with the N=2 SCA as the second hamiltonian structure. We constructa generalized Miura transformation which relates our system to the $\alpha =the N=2 W_3 superalgebra.
