General static solutions of effectively 2-dimensionalEinstein-Dilaton-Maxwell-Scalar theories are obtained. Our model actionincludes a class of 2-d dilaton gravity theories coupled with a $U(1)$ gaugefield and a massless scalar field. Therefore it also describes the sphericallysymmetric reduction of $d$-dimensional Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell theories. Theproperties of the analytic solutions are briefly discussed.
