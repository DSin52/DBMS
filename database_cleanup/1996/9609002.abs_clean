It is shown that fractional $Z_3$-superspace is isomorphic to the$q\to\exp(2\pi i/3)$ limit of the braided line. $Z_3$-supersymmetry isidentified as translational invariance along this line. The fractionaltranslation generator and its associated covariant derivative emerge as the$q\to\exp(2\pi i/3)$ limits of the left and right derivatives from the calculuson the braided line
