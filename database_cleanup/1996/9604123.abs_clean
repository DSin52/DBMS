Title: A New Description of the Superstring

Comments: Corrected coefficients in eqs. (3.22),(3.23),(4.15)

This is a review of the new manifestly spacetime-supersymmetric descriptionof the superstring. The new description contains N=2 worldsheet supersymmetry,and is related by a field redefinition to the standard RNS description. It isespecially convenient for four-dimensional compactifications since SO(3,1)super-Poincar\'e invariance can be made manifest. Parts of this work have beendone in collaboration with Warren Siegel and Cumrun Vafa.This review is based on lectures given at the VIII J.A. Swieca summer schooland should be easily accesible to anyone familiar with the RNS superstringdescription.
