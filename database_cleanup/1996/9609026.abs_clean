Black holes do not Hawking radiate strictly blackbody radiation due towell-known frequency-dependent greybody factors. These factors arise fromfrequency-dependent potential barriers outside the horizon which filter theinitially blackbody spectrum emanating from the horizon. D-brane bound states,in a thermally excited state corresponding to near-extremal black holes, alsoenergy spectrum of its excitations. We study a near-extremal five-dimensionalblack hole. We show that, in a wide variety of circumstances including bothneutral and charged emission, the effect of the greybody filter is to transformthe blackbody radiation spectrum precisely into the bound state radiationspectrum. Implications of this result for the information puzzle in the contextof near-extremal black hole dynamics are discussed.
