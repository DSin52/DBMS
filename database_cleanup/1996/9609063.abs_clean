Comments: 7 pages, LaTex

Journal-ref: Mod.Phys.Lett. A11 (1996) 1861-1868

The ultraviolet structure of the Calogero-Sutherland models is examined, and,in particular, semions result to have special properties. An analogy withultraviolet structures known in anyon quantum mechanics is drawn, and it isused to suggest possible physical consequences of the observed semionicproperties.
