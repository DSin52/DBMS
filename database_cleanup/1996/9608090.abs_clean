In these lectures we discuss various aspects of gauge theories with extended$N=2$ and $N=4$ supersymmetry that are at the basis of recently found exactresults. These results include the exact calculation of the low energyeffective action for the light degrees of freedom in the $N=2$ super Yang-Millstheory and the conjecture, supported by some checks, that the $N=4$ superYang-Mills theory is dual in the sense of Montonen-Olive.
