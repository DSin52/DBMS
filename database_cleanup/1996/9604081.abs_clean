Unconventional way of handling the perturbative series is presented with thehelp of Heaviside transformation with respect to the mass. We apply Heavisidetransform to the effective potential in the massive Gross-Neveu model and carryout perturbative approximation of the massless potential by dealing with theresulting Heaviside function. We find that accurate values of the dynamicalmass can be obtained from the Heaviside function already at finite orders wherejust the several of diagrams are incorporated. We prove that our approximantsconverges to the exact massless potential in the infinite order. Small massexpansion of the effective potential can be also obtained in our approach.
