We construct multi-center solutions for charged, dilatonic, non-extremalblack holes in $D=4$. When an infinite array of such non-extremal black holesare aligned periodically along an axis, the configuration becomes independentof this coordinate, which can therefore be used for Kaluza-Kleincompactification. This generalises the vertical dimensional reduction procedureto include {\it non-extremal} black holes. We then extend the construction tomulti-center non-extremal $(D-4)$-branes in $D$ dimensions, and discuss theirvertical dimensional reduction.
