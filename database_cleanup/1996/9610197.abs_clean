presented to the Graduiertenkolleg Erlangen-RegensburgThese lecture notes want to illustrate the close connection betweenstatistical mechanics and field theory not only on the formal level, i.e. thatmany concepts of one area can easily be taken over to the other one, but alsoon the level of actual calculations. To this purpose, the last section willdemonstrate that a special statistical system, the binary fluid system, can bedescribed by field theory in its critical behaviour.
