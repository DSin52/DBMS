We consider the propagation of Type I open superstrings on orbifolds withfour non-compact dimensions and $N=1$ supersymmetry. In this paper, weconcentrate on a non-trivial Z_2xZ_2 example. We show that consistencyconditions, arising from tadpole cancellation and algebraic sources, requirethe existence of three sets of Dirichlet 5-branes. We discuss fully theenhancements of the spectrum when these 5-branes intersect. An amusingattribute of these models is the importance of the tree-level (in Type Ilanguage) superpotential to the consistent relationship between Higgsing andthe motions of 5-branes.
