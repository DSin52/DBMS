This paper studies the 1-loop approximation for a massless spin-1/2 field ona flat four-dimensional Euclidean background bounded by two concentric3-spheres, when non-local boundary conditions of the spectral type are imposed.The use of $\zeta$-function regularization shows that the conformal anomalyvanishes, as in the case when the same field is subject to local boundaryconditions involving projectors. A similar analysis of non-local boundaryconditions can be performed for massless supergravity models on manifolds withboundary, to study their 1-loop properties.
