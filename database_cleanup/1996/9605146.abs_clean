The `electromagnetic' $Sl(2;\bZ)$ duality group in spacetime dimension $D=4k$can be given a Kaluza-Klein interpretation in $D=4k+2$ as the modular group ofa compactifying torus. We show how dyonic $2(k-1)$-branes in $D=4k$ can beinterpreted as self-dual $(2k-1)$-branes in $D=4k+2$ wound around the homologycycles of the torus. In particular, dyons of the D=4 N=4 heterotic stringtheory are interpreted as winding modes of a D=6 self-dual string, while D=8dyonic membranes are interpreted as wound 3-branes of D=10 IIB superstringtheory. We also discuss the T-dual IIA interpretations of D=8 dyonic membranes.
