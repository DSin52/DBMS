Simple bosonic path integral representation for path ordered exponent isderived. This representation is used, at first, to obtain new variant ofnon-Abelian Stokes theorem. Then new pure bosonic worldline path integralrepresentations for fermionic determinant and Green functions are presented.Finally, applying stationary phase method, we get quasiclassical equations ofmotion in QCD.
