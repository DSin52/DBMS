Starting from the type IIB string on the Z orbifold, we construct some chiralopen-string vacua with N=1 supersymmetry in four dimensions. The Chan-Patongroup depends on the (quantized) NS-NS antisymmetric tensor. The largestchoice, SO(8)xSU(12)xU(1), has an anomalous U(1) factor whose gauge bosonacquires a mass of the order of the string scale. The corresponding open-stringspectrum comprises only Neumann strings and includes three families of chiralmultiplets in the (8,12*) + (1,66) representation. A comparison is drawn with aheterotic vacuum with non-standard embedding, and some properties of thelow-energy effective field theory are discussed.
