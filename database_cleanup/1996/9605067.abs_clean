Newly introduced generalized Poisson structures based on suitableskew-symmetric contravariant tensors of even order are discussed in terms ofthe Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket. The associated `Jacobi identities' areexpressed as conditions on these tensors, the cohomological contents of whichis given. In particular, we determine the linear generalized Poisson structureswhich can be constructed on the dual spaces of simple Lie algebras.
