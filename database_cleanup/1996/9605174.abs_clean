We study the internal dynamics of Ramond-Ramond solitons excited far from theBPS limit by leading Regge trajectory open strings. The simplest world volumeprocess for such strings is splitting into two smaller pieces, and we calculatethe corresponding decay rates. Compared to the conventional open superstring,the splitting of states polarized parallel to the brane is suppressed by powersof logarithms of the energy. The rate for states polarized transverse to thebrane {\em decreases} with increasing energy. We also calculate the staticforce between a D-brane excited by a massive open string and an unexcitedD-brane parallel to it. The result shows that transversely polarized massiveopen strings endow D-branes with a size of order the string scale.
