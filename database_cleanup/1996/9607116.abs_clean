Excitations of a vortex are usually considered in a linear approximationneglecting their backreaction on the vortex. In the present paper weinvestigate backreaction of Proca type excitations on a straightlinear vortexin the Abelian Higgs model. We propose exact Ansatz for fields of the excitedvortex. From initial set of six nonlinear field equations we obtain (in a limitof weak excitations) two linear wave equations for the backreactioncorrections. Their approximate solutions are found in the cases of plane waveand wave packet type excitations. We find that the excited vortex radiatesvector field and that the Higgs field has a very broad oscillating component.
