The prolongation structure of Zhiber-Mikhailov-Shabat (ZMS) equation isstudied by using Wahlquist-Estabrook's method. The Lax-pair for ZMS equationand Riccati equations for pseudopotentials are formulated respectively fromlinear and nonlinear realizations of the prolongation structure. Based onnonlinear realization of the prolongation structure, an auto-B$\ddot{a}$cklundtransformation of ZMS equation is obtained.
