Real-time perturbation theory is formulated for complex scalar fields awayfrom thermal equilibrium in such a way that dissipative effects arising fromthe absorptive parts of loop diagrams are approximately resummed into theunperturbed propagators. Low order calculations of physical quantities theninvolve quasiparticle occupation numbers which evolve with the changing stateof the field system, in contrast to standard perturbation theory, where theseoccupation numbers are frozen at their initial values. The evolution equationof the occupation numbers can be cast approximately in the form of a Boltzmannequation. Particular attention is given to the effects of a non-zero chemicalpotential, and it is found that the thermal masses and decay widths ofquasiparticle modes are different for particles and antiparticles.
