Title: Thermodynamics of Black Holes in Presence of String Instantons

Authors: Francois Englert, Laurent Houart and Paul Windey

Comments: 5 pages, LaTeX, to appear in the Proceedings of the Second

International Sakharov Conference, Moscow, May 1996, based on a talk given byThe coupling of a Nambu-Goto string to gravity allows for Schwarzschild blackholes whose entropy to area relation is $S=(A/4)(1-4\mu)$, where $\mu$ is thestring tension. The departure from $A/4$ universality results from a stringinstanton which leads to a materialisation of the horizon at the quantum level.
