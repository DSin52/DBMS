The four dimensional SU(3) WZW model coupled to electromagnetism is treatedas a constrained system in the context of Batalin-Fradkin- Vilkoviskyformalism. It is shown that this treatment is equivalent to the Faddeev-Jackiw(FJ) approach. It is also shown that the field redefinitions that transform thefields of the model into BRST and $\sigma$ closed are actually the Darboux'stransformations used in the FJ formalism.
