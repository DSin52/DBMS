It has been argued by Dyson in the context of QED in flat spacetime thatperturbative expansions in powers of the electric charge e cannot be convergentbecause if e is purely imaginary then the vacuum should be unstable to theproduction of charged pairs. We investigate the spontaneous production of suchDyson pairs in electrodynamics coupled to gravity. They are found to consist ofpairs of zero-rest mass black holes with regular horizons. The properties ofthese zero rest mass black holes are discussed. We also consider ways in whicha dilaton may be included and the relevance of this to recent ideas in stringtheory. We discuss accelerating solutions and find that, in certaincircumstances, the `no strut' condition may be satisfied giving a regularsolution describing a pair of zero rest mass black holes accelerating away fromone another. We also study wormhole and tachyonic solutions and how they affectthe stability of the vacuum.
