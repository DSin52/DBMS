We study the evaporation process of 2D black holes in thermal equilibriumwhen the incoming radiation is turned off. Our analysis is based on twodifferent classes of 2D dilaton gravity models which are exactly solvable inthe semiclassical aproximation including back-reaction. We consider a oneparameter family of models interpolating between the Russo-Susskind-Thorlaciusand Bose-Parker-Peleg models. We find that the end-state geometry is the sameas the one coming from an evaporating black hole formed by gravitationalcollapse. We also study the quantum evolution of black holes arising in a modelwith classical action $S = {1\over2\pi} \int d^2x \sqrt{-g} (R\phi +4\lambda^2e^{\beta\phi})$. The black hole temperature is proportional to themass and the exact semiclassical solution indicates that these black holesnever disappear completely.
