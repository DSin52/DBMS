In the usual procedure for toroidal Kaluza-Klein reduction, all thehigher-dimensional fields are taken to be independent of the coordinates on theinternal space. It has recently been observed that a generalisation of thisprocedure is possible, which gives rise to lower-dimensional ``massive''supergravities. The generalised reduction involves allowing gauge potentials inthe higher dimension to have an additional linear dependence on the toroidalcoordinates. In this paper, we show that a much wider class of generalisedreductions is possible, in which higher-dimensional potentials have additionalterms involving differential forms on the internal manifold whose exteriorderivatives yield representatives of certain of its cohomology classes. Weconsider various examples, including the generalised reduction of M-theory andtype II strings on K3, Calabi-Yau and 7-dimensional Joyce manifolds. Theresulting massive supergravities support domain-wall solutions that arise bythe vertical dimensional reduction of higher-dimensional solitonic p-branes andintersecting p-branes.
