We apply a recently proposed path-integral approach to non-local bosonizationto a Thirring-like system modeling non-relativistic massless particlesinteracting with localized fermionic impurities. We consider forward scatteringprocesses described by symmetric potentials including interactions betweencharge, current, spin and spin-current densities. In the general(spin-flipping) problem we obtain an effective action for the collective modesof the model at T = 0, containing WZW-type terms. When spin-flipping processesare disregarded the structure of the action is considerably simplified,allowing us to derive exact expressions for the dispersion relations ofcollective modes and two point fermionic correlation functions as functionalsof the potentials. Finally, as an example, we compute the momentum distributionfor the case in which electrons and impurities are coupled through spin andspin-current densities only. The formulae we get suggest that our formalismcould be useful in order to seek for a mechanism able to restore Fermi liquidbehavior.
