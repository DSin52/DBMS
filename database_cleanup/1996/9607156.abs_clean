The perturbation theory with a variational basis is constructed andanalyzed.The generalized Gaussian effective potential is introduced andevaluated up to the second order for selfinteracting scalar fields in one andtwo spatial dimensions. The problem of the renormalization of the mass isdiscussed in details. Thermal corrections are incorporated. The comparisonbetween the finite temperature generalized Gaussian effective potential and thefinite temperature effective potential is critically analyzed. The phenomenonof the restoration at high temperature of the symmetry broken at zerotemperature is discussed.
