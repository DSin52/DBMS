Title: The Cauchy Problem for Classical Field Equations with Ghost and Fermion

FieldsAuthors: Thomas Schmitt

Comments: 37 pages, LateX2E+AMSLaTeX

Using a supergeometric interpretation of field functionals developed inprevious papers, we show that for quite a large class of systems of nonlinearfield equations with anticommuting fields, infinite-dimensional supermanifolds(smf) of classical solutions can be constructed. Such systems arise inclassical field models used for realistic quantum field theoretic models. Inparticular, we show that under suitable conditions, the smf of smooth Cauchydata with compact support is isomorphic with an smf of corresponding classicalsolutions of the model.
