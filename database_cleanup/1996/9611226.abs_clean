Title: On the relations between osp(2,2) and the quasi exactly solvable systems

Comments: 14 pages, latex

By taking a product of two sl(2) representations, we obtain the differentialoperators preserving some space of polynomials in two variables. This allows usto construct the representations of osp(2,2) in terms of matrix differentialoperators in two variables. The corresponding operators provide the buildingblocks for the construction of quasi exactly solvable systems of two and fourequations in two variables. Some generalisations are also sketched. Thepeculiar labelling used for the generators allows us to elaborate a nicedeformation of osp(2,2). This gives an appropriate basis for analyzing thequasi exactly solvable systems of finite difference equations.
