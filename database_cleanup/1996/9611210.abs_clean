Journal-ref: Mod.Phys.Lett. A12 (1997) 789-798

We discuss the entropy and the transformation properties of classicalextremal N=2 black hole solutions in supergravity theories associated with theminimal coupling models CP(n-1,1). The entropy is given by a manifestlyinvariant quantity under the embedding of the duality group SU(1,n) intoSp(2n+2) which is a symmetry of the classical BPS mass formula.
