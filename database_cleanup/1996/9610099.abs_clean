We find the solitons of massive (1,1)-supersymmetric sigma models with targetspace the groups $SO(2)$ and $SU(2)$ for a class of scalar potentials andcompute their charge, mass and moduli space metric. We also investigate themassive sigma models with target space any semisimple Lie group and show thatsome of their solitons can be obtained from embedding the $SO(2)$ and $SU(2)$solitons.
