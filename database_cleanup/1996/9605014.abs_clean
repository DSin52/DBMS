Title: Causality and Self-consistency in Classical Electrodynamics

Comments: Replaced with revised version, 4 improved figures and a new section

discussing the physical meaning of terms in the electron equation of motion11 pages, RevtexWe present a pedagogical review of old inconsistencies of ClassicalElectrodynamics and of some new ideas that solve them. Problems with theelectron equation of motion and with the non-integrable singularity of itsself-field energy tensor are well known. They are consequences, we show, ofneglecting terms that are null off the charge world-line but that give a nonnull contribution on its world-line. The electron self-field energy tensor isintegrable without the use of any kind of renormalization; there is nocausality violation and no conflict with energy conservation in the electronequation of motion, when its meaning is properly considered.
