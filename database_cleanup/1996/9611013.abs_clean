Title: Scattering Amplitudes and the CPT theorem in String Theory

Authors: A. Pasquinucci and K. Roland

Comments: LaTeX2e, 8 pages, talk given at the Conference "Gauge Theories,

Applied Supersymmetry and Quantum Gravity", London, July 1996We discuss the role of the CPT transformation in first quantized stringtheories, both on the world-sheet and in the space-time. We explicitly showthat the space-time CPT theorem holds for all first-quantized (perturbative)string theories in a Minkowski background of even dimension $D>2$.
