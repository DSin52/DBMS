The low energy effective theory of the N=1 supersymmetric SU(5) gauge theorywith chiral superfields in the 5* and 10 representations is constructed.Instead of postulating the confinement of SU(5) (confining picture), only theconfinement of its subgroup SU(4) is postulated (Higgs picture), and theeffective fields are SU(4)-singlet but SU(5)-variant. The classical scalarpotential which ensures unique supersymmetric vacuum at the classical level isincorporated into the Kaehler potential of the effective fields. We show thatsupersymmetry and all other global symmetry are spontaneously broken. Thescales of these symmetry breaking and the particle spectrum includingNambu-Goldstone particles are explicitly calculated, and no large scalehierarchy is found.
