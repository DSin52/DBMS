We investigate the quantum effects of the non-minimal matter-gravitycouplings derived by Cangemi and Jackiw in the realm of a specific fermionictheory, namely the abelian Thirring model on a Riemann surface of genuszero and one. The structure and the strength of the new interactions are seento be highly constrained, when the topology of the underlying manifold is takeninto account. As a matter of fact, by requiring to have a well-defined action,we are led both to quantization rules for the coupling constants and toselection rules for the correlation functions. Explicit quantum computationsare carried out in genus one (torus). In particular the two-point function andthe chiral condensate are carefully derived for this case. Finally theeffective gravitational action, coming from integrating out the fermionicdegrees of freedoom, is presented. It is different from the standard Liouvillecharge is improved, depending also on the Thirring coupling constant. This lastfeature opens the possibility of giving a new explicit representation of theminimal series in terms of a fermionic interacting model.
