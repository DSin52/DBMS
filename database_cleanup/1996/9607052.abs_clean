We study the thermodynamics of open superstrings in the presence of$p$-dimensional D-branes. We get some finite temperature dualities relating theone-loop canonical free energy of open strings to the self-energy of D-branesat dual temperature. For the open bosonic string the inverse dual temperatureis, as expected, the dual length under T-duality, $4\pi^{2}\alpha^{'}/\beta$.On the contrary, for the $SO(N)$, type-I superstring the dual temperature isgiven by $\beta$-duality, $2\pi^{2}\alpha^{'}/\beta$. We also study theemergence of the Hagedorn singularity in the dual description as triggered bythe coupling of the D-brane to unphysical tachyons as well as the hightemperature limit.
