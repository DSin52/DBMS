We consider a bosonic $\s$--model coupled to two--dimensional gravity. In thesemiclassical limit, $c\rightarrow -\infty$, we compute the gravity dressing ofthe $\b$--functions at two--loop order in the matter fields. We find that thecorrections due to the presence of dynamical gravity are {\em not} expressiblesimply in terms of a multiplicative factor as previously obtained at theone--loop level. Our result indicates that the critical points of the theoryare nontrivially influenced and modified by the induced gravity.
