We study the effect of mirror symmetry for K3 surfaces on D-brane probephysics. The case of elliptically fibered K3 surfaces is considered indetail. In many cases, mirror can transform a singular fiber of Kodaira's typeADE into sets of singular fibers of type I_1 (II) with equal total Eulernumber, but vanishing contribution to the Picard number of the mirror surface.This provides a geometric model of quantum splitting phenomena. Mirror forthree dimensional gauge theories, interchanging Fayet-Iliopoulos and massterms, is also briefly discussed.
