Title: Interpretation of the Determinant Formulae for the Chiral

Representations of the N=2 Superconformal AlgebraAuthors: Beatriz Gato-Rivera and Jose Ignacio Rosado

Comments: This is a major revision. Our results are complementary, not

contradictory, to the standard interpretation of the N=2 determinantformulae, because the latter do not apply directly to chiral modules. We havealso added one chapter analyzing the Periodic algebraWe show that the N=2 determinant formulae of the Aperiodic NS algebra and thePeriodic R algebra can be applied directly to incomplete Verma modules built onchiral primary states and on Ramond ground states, respectively, provided onemodifies the interpretation of the zeroes in an appropriate way. That is, thezeroes of the determinat formulae account for the highest weight singularstates built on chiral primaries and on Ramond ground states, but theidentification of the levels and relative U(1) charges of the singular statesis different than for complete Verma modules. In particular, half of the zeroesof the quadratic vanishing surfaces $f^A_{r,s}=0$ and $f^P_{r,s}=0$ correspondto uncharged singular states, and the other half correspond to charged singularstates. We derive the spectrum of singular states built on chiral primaries,including the singular states of the Twisted Topological algebra, and thespectrum of singular states built on the Ramond ground states. We also uncoverthe existence of non-highest weight singular states which are not secondary ofany highest weight singular state.
