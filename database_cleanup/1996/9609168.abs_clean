391-396The quantization condition derived previously for SU(2) solitons quantizedwith SU(3)-collective coordinates is generalized for SU(3) skyrmions withstrangeness content different from zero. Quantization of the dipole-typeconfiguration with large strangeness content found recently is considered as anexample.
