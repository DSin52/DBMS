Yang-Baxter EquationComments: 6 pages, latex, no figures, invited talk at the Int. Conf. on

Problems in QFT ( Alushta, May 13-18, 1996), to appear in the proceedingsFormulating quantum integrability for nonultralocal models (NM) parallel tothe familiar approach of inverse scattering method is a long standing problem.After reviewing our result regarding algebraic structures of ultralocal models,we look for the algebra underlying NM. We propose an universal equationrepresented by braided Yang-Baxter equation and able to derive all basicequations of the known models like WZWN model, nonabelian Toda chain, quantummapping etc. As further useful application we discover new integrable quantumNM, e.g. mKdV model, anyonic model, Kundu-Eckhaus equation and derive SUSYmodels and reflection equation from the nonultralocal view point.
