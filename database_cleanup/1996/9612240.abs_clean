We show how to give the expression for periods, Higgs field and its dual ofN=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory around the conformal point. This isachieved by evaluating the integral representation in the weak coupling region,and by using analytic continuation to the conformal point. The explicitrepresentation is shown for the SU(2) theory with matter fields and also forpure SU(N) and pure SO(2N) theory around the conformal point where the relationto the beta function of the theory is clarified. We also discuss a relationbetween the fixed points in the SU(2) theories with matter fields and theLandau-Ginzburg point of 2-D N=2 SCFT.
