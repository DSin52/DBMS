We discuss the scattering of a light closed-string state off a $D$ brane,taking into account quantum recoil effects on the latter, which are describedby a pair of logarithmic operators. The light-particle and $D$-brane subsystemsmay each be described by a world-sheet with an external source due to theinteraction between them. This perturbs each subsystem away from criticality,which is compensated by dressing with a Liouville field whose zero mode weinterpret as time. The resulting evolution equations for the $D$ brane and theclosed string are of Fokker-Planck and modified quantum Liouville type,respectively. The apparent entropy of each subsystem increases as a result ofthe interaction between them, which we interpret as the loss of informationresulting from non-observation of the other entangled subsystem. We speculateon the possible implications of these results for the propagation of closedstrings through a dilute gas of virtual $D$ branes.
