Title: Gauge Symmetry of the Heat-Kernel and Anomaly Formulas

Authors: Shoichi Ichinose and Noriaki Ikeda

Comments: Latex, 14 pages

We consider a gauge symmetry in a quantum Hilbert space. The symmetry leadsto that of the heat-kernel and of the anomaly formulae which were previouslyobtained by the authors. This greatly simplifies and clarifies the structure ofthe formulae. We explicitly obtain the anomaly formulae in two and fourdimensions, which ``unify'' all kinds of anomaly. The symmetry corresponds tothat of the counterterm formulae in the background field method. As an example,the non-abelian anomaly is considered.
