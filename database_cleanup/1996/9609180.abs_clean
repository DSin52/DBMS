We construct sequences of axially symmetric multisphaleron solutions in SU(2)Yang-Mills-dilaton theory. The sequences are labelled by a winding number$n>1$. For $n=1$ the known sequence of spherically symmetric sphaleronsolutions is obtained. The solutions within each sequence are labelled by thenumber of nodes $k$ of the gauge field functions. The limiting solutions of thesequences correspond to abelian magnetic monopoles with $n$ units of charge andenergy $E \propto n$.
