In a recent paper Townsend suggested to associate to the D=11 solitonicmembrane of N=1 supergravity a certain thickness, and then to identify thismembrane with the fundamental supermembrane. By integrating out the 8transverse dimensions of the "thick" solitonic membrane, we show that theresulting world-volume action indeed contains all the usual supermembraneterms, as well as background curvature terms and extrinsic curvature terms,which are believed to render the membrane spectrum discrete. We also outlinethe analog derivation for the "thick" D=10 solitonic string solution of N=IIAsupergravity. The resulting world-sheet action contains the usual type IIAsuperstring terms, as well as extra terms whose presence can be interpreted asa rescaling of the background metric, thus preserving kappa-symmetry andconformal invariance.
