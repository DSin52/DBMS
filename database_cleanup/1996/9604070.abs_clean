We construct several examples where duality transformation commutes with theorbifolding procedure even when the orbifolding group does not act freely, andthere are massless states from the twisted sector at a generic point in themoduli space. Often the matching of spectrum in the dual theories is a resultof non-trivial identities satisfied by the coefficients of one loop tadpoles inthe heterotic, type II and type I string theories.
