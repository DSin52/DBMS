In this paper we present a symmetry of a toroidally compactified type IIstring theory. This symmetry has the interpretaion that it interchanges theleft and the right-moving worldsheet coordinates and reverses the orientationsof some of the spatial coordinates. We also identify another discrete symmetryof the type II theory which is related to the above one by a nontrivialU-duality element of string theory. This symmetry, however, has trivial actionon the worldsheet coordinates and corresponds to an improper T-dualityrotation. We then construct examples of type II dual pairs in four dimensionsby modding out the known type II dual pairs by the above symmetries. We showthe explicit matching of the spectrum and supersymmetries in these examples.
