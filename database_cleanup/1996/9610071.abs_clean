We present a comparative study of the dynamical behaviour of topologicalsystems of recent interest, namely the non-Abelian Chern-Simons Higgs systemand the Yang-Mills Chern-Simons Higgs system. By reducing the full fieldtheories to temporal differential systems using the assumption of spatiallyhomogeneous fields , we study the Lyapunov exponents for two types of initialconditions. We also examine in minute detail the behaviour of the Lyapunovspectra as a function of the various coupling parameters in the system. Wecompare and contrast our results with those for Abelian Higgs, Yang-Mills Higgsand Yang-Mills Chern-Simons systems which have been discussed by other authorsrecently. The role of the various terms in the Hamiltonians for such systems indetermining the order-disorder transitions is emphasized and shown to becounter-intuitive in the Yang-Mills Chern-Simons Higgs systems.
