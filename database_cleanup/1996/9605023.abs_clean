We derive the BPS mass formulae of the Dirichlet branes from the Born-Infeldtype action. BPS saturation is realized when the brane has the minimal volumewhile keeping the appropriate winding numbers. We apply the idea to two cases,type IIA superstring compactified on $T^4$ and $K3$. The result is consistentwith the string duality, and the expected spectrum for the BPS states isreproduced.
