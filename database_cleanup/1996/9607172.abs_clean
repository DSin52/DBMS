We study gaugino condensation in presence of an anomalous $U(1)$ gauge groupand find that global supersymmetry is dynamically broken. An example ofparticular interest is provided by effective string models with 4-dimensionalGreen-Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism. The structure of the hiddensector is constrained by the anomaly cancellation conditions and the scale ofgaugino condensation is shifted compared with the usual case. We explicitlycompute the resulting soft supersymmetry breaking terms.
