We give a classification of all multiple intersections of D-branes in tendimensions and M-branes in eleven dimensions that corresponds to threshold BPSbound states. The residual supersymmetry of these composite branes isdetermined. By dimensional reduction composite p-branes in lower dimensions canbe constructed. We emphasize in dimensions D greater or equal than two, thosesolutions which involve a single scalar and depend on a single harmonicfunction. For these extremal branes we obtain the strength of the couplingbetween the scalar and the gauge field. In particular we give a D-brane andM-brane interpretation of extreme p-branes in two, three and four dimensions.
