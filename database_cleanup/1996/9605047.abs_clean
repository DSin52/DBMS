Title: $M$-theory Compactification and Two-brane/Five-brane Duality

Comments: 16 pages, Latex file

We discuss various dual {\it pairs} of $M$-theory compactifications. Eachpair consists of a compactification in which the two-brane plays the crucialrole in relation to a string theory and a compactification in which thefive-brane takes center stage. We show that in many examples such dual pairsare interchanged by the {\it same} duality transformation in each case.
