An explicit canonical construction of monopole connections on non trivialU(1) bundles over Riemann surfaces of any genus is given. The class of monopolesolutions depend on the conformal class of the given Riemann surface and a setof integer weights. The reduction of Seiberg-Witten 4-monopole equations toRiemann surfaces is performed. It is shown then that the monopole connectionsconstructed are solutions to these equations.
