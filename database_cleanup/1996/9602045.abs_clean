This is a pedagogical review article surveying the various approaches towardsunderstanding gauge coupling unification within string theory. As is wellknown, one of the major problems confronting string phenomenology has been anapparent discrepancy between the scale of gauge coupling unification predictedwithin string theory, and the unification scale expected within the frameworkof the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). In this article, I providean overview of the different approaches that have been taken in recent yearstowards reconciling these two scales, and outline some of the major recentdevelopments in each. These approaches include1) string GUT models;2) higher affine levels and non-standard hypercharge normalizations;3) heavy string threshold corrections;4) light supersymmetric thresholds;5) effects from intermediate-scale gauge and matter structurebeyond the MSSM;6) strings without supersymmetry; and7) strings at strong coupling.
