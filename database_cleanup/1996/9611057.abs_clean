The well known domain wall type solutions are nowadays of great physicalinterest in classical field theory. These solutions can mostly be found onlyapproximately. Recently the Hilbert-Chapman-Enskog method was succesfullyapplied to obtain this type solutions in phi**4 theory. The goal of the presentpaper is to verify these perturbative results by numerical computations.
