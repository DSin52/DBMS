Some bosonic solutions of supergravities admit Killing spinors of unbrokensupersymmetry. The anti-Killing spinors of broken supersymmetry can be used togenerate the superpartners of stringy black holes. This has a consequentfeedback on the metric and the graviphoton. We have found however that thefixed scalars for the black hole superpartners remain the same as for theoriginal black holes. Possible phenomenological implications of this result arediscussed.
