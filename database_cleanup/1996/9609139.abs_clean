The mechanism underlying the divergence of perturbation theory is exposed.This is done through a detailed study of the violation of the hypothesis of theDominated Convergence Theorem of Lebesgue using familiar techniques of QuantumField Theory. That theorem governs the validity (or lack of it) of the formalmanipulations done to generate the perturbative series in the functionalintegral formalism. The aspects of the perturbative series that need to bemodified to obtain a convergent series are presented. Useful tools for apractical implementation of these modifications are developed. Some resummationmethods are analyzed in the light of the above mentioned mechanism.
