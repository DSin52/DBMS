The correlation function of the product of N generalized vertex operatorssatisfies an infinite set of Ward identities, related to a W_{\infty} algebra,whose extention out of the mass shell gives rise to equations which can beconsidered as a generalization of the compactified Calogero-Sutherland (CS)hamiltonians. In particular the wave function of the ground state of thecompactified CS model is shown to be given by the value of the product of Nvertex operators between the vacuum and exitated state. The role of vertexalgebra as underlying unifying structure is pointed out.
