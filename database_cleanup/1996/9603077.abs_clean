Title: Gravitational Meissner Effect

Authors: R.P. Lano (The University of Iowa)

Comments: Submitted to Phys. Rev. D

The gravitational analogue of the electromagnetic Meissner effect isinvestigated. Starting from the post-Newtonian approximation to generalrelativity we arrive at gravitational London equations, predicting agravitational Meissner effect. Applied to neutron stars we arrive at a Londonpenetration depth of 12km, which is about the size of a neutron star.
