We consider an extension of a special class of conformal sigma models(`chiral null models') which describe extreme supersymmetric string solutions.The new models contain both `left' and `right' vector couplings and shouldcorrespond to non-BPS backgrounds. In particular, we discuss a conformalsix-dimensional model which is a combination of fundamental string and 5-branemodels with two extra couplings representing rotations in orthogonal planes. Ifthe two rotational parameters are independent the resulting background is foundto be either singular or not asymptotically flat. The non asymptotically flatsolution has a regular short distance limit described by a `twisted' product ofSL(2,R) and SU(2) WZW theories with two twist parameters mixing the isometricEuler angles of SU(2) with a null direction of SL(2,R).
