The Wilson (exact) renormalization group equations are used to determine theevolution of a general low energy N=1 supersymmetric action containing a U(1)gauge vector multiplet and a neutral chiral multiplet. The effective theoryevolves towards satisfying a fixed relation where the K\"ahler potential andeffective gauge coupling are obtained from a N=2 supersymmetric holomorphicprepotential.
