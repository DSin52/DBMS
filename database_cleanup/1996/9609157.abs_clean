We obtain the closed form of the Picard-Fuchs equations for $N=2$supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with classical Lie gauge groups. For a gaugegroup of rank $r$, there are $r-1$ regular and an exceptional differentialequations. We describe the series solutions of the Picard-Fuchs equations inthe semi-classical regime.
