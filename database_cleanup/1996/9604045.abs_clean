Quantum mechanics ordinarily describes particles as being pointlike, in thesense that the uncertainty $\Delta x$ can, in principle, be made arbitrarilysmall. It has been shown that suitable correction terms to the canonicalcommutation relations induce a finite lower bound to spatial localisation.Here, we perturbatively calculate the corrections to the energy levels of an inthis sense nonpointlike particle in isotropic harmonic oscillators. Apart froma special case the degeneracy of the energy levels is removed.
