The heat kernels of Laplacians for spin 1/2, 1, 3/2 and 2 fields, and theasymptotic expansion of their traces are studied on manifolds with conicalsingularities. The exact mode-by-mode analysis is carried out for 2-dimensionaldomains and then extended to arbitrary dimensions. The corrections to the firstSchwinger-DeWitt coefficients in the trace expansion, due to conicalsingularities, are found for all the above spins. The results for spins 1/2 and1 resemble the scalar case. However, the heat kernels of the Lichnerowicz spin2 operator and the spin 3/2 Laplacian show a new feature. When the conicalangle deficit vanishes the limiting values of these traces differ from thecorresponding values computed on the smooth manifold. The reason for thediscrepancy is breaking of the local translational isometries near a conicalsingularity. As an application, the results are used to find the ultravioletdivergences in the quantum corrections to the black hole entropy for all thesespins.
