Discussions are made on the relationship between physical states and gaugeindependence in QED. As the first candidate take the LSZ-asymptotic states in acovariant canonical formalism to investigate gauge independence of the(Belinfante's) symmetric energy-momentum tensor. It is shown that expectationvalues of the energy-momentum tensor in terms of those asymptotic states aregauge independent to all orders. Second, consider gauge invariant operators ofelectron or photon, such as the Dirac's electron or Steinmann's covariantapproach, expecting a gauge invariant result without any restriction. It is,however, demonstrated that to single out gauge invariant quantities is merelysynonymous to a gauge fixing, resulting again in use of the asymptoticcondition when proving gauge independence. Nevertheless, it is commented thatthese invariant approaches is helpful to understand the mechanism of theLSZ-mapping and furthermore of quark confinement in QCD. As the finalcandidate, it is shown that gauge transformations are freely performed underthe functional representation or the path integral expression on account of thefact that the functional space is equivalent to a collection of infinitely manyinequivalent Fock spaces. The covariant LSZ formalism is shortly reviewed andthe basic facts on the energy-momentum tensor are also illustrated.
