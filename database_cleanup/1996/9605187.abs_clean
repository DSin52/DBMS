I study the technique of Algebraic Bethe Ansatz for solving integrable modelsand show how it works in detail on the simplest example of spin 1/2 XXXmagnetic chain. Several other models are treated more superficially, only thespecific details are given. Several parameters, appearing in thesealternating chain, allow to include in our treatment most known examples ofsoliton theory, including relativistic model of Quantum Field Theory.
