We describe a set of methods to calculate gauge theory renormalizationconstants from string theory, all based on a consistent prescription tocontinue off shell open bosonic string amplitudes. We prove the consistency ofour prescription by explicitly evaluating the renormalizations of the two,three and four-gluon amplitudes, and showing that they obey the appropriateWard identities. The field theory limit thus performed corresponds to thebackground field method in Feynman gauge. We identify precisely the regions instring moduli space that correspond to different classes of Feynman diagrams,and in particular we show how to isolate contributions to the effective action.Ultraviolet divergent terms are then encoded in a single string integral overthe modular parameter $\tau$. Finally, we derive a multiloop expression for theeffective action by computing the partition function of an open bosonic stringinteracting with an external non-abelian background gauge field.
