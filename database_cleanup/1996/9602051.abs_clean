A six-dimensional black string is considered and its Bekenstein-Hawkingentropy computed. It is shown that to leading order above extremality, thisentropy precisely counts the number of string states with the given energy andcharges. This identification implies that Hawking decay of the near-extremalblack string can be analyzed in string perturbation theory and isperturbatively unitary.
