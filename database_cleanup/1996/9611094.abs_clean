Five-dimensional stringy rotating black holes are embedded into N=2supergravity interacting with one vector multiplet. The existence of anunbroken supersymmetry of the rotating solution is proved directly by solvingthe Killing spinor equations. The asymptotic enhancement of supersymmetry nearthe horizon in the presence of rotation is established via the calculation ofthe super-curvature. The area of the horizon of the rotating supersymmetricblack holes is found to be $\sqrt {Z_{fix}^{3 }- J^2}$, where $Z_{fix}$ is theextremal value of the central charge in moduli space.
