We study density correlation functions for an impenetrable Bose gas in afinite box, with Neumann or Dirichlet boundary conditions in the ground state.We derive the Fredholm minor determinant formulas for the correlationfunctions. In the thermodynamic limit, we express the correlation functions interms of solutions of non-linear differential equations which were introducedby Jimbo, Miwa, M\^ori and Sato as a generalization of the fifth Painlev\'eequations.
