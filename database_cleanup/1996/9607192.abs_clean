We show that the gauge-fermion interaction in multiflavour$(2+1)$-dimensional quantum electrodynamics with a finite infrared cut-off isresponsible for non-fermi liquid behaviour in the infrared, in the sense ofleading to the existence of a non-trivial fixed point at zero momentum, as wellas to a significant slowing down of the running of the coupling at intermediatescales as compared with previous analyses on the subject. Both these featuresconstitute deviations from fermi-liquid theory. Our discussion is based on theleading- $1/N$ resummed solution for the wave-function renormalization of theSchwinger-Dyson equations . The present work completes and confirms theexpectations of an earlier work by two of the authors (I.J.R.A. and N.E.M.) onthe non-trivial infrared structure of the theory.
