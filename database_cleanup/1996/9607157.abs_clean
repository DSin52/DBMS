We consider the compactification of type IIB superstring theory on K3$\times$ K3. We obtain the massless spectrum of the resulting two dimensionaltheory and show that the model is free of gravitational anomaly. We thenconsider an orbifold and an orientifold projection of the above model and findthat their spectrum match identically and are anomaly-free as well. This givesa dual pair of type IIB theory in two dimensions and can be understood as aconsequence of SL(2, Z) symmetry of the ten dimensional theory. We also pointout the M-theory duals of the type IIB compactifications considered here.
