A matrix model which has the manifest ten-dimensional N=2 super Poincareinvariance is proposed. Interactions between BPS-saturated states are analyzedto show that massless spectrum is the same as that of type IIB string theory.It is conjectured that the large-N reduced model of ten-dimensional superYang-Mills theory can be regarded as a constructive definition of this modeland therefore is equivalent to superstring theory.
