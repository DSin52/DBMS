We develop an efficient technique to compute anomalies in supersymmetrictheories by combining the so-called nonlocal regularization method andsuperspace techniques. To illustrate the method we apply it to a fourdimensional toy model with potentially anomalous N=1 supersymmetry and proveexplicitly that in this model all the candidate supersymmetry anomalies havevanishing coefficients at the one-loop level.
