A new form of the Wilson renormalization group equation is derived, in whichthe flow equations are, up to linear terms, proportional to a gradient flow. Aset of co\"ordinates is found in which the flow of marginal, low-energy,couplings takes a gradient form, if relevant couplings are tuned to vanish.
