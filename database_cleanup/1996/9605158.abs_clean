The cohomology of the BRS operator corresponding to a group of rigidsymmetries is studied in a space of local field functionals subjected to acondition of gauge invariance. We propose a procedure based on a filtrationoperator counting the degree in the infinitesimal parameters of the rigidsymmetry transformations. An application to Witten's topological Yang-Millstheory is given.
