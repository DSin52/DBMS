We build the trigonometric solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation that can notbe obtained from quantum groups in any direct way. The solution is obtainedusing the construction suggested recently from the rational conformal fieldtheory corresponding to the WZW model on $SO(3)_{4 R}=SU(2)_{4 R} / Z_{2}$. Wealso discuss the full elliptic solution to the Yang-Baxter equation whosecritical limit corresponds to the trigonometric solution found below.
