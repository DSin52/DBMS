SystemsAdditional non-isospectral symmetries are formulated for the constrainedKadomtsev-Petviashvili (\cKP) integrable hierarchies. The problem ofcompatibility of additional symmetries with the underlying constraints issolved explicitly for the Virasoro part of the additional symmetry throughappropriate modification of the standard additional-symmetry flows for thegeneral (unconstrained) KP hierarchy. We also discuss the special case of \cKPpurely differential Lax operators. The latter give rise to Toda-lattice-likestructures relevant for discrete (multi-)matrix models. Our constructionestablishes the condition for commutativity of the additional-symmetry flowswith the discrete Darboux-B\"{a}cklund transformations of \cKP hierarchiesleading to a new derivation of the string-equation constraint in matrix models.
