We consider the generalized chiral $QED_2$ on $S^1$ with a $U(1)$ gaugefield coupled with different charges to both chiral components of a fermionicfield. Using the adiabatic approximation we calculate the Berry phase and thecorresponding ${\rm U}(1)$ connection and curvature for the vacuum and manyparticle Fock states. We show that the nonvanishing vacuum Berry phase isassociated with a projective representation of the local gauge symmetry groupand contributes to the effective action of the model.
