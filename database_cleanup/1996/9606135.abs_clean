We present the full result for the divergent one-loop contribution to theeffective boson Lagrangian for supergravity coupled to chiral and Yang-Millssupermultiplets. We also consider the specific case of dilaton couplings ineffective supergravity Lagrangians from superstrings, for which the one-loopresult is considerably simplified.
