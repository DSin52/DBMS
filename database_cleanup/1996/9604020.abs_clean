headingI outline various derivations of the non-Abelian Kubo equation, which governsthe response of a quark-gluon plasma to hard thermal perturbations. In thestatic case, it is proven that gauge theories do not support hard thermalsolitons. Explicit solutions are constructed within an SU(2) Ansatz and theyare shown to support the general result. The time-dependent problem, i.e.,non-Abelian plasma waves, has not been completely solved. We express andmotivate the hope that the intimate relations linking the gauge-invariancecondition for hard thermal loops to the equation of motion for T=0, topologicalChern-Simons theory may yield new insight into this field.
