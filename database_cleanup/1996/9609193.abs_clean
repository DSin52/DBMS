Higher-order WKB methods are used to investigate the border between thesolvable and insolvable portions of the spectrum of quasi-exactly solvablequantum-mechanical potentials. The analysis reveals scaling and factorizationproperties that are central to quasi-exact solvability. These two propertiesdefine a new class of semiclassically quasi-exactly solvable potentials.
