Certain type II string non-threshold BPS bound states are shown to be relatedto non-static backgrounds in 11-dimensional theory. The 11-d counterpart of thebound state of NS-NS and R-R type IIB strings wound around a circle is a puregravitational wave propagating along a generic cycle of 2-torus. The extremal(q_1,q_2) string with non-vanishing momentum along the circle (or infinitelyboosted black string) corresponds in D=11 to a 2-brane wrapped around 2-toruswith momentum flow along the (q_1,q_2) cycle. Applying duality transformationsto the string-string solution we find type IIA background representing a boundstate of 2-brane and 0-brane. Its lift to 11 dimensions is simply a 2-branefinitely boosted in transverse direction. This 11-d solution interpolatesbetween a static 2-brane (zero boost) and a gravitational wave in 11-thdimension (infinite boost). Similar interpretations are given for various boundstates involving 5-branes. Relations between transversely boosted M-branes and1/2 supersymmetric non-threshold bound states 2+0 and 5+0 complement relationsbetween M-branes with momentum in longitudinal direction and 1/4 supersymmetricthreshold bound states 1+0 and 4+0. In the second part of the paper weestablish the correspondence between the BPS states of type IIB strings on acircle and oscillating states of a fundamental supermembrane wrapped around a2-torus. We show that the (q_1,q_2) string spectrum is reproduced by themembrane BPS spectrum, determined using a certain limit. This supports thepicture suggested by Schwarz.
