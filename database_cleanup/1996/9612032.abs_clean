Authors: Masahiko Miyamoto (Tsukuba University)

We study a vertex operator algebra containing a tensor product of Isingmodels. It is a direct sum of code vertex operator algebra and its irreduciblemodules. Therefore, we classify all irreducible modules of code vertex operatoralgebras and show a new construction of vertex operator algebras.
