We discuss the equivalence between Type I, Type II and Heterotic N=2superstring theories in four dimensions. We study the effective field theory ofType I models obtained by orientifold reductions of Type IIB compactificationson $K_3\times T^2$. We show that the perturbative prepotential is determined bythe one-loop corrections to the Planck mass and is associated to an index. Asis the case for threshold corrections to gauge couplings, this renormalizationis entirely due to N=2 BPS states that originate from D=6 massless stringmodes. We apply our result to the so-called S-T-U model which admitssimultaneous Type II and Heterotic descriptions, and show that all threeprepotentials agree in the appropriate limits as expected from the superstringtriality conjecture.
