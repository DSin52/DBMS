It has been known for some time that the (1,3) perturbations of the (2k+1,2)Virasoro minimal models have conserved currents which are also singular vectorsof the Virasoro algebra. This also turns out to hold for the (1,2) perturbationof the (3k+-1,3) models. In this paper we investigate the requirement that aperturbation of an extended conformal field theory has conserved currents whichare also singular vectors. We consider conformal field theories with W3 and(bosonic) WBC2 = W(2,4) extended symmetries. Our analysis relies heavily on thegeneral conjecture of de Vos and van Driel relating the multiplicities ofW-algebra irreducible modules to the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of a certaindouble coset. Granting this conjecture, the singular-vector argument provides adirect way of recovering all known integrable perturbations. However, W modelsbring a slight complication in that the conserved densities of some (1,2)-typeperturbations are actually subsingular vectors, that is, they become singularvectors only in a quotient module.
