Quantum corrections are studied for a charged black hole in a two-dimensionalmodel obtained by spherisymmetric reduction of the 4D Einstein-Maxwell theory.The classical (tree-level) thermodynamics is re-formulated in the framework ofthe off-shell approach, considering systems at arbitrary temperature. Thisimplies a conical singularity at the horizon and modifies the gravitationalaction by terms defined on the horizon. A consistent variational procedure forthe action functional is formulated. It is shown that the free energy reachesan extremum on the regular manifold with $T=T_H$. The one-loop contribution tothe action in the Liouville-Polyakov form is re-examined. All the boundaryterms are taken into account and the dependence on the state of the quantumfield is established. The modification of the Liouville-Polyakov term for a 2Dspace with a conical defect is derived. The backreaction of the Hawkingradiation on the geometry is studied and the quantum-corrected black holemetric is calculated perturbatively. Within the off-shell approach the one-loopthermodynamical quantities, energy and entropy, are found. They are shown tocontain a part due to hot gas surrounding he black hole and a part due to thehole itself. It is noted that the contribution of the hot gas can be eliminatedby appropriate choice of the (generally, non-flat) reference geometry. Thedeviation of the {\it `` entropy - horizon area''} relation for thequantum-corrected black hole from the classical law is discovered and possiblephysical consequences are discussed.
