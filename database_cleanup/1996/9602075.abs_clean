We show how spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in the vacuum state ofhigher-derivative supergravity is transmitted, as explicit softsupersymmetry-breaking terms, to the effective Lagrangian of the standardelectroweak model. The general structure of the soft supersymmetry breakingterms is presented and a new scenario for understanding the gauge hierarchyproblem, based on the functional form of these terms, is discussed.
