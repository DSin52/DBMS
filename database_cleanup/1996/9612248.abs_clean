Recent developments in string theory have brought forth a considerableinterest in time-dependent hair on extended objects. This novel new hair istypically characterized by a wave profile along the horizon and angularmomentum quantum numbers $l,m$ in the transverse space. In this work, wepresent an extensive treatment of such oscillating black objects, focusing ontheir geometric properties. We first give a theorem of purely geometric nature,stating that such wavy hair cannot be detected by any scalar invariant builtout of the curvature and/or matter fields. However, we show that the tidalforces detected by an infalling observer diverge at the `horizon' of a blackstring superposed with a vibration in any mode with $l \ge 1$. The sameargument applied to longitudinal ($l=0$) waves detects only finite tidalforces. We also provide an example with a manifestly smooth metric, provingthat at least a certain class of these longitudinal waves have regularhorizons.
