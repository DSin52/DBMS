Title: Massless and Massive Monopoles Carrying Nonabelian Magnetic Charges

Comments: 17 pages Latex, presented at Quarks-96, Yaroslavl, Russia

The properties of BPS monopoles carrying nonabelian magnetic charges areinvestigated by following the behavior of the moduli space of solutions as theHiggs field is varied from a value giving a purely abelian symmetry breaking toone that leaves a nonabelian subgroup of the gauge symmetry unbroken. As thelimit of nonabelian unbroken symmetry is reached, some of the fundamentalabelian monopoles remain massive but acquire nonabelian magnetic charges. TheBPS mass formula indicates that others should because massless in this limit.These do not correspond to distinct solitons, but instead are manifested as a``nonabelian cloud'' surrounding the massive monopoles, with their position andphase degrees of freedom being transformed into parameters characterizing thecloud.
