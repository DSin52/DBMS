We write an O(d,d)-covariant Wheeler-De Witt equation in the($d^2+1$)-dimensional minisuperspace of low-energy cosmological stringbackgrounds. We discuss explicit examples of transitions between twoduality-related cosmological phases, and we find a finite quantum transitionprobability even when the two phases are classically separated by a curvaturesingularity. This quantum approach is completely free from operator orderingambiguities as a consequence of the duality symmetries of the string effectiveaction.
