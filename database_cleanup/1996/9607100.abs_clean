Title: Non--trivial Fixed Point in Four Dimensional Scalar Field Theory and the

Higgs MassComments: 9 pages, LaTeX

We show, using the large $N$ limit, that there is a non--trivial scaleinvariant action for four dimensional scalar field theory. We investigate thepossibility that the scalar sector of the standard model of particle physicshas such a scale invariant action, with scale invariance being spontaneouslybroken by the vacuum expectation value of the scalar. This leads to aprediction for the mass of the lightest massive scalar particle (the Higgsparticle) to be $5.4$ Tev.
