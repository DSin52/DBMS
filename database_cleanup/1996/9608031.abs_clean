We discuss the $2+1$ dimensional description of the $\Phi_{1,3}$ deformationof the minimal model $M_p$ leading to a transition $M_p \rightarrow M_{p-1}$.The deformation can be considered as an addition of the charged matter to theChern-Simons theory describing a minimal model. The $N=1$ superconformal caseis also considered.
