of an ideal, because the old definition leads to a vanishing Higgs potentialin the standard model (hep-th/9607096)Starting with a Hilbert space endowed with a representation of a unitary Liealgebra and an action of a generalized Dirac operator, we develop amathematical concept towards gauge field theories. This concept shares commonfeatures with the non--commutative geometry a la Connes/Lott, differs fromthat, however, by the implementation of unitary Lie algebras instead ofassociative *-algebras. The general scheme is presented in detail and isapplied to functions $\otimes$ matrices.
