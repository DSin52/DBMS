A general framework for the Weyl invariant quantization of Liouville fieldtheory by means of an exact renormalization group equation is proposed. Thisflow equation describes the scale dependence of the effective average actionwhich has a built-in infrared cutoff. For c<1 it is solved approximately by atruncation of the space of action functionals. We derive the Ward identitiesassociated to Weyl transformations in presence of the infrared cutoff. They areused to select a specific universality class for the renormalization grouptrajectory which is found to connect two conformal field theories with centralcharges 25-c and 26-c, respectively.
