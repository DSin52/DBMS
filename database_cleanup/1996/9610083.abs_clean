We show that constraints on the generating functional have directBRST-extensions in terms of nilpotent operators $\Delta$ that annihilate thisgenerating functional, and which may be of arbitrarily high order. The freeenergy $F$ in the presence of external sources thus satisfies a ``MasterEquation'' which is described in terms of a tower of higher antibrackets.
