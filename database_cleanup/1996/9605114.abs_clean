We discuss the exact electrically charged BTZ black hole solutions to theEinstein-Maxwell equations with a negative cosmological constant in 2+1spacetime dimensions assuming a (anti-)self dual condition between theelectromagnetic fields. In a coordinate condition there appears a logarithmicdivergence in the angular momentum at spatial infinity. We show how it is to beregularized by taking the contribution from the boundary into account. We showanother coordinate condition which leads to a finite angular momentum though itbrings about a peculiar spacetime topology.
