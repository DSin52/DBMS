We present the construction of the standard model within the framework ofnon--associative geometry. For the simplest scalar product we get thetree--level predictions $m_W=\frac{1}{2} m_t\,,$ $m_H=\frac{3}{2} m_t$ and$\sin^2 \theta_W= \frac{3}{8}.$ These relations differ slightly frompredictions derived in non--commutative geometry.
