We discuss the phase structure of the NJL model in curved spacetime withmagnetic field using $1/N$-expansion and linear curvature approximation. Theeffective potential for composite fields $\bar\psi \psi$ is calculated usingb) at non-zero curvature and non-zero magnetic field, and c) at non-zerocurvature and non-zero covariantly constant gauge field. Chiral symmetrybreaking is studied numerically. We show that the gravitational field maycompensate the effect of the magnetic field what leads to restoration of chiralsymmetry.
