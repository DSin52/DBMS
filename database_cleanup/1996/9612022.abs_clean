A novel probe of D-brane dynamics is via scattering of a high energy rippletraveling along an attached string. The inelastic processes in which theD-brane is excited through emission of an additional attached string isconsidered. Corresponding amplitudes can be found by factorizing a one-loopamplitude derived in this paper. This one-loop amplitude is shown to have thecorrect structure, but extraction of explicit expressions for the scatteringamplitudes is difficult. It is conjectured that the exponential growth ofavailable string states with energy leads to an inclusive scattering rate thatbecomes large at the string scale, due to excitation of the ``string halo,''and meaning that such probes do not easily see structure at shorter scales.
