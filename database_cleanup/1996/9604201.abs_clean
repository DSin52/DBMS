The violation of the Jacobi identity by the presence of magnetic charge isaccomodated by using an explicitly nonassociative theory of octonionic fields.It is found that the dynamics of this theory is simplified if the Lagrangiancontains only dyonic charges, but certain problems in the constrainedquantisation remain. The extension of these concepts to string theory mayhowever resolve these difficulties.
