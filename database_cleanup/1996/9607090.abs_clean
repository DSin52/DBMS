We study phase transitions induced by topological defects in Abelian gaugetheories of open p-branes in (d+1) space-time dimensions. Starting from amassive antisymmetric tensor theory for open p-branes we show how thecondensation of topological defects can lead to a decoupled phase with amassless tensor coupled to closed (p-1)-branes and a massive tensor coupled toopen (p+1)-branes. We also consider the case, relevant in string theory, inwhich the boundaries of the p-branes are constrained to live on a Dirichletn-branes.
