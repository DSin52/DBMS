An analysis of the generalised Raychaudhuri equations for string world sheetsis shown to lead to the notion of focusing of timelike worldsheets in theclassical Nambu-Goto theory of strings. The conditions under which sucheffects can occur are obtained . Explicit solutions as well as the Cauchyinitial value problem are discussed. The results closely resemble theircounterparts in the theory of point particles which were obtained in thecontext of the analysis of spacetime singularities in General Relativity manyyears ago.
