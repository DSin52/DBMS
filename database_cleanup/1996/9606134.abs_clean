The quantum mechanics of black holes in generic 2-D dilaton gravity isconsidered. The Hamiltonian surface terms are derived for boundary conditionscorresponding to an eternal black hole with slices on the interior ending onthe horizon bifurcation point. The quantum Dirac constraints are solved exactlyfor these boundary conditions to yield physical eigenstates of the energyoperator. The solutions are obtained in terms of geometrical phase spacevariables that were originally used by Cangemi, Jackiw and Zwiebach in thecontext of string inspired dilaton gravity. The spectrum is continuous in theLorentzian sector, but in the Euclidean sector the thermodynamic entropy mustbe $2\pi n/G$ where $n$ is an integer. The general class of models consideredcontains as special cases string inspired dilaton gravity, Jackiw-Teitelboimgravity and spherically symmetry gravity.
