Many N=1 heterotic string compactifications exhibit physically mysterioussingularities at codimension one in the moduli space of vacua. At thesesingularities, Yukawa couplings of charged fields develop poles as a functionof the moduli. We explain these conformal field theory singularities, in aclass of examples, as arising from non-perturbative gauge dynamics ofnon-perturbative gauge bosons (whose gauge coupling is the sigma modelcoupling) in the string theory.
