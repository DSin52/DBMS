Title: T-duality and Gauge Symmetry in Supermembrane Theory

Comments: Latex

T-duality has been shown to arise from a gauge symmetry in some stringtheories. However, in the case of \IIA\ compactified on a circle, it is notpossible to show that this is the case. This situation is rather uncomfortablesince string string duality suggests that all T-dualities should arise from agauge symmetry. Here we show that the T-duality of \IIA\ compactified on acircle arises from the reparametrization of the supermembrane. Then we show howthis reparametrization can be understood in terms of a gauge symmetry of thesupermembrane, thus allowing to connect T-duality in \II\ to a gauge symmetryof the supermembrane.
