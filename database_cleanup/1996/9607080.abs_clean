The quantum mechanical concept of quasi-exact solvability is based on theidea of partial algebraizability of spectral problem. This concept is notdirectly extendable to the systems with infinite number of degrees of freedom.For such systems a new concept based on the partial Bethe Ansatz solvability isproposed. In present paper we demonstrate the constructivity of this conceptand formulate a simple method for building quasi-exactly solvable fieldtheoretical models on a one-dimensional lattice. The method automatically leadsto local models described by hermitian hamiltonians.
