We continue our study of compactifications of F-theory on Calabi--Yauthreefolds. We gain more insight into F-theory duals of heterotic strings andprovide a recipe for building F-theory duals for arbitrary heteroticcompactifications on elliptically fibered manifolds. As a byproduct we findthat string/string duality in six dimensions gets mapped to fiber/base exchangein F-theory. We also construct a number of new $N=1$, $d=6$ examples ofF-theory vacua and study transitions among them. We find that some of thesetransition points correspond upon further compactification to 4 dimensions totransitions through analogues of Argyres--Douglas points of $N=2$ moduli. A keyidea in these transitions is the notion of classifying $(0,4)$ fivebranes ofheterotic strings.
