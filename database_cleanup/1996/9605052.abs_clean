SystemsHidden nonabelian symmetries in nonlinear interactions of radiation withmatter are clarified. In terms of a nonabelian potential variable, we constructan effective field theory of self-induced transparency, a phenomenon oflossless coherent pulse propagation, in association with Hermitian symmetricspaces $G/H$. Various new properties of self-induced transparency, e.g. solitonnumbers, effective potential energy, gauge symmetry and discrete symmetries,modified pulse area, conserved $U(1)$-charge etc. are addressed and elaboratedin the nondegenerate two-level case where $G/H = SU(2)/U(1)$. Using the$U(1)$-charge conservation, a new type of analysis on pulse stability is givenwhich agrees with earlier numerical results.
