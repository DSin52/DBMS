We first introduce and discuss the formalism of $SU_q(N)$-bosons and fermionsand consider the simplest Hamiltonian involving these operators. We thencalculate the grand partition function for these models and study the hightemperature (low density) case of the corresponding gases for $N=2$. We showthat quantum group gases exhibit anyonic behavior in $D=2$ and $D=3$ spatialdimensions. In particular, for a $SU_q(2)$ boson gas at $D=2$ the parameter $q$interpolates within a wider range of attractive and repulsive systems than theanyon statistical parameter.
