Equations of motion and the lagrangian are derived explicitely for Dual D=10,N=1 Supergravity considered as a field theory limit of a Fivebrane. It is usedthe mass-shell solution of Heterotic String Bianchi Identites obtained in the2-dimensional $\sigma$-model two-loop approximation and in the tree-levelHeterotic String approximation. As a result the Dual Supergravity lagrangian isderived in the one-loop Five-Brane approximation and in the lowest6-dimensional $\sigma$-model approximaton.
