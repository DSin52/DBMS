Title: On the solution of the Calogero model and its generalization to the case

of distinguishable particlesComments: 8 pages

The 3-body Calogero problem is solved by separation of variables forarbitrary exchange statistics. A numerical computation of the 4-body spectrumis also presented. The results display new features in comparison with thestandard case of bosons and fermions, for instance the energies are not linearwith the interaction parameter $\nu$ and Bethe ansatz as well as Haldane'sstatistics are not verified.
