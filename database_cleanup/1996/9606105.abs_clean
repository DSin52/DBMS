We continue the investigation of quantized Yang-Mills theories coupled tomatter fields in the framework of causal perturbation theory which goes back toEpstein and Glaser. In this approach gauge invariance is expressed by a simplecommutator relation for the S-matrix and the corresponding gaugetransformations are simple transformations of the free fields only. In spite ofthis simplicity, gauge invariance implies the usual Slavnov-Taylor identities.The main purpose of this paper is to prove the latter statement. Since theSlavnov-Taylor identities are formulated in terms of Green's functions, weinvestigate the agreement of two perturbative definitions of Green's functions,namely of Epstein and Glaser's definition with the Gell-Mann Low series.
