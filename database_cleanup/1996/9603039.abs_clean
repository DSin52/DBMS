Title: Relation of The New Calogero Models and xxz Spin Chains

Comments: 15 pages , Latex , No Figures

SystemsWe extend our previous analysis of the classical integrable models ofCalogero in several respects. Firstly we provide the algebraic resaons of theirquantum integrability.Secondly we show why these systems allow their initialvalue problem to be solved in closed form . Furthermore we show that due totheir similarity with the above models the classical and quantum Heisenbergmagnets with long rang interactions in a magnetic field are also intergrable.Explicit expressions are given for the integrals of motion in involution in theclassical case and for the commuting operators in the quantum case.
