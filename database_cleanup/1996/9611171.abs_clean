We consider branching of baby universes off parent one in (1+1)-dimensionaldilaton gravity with 24 types of conformal matter fields. This theory isequivalent to string theory in a certain background in D=26-dimensional targetspace, so this process may be also viewed as the emission of a light stringstate by a heavy string. We find that bare energy is not conserved in (1+1)dimensions due to the emission of baby universes, and that the probability ofthis process is finite even for local distribution of matter in the parentuniverse. We present a scenario suggesting that the non-conservation of bareenergy may be consistent with the locality of the baby universe emissionprocess in (1+1) dimensions and the existence of the long ranged dilaton fieldwhose source is bare energy. This scenario involves the generation oflongitudinal gravitational waves in the parent universe.
