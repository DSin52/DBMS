Quantum theory of 2d gravity for $c>1$ is examined as a non-critical stringtheory by taking account of the loop-correction of open strings whose endpoints are on the 2d world surface of the closed string. This loop-correctionleads to a conformal anomaly, and we obtain a modified target-space actionwhich implies a new phase of the non-critical closed-string. In this phase, thedual field of the gauge field, which lives on the boundary, condenses and thetheory can be extended to $c>1$ without any instability.
