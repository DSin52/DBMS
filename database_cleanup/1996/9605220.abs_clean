N=2 noncritical strings are closely related to the $\Slr/\Slr$ Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model, and there is much hope to further probe the former byusing the algebraic apparatus provided by the latter. An important ingredientis the precise knowledge of the $\hslc$ representation theory at fractionallevel. In this paper, the embedding diagrams of singular vectors appearing in$\hslc$ Verma modules for fractional values of the level ($k=p/q-1$, p and qcoprime) are derived analytically. The nilpotency of the fermionic generatorsin $\hslc$ requires the introduction of a nontrivial generalisation of the MFFconstruction to relate singular vectors among themselves. The diagrams reveal astriking similarity with the degenerate representations of the $N=2$superconformal algebra.
