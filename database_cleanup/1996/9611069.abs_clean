Title: Vertex functions and generalized normal-ordering by triple systems in

non-linear spinor field modelsComments: 11 pages, REVTeX, ca. 45kB, no figures

Triple systems are closely related to Yang-Baxter symmetries. Utilizing anon-parameter-dependent triple product, we derive the BCS interaction. Theenlargement of the notion of symmetry leads in some sense to a regular vertexfunction. The connection to the effect of running coupling constants isoutlined, which leads to the recently discussed anisotropic effective localinteractions. Furthermore, a discussion of the physical nature of q-symmetriesis given.
