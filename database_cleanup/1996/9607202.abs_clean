We further discuss the N=2 superinstantons in SU(2) gauge theory, obtainedfrom the general self-dual solutions of topological charge n constructed byAtiyah, Drinfeld, Hitchin and Manin (ADHM). We realize the N=2 supersymmetryalgebra as actions on the superinstanton moduli. This allows us to recast inconcise superfield notation our previously obtained expression for the exactclassical interaction between n ADHM superinstantons mediated by the adjointHiggs bosons, and moreover, to incorporate N_F flavors of hypermultiplets. Weperform explicit 1- and 2-instanton checks of the Seiberg-Witten prepotentialsfor all N_F and arbitrary hypermultiplet masses. Our results for the low-energycouplings are all in precise agreement with the predictions of Seiberg andWitten except for N_F=4, where we find a finite renormalization of the couplingwhich is absent in the proposed solution.
