Studies in string theory and quantum gravity suggest the existence of afinite lower limit $\Delta x_0$ to the possible resolution of distances, at thelatest on the scale of the Planck length of $10^{-35}m$. Within the frameworkof the euclidean path integral we explicitly show ultraviolet regularisation infield theory through this short distance structure. Both rotation andtranslation invariance can be preserved. An example geometry is studied indetail.
