Title: Large-N limit and contact terms in unbroken YM_4

Comments: 8 pages, latex, no figures

I characterize the structure of the master field for $F^{0}_{z \bar z}$ in$SU(\infty)$-$YM_4$ on a product of two Riemann surfaces $Z \times W$ in thegauge $F^{ch}_{z \bar z}=0$ as the sum of a `bulk' constant term and ofdelta-like `contact' terms.\\ The contact terms may occur because thelocalization of the functional integral at $N=\infty$ on a master orbit of aconstant connection under the action of singular gauge transformations is stillcompatible with the large-$N$ factorization and translational invariance.\\ Inaddition I argue that if the gauge group is unbroken and there is a mass gap,that is if the theory confines, the functional measure at $N=\infty$, in thegauge $F^{ch}_{z \bar z}=0$, must be localized on the moduli space of flatconnections with punctures on $Z \times W$.
