Title: Physical masses and the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field

Comments: Latex, 7 pages

By using the Ward-Takahashi identities in the Landau gauge, we derive exactrelations between particle masses and the vacuum expectation value of the Higgsfield in the Abelian gauge field theory with a Higgs meson.
