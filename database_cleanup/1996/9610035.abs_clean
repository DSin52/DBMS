In this paper we study the structure of the Hilbert space for the recentnoncommutative geometry models of gauge theories. We point out the presence ofunphysical degrees of freedom similar to the ones appearing in lattice gaugetheories (fermion doubling). We investigate the possibility of projecting outthese states at the various levels in the construction, but we find that theresults of these attempts are either physically unacceptable or geometricallyunappealing.
