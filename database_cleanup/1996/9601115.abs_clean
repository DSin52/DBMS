In addition to the familiar contribution from a holomorphic function $\FF$,the K\"ahler potential of the scalars in the nonabelian $N=2$ vector multipletreceives contributions from a real function $\HH$. We determine the latter atthe one-loop level, taking into account both supersymmetric matter and gaugeloops. The function $\HH$ characterizes the four-point coupling of the $N=2$vector-multiplet vectors for constant values of their scalar superpartners. Wediscuss the consequences of our results.
