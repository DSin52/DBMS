By imposing certain combined inversion and rotation symmetries on therational maps for SU(2) BPS monopoles we construct geodesics in the monopolemoduli space. In the moduli space approximation these geodesics describe anovel kind of monopole scattering. During these scattering processes axialsymmetry is instantaneously attained and, in some, monopoles with thesymmetries of the regular solids are formed. The simplest example correspondsto a charge three monopole invariant under a combined inversion and 90 degreerotation symmetry. In this example three well-separated collinear unit chargemonopoles coalesce to form first a tetrahedron, then a torus, then the dualtetrahedron and finally separate again along the same axis of motion. Weexplicitly construct the spectral curves in this case and use a numerical ADHMNconstruction to compute the energy density at various times during the motion.We find that the dynamics of the zeros of the Higgs field is extremely rich andwe discover a new phenomenon; there exist charge k SU(2) BPS monopoles withmore than k zeros of the Higgs field.
