The conventional path integral expression for the Yang-Mills transitionamplitude with flat measure and gauge-fixing built in via the Faddeev-Popovmethod has been claimed to fall short of guaranteeing gauge invariance in thenon-perturbative regime. We show, however, that it yields the gauge invariantpartition function where the projection onto gauge invariant wave functions isexplicitly performed by integrating over the compact gauge group. In a variantof maximal Abelian gauge the Haar measure arises in the conventional Yang-Millspath integral from the Faddeev-Popov determinant.
