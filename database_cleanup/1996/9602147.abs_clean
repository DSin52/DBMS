Authors: S. Hosono and B.H. Lian

Comments: 10 pages, uses sprocl.sty

We analyze GKZ(Gel'fand, Kapranov and Zelevinski) hypergeometric systems andapply them to study the quantum cohomology rings of Calabi-Yau manifolds. Wewill relate properties of the local solutions near the large radius limit tothe intersection rings of a toric variety and of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface.(Talk presented at "Frontiers in Quantum Field Theory", Osaka, Japan, Dec.1995)
