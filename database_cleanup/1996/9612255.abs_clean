(World Sci.,Singapore, 1997) p. 894The polysymplectic $(n+1)$-form is introduced as an analogue of thesymplectic form for the De Donder-Weyl polymomentum Hamiltonian formulation offield theory. The corresponding Poisson brackets on differential forms areconstructed. The analogues of the Poisson algebra are shown to be generalized(non-commutative and higher-order) Gerstenhaber algebras defined in the text.
