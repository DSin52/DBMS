Title: Verma Modules, Extremal Vectors, and Singular Vectors on the

Non-Critical N=2 String WorldsheetComments: LaTeX2.09, 34p

We formulate the general construction for singular vectors in Verma modulesof the affine sl(2|1) superalgebra. We then construct sl(2|1) representationsout of the fields of the non-critical N=2 string. This allows us to extendnaturally to sl(2|1) several crucial properties of the N=2 superconformalalgebra, first of all the construction of extremal states (an analogue ofdifferent pictures for non-free fermions) and the spectral flow transform(which then affects the Liouville sector). We further evaluate the affinesl(2|1) singular vectors in the realization of sl(2|1) provided by the N=2string. We establish that, with a notable exception, the respective singularvectors evaluate as an N=2 superconformal singular vector (however, thosesingular vectors that are labelled by a pair of positive integers get theseintegers transposed under the reduction). We also analyse the `exceptional'cases, which amount to a series of sl(2|1) singular vectors, labelled by r>=1,which do not have an N=2 counterpart, and discuss the mechanism by which themultiplicity of singular vectors becomes equal to two at certain points in theweight spaces of both algebras.
