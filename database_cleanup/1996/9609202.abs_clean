We discuss non-Abelian bosonization of two and three dimensional fermionsusing a path-integral framework in which the bosonic action follows from theevaluation of the fermion determinant for the Dirac operator in the presence ofa vector field. This naturally leads to the Wess-Zumino-Witten action formassless two-dimensional fermions and to a Chern-Simons action for very massivethree dimensional fermions. One advantage of our approach is that it allows toderive the exact bosonization recipe for fermion currents in a systematic way.
