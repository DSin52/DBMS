The known Holstein-Primakoff and Dyson realizations for the Lie algebras$gl(n+1),\;n=1,2,\ldots$ in terms of Bose operators are generalized to theclass of the Lie superalgebras $gl(m/n+1)$ for any $n$ and $m$. Formally theexpressions are the same as for $gl(m+n+1)$, however both Bose and Fermioperators are involved.
