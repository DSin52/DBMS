A non-Abelian analogue of the Abelian T-duality momentum-winding exchange isdescribed. The non-Abelian T-duality relates $\sigma$-models living on thecosets of a Drinfeld double with respect to its isotropic subgroups. The roleof the Abelian momentum-winding lattice is in general played by the fundamentalgroup of the Drinfeld double.
