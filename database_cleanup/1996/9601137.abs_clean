We clarifies the group theoretical structure of $N=1$ and $N=2$ two-formsupergravity, which is classically equivalent to the Einstein supergravity.$N=1$ and $N=2$ two-form supergravity theories can be formulated as gaugetheories. By introducing two Grassmann variables $\theta^A$ ($A=1,2$), weconstruct the explicit representations of the generators $Q^i$ of the gaugegroup, which makes to express any product of the generators as a linearcombination of the generators $Q^iQ^j=\sum_k f^{ij}_k Q^k$. By using theexpression and the tensor product representation, we explain how to constructfinite-dimensional representations of the gauge groups. Based on theserepresentations, we construct the Lagrangeans of $N=1$ and $N=2$ two-formsupergravity theories.
