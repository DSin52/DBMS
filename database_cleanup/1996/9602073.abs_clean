We calculate the one-instanton contribution to the prepotential in $N=2$supersymmetric $SU(N_c)$ Yang-Mills theory from the microscopic viewpoint. Wefind that the holomorphy argument simplifies the group integrations of theinstanton configurations. For $N_{c}=3$, the result agrees with the exactsolution.
