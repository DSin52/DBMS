We construct Landau-Ginzburg Lagrangians for minimal bosonic ($N=0$)$W$-models perturbed with the least relevant field, inspired by the theory of$N=2$ supersymmetric Landau-Ginzburg Lagrangians. They agree with theLagrangians for unperturbed models previously found with Zamolodchikov'smethod. We briefly study their properties, e.g. the perturbation algebra andthe soliton structure. We conclude that the known properties of $N=2$ solitons(BPS, lines in $W$ plane, etc.) hold as well. Hence, a connection with ageneralized supersymmetric structure of minimal $W$-models is conjectured.
