By using the standard perturbation theory we study the mass as well as$\theta$ parameter dependence of the Seiberg-Witten theory with $SU(2)$ gaugegroup, supplemented with a $N=1$ supersymmetric as well as a smallernonsupersymmetric (e.g.) gaugino mass. Confinement persists at all values ofthe bare vacuum parameter $\theta_{ph}$; as it is varied there is however aphase transition at $\theta_{ph} =-\pi, \pi, 3\pi, \ldots$. At these values of$\theta_{ph}$ the vacuum is doubly degenerate and CP invariance isspontaneously broken \`a la Dashen. Due to the instanton-inducedrenormalization effect the low energy effective $\theta$ parameter remainssmall irrespectively of $\theta_{ph}$ as long as the gaugino mass issufficiently small.
