We use a simple algebraic method to find a special class of composite p-branesolutions of higher dimensional gravity coupled with matter. These solutionsare composed of n constituent p-branes corresponding n independent harmonicfunctions. A simple algebraic criteria of existence of such solutions ispresented. Relations with D=11,10 known solutions are discussed.
