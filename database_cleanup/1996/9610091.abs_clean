We present a mechanism to construct four-dimensional charged massless Ramondstates using the discrete states of a fivebrane Liouville internal conformalfield theory. This conformal field theory has background charge, and admits aninner product which allows positive norm states. A connection amongsupergravity soliton solutions, Liouville conformal field theory, non-criticalstring theory and their gauge symmetry properties is given. A generalizedconstruction of the SU(2) super Kac-Moody algebra mixing with the N=1 superVirasoro algebra is analyzed. How these Ramond states evade the DKV no-gotheorem is explained.
