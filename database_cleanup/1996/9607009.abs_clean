We study 2D non-linear sigma models on a group manifold with a special formof the metric. We address the question of integrability for this special classof sigma models. We derive two algebraic conditions for the metric on the groupmanifold. Each solution of these conditions defines an integrable model.Although the algebraic system is overdetermined in general, we give twoexamples of solutions. We find the Lax field for these models and calculatetheir Poisson brackets. We also obtain the renormalization group (RG)equations, to first order, for the generic model. We solve the RG equations forthe examples we have and show that they are integrable along the RG flow.
