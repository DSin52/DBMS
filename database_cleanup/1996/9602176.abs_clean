An overlap method for regularizing Majorana--Weyl fermions interacting withgauge fields is presented. A mod(2) index is introduced in relation to theanomalous violation of a discrete global chiral symmetry. Most of the paper isrestricted to 2 dimensions but generalizations to 2+8k dimensions should bestraightforward.
