We investigate some properties of a first-order polynomial formulation of theU(1) non-linear sigma-model in two Euclidean dimensions. The variables in thisdescription are a 1-form field plus a 0-form Lagrange multiplier field. Theusual spin variables are non-local functions of the new fields. As thisconstruction incorporates O(2) invariance ab initio, only O(2)-invariantcorrelation functions (the only non-vanishing ones in the model) can beconstructed. We show that the vortices play a dual role to the spin variablesin the partition function. The equivalent Sine-Gordon description is obtainedin a natural way, when one integrates out the 1-form field to get an effectivepartition function for the Lagrange multiplier. We also show how to introducestrings of vortices within this formulation.
