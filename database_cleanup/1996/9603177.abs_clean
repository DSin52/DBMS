The massive Schwinger model is quantized on the light cone with great care onthe bosonic zero modes by putting the system in a finite (light-cone) spatialbox. The zero mode of $A_{-}$ survives Dirac's procedure for the constrainedsystem as a dynamical degree of freedom. After regularization and quantization,we show that the physical space condition is consistently imposed and relatesthe fermion Fock states to the zero mode of the gauge field. The vacuum isobtained by solving a Schr\"odinger equation in a periodic potential, so thatthe theta is understood as the Bloch momentum. We also construct a one-mesonstate in the fermion-antifermion sector and obtained the Schr\"odinger equationfor it.
