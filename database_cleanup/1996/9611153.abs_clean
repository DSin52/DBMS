We consider quantum holonomy of some three-dimensional general covariantnon-Abelian field theory in Landau gauge and confirm a previous resultpartially proven. We show that quantum holonomy retains metric independenceafter explicit gauge fixing and hence possesses the topological property of alink invariant. We examine the generalized quantum holonomy defined on amulti-component link and discuss its relation to a polynomial for the link.
