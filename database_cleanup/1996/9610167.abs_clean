Title: Applications of Free Fields in 2D Current Algebra

Comments: 161 pages, LaTeX using pictex, Ph.D. thesis submitted 8 October 1996

In this thesis steps are taken in the direction of formulating non-criticalstrings in the framework of the $G/G$ approach. A major part of the thesis isconcerned with conformal field theory based on affine $SL(2)$ current algebra,in particular for admissible representations which are relevant in the$SL(2)/SL(2)$ description of coupling conformal minimal matter to 2D gravity.By virtue of fractional calculus, free field realizations are made applicableof producing integral representations of chiral blocks, even in the case ofadmissible representations where ghost fields raised to fractional powers areinherent. The famous work on minimal models by Dotsenko and Fateev is thengeneralised, working out monodromy invariant 4-point Greens functions and theoperator algebra coefficients. Furthermore, the fusion rules are re-derivedwithin the context of free field realizations by introducing the notion ofover-screening. For higher groups an explicit Wakimoto free field realizationis presented of affine current algebras based on simple Lie groups.Furthermore, a study is undertaken of primary fields in the framework of extra$x$ variables, and screening currents of both kinds are discussed. Several newand definite results are presented. A quantum group structure relying on bothkinds of screening currents is discussed along the lines of Gomez and Sierra.
