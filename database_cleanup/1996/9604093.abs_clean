The constraint structure of 2D-gravity with the Weyl and area-preservingdiffeomorphism invariances is analysed in the ADM formulation. It is found thatwhen the area-preserving diffeomorphism constraints are kept, the usualconformal gauge does not exist, whereas there is the possibility to choose theso-called ``quasi-light-cone'' gauge, in which besides the area-preservingdiffeomorphism invariance, the reduced Lagrangian also possesses the SL(2,R)residual symmetry. The string-like approach is applied to quantise this model,but a fictitious non-zero central charge in the Virasoro algebra appears. Whena set of gauge-independent SL(2,R) current-like fields is introduced instead ofthe string-like variables, a consistent quantum theory is obtained.
