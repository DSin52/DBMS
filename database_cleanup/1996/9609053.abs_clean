Title: Non-BPS excitations of D-branes and Black holes

Comments: harvmac, 20 pages

This note discusses some results on the non-BPS excitations of D-branes. Weshow that the excitation spectrum of a bound state of D-strings changescharacter when the length of the wrapping circle becomes less than $\simg^{-1}\LS$. We review the observed relation between the low energy absorptioncross-section of D-branes and the low energy absorption cross-section for blackholes. We discuss various issues related to the information question for blackholes.
