A precise definition of an adiabaticity parameter $\nu$ of a time-dependentHamiltonian is proposed. A variation of the time-dependent perturbation theoryis presented which yields a series expansion of the evolution operator$U(\tau)=\sum_\ell U^{(\ell)}(\tau)$ with $U^{(\ell)}(\tau)$ being at least ofthe order $\nu^\ell$. In particular $U^{(0)}(\tau)$ corresponds to theadiabatic approximation and yields Berry's adiabatic phase. It is shown thatthis series expansion has nothing to do with the $1/\tau$-expansion of$U(\tau)$. It is also shown that the non-adiabatic part of the evolutionoperator is generated by a transformed Hamiltonian which is off-diagonal in theeigenbasis of the initial Hamiltonian. Some related issues concerning thegeometric phase are also discussed.
