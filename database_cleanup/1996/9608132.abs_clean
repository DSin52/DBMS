Title: Large $N$ QCD and $q$-Deformed Quantum Field Theories

Comments: 4 pages, latex.Invited talk at the Second International Sakharov

Conference on Physics, Moscow, May 1996A construction of master field describing multicolour QCD is presented. Themaster fields for large N matrix theories satisfy to standard equations ofrelativistic field theory but fields are quantized according $q$-deformedcommutation relations with $q=0$. These commutation relations are realized inthe Boltzmannian Fock space. The master field for gauge theory does not takevalues in a finite-dimensional Lie algebra, however, there is a non-Abeliangauge symmetry and BRST-invariance.
