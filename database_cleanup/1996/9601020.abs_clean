Title: Lagrangian Models of the Particles with Spin

Comments: plain LaTeX, 25 pages. To appear in "From Field Theory to Quantum

Groups" World Scientific, proceedings to honour J.Lukierski in his 60thbirthdayWe briefly review models of relativistic particles with spin. Departingfrom the oldest attempts to describe the spin within the lagrangian frameworkwe pass through various non supersymmetric models. Then the component andsuperfield formulations of the spinning particle and superparticle models arereviewed. Our focus is mainly on the classical side of the problem, but somequantization questions are mentioned as well.
