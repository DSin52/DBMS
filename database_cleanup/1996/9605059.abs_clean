We present a new set of supersymmetric stationary solutions of pure N=4,d=4supergravity (and, hence, of low-energy effective string theory) thatgeneralize (and include) the Israel-Wilson-Perj\'es solutions ofEinstein-Maxwell theory. All solutions have 1/4 of the supersymmetries unbrokenand some have 1/2. The full solution is determined by two arbitrary complexharmonic functions {\cal H}_{1,2} which transform as a doublet under SL(2,\R) Sduality and N complex constants k^{(n)} that transform as an SO(N) vector. Thisset of solutions is, then, manifestly duality invariant. When the harmonicfunctions are chosen to have only one pole, all the general resultingpoint-like objects have supersymmetric rotating asymptotically Taub-NUT metricswith 1/2 or 1/4 of the supersymmetries unbroken. The static, asymptoticallyflat metrics describe supersymmetric extreme black holes. Only those breaking3/4 of the supersymmetries have regular horizons. The stationary asymptoticallyflat metrics do not describe black holes when the angular momentum does notvanish, even in the case in which 3/4 of the supersymmetries are broken.
