We examine the proposal made recently that the su(3) modular invariantpartition functions could be related to the geometry of the complex Fermatcurves. Although a number of coincidences and similarities emerge between themand certain algebraic curves related to triangular billiards, their meaningremains obscure. In an attempt to go beyond the su(3) case, we show that anyrational conformal field theory determines canonically a Riemann surface.
