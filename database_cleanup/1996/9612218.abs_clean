A complete treatment of the (2,2) NSR string in flat (2+2) dimensionalspace-time is given, from the formal path integral over N=2 super Riemannsurfaces to the computational recipe for amplitudes at any loop or gaugeinstanton number. We perform in detail the superconformal gauge fixing, discussthe spectral flow, and analyze the supermoduli space with emphasis on the gaugemoduli. Background gauge field configurations in all instanton sectors areconstructed. We develop chiral bosonization on punctured higher-genus surfacesin the presence of gauge moduli and instantons. The BRST cohomology isrecapitulated, with a new space-time interpretation for picture-changing. Wepoint out two ways of combining left- and right-movers, which lead to differentthree-point functions.
