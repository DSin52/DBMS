Authors: A.V.Sinitskaya, E.V.Pavlova

Comments: 9 pages

The bound states of two particles are studied in frames of non-relativisticquantum field model with current $\times$ current type interaction by analyzingthe Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes. The Bethe-Salpeter equations are obtained inclosed form. The existence of Goldstone mode corresponding to the spontaneousbreaking of additional SU(2) symmetry of the model is revealed.
