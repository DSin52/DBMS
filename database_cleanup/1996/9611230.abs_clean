We propose an explanation via string theory of the correspondence between theCoulomb branch of certain three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories andcertain moduli spaces of magnetic monopoles. The same construction also givesan explanation, via $SL(2,\Z)$ duality of Type IIB superstrings, of therecently discovered ``mirror symmetry'' in three dimensions. New phasetransitions in three dimensions as well as new infrared fixed points and evennew coupling constants not present in the known Lagrangians are predicted fromthe string theory construction. An important role in the construction is playedby a novel aspect of brane dynamics in which a third brane is created when twobranes cross.
