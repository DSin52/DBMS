We consider supersymmetrization of Hamiltonian dynamics via antibrackets forsystems whose Hamiltonian generates an isometry of the phase space. We findthat the models are closely related to the supersymmetric non-linear$\sigma$-model. We interpret the corres\-ponding path integrals in terms ofsuper loop space equivariant cohomology. It turns out that they can beevaluated exactly using localizations techniques.
