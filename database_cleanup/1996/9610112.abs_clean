We present a class of Kaluza-Klein electrically charged black p-branesolutions of ten-dimensional, type IIA superstring theory. Uplifting to elevendimensions these solutions are studied in the context of M-theory. They can beinterpreted either as a p+1 extended object trapped around the eleventhdimension along which momentum is flowing or as a boost of the following(10-p)-dimensional Euclidean Schwarzschild manifold with the (p+1)-dimensionalMinkowski spacetime.
