We analyse in a systematic way the four dimensionnal Einstein-Weyl spacesequipped with a diagonal K\"ahler Bianchi IX metric. In particular, we showthat the subclass of Einstein-Weyl structures with a constant conformal scalarcurvature is the one with a conformally scalar flat - but not necessarilyscalar flat - metric ; we exhibit its 3-parameter distance and Weyl one-form.This extends previous analysis of Pedersen, Swann and Madsen , limited to thescalar flat, antiself-dual case. We also check that, in agreement with atheorem of Derdzinski, the most general conformally Einstein metric in thefamily of biaxial K\"ahler Bianchi IX metrics is an extremal metric of Calabi,conformal to Carter's metric, thanks to Chave and Valent's results.
