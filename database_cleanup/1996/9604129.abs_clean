We study string theory propagating on R^6 times K3 by constructingorientifolds of Type IIB string theory compactified on the T^4/Z_N orbifoldlimits of the K3 surface. This generalises the Z_2 case studied previously. Theorientifold models studied may be divided into two broad categories, sometimesrelated by T-duality. Models in category A require either both D5- andD9-branes, or only D9-branes, for consistency. Models in category B requireeither only D5-branes, or no D-branes at all. This latter case is an example ofa consistent purely closed unoriented string theory. The spectra of theresulting six dimensional N=1 supergravity theories are presented. Precisestatements are made about the relation of the Z_N ALE spaces and D5-branes toinstantons in the dual heterotic string theory.
