Title: String Equation From Field Equation

Comments: REVTEX, 5 pages

It is shown that the string equation can be obtain from field equations. Suchwork is performed to scalar field. The equation obtained in nonrelativisticlimit describes the nonlinear string. Such string has the effective elasticityconnencted with the local string curvature. Some examples of the movement suchnonlinear elastic string are considered.
