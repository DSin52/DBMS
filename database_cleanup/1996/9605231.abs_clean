We study the QED bound-state problem in a light-front hamiltonian approach.Starting with a bare cutoff QED Hamiltonian, $H_{_{B}}$, with matrix elementsbetween free states of drastically different energies removed, we perform asimilarity transformation that removes the matrix elements between free stateswith energy differences between the bare cutoff, $\Lambda$, and effectivecutoff, $\lam$ ($\lam < \Lam$). This generates effective interactions in therenormalized Hamiltonian, $H_{_{R}}$. These effective interactions are derivedto order $\alpha$ in this work, with $\alpha \ll 1$. $H_{_{R}}$ is renormalizedby requiring it to satisfy coupling coherence. A nonrelativistic limit of thetheory is taken, and the resulting Hamiltonian is studied using bound-stateperturbation theory (BSPT). The effective cutoff, $\lam^2$, is fixed, and thelimit, $0 \longleftarrow m^2 \alpha^2\ll \lam^2 \ll m^2 \alpha \longrightarrow\infty$, is taken. This upper bound on $\lam^2$ places the effects oflow-energy (energy transfer below $\lam$) emission in the effectiveinteractions in the $| e {\overline e} > $ sector. This lower bound on $\lam^2$insures that the nonperturbative scale of interest is not removed by thesimilarity transformation. As an explicit example of the general formalismintroduced, we show that the Hamiltonian renormalized to $O(\alpha)$ reproducesthe exact spectrum of spin splittings, with degeneracies dictated by rotationalsymmetry, for the ground state through $O(\alpha^4)$. The entire calculation isperformed analytically, and gives the well known singlet-triplet ground statespin splitting of positronium, $7/6 \alpha^2 Ryd$. We discuss remainingcorrections other than the spin splittings and how they can be treated incalculating the spectrum with higher precision.
