Boundary condition changing operators in conformal field theory describevarious types of "sudden switching" problems in condensed matter physics suchas the X-ray edge singularity. We review this subject and give two extensionsof previous work. A general derivation of a connection between the X-ray edgesingularity, the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe and finite-size scaling ofenergies is given. The formalism is also extended to include boundstates.
