Theories, Applied Supersymmetry and Quantum gravity, Imperial College,London, 1996We report on recent progress in the use of string techniques for thecomputation of field theory amplitudes. We show how one-loop renormalizationconstants in Yang-Mills theory can be computed using the open spinning string,we review the calculation of two-loop scalar amplitudes with the bosonicstring, and we briefly indicate how the technique can be applied to thetwo-loop vacuum bubbles of Yang-Mills theory.
