We present intersecting p-brane solutions of eleven-dimensional supergravity(M-branes) which upon toroidal compactification reduce to non-extreme``rotating'' black holes. We identify harmonic functions, associated with eachM-brane, and non-extremality functions, specifying a deviation from the BPSlimit. These functions are modified due to the angular momentum parameters,which specify the rotation along the transverse directions of the M-branes. Wespell out the intersection rules for the eleven-dimensional space-time metricfor intersecting (up to three) rotating M-brane configurations (and a boostalong the common intersecting direction).
