The massive soliton theories describe integrable perturbations of WZW cosetsas generalized multi-component sine-Gordon models. We study their coupling to2-dim gravity in the conformal gauge and show that the resulting models can beinterpreted as conformal non-Abelian Toda theories when a certain algebraiccondition is satisfied. These models, however, do not provide quantummechanically consistent string backgrounds in the case the underlying WZWconstraints are first solved classically.
