We consider compactifications of the heterotic string on $K3 \times T2$ sothat the resulting theory in $d = 4$ space-time dimensions has $N = 2$supersymmetry. The gravitational and gauge coupling constants of the low-energyeffective theory receive threshold corrections from loops of super-heavy stringstates. We calculate these corrections for the case when the $K3$-surface is a${\bf Z}_n$ orbifold of a four torus $T4$. The results are used to determinethe one-loop prepotential ${\cal F}_0^{(1)}$ for the vector multiplets and thegravitational coupling ${\cal F}_1^{(1)}$.
