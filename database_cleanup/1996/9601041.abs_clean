LaTeX 2e version, uses NFSS2; no changes in contentsIn this thesis generalizations of matrix and eigenvalue models involvingsupersymmetry are discussed. Following a brief review of the Hermitian onematrix model, the c=-2 matrix model is considered. Built from a matrix valuedsuperfield this model displays supersymmetry on the matrix level. We stress theemergence of a Nicolai-map of this model to a free Hermitian matrix model andstudy its diagrammatic expansion in detail. Correlation functions for quarticpotentials on arbitrary genus are computed, reproducing the stringsusceptibility of c=-2 Liouville theory in the scaling limit. The results maybe used to perform a counting of supersymmetric graphs.We then turn to the supereigenvalue model, today's only successful discreteapproach to 2d quantum supergravity. The model is constructed in asuperconformal field theory formulation by imposing the super-Virasoroconstraints. The complete solution of the model is given in the momentdescription, allowing the calculation of the free energy and the multi-loopcorrelators on arbitrary genus and for general potentials. The solution ispresented in the discrete case and in the double scaling limit. Explicitresults up to genus two are stated.Finally the supersymmetric generalization of the external field problem isaddressed. We state the discrete super-Miwa transformations of thesupereigenvalue model on the eigenvalue and matrix level. Properties ofexternal supereigenvalue models are discussed, although the model correspondingto the ordinary supereigenvalue model could not be identified so far.
