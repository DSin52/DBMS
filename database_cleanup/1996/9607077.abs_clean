In N=2 ungauged supergravity we have found the most general double-extremedyonic black holes with arbitrary number n_v of constant vector multiplets andwith coinciding horizons, 2) the mass for a given set of quantized charges isextremal. The spacetime is of the Reissner-Nordstrom form and the vectormultiplet moduli depend on dyon charges. As an example we display n_v complexmoduli as functions of 2(n_v+1) electric and magnetic charges in a modelrelated to a classical Calabi-Yau moduli space. A specific case includes thecomplex S, T, U moduli depending on 4 electric and 4 magnetic charges of 4 U(1)gauge groups.
