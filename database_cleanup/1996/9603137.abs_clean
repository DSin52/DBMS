Title: Is the Chiral Model equivalent to Wess-Zumino-Witten Model when coupled

with Gravity?Comments: Latex file, 6 pages

We investigate the non-abelian $T$-duality of Wess-Zumino-Witten model. Theobtained dual model is equivalent to the model dual to the $SU(2)$ chiral modelfound by Curtright-Zachos. This might tell that the Wess-Zumino term would beinduced when the chiral model couples with gravity.
