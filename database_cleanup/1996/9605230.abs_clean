Authors: J. S. Prakash

Comments: RevTex 3.0, 21 pages, no figures

An explicit and simple correspondence, between the basis of the model spaceof $SU(3)$ on one hand and that of $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ or $SO(1,3)$ on theother, is exhibited for the first time. This is done by considering thegenerating functions for the basis vectors of these model spaces.
