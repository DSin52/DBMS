We prove that self-dual gauge fields in type I superstring theory areequivalent to configurations of Dirichlet 5-branes, by showing that theworld-sheet theory of a Dirichlet 1-brane moving in a background of 5-branesincludes an ``ADHM sigma model.'' This provides an explicit construction of theequivalent self-dual gauge field. We also discuss type II.
