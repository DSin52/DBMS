We get the general static, spherically symmetric solutions of thed-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theories by dimensionally reducingthem to a class of 2-dimensional dilaton gravity theories. By studying thesymmetries of the actions for the static equations of motion, we find fieldredefinitions that nearly reduce these theories to the d-dimensionalEinstein-Maxwell-Scalar theories, and therefore enable us to get the exactsolutions. We do not make any assumption about the asymptotic space-timestructure. As a result, our 4-dimensional solutions contain the asymptoticallyflat Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) solutions and the non-asymptoticallyflat Chan-Horne-Mann (CHM) solutions. Besides, we find some new solutions witha finite range of allowed radius of the transversal sphere. These resultsgeneralize to an arbitrary space-time dimension d (d>3).
