The problem of extracting the modes of Goldstone bosons from a thermalbackground is reconsidered in the framework of relativistic quantum fieldtheory. It is shown that in the case of spontaneous breakdown of an internalbosonic symmetry a recently established decomposition of thermal correlationfunctions contains certain specific contributions which can be attributed to aparticle of zero mass.
