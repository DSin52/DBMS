Title: Exact Wavefunctions for a Delta Function Bose Gas with Higher

DerivativesAuthors: Eric D. Williams

A quantum mechanical system describing bosons in one space dimension with akinetic energy of arbitrary order in derivatives and a delta functioninteraction is studied. Exact wavefunctions for an arbitrary number ofparticles and order of derivative are constructed. Also, equations determiningthe spectrum of eigenvalues are found.
