We present a relation which connects the propagator in the radial(Fock-Schwinger) gauge with a gauge invariant Wilson loop. It is closelyrelated to the well-known field strength formula and can be used to calculatethe radial gauge propagator. The result is shown to diverge in four-dimensionalspace even for free fields, its singular nature is however naturally explainedusing the renormalization properties of Wilson loops with cusps andself-intersections. Using this observation we provide a consistentregularization scheme to facilitate loop calculations. Finally we compare ourresults with previous approaches to derive a propagator in Fock-Schwingergauge.
