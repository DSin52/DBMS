Title: Algebra of Conserved Generators and Statistical Ensembles in Generalized

Quantum DynamicsAuthors: Stephen L. Adler and L.P. Horwitz

Comments: 15 pages, plain TeX. Corrected report number only

We study here the algebraic structure of the conserved generators from whichthe microcanonical and canonical ensembles are constructed on an underlyinggeneralized quantum dynamics, and the flows they induce on the phase space. Wealso discuss briefly the structure of the microcanonical and canonicalensembles.
