(Anti)self-dual solutions of the scale invariant SU(2) gauged Grassmanianmodel are sought. A stronger (anti)selfduality condition for this system isdefined, referred to as strong self-duality, and spherically symmetricsolutions of this {\it strong} (anti)self-duality equations are found in closedform. It is verified that these are the only solutions of the strong(anti)self-duality equations. The usual (anti)self-duality equations for theaxially symmetric fields are derived and seen to be not overdetermined.
