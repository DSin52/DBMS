We construct QED_2 with mass and flavor and an extra Thirring term. Thevacuum expectation values are carefully decomposed into clustering states usingthe U(1)-axial symmetry of the considered operators and a limiting procedure.The properties of the emerging expectation functional are compared to theproposed theta-vacuum of QCD. The massive theory is bosonized to a generalizedSine-Gordon model (GSG). The structure of the vacuum of QED_2 manifests itselfin symmetry properties of the GSG. We study the U(1)-problem and derive aWitten-Veneziano-type formula for the masses of the pseudoscalars determinedfrom a semiclassical approximation.
