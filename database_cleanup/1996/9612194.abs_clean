We compute the exact finite temperature effective action in a 0+1-dimensionalfield theory containing a topological Chern-Simons term, which has manyfeatures in common with 2+1-dimensional Chern-Simons theories. This exactresult explains the origin and meaning of puzzling temperature dependentcoefficients found in various naive perturbative computations in the higherdimensional models.
