We spell out the derivation of novel features, put forward earlier in aletter, of two dimensional gravity in the strong coupling regime, at $C_L=7$,$13$, $19$. Within the operator approach previously developed,they neatly follow from the appearence of a new cosmological term/marginaloperator, different from the standard weak-coupling one, that determines theworld sheet interaction. The corresponding string susceptibility is obtainedand found real contrary to the continuation of the KPZ formula. Stronglycoupled (topological like) models---only involving zero-mode degrees offreedom---are solved up to sixth order, using the ward identities which followfrom the dependence upon the new cosmological constant. They are technicallysimilar to the weakly coupled ones, which reproduce the matrix model results,but gravity and matter quantum numbers are entangled differently.
