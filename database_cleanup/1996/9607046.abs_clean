It is shown that the scaling operators in the conformal limit of atwo-dimensional field theory have massive form factors which obey a simplefactorisation property in rapidity space. This has been used to identify suchoperators within the form factor bootstrap approach. A sum rule which yieldsthe scaling dimension of such operators is also derived.
