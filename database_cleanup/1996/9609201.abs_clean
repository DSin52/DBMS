Title: Negative modes around Einstein-Yang-Mills sphalerons and black holes

Comments: 19 pp, LaTeX, epsf, 2 postscript figures, Published in "Geometry and

Integrable Models", Eds. P.N. Pyatov \& S.N.Solodukhin, World Scientific1996, pp. 55-77The dynamics of small perturbations around sphaleron and black hole solutionsin the Einstein-Yang-Mills theory for the gauge group $SU(2)$ is investigated.The perturbations can be split into the two independent sectors in accordancewith their parity; each sector contains negative modes. The even-paritynegative modes are shown to correspond to the negative second variations of theheight of the potential energy barrier near the sphaleron. For the odd-paritysector, the existence of precisely $n$ (the number of nodes of the sphaleronsolution gauge field function) negative modes is rigorously proven. The sameresults hold for the Einstein-Yang-Mills black holes as well.
