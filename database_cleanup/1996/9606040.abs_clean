It is argued that every Calabi-Yau manifold $X$ with a mirror $Y$ admits afamily of supersymmetric toroidal 3-cycles. Moreover the moduli space of suchcycles together with their flat connections is precisely the space $Y$. Themirror transformation is equivalent to T-duality on the 3-cycles. The geometryof moduli space is addressed in a general framework. Several examples arediscussed.
