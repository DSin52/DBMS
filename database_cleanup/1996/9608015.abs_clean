We generalize central-charge relations and differential identities of N=2Special Geometry to N extended supergravity in any dimension 4 \leq D <10,and p-extended objects. We study the extremization of the ADM mass per unitof p-volume of BPS extended objects. Runaway solutions for a ``dilaton''degree of freedom leading to a vanishing result are interpreted as BPSextremal states having vanishing Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy.
