The comultiplication formula for fusion products of untwisted representationsof the chiral algebra is generalised to include arbitrary twistedrepresentations. We show that the formulae define a tensor product withsuitable properties, and determine the analogue of Zhu's algebra for arbitrarytwisted representations.As an example we study the fusion of representations of the Ramond sector ofthe N=1 and N=2 superconformal algebra. In the latter case, certain subtletiesarise which we describe in detail.
