We present non-extreme generalisations of intersecting p-brane solutions ofeleven-dimensional supergravity which upon toroidal compactification reduce tonon-extreme static black holes in dimensions D=4, D=5 and 5<D<10, parameterizedby four, three and two charges, respectively. The D=4 black holes are obtainedeither from non-extreme configuration of three intersecting five-branes with aboost along the common string or from non-extreme intersecting system of twotwo-branes and two five-branes. The D=5 black holes arise from threeintersecting two-branes or from a system of intersecting two-brane andfive-brane with a boost along the common string. Five-brane and two-brane witha boost along one direction reduce to black holes in D=6 and D=9, respectively,while D=7 black hole can be interpreted in terms of non-extreme configurationof two intersecting two-branes. We discuss the expressions for thecorresponding masses and entropies.
