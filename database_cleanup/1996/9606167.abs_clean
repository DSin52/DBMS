Proceedings of the 2nd Sakharov Conference, Moscow, May 1996Two-dimensional QED with N-flavor fermions serves as a model of quarkdynamics in QCD as well as an effective theory of an anti-ferromagnetic spinchain. It is reduced to N-degree quantum mechanics in which a potential isself-consistently determined by the Schr\"odinger equation itself.
