Title: Spacetime models, fundamental interactions and noncommutative geometry

Authors: Jan Sladkowski

We discuss the problem of determining the spacetime structure. We show thatwhen we are using only topological methods the spacetime can be modelled as anR- or Q-compact space although the R-compact spaces seem to be moreappropriate. Demanding the existence of a differential structure substantiallynarrows the choice of possible models. The determination of the differentialstructure may be difficult if it is not unique. By using the noncommutativegeometry construction of the standard model we show that fundamentalinteractions determine the spacetime in the class of R-compact spaces. Fermionsare essential for the process of determining the spacetime structure.
