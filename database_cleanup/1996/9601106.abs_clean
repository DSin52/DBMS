Title: On Duality of Two-dimensional Ising Model on Finite Lattice

Theoretical Physics, Kiev)Comments: 18 pages, LaTeX

It is shown that the partition function of the 2d Ising model on the dualfinite lattice with periodical boundary conditions is expressed through somespecific combination of the partition functions of the model on the torus withcorresponding boundary conditions. The generalization of the duality relationsfor the nonhomogeneous case is given. These relations are proved for theweakly-nonhomogeneous distribution of the coupling constants for the finitelattice of arbitrary sizes. Using the duality relations for the nonhomogeneousIsing model, we obtain the duality relations for the two-point correlationfunction on the torus, the 2d Ising model with magnetic fields applied to theboundaries and the 2d Ising model with free, fixed and mixed boundaryconditions.
