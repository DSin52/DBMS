We compute the boundary scattering amplitudes of the breathers of thesupersymmetric sine-Gordon model using the fusion of the soliton-antisolitonpair scattering with the boundary with a known result of the soliton boundaryscattering amplitudes. We also solve the boundary Yang-Baxter equation of theeight-vertex free fermion models to find the boundary reflection matrices. Theformer result is confirmed by the latter since the bulk $S$-matrices of thebreathers can be identified with the trigonometric limit of the Boltzmannweights of the free fermion models. Our dual approach can answer a few quesionson the relationships between the free parameters in the boundary potential andthose in the scattering amplitudes.
