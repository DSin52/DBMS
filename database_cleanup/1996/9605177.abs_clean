The purpose of this Letter is to present a computation of the interactionenergy of gauged O(3) Chern-Simons vortices which are infinitely separated. Theresults will show the behaviour of the interaction energy as a function of theconstant coupling the potential, which measures the relative strength of thematter self-coupling and the electromagnetic coupling. We find that vorticesattract each other for $\lambda > 1 $ and repel when $\lambda < 1 $. When$\lambda =1 $ there is a topological lower bound on the energy. It is possibleto saturate the bound if the fields satisfy a set of first order partialdifferential equations.
