We shall discuss various kinds of geometric bremsstrahlung processes in thespatially flat Robertson-Walker universe. Despite that the temperature of theuniverse is much higher than particle masses and the Hubble parameter, thetransition probability of these processes do not vanish. It is also pointed outthat explicit forms of the probability possess a new duality with respect toscale factor of background geometry.
