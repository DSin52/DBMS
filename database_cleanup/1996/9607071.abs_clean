We consider families of geometries of D--dimensional space, described by afinite number of parameters. Starting from the De Witt metric we extract aunique integration measure which turns out to be a geometric invariant, i.e.independent of the gauge fixed metric used for describing the geometries. Themeasure is also invariant in form under an arbitrary change of parametersdescribing the geometries. We prove the existence of geometries for which thereare no related gauge fixing surfaces orthogonal to the gauge fibers. Theadditional functional integration on the conformal factor makes the measureindependent of the free parameter intervening in the De Witt metric. Thedeterminants appearing in the measure are mathematically well defined eventhough technically difficult to compute.
