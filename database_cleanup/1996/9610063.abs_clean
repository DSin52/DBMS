Title: Cosmic Strings and Black Holes

Comments: 28 pages, Latex. 5 figures not included. For the proceedings of

"String Gravity", Paris, France, June 1996 and the e-proceedings of"Non-Equilibrium Phase Transitions", Santa Fe, New Mexico, July 1996In the first part of this talk, I consider some exact string solutions incurved spacetimes. In curved spacetimes with a Killing vector (timelike orspacelike), the string equations of motion and constraints are reduced to theHamilton equations of a relativistic point-particle in a scalar potential, byimposing a particular ansatz. As special examples I consider circular stringsin axially symmetric spacetimes, as well as stationary strings in stationaryspacetimes. In the second part of the talk, I then consider in more detail thestationary strings in the Kerr -Newman geometry. It is shown that theworld-sheet of a stationary string, that passes the static limit of the 4-DKerr-Newman black hole, describes a 2-D black hole. Mathematical results for2-D black holes can therefore be applied to physical objects; (say) cosmicstrings in the vicinity of Kerr black holes. As an immediate general result, itfollows that the string modes are thermally excited.
