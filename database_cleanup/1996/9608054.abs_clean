We study the low-energy effective theory in N=2 super Yang-Mills theories bymicroscopic and exact approaches. We calculate the one-instanton correction tothe prepotential for any simple Lie group from the microscopic approach. Wealso study the Picard-Fuchs equations and their solutions in the semi-classical regime for classical gauge groups with rank r \leq 3. We find thatfor gauge groups G=A_r, B_r, C_r (r \leq 3) the microscopic results agree withthose from the exact solutions.
