We present a detailed account of the isomonodromic quantization ofdimensionally reduced Einstein gravity with two commuting Killing vectors. Thistheory constitutes an integrable ``midi-superspace" version of quantum gravitywith infinitely many interacting physical degrees of freedom. The canonicaltreatment is based on the complete separation of variables in the isomonodromicsectors of the model. The Wheeler-DeWitt and diffeomorphism constraints arethereby reduced to the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations for $SL(2,R)$. Thephysical states are shown to live in a well defined Hilbert space and aremanifestly invariant under the full diffeomorphism group. An infinite set ofindependent observables \`a la Dirac exists both at the classical and thequantum level. Using the discrete unitary representations of $SL(2,R)$, weconstruct explicit quantum states. However, satisfying the additionalconstraints associated with the coset space $SL(2,R)/SO(2)$ requires solutionsbased on the principal series representations, which are not yet known. Webriefly discuss the possible implications of our results for string theory.
