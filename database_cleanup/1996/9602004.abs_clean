Title: Unification of Spacetime Symmetries of Massive and Massless Particles

Comments: 7 pages,LaTeX,based on a talk presented at the 2nd German-Polish

Symposium on New Ideas in the Theory of Fundamental Interactions (Zakopane,Poland, September 11-15, 1995)Journal-ref: Acta Phys.Polon. B27 (1996) 2741-2746

The internal space-time symmetries of relativistic particles are dictated byWigner's little groups. The $O(3)$-like little group for a massive particle atrest and the $E(2)$-like little group of a massless particle are two differentmanifestations of the same covariant little group. Likewise, the quark modeland parton pictures are two different manifestations of the one covariantentity.
