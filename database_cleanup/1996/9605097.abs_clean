We analyse boundary conformal field theories on random surfaces using theconformal gauge approach of David, Distler and Kawai. The crucial point is thechoice of boundary conditions on the Liouville field. We discuss the Weylanomaly cancellation for Polyakov`s non-critical open bosonic string withNeumann, Dirichlet and free boundary conditions. Dirichlet boundary conditionson the Liouville field imply that the metric is discontinuous as the boundaryis approached. We consider the semi-classical limit and argue how it singlesout the free boundary conditions on the Liouville field. We define the openstring susceptibility, the anomalous gravitational scaling dimensions and a newYang-Mills Feynman mass critical exponent.
