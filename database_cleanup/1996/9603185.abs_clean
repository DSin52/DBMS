The scattering problem under the influence of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB)potential is reconsidered. By solving the Lippmann-Schwinger (LS) equation weobtain the wave function of the scattering state in this system. In spite ofworking with a plane wave as an incident wave we obtain the same wave functionas was given by Aharonov and Bohm. Another method to solve the scatteringproblem is given by making use of a modified version of Gordon's idea which wasinvented to consider the scattering by the Coulomb potential. These two methodsgive the same result, which guarantees the validity of taking an incident planewave as usual to make an analysis of this scattering problem. The scatteringproblem by a solenoid of finite radius is also discussed, and we find that thevector potential of the solenoid affects the charged particles even when themagnitude of the flux is an odd integer as well as noninteger. It is shown thatthe unitarity of the $S$ matrix holds provided that a plane wave is taken to bean incident one.
