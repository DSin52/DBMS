Title: Towards a loop representation of connection theories defined over a

super Lie algebraAuthors: L.F. Urrutia (Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana-I, Universidad

Nacional Autonoma de Mexico)Comments: 35 pages, LATEX, aipproc style Based on the lectures given at the

Fifth Workshop on Particles and Fields, Puebla, Nov. 1995The purpose of this contribution is to review some aspects of the loop spaceformulation of pure gauge theories having the connection defined over a Liealgebra. The emphasis is focused on the discussion of the Mandelstamidentities, which provide the basic constraints upon both the classical and thequantum degrees of freedom of the theory. In the case where the connection isextended to be valued on a super Lie algebra, some new results are presentedwhich can be considered as first steps towards the construction of theMandelstam identities in this situation, which encompasses such interestingcases as supergravity in $3+1$ dimensions together with $2+1$ superChern-Simons theories, for example. Also, these ideas could be useful in theloop space formulation of fully supersymmetric theories.
