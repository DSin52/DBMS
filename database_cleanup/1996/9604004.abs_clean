We analyze the possible soft breaking of $N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Millstheory with and without matter flavour preserving the analyticity properties ofthe Seiberg-Witten solution. For small supersymmetry breaking parameter withrespect to the dynamical scale of the theory we obtain an exact expression forthe effective potential. We describe in detail the onset of the confinementtransition and some of the patterns of chiral symmetry breaking. If weextrapolate the results to the limit where supersymmetry decouples, we obtainhints indicating that perhaps a description of the QCD vacuum will require theuse of Lagrangians containing simultaneously mutually non-local degrees offreedom (monopoles and dyons).
