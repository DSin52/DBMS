Generalizing the concept of primary fields, we find a new representation ofthe Virasoro algebra, which we call it a pseudo-conformal representation. Inspecial cases, this representation reduces to ordinary- orlogarithmic-conformal field theory. There are, however, other cases in whichthe Green functions differ from those of ordinary- or logarithmic-conformalfield theories. This representation is parametrized by two matrices. Weclassify these two matrices, and calculate some of the correlators for a simpleexample.
