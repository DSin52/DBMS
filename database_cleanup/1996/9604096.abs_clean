We analyze the behaviour of moduli fields in string effective models betweenthe end of inflation and reheating. The effective moduli potential during thisera is derived for a class of simple models. We argue that this potentialsignificantly stabilizes the modulus at its high energy minimum, if somerestrictions on modular weights are met. Two mechanisms to further stabilizeminima at a point of enhanced symmetry, and the smooth transition from high tolow energy minimum by an effective mass term C^2 H^2. For both cases we presentexplicit examples, and C^2 is found to be O(10) at most. In addition, we showthat during a smooth transition the reduction of the modulus amplitude stronglydepends on the shape of the low energy potential.
