We study the nonrelativistic limit of the quantum theory of a real scalarfield with quartic self-interaction. The two body scattering amplitude iswritten in such way as to separate the contributions of high and low energyintermediary states. From this result and the two loop computation of the selfenergy correction, we determine an effective nonrelativistic action.
