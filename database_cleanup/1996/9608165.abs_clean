Confinement, and Chaos, Paris, France, 3-8 Jun 1996We discuss the relationship between the boundary conditions of theSchwinger-Dyson equations and the phase diagram of a bosonic field theory ormatrix model. In the thermodynamic limit, many boundary conditions lead to thesame solution, while other boundary conditions have no such limit. The list ofboundary conditions for which a thermodynamic limit exists depends on theparameters of the theory. The boundary conditions of a physical solution may bequite exotic, corresponding to path integration over various inequivalentcomplex contours.
