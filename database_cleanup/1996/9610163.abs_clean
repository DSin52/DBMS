We study the cosmological constant problem in a three-dimensional N=2supergravity theory with gauge group SU[2]_{global}xU[1]_{local}. The model weconsider is known to admit string-like configurations, the so-called semi-localcosmic strings. We show that the stability of these solutions is provided bysupersymmetry through the existence of a lower bound for the energy, eventhough the manifold of the Higgs vacuum does not contain non-contractibleloops. Charged Killing spinors do exist over configurations that saturate theBogomolnyi bound, as a consequence of an Aharonov-Bohm-like effect.Nevertheless, there are no physical fermionic zero modes on these backgrounds.The exact vanishing of the cosmological constant does not imply, then,Bose-Fermi degeneracy. This provides a non-trivial example of the recent claimmade by Witten on the vanishing of the cosmological constant in threedimensions without unphysical degeneracies.
