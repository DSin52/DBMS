Title: Shift Operator for Nonabelian Lattice Current Algebra

Authors: L. Faddeev, A. Yu. Volkov

Comments: 11 pages, LATEX

The shift operator for a quantum lattice current algebra associated withsl(2) is produced in the form of product of local factors. This gives a naturaldeformation of the Sugawara construction for discrete space-time.
