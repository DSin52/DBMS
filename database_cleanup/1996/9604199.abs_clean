We provide a unified construction of the symplectic forms which arise in thesolution of both N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories and soliton equations.Their phase spaces are Jacobian-type bundles over the leaves of a foliation ina universal configuration space. On one hand, imbedded into finite-gapsolutions of soliton equations, these symplectic forms assume explicitexpressions in terms of the auxiliary Lax pair, expressions which generalizethe well-known Gardner-Faddeev-Zakharov bracket for KdV to a vast class of 2Dintegrable models; on the other hand, they determine completely the effectiveLagrangian and BPS spectrum when the leaves are identified with the modulispace of vacua of an N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory. For SU($N_c$) with$N_f\leq N_c+1$ flavors, the spectral curves we obtain this way agree with theones derived by Hanany and Oz and others from physical considerations.
