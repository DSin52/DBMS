We show that a class of 3+1 dimensional Friedmann-Robertson-Walkercosmologies can be embedded within a variety of solutions of string theory. Insome realizations the apparent singularities associated with the big bang orbig crunch are resolved at non-singular horizons of higher-dimensionalquasi-black hole solutions (with compactified real time); in othersplausibly they are resolved at D-brane bound states having no conventionalspace-time interpretation.
