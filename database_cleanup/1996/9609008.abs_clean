We show that coarse graining arguments invented for the analysis ofmulti-spin systems on a randomly triangulated surface apply also to the O(n)model on a random lattice. These arguments imply that if the model has acritical point with diverging string susceptibility, then either \g=+1/2 orthere exists a dual critical point with negative string susceptibilityexponent, \g', related to \g by \g=\g'/(\g'-1). Exploiting the exact solutionof the O(n) model on a random lattice we show that both situations are realizedfor n>2 and that the possible dual pairs of string susceptibility exponents aregiven by (\g',\g)=(-1/m,1/(m+1)), m=2,3,.... We also show that at the criticalpoints with positive string susceptibility exponent the average number of loopson the surface diverges while the average length of a single loop stays finite.
