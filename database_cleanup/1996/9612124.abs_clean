Title: Direct Interactions in Relativistic Statistical Mechanics

Comments: Plain Tex file, 26 pages

Directly interacting particles are considered in the multitime formalism ofpredictive relativistic mechanics. When the equations of motion leave aphase-space volume invariant, it turns out that the phase average of any firstintegral, covariantly defined as a flux across a $7n$-dimensional surface, isconserved. The Hamiltonian case is discussed, a class of simple models isexhibited, and a tentative definition of equilibrium is proposed.
