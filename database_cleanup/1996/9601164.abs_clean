U duality transformations must act on a basis of states that form completemultiplets of the U group, at any coupling, even though the states may not bemass degenerate, as for a broken symmetry. Similarly, if superstring theory isrelated to a non-perturbative 11D M-theory, then an 11D supermultipletstructure is expected, even though the multiplet may contain states ofdifferent masses. We analyse the consistency between these two multipletschemes at the higher excited string levels for various compactifications ofthe type IIA superstring. While we find complete consistency for a number ofcompactifications, there remain some unanswered questions in others. Therelation to D-branes also needs further clarification.
