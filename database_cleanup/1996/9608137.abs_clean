Title: D-branes, Black Holes and $SU(\infty)$ Gauge Theory

Comments: 4 pages, latex. Invited talk at the Second International Sakharov

Conference on Physics, Moscow, May 1996We discuss an application of the known in QCD large $N$ expansion to stringsand supermembranes in the strong coupling. In particular we use the recentlyobtained master field describing $ SU(\infty)$ gauge theory to argue thatquantum extreme black holes obey quantum Boltzmann (infinite) statistics. Thissupports a topological argument by Strominger that black holes obey infinitestatistics. We also speculate on a formulation of $X$-theory of strings andp-branes as theory of Grothendieck's motives. The partition function isexpressed in terms of $L$-function of a motive. The Beilinson conjectures onthe values of $L$-functions are interpreted as dealing with the cosmologicalconstant problem.
