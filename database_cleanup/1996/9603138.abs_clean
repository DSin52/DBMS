We study the $SU(2)_k/U(1)$-parafermion model perturbed by its first thermaloperator. By formulating the theory in terms of a (perturbed) fermionic cosetmodel we show that the model is equivalent to interacting WZW fields modulofree fields. In this scheme, the order and disorder operators of the $Z_k$parafermion theory are constructed as gauge invariant composites. We find thatthe theory presents a duality symmetry that interchanges the roles of the spinand dual spin operators. For two particular values of the coupling constant wefind that the theory recovers conformal invariance and the gauge symmetry isenlarged. We also find a novel self-dual point.
