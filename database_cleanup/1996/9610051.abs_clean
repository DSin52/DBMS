Comments: 16 pages, latex, no figures; two important early references on the

coset construction have been included; to appear in Mod. Phys. LettJournal-ref: Int.J.Mod.Phys. A12 (1997) 4291-4307

The conformal field theory on a Z_N-surface is studied by mapping it on thebranched sphere. Using a coulomb gas formalism we construct the minimal modelsof the theory.
