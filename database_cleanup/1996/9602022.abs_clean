We construct compact examples of D-manifolds for type IIB strings. Theconstruction has a natural interpretation in terms of compactification of a 12dimensional `F-theory'. We provide evidence for a more natural reformulation oftype IIB theory in terms of F-theory. Compactification of M-theory on amanifold $K$ which admits elliptic fibration is equivalent to compactificationof F-theory on $K\times S^1$. A large class of $N=1$ theories in 6 dimensionsare obtained by compactification of F-theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds. A classof phenomenologically promising compactifications of F-theory is on $Spin(7)$holonomy manifolds down to 4 dimensions. This may provide a concreterealization of Witten's proposal for solving the cosmological constant problemin four dimensions.
