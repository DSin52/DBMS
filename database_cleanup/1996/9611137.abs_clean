correctedThe primary purpose of these lecture notes is to explore the moduli space oftype IIA, type IIB, and heterotic string compactified on a K3 surface. The maintool which is invoked is that of string duality. K3 surfaces provide afascinating arena for string compactification as they are not trivial spacesbut are sufficiently simple for one to be able to analyze most of theirproperties in detail. They also make an almost ubiquitous appearance in thecommon statements concerning string duality. We review the necessary factsconcerning the classical geometry of K3 surfaces that will be needed and thenwe review "old string theory" on K3 surfaces in terms of conformal fieldtheory. The type IIA string, the type IIB string, the E8 x E8 heterotic string,and Spin(32)/Z2 heterotic string on a K3 surface are then each analyzed inturn. The discussion is biased in favour of purely geometric notions concerningthe K3 surface itself. These are an extended form of the notes from lecturesgiven at TASI 96.
