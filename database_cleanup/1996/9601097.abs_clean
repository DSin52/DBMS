We consider the low-energy dynamics of a pair of distinct fundamentalmonopoles that arise in the $N=4$ supersymmetric $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theorybroken to $U(1)\times U(1)$. Both the long distance interactions and the shortdistance behavior indicate that the moduli space is $R^3\times(R^1 \times {\calM}_0)/Z$ where ${\cal M}_0$ is the smooth Taub-NUT manifold, and we confirmthis rigorously. By examining harmonic forms on the moduli space, we find athreshold bound state of two monopoles with a tower of BPS dyonic states builton it, as required by Montonen-Olive duality. We also present a conjecture forthe metric of the moduli space for any number of distinct fundamental monopolesfor an arbitrary gauge group.
