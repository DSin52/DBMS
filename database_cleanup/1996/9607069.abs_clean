Authors: Takesi Saito, Kunihiko Uehara

Comments: 14 pages, LaTeX file. Change in title and minor changes in content

We apply the gauge theory on $M_4\times Z_2$ geometry previously proposed byKonisi and Saito to the Weinberg-Salam model for electroweak interactions,especially in order to clarify the geometrical meaning of curvatures in thisgeometry. Considering the Higgs field to be a gauge field along $Z_2$direction, we also discuss the BRST invariant gauge fixing in this theory.
