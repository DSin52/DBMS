In this paper we study the motion of a rigidly rotating Nambu-Goto teststring in a stationary axisymmetric background spacetime. As special exampleswe consider the rigid rotation of strings in flat spacetime, where explicitanalytic solutions can be obtained, and in the Kerr spacetime where we find aninteresting new family of test string solutions. We present a detailedclassification of these solutions in the Kerr background.
