The Narain lattice construction of string compactifications is generalized toinclude spontaneously broken supersymmetry. Consistency conditions from modularinvariance and Lorentz symmetry are solved in full generality. This frameworkincorporates models where supersymmetry breaking is inversely proportional tothe radii of compact dimensions. The enhanced lattice description, however,might allow for models with a different geometrical or even non-geometricalinterpretation.
