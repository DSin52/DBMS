We consider low energy, non-relativistic scattering of two Dirichletzero-branes as an exercise in quantum mechanics. For weak string coupling andsufficiently small velocity, the dynamics is governed by an effective U(2)gauge theory in 0+1 dimensions. At low energies, D-brane scattering canreliably probe distances much shorter than the string scale. The only lengthscale in the quantum mechanics problem is the eleven dimensional Planck length.This provides evidence for the role of scales shorter than the string length inthe weakly coupled dynamics of type IIA strings.
