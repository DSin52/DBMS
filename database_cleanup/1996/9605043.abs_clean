We use soliton techniques of the two-dimensional reduced beta-functionequations to obtain non-trivial string backgrounds from flat space. Thesesolutions are characterized by two integers (n, m) referring to the solitonnumbers of the metric and axion-dilaton sectors respectively. We show that theNappi-Witten universe associated with the SL(2) x SU(2) / SO(1, 1) x U(1) CFTcoset arises as an (1, 1) soliton in this fashion for certain values of themoduli parameters, while for other values of the soliton moduli we arrive atthe SL(2)/SO(1, 1) x SO(1, 1)^2 background. Ordinary 4-dim black-holes arise as2-dim (2, 0) solitons, while the Euclidean worm-hole background is described asa (0, 2) soliton on flat space. The soliton transformations correspond tospecific elements of the string Geroch group. These could be used as startingpoint for exploring the role of U-dualities in string compactifications to twodimensions.
