Title: Geometrical Structures of M-Theory

Comments: 19 pages, latex

N=(2,1) heterotic string theory provides clues about hidden structure inM-theory related to string duality; in effect it geometrizes some aspects ofduality. The program whereby one may deduce this hidden structure is outlined,together with the results obtained to date. Speculations are made as to theeventual shape of the theory. Talk presented at Strings '96 (Santa Barbara,July 20-25, 1996).
