We consider Dynamical Supersymmetry Breaking (DSB) in models with classicalflat directions. We analyze a number of examples, and develop a systematicapproach to determine if classical flat directions are stabilized in the fullquantum theory, or lead to run-away behavior. In some cases pseudo-flatdirections remain even at the quantum level before taking into accountcorrections to the K\"ahler potential. We show that in certain limits thesecorrections are calculable. In particular, we find that in theIntriligator-Thomas $SU(2)$ and its generalizations, a potential for moduli isgenerated. Moreover, there is a region of the parameter space where K\"ahlerpotential corrections lead to calculable (local) minima at large but finitedistance from the origin.
