We study orbifold compactifications of F-theory which lead to $N=1$supersymmetry in 6 and 4 spacetime dimensions. These are dual to specificorientifolds of M-theory, and in many cases to orientifolds of type IIB stringtheory. The equivalences are demonstrated by mapping the orbifoldingtransformations in the F, M and string theories to each other using dualities.We observe that M and F-theory appear to possess a property similar to discretetorsion in string theory. This is related to an ambiguity recently noted byPolchinski in the orientifold projection for 6-dimensional models. The4-dimensional compactifications exhibit similar features, from which we predictthe existence of certain new orientifolds of type IIB. Some orbifolds withhigher supersymmetry are also examined.
