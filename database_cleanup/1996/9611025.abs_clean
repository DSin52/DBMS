LaTeX, 4 pages, 3 epsf figures, includes modified stwol.sty file. Somereferences were revisedA new method is applied to solve the Baxter equation for the one dimensionalsystem of noncompact spins. Dynamics of such an ensemble is equivalent to thatof a set of reggeized gluons exchanged in the high energy limit of QCDamplitudes. The technique offers more insight into the old calculation of theintercept of hard Pomeron, and provides new results in the odderon channel.
