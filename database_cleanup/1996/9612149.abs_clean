In this article we show in some detail how the full action functional of thestandard model of elementary particle physics can be described within thegeometrical setting of generalized Dirac operators. We thereby introduce a newmodel building kit for (a certain class of) gauge invariant theories whichprovides a unified geometrical description of Einstein's theory of gravity andYang-Mills gauge theories on the "classical" level. Moreover, when the gaugesymmetry is spontaneously broken, the Higgs sector as well has a naturalgeometrical interpretation. It turns out that the Higgs field is related to thegravitational potential.Since the full action functional of the standard model is derived in onestroke, the appropriate parameters of the model have to satisfy certainrelations similar to those in the Connes-Lott approach. Likewise, this mayyield some phenomenological consequences, which is illustrated by using thegauge group of the standard model in the case of $N-$generations of leptons andquarks.
