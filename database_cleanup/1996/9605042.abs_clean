200-209Open descendants extend Conformal Field Theory to unoriented surfaces withboundaries. The construction rests on two types of generalizations of thefusion algebra. The first is needed even in the relatively simple case ofdiagonal models. It leads to a new tensor that satisfies the fusion algebra,but whose entries are signed integers. The second is needed when dealing withnon-diagonal models, where Cardy's ansatz does not apply. It leads to a newtensor with positive integer entries, that satisfies a set of polynomialequations and encodes the classification of the allowed boundary operators.
