The sum of all ladder and rainbow diagrams in $\phi^3$ theory near 6dimensions leads to self-consistent higher order differential equations incoordinate space which are not particularly simple for arbitrary dimension D.We have now succeeded in solving these equations, expressing the results interms of generalized hypergeometric functions; the expansion and representationof these functions can then be used to prove the absence of renormalizationfactors which are transcendental for this theory and this topology to allorders in perturbation theory. The correct anomalous scaling dimensions of theGreen functions are also obtained in the six-dimensional limit.
