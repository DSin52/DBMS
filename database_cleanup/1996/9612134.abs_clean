We consider the close relation between duality in N=2 SUSY gauge theories andintegrable models. Various integrable models ranging from Toda lattices,Calogero models, spinning tops, and spin chains are related to the quantummoduli space of vacua of N=2 SUSY gauge theories. In particular, SU(3) gaugetheories with two flavors of massless quarks in the fundamental representationcan be related to the spectral curve of the Goryachev-Chaplygin top, which isa Nahm's equation in disguise. This can be generalized to the cases withmassive quarks, and N_f = 0,1,2, where a system with seven dimensional phasespace has the relevant hyperelliptic curve appear in the Painlev\'e test. Tounderstand the stringy origin of the integrability of these theories we obtainexact nonperturbative point particle limit of type II string compactified on aCalabi-Yau manifold, which gives the hyperelliptic curve of SU(2) QCD withN_f=1 hypermultiplet.
