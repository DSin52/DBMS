We consider SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in 1+1 dimensions coupled to masslessadjoint fermions. With all fields in the adjoint representation the gauge groupis actually SU(2)/Z_2, which possesses nontrivial topology. In particular,there are two distinct topological sectors and the physical vacuum state has astructure analogous to a \theta vacuum. We show how this feature is realized inlight-front quantization, using discretization of x^- as an infrared regulator.We find exact expressions for the vacuum states and construct the analog of the\theta vacuum. We calculate the bilinear condensate of the model. We argue thatthis condensate does not effect the spectrum of the massless theory but givesthe string tenson of the massive theory.
