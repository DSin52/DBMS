Following on from earlier work relating modules of meromorphic bosonicconformal field theories to states representing solutions of certain simpleequations inside the theories, we show, in the context of orbifold theories,that the intertwiners between twisted sectors are unique and describedexplicitly in terms of the states corresponding to the relevant modules. Noexplicit knowledge of the structure of the twisted sectors is required.Further, we propose a general set of sufficiency conditions, illustrated in thecontext of a third order no-fixed-point twist of a lattice theory, forverifying consistency of arbitrary orbifold models in terms of the statesrepresenting the twisted sectors.
