Title: M Theory Extensions of T Duality

Comments: 13 pages, latex2e, 3 figures included; for Kikkawa's 60th Birthday

T duality expresses the equivalence of a superstring theory compactified on amanifold K to another (possibly the same) superstring theory compactified on adual manifold K'. The volumes of K and K' are inversely proportional. In thiscompactified on a torus is equivalent to type IIB superstring theorycompactified on a circle and (ii) M theory compactified on a cylinder isequivalent to SO(32) superstring theory compactified on a circle. In both casesthe size of the circle is proportional to the -3/4 power of the area of thedual manifold.
