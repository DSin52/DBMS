a Confining ModelAstronomy, The University of Kansas, Lawrence)Journal-ref: Phys.Rev. D55 (1997) 2455-2463

We solve the Dyson--Schwinger equation for the quark propagator in a modelwith singular infrared behavior for the gluon propagator. We require that thesolutions, easily found in configuration space, be tempered distributions andthus have Fourier transforms. This severely limits the boundary conditions thatthe solutions may satisify. The sign of the dimensionful parameter thatcharacterizes the model gluon propagator can be either positive or negative. Ifthe sign is negative, we find a unique solution. It is singular at the originin momentum space, falls off like $1/p^2$ as $p^2\rightarrow +/-\infty$, and itis truly nonperturbative in that it is singular in the limit that thegluon--quark interaction approaches zero. If the sign of the gluon propagatorcoefficient is positive, we find solutions that are, in a sense that weexhibit, unconstrained linear combinations of advanced and retardedpropagators. These solutions are singular at the origin in momentum space, falloff like $1/p^2$ asympotically, exhibit ``resonant--like" behavior at theposition of the bare mass of the quark when the mass is large compared to thedimensionful interaction parameter in the gluon propagator model, and smoothlyapproach a linear combination of free--quark, advanced and retarded two--pointfunctions in the limit that the interaction approaches zero. In this sense,these solutions behave in an increasingly ``particle--like" manner as the quarkbecomes heavy. The Feynman propagator and the Wightman function are nottempered distributions and therefore are not acceptable solutions to theSchwinger--Dyson equation in our model. On this basis we advance severalarguments to show that the Fourier--transformable solutions we find areconsistent with quark confinement, even though they have singularities on the
