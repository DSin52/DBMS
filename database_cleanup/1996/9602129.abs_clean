We calculate the entropies of the system of classical particles and a quantumscalar field by using the brick wall method in thermal bath in a charged Kerrblack hole spacetime. Their leading terms at Hartle-Hawking temperature $T_H =\kappa/(2 \pi) $ are given by $ S_{cl} \approx N \ \ln \left(\frac{A_b}{\epsilon^2} \right)$, and $S \approx N' \frac{A_H}{\epsilon^2}$,where $A_b$ and $A_H$ are the area of the box and the horizon respectively.
