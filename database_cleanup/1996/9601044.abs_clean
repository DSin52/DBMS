Title: Applications of special geometry

Comments: LateX file, 12 pp. To appear in the proc. of the Workshop on Strings,

Gravity & Related Phenomena, Trieste, 1995We review characteristic features of N=2 supersymmetric vector multiplets anddiscuss symplectic reparametrizations and their relevance for monopoles anddyons. We close with an analysis of perturbative corrections to the low-energyeffective action of N=2 heterotic superstring vacua.
