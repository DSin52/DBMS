We give the explicit expression for four-dimensional rotating charged blackhole solutions of N=4 (or N=8) superstring vacua, parameterized by the ADMmass, four charges (two electric and two magnetic charges, each arising from adifferent U(1) gauge factors), and the angular momentum (as well as theasymptotic values of four toroidal moduli of two-torus and the dilaton-axionfield). The explicit form of the thermodynamic entropy is parameterized in asuggestive way as a sum of the product of the `left-moving' and the`right-moving' terms, which may have an interpretation in terms of themicroscopic degrees of freedom of the corresponding D-brane configuration. Wealso give an analogous parameterization of the thermodynamic entropy for therecently obtained five-dimensional rotating charged black holes parameterizedby the ADM mass, three U(1) charges and two rotational parameters (as well asthe asymptotic values of one toroidal modulus and the dilaton).
