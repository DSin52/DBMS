We analyze the perturbative implications of the most general high derivativeapproach to quantum gravity based on a diffeomorphism invariant local action.In particular, we consider the super-renormalizable case with a large number ofmetric derivatives in the action. The structure of ultraviolet divergences isanalyzed in some detail. We show that they are independent of the gauge fixingcondition and the choice of field reparametrization. The cosmologicalcounterterm is shown to vanish under certain parameter conditions. We elaborateon the unitarity problem of high derivative approaches and the distribution ofmasses of unphysical ghosts. We also discuss the properties of the low energyregime and explore the possibility of having a multi-scale gravity withdifferent scaling regimes compatible with Einstein gravity at low energies.Finally, we show that the ultraviolet scaling of matter theories is notaffected by the quantum corrections of high derivative gravity. As aconsequence, asymptotic freedom is stable under those quantum gravitycorrections.
