We examine the pair creation of black holes in the presence of supergravitydomain walls with broken and unbroken supersymmetry. We show that black holeswill be nucleated in the presence of non- extreme, repulsive walls which breakthe supersymmetry, but that as one allows the parameter measuring deviationfrom extremality to approach zero the rate of creation will be suppressed. Inparticular, we show that the probability for creation of black holes in thepresence of an extreme domain wall is identically zero, even though an extremevacuum domain wall still has repulsive gravitational energy. This is consistentwith the fact that the supersymmetric, extreme domain wall configurations areBPS states and should be stable against quantum corrections. We discuss howthese walls arise in string theory, and speculate about what string theorymight tell us about such objects.
