We study the correlation functions of logarithmic conformal field theories.First, assuming conformal invariance, we explicitly calculate two-- and three--point functions. This calculation is done for the general case of more than onelogarithmic field in a block, and more than one set of logarithmic fields. Thenwe show that one can regard the logarithmic field as a formal derivative of theordinary field with respect to its conformal weight. This enables one tocalculate any $n$-- point function containing the logarithmic field in terms ofordinary $n$--point functions. At last, we calculate the operator productexpansion (OPE) coefficients of a logarithmic conformal field theory, and showthat these can be obtained from the corresponding coefficients of ordinaryconformal theory by a simple derivation.
