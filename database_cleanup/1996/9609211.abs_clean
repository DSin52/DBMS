We show the complete cancellation of gauge and gravitational anomalies in theM-theory of Horava and Witten using their boundary contribution, and a termcoming from the existence of two and five-branes. A factor of three discrepancynoted in an earlier work is resolved. We end with a comment on fluxquantization.
