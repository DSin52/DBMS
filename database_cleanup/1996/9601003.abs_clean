Effective world-brane actions for solitons of ten-dimensional type IIA andIIB superstring theory are derived using the formulation of solitons asDirichlet branes. The one-brane actions are used to recover predictions ofSL(2,Z) strong-weak coupling duality. The two-brane action, which contains ahidden eleventh target space coordinate, is shown to be the eleven-dimensionalsupermembrane action. It can be thought of as the membrane action of`M-theory'.
