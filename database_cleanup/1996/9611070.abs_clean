A renormalizable rigid supersymmetry for the four dimensional antisymmetrictensor field model in a curved space-time background is constructed. A closedalgebra between the BRS and the supersymmetry operators is only realizable ifthe vector parameter of the supersymmetry is a covariantly constant vectorfield. This also guarantees that the corresponding transformations lead to agenuine symmetry of the model. The proof of the ultraviolet finiteness to allorders of perturbation theory is performed in a pure algebraic manner by usingthe rigid supersymmetry.
