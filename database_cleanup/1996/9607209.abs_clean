Title: New index formulas as a meromorphic generalization of the

Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theoremComments: LATEX, 14 pages

Laplace operators perturbed by meromorphic potential on the Riemann andseparated type Klein surfaces are constructed and their indices are calculatedby two different ways. The topological expressions for the indices are obtainedfrom the study of spectral properties of the operators. Analytical expressionsare provided by the Heat Kernel approach in terms of the functional integrals.As a result two formulae connecting characteristics of meromorphic (realmeromorphic) functions and topological properties of Riemann (separated typeKlein) surfaces are derived.
