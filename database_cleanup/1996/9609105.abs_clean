We derive, in 2+1 dimensions, classical solutions for metric and motion oftwo or more spinning particles, in the conformal Coulomb gauge introducedpreviously. The solutions are exact in the $N$-body static case, and areperturbative in the particles' velocities in the dynamic two-body case. Anatural boundary for the existence of our gauge choice is provided by some``CTC horizons'' encircling the particles, within which closed timelike curvesoccur.
