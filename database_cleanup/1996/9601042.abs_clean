Title: A possible solution of the black hole information paradox through

quantum gravity unified with other interactionsComments: 24 pages, 8 figures, in a single compressed/encoded file

I try to argue that the only way out of the black hole information paradox isthrough a unified quantum field theory of gravity and other interactions.Superstring theory is especially interesting, since in a special limit, theclassical picture of 't Hooft emerges.
