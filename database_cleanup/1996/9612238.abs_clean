We suggest the brane interpretation of the integrable dynamics behind theexact solution to the N=2 SUSY YM theory. Degrees of freedom of the Calogerotype integrable system responsible for the appearance of the spectral Riemannsurfaces originate from the collective coordinates of the dynamical branes. Thesecond Whitham type integrable system corresponds to the low energy scatteringof branes similar to the scattering of the magnetic monopoles.
