Journal-ref: Class.Quant.Grav. 13 (1996) L87-L93

It is shown that time-harmonic hypersurface motions in various, conformallyflat, N-dimensional manifolds admit a multilinear description, dL/dt={ L, M_1,... , M_{N-2} }, automatically generating infinitely many conserved quantities,as well as leading to new (integrable) matrix equations. Interestingly, theconformal factor can be changed without changing L.
