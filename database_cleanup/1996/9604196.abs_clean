We study the different phases of field theories of compact antisymmetrictensors of rank $h-1$ in arbitrary space-time dimensions $D=d+1$. Starting in a`Coulomb' phase, topological defects of dimension $d-h-1$ ($(d-h-1)$-branes)may condense leading to a generalized `confinement' phase. If the dual theoryis also compact the model may also have a third, generalized `Higgs' phase,driven by the condensation of the dual $(h-2)$-branes. Developing on the workof Julia and Toulouse for ordered solid-state media, we obtain the low energyeffective action for these phases. Each phase has two dual descriptions interms of antisymmetric tensors of different ranks, which are massless for theCoulomb phase but massive for the Higgs and confinement phases. We illustrateour prescription in detail for compact QED in 4D. Compact QED and $O(2)$ modelsin 3D, as well as a periodic scalar field in 2D (strings on a circle), are alsodiscussed. In this last case we show how $T$-duality is maintained if oneconsiders both worldsheet instantons and their duals. We also unify variousapproaches to the problem of the axion mass in 4D string models. Finally wediscuss possible implications of our results for non-perturbative issues instring theory.
