Title: Multiscale Renormalization and Decoupling

Comments: talk given at RG96, Dubna

The standard MS renormalization prescription is inadequate for dealing withmultiscale problems. To illustrate this, we consider the computation of theeffective potential in the Higgs-Yukawa model. It is argued that the mostnatural way to deal with this problem is to introduce a 2-scale renormalizationgroup. We review various ways of implementing this idea and consider to whatextent they fit in with the notion of heavy particle decoupling.
