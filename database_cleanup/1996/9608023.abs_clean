The act of implementing non-Abelian duality in two dimensional sigma modelsresults unavoidably in an additional reducible symmetry. The Batalin-Vilkoviskyformalism is employed to handle this new symmetry. Valuable lessons are learnthere with respect to non-Abelian duality. We emphasise, in particular, theeffects of the ghost sector corresponding to this symmetry on non-Abelianduality.
