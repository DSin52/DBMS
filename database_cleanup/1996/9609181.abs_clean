We present new supersymmetric solutions of D=11 supergravity obtained byintersecting the brane configuration interpreted as a 2-brane lying within a5-brane. Some of these solutions can be boosted along a common string and/orsuperposed with a Kaluza-Klein monopole. We also present a new embedding of theextreme four dimensional dyonic black hole with finite horizon area. Thesesolutions are a consequence of a rather simple set of rules that allow us toconstruct the composite M-branes.
