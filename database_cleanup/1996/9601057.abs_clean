The scattering of R-R gauge bosons off of Dirichlet p-branes is computed toleading order in the string coupling. The results are qualitatively similar to0 exhibit stringy properties, in particular the Regge behavior. Both the R-Rand NS-NS scattering amplitudes agree in the limit of small momentum transferwith scattering off the extremal R-R charged p-brane solutions found in thelow-energy supergravities. We interpret this as evidence that Dirichlet-branesare an exact world-sheet description of the extremal p-branes. The -1-brane(D-instanton) is a special object which, unlike all other Dirichlet-branes,exhibits point-like behavior. We find the R-R charged instanton solution totype IIB supergravity and confirm that the field theoretic scattering off ofthis solution miraculously reproduces the full stringy calculation. As anaside, we include a discussion of the entropy of non-extremal black holes inten dimensions, produced by exciting the 0-brane. We show that, for large blackholes, the entropy grows linearly with the black hole mass.
