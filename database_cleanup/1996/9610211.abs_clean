Title: On Instanton Calculations of N=2 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory

Authors: Yuhsuke Yoshida

Comments: 24 pages, LaTeX, no figures

Instanton calculations are demonstrated from a viewpoint of twistedtopological field theory. Various properties become manifest such thatperturbative corrections are terminated at one-loop, and norm cancellationsoccur between bosonic and fermionic excitations in any instanton background. Wecan easily observe that for a suitable choice of Green functions the infinitedimensional path integration reduces to a finite dimensional integration over asupersymmetric instanton moduli space.
