Exact operator solution for quantum Liouville theory is investigated based onthe canonical free field. Locality, the field equation and the canonicalcommutation relations are examined based on the exchange algebra hidden in thetheory. The exact solution proposed by Otto and Weigt is shown to be correct toall order in the cosmological constant.
