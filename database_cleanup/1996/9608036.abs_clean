Title: On "Bosonic, Fermionic and Mixed" Supersymmetric 2-Dimensional

Integrable ModelsComments: LaTex file, 8 pages. Talk given at Alushta (May 1996) in "Problems

of Quantum Field Theory", to appear in the ProceedingsIt is shown that supersymmetric integrable models in two dimensions, bothrelativistic (i.e. super-Toda type theories) and non-relativistic (reductionsof super-KP hierarchies) can be associated to general Poisson-bracketsstructures given by superaffinizations of any bosonic Lie or any super-Liealgebra. This result allows enlarging the set of supersymmetric integrablemodels, which are no longer restricted to the subclass of superaffinizations ofpurely fermionic super-Lie algebras (that is admitting fermionic simple rootsonly).
