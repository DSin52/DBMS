We propose a formulation of 11-dimensional M-theory in terms of five-braneswith closed strings on their world-volume. We use this description to constructthe complete spectrum of BPS states in compactifications to six and fivedimensions. We compute the degeneracy for fixed charge and find it to be inaccordance with U-duality (which in our formulation is manifest in sixdimensions) and the statistical entropy formula of the corresponding blackhole. We also briefly comment on the four-dimensional case.
