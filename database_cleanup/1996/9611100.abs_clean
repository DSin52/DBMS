We demonstrate how a Lorentz covariant formulation of the chiral p-form modelin D=2(p+1) containing infinitely many auxiliary fields is related to a Lorentzcovariant formulation with only one auxiliary scalar field entering a chiralp-form action in a nonpolynomial way. The latter can be regarded as aconsistent Lorentz-covariant truncation of the former. We make the Hamiltoniananalysis of the model based on the nonpolynomial action and show that the Diracconstraints have a simple form and are all of the first class. In contrast tothe Siegel model the constraints are not the square of second-classconstraints. The canonical Hamiltonian is quadratic and determines energy of asingle chiral p-form. In the case of d=2 chiral scalars the constraint can beimproved by use of `twisting' procedure (without the loss of the property to beof the first class) in such a way that the central charge of the quantumconstraint algebra is zero. This points to possible absence of anomaly in anappropriate quantum version of the model.
