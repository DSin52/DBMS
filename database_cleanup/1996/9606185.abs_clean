We compute the leading order (in coupling) rate of emission of low energyquanta from a slightly nonextremal system of 1 and 5 D-branes. We also computethe classical cross-section, and hence the Hawking emission rate, for lowenergy scalar quanta for the black hole geometry that corresponds to thesebranes (at sufficiently strong coupling). These rates are found to agree witheach other.
