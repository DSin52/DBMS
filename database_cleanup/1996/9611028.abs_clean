String-inspired 1+1-dimensional gravity is coupled to Yang-Mills fields inthe Cangemi-Jackiw gauge-theoretical formulation, based on the extendedPoincar\'e group. A family of couplings, which involves metrics obtainable fromthe physical metric with a conformal rescaling, is considered, and theresulting family of models is investigated both at the classical and thequantum level. In particular, also using a series of Kirillov-Kostant phases,the wave functionals that solve the constraints are identified.
