The method of self-adjoint extensions is employed to determine the vacuumquantum numbers induced by a singular static magnetic vortex in$2+1$-dimensional spinor electrodynamics. The results obtained aregauge-invariant and, for certain values of the extension parameter, bothperiodic in the value of the vortex flux and possessing definite parity withrespect to the charge conjugation.
