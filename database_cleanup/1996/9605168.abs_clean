Using a formalism developed to include collective coordinates, we calculatethe contributions to S-matrix elements due to off-shell D-branes in a stringcoupling expansion. The formalism is further used to establish atwo-dimensional computation of higher order corrections to the D-brane tension,both for the bosonic and the supersymmetric cases.
