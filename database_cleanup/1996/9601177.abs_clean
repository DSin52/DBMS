Supersymmetric extreme dyonic black holes of toroidally compactifiedheterotic or type II string theory can be viewed as lower-dimensional images ofsolitonic strings wound around a compact dimension. We consider conformal sigmamodels which describe string configurations corresponding to various extremedyonic black holes in four and five dimensions. These conformal models haveregular short-distance region equivalent to a WZW theory with levelproportional to magnetic charges. Arguments are presented suggesting auniversal relation between the black hole entropy (area) and the statisticalentropy of BPS-saturated oscillation states of solitonic string.[Extendedversion of a talk at the Workshop "Frontiers in Quantum Field Theory", in honorof the 60th birthday of K.
