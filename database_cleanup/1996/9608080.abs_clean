We present a study of the role of fermions in the decay of metastable statesof a scalar field via bubble nucleation. We analyze both one andthree-dimensional systems by using a gradient expansion for the calculation ofthe fermionic determinant. The results of the one-dimensional case are comparedto the exact results of previous work.
