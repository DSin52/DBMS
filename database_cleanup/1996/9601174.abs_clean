The structure of the asymptotic symmetry in the Poincar\'e gauge theory ofgravity in 2d is clarified by using the Hamiltonian formalism. The improvedform of the generator of the asymptotic symmetry is found for very generalasymptotic behaviour of phase space variables, and the related conservedquantities are explicitly constructed.
