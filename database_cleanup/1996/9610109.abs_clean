We show that it is possible, in opposition to a previous conjecture, toderive a Nielsen identity for the effective action in the case of thegeneralized $R_\xi $-gauge, where the gauge function explicitly depends on thegauge parameter $\xi $. Also the Nielsen identity for the effective potentialis verified to one-loop in the Abelian Higgs model and the correspondingidentity for the physical Higgs mass is derived.
