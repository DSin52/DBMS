It has been argued that the superpotential can be renormalized in thepresence of massless particles. Possible implications which have beenconsidered include the restoration of supersymmetry at higher loops or a shiftto a supersymmetric vacuum state. We argue that even in the presence ofmassless particles, there are no new contributions to the superpotential at anyorder in perturbation theory. This confirms the utility of the Wilsoniansuperpotential for analyzing the moduli space of the low energy theory.
