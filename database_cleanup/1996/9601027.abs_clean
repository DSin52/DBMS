A supersymmetric gauge invariant action is constructed over any 4-dimensionalRiemannian manifold describing Witten's theory of 4-monopoles. The topologicalsupersymmetric algebra closes off-shell. The multiplets include the auxiliaryfields and the Wess-Zumino fields in an unusual way, arising naturally fromBRST gauge fixing. A new canonical approach over Riemann manifolds is followed,using a Morse function as an euclidean time and taking into account the BRSTboundary conditions that come from the BFV formulation. This allows aconstruction of the effective action starting from gauge principles.
