Title: About the kinematics of spinning particles

Authors: Giovanni Salesi and Erasmo Recami

Inserting the correct Lorentz factor into the definition of the 4-velocityv^mu for spinning particles entails new kinematical properties for v^2. Thewell-known constraint (identically true for scalar particles, but entering alsothe Dirac theory, and assumed a priori in all spinning particle models) p_muv^mu = m is here derived in a self-consistent way.
