Title: W_infty Structures of 2D String Theory

Comments: 12 pages, Latex

The Ward identities of the $W_{\infty}$ symmetry in 2D string theory in thetachyon background are studied in the continuum approach. Comparing thesolutions with the matrix model results, it is verified that 2D stringamplitudes are different from the matrix model amplitudes only by the externalleg factors even in higher genus. This talk is based on the recent work [1] andalso [2] for the $c_M <1$ model. (Talk given at the workshop on ``Frontiers inQuantum Field Theory'', Osaka, Japan, December 1995.)
