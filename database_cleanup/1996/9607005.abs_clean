We study all possible $U(1)$-extensions of the standard model (SM) in theframework of noncommutative geometry (NCG) with the algebra$\hhh\op\cc\op\cc\op M_3(\cc)$. Comparison to experimental data about the massof a hypothetical $Z'$ gauge boson leads to the necessity of introducing atleast one new family of heavy fermions.
