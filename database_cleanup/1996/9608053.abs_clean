Orientifolds of the type IIB superstring that descend from F theory and Mtheory orbifolds are studied perturbatively. One finds strong evidence that apreviously ignored twisted open string is required in these models. An attemptis made to interpret the $J$ type torsion in F theory where one finds arealization of Gimon and Johnson's models which does not require these twistedstrings. S-duality also provides evidence for these strings.
