The super or Z_2-graded Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket is introduced. Using it,new generalized super-Poisson structures are found which are given in terms ofcertain graded-skew-symmetric contravariant tensors \Lambda of even order. Thecorresponding super `Jacobi identities' are expressed by stating that thesetensors have zero super Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket with themselves[\Lambda,\Lambda]=0. As a particular case, we provide the linear generalizedsuper-Poisson structures which can be constructed on the dual spaces of simplesuperalgebras with a non-degenerate Killing metric. The su(3,1) superalgebra isgiven as a generic example.
