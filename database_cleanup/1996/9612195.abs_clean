We study the low-energy effective Hamiltonian of N=2 super Yang-Millstheories. We find that the BPS equations are unchanged outside a quantum corewhere higher dimension contributions are expected to be important. We find twoquantum generalizations of the BPS soliton. The leading higher-derivativecorrection to the effective action is shown not to contribute to the BPS massformula.
