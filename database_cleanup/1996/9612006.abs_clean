We investigate how a uniformly rotating frame is defined as the rest frame ofan observer rotating with constant angular velocity $\Omega$ around the $z$axis of an inertial frame. Assuming that this frame is a Lorentz one, we secondquantize a free massless scalar field in this rotating frame and obtain thatcreation-anihilation operators of the field are not the same as those of aninertial frame. This leads to a new vacuum state --- a rotating vacuum ---which is a superposition of positive and negative frequency Minkowskiparticles. After this, introducing an apparatus device coupled linearly withthe field we obtain that there is a strong correlation between number ofrotating particles (in a given state) obtained via canonical quantization andvia response function of the rotating detector. Finally, we analysepolarization effects in circular accelerators in the proper frame of theelectron making a connection with the inertial frame point of view.
