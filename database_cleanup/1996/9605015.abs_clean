Title: Critical Statistical Charge for Anyonic Superconductivity

Authors: James Ball (U of Utah) and Wei Chen (UC Davis)

Comments: 11 pages; to appear in Phys Rev B

We examine a criterion for the anyonic superconductivity at zero temperaturein Abelian matter-coupled Chern-Simons gauge field theories in threedimensions. By solving the Dyson-Schwinger equations, we obtain a criticalvalue of the statistical charge for the superconducting phase in a masslessfermion-Chern-Simons model.
