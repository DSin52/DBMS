Title: Duality in N=2 SUSY SU(2) Yang-Mills Theory

to the work of Seiberg and WittenComments: 33 pages, uses PHYZZX

These are notes from introductory lectures given at the Ecole Normale inParis and at the Strasbourg meeting dedicated to the memory of Claude Itzykson.I review in considerable detail and in a hopefully pedagogical way the work ofSeiberg and Witten on $N=2$ supersymmetric $SU(2)$ gauge theory without extramatter. This presentation basically follows their original work, except in thelast section where the low-energy effective action is obtained emphasizing morethe relation between monodromies and differential equations rather than usingelliptic curves.
