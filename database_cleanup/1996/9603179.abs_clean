The propagator and corresponding path integral for a system of identicalparticles obeying parastatistics are derived. It is found that the statisticalweights of topological sectors of the path integral for parafermions andparabosons are simply related through multiplication by the parity of thepermutation of the final positions of the particles. Appropriategeneralizations of statistics are proposed obeying unitarity andfactorizability (strong cluster decomposition). The realization of simplemaximal occupancy (Gentile) statistics is shown to require ghost states.
