Title: Generalized Hirota Equations in Models of 2D Quantum Gravity

Authors: Jorge Alfaro and Ivan Kostov

Comments: 10 pages, harvmac, no figures

We derive a set of bilinear functional equations of Hirota type for thepartition functions of the $sl(2)$ related integrable statistical modelsdefined on a random lattice. These equations are obtained as deformations ofthe Hirota equations for the KP integrable hierarchy, which are satisfied bythe partition function of the ensemble of planar graphs.
