By using the intertwiner and face-vertex correpondence relation, we obtainthe Bethe ansatz equation of eight vertex model with open boundary condtitionsin the framework of algebraic Bethe ansatz method. The open boundary conditionunder consideration is the general solution of the reflection equation foreight vertex model with only one restriction on the free parameters of theright side reflecting boundary matrix. The reflecting boundary matrices used inthis paper thus may have off-diagonal elements. Our construction can also beused for the Bethe ansatz of SOS model with reflection boundaries.
