Title: Decay amplitudes in two-dimensional QCD

Authors: Elcio Abdalla and Roya Mohayaee

Comments: We discuss in more detail the background material and elaborate on

the consequences of the new results. New equations and text are added andthe figures are efficiently regenerated by a fortran program,latex file, 13 pages, 4 figures in encapsulated postscript files, uses epsf.minor changes, version to appear in Physical Review DDecay amplitudes for mesons in two-dimensional QCD are discussed. We showthat in spite of an infinite number of conserved charges, particle productionis not entirely suppressed. This phenomenon is explained in terms of quantumcorrections to the combined algebra of higher-conserved and spectrum-generatingcurrents. We predict the qualitative form of particle production probabilitiesand verify that they are in agreement with numerical data. We also discussfour-dimensional self-dual Yang-Mills theory in the light of our results.
