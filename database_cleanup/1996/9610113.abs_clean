We exhibit the dynamical scattering of multi-solitons in the Skyrme model forconfigurations with charge two, three and four. First, we construct maximallyattractive configurations from a simple profile function and the productansatz. Then using a sophisticated numerical algorithm, initiallywell-separated skyrmions in approximately symmetric configurations are shown toscatter through the known minimum energy configurations. These scatteringevents illustrate a number of similarities to BPS monopole configurations ofthe same charge. A simple modification of the dynamics to a dissipative regime,allows us to compute the minimal energy skyrmions for baryon numbers one tofour to within a few percent.
