0-brane of type IIA string theory can be interpreted as a dimensionalreduction of a gravitational wave in 11 dimensions. We observe that a similarit can be viewed as a reduction (along one spatial and one time-like direction)of a wave in a 12-dimensional theory. The instanton charge is thus related to alinear momentum in 12 dimensions. This suggests that the instanton should playas important role in type IIB theory as the 0-brane is supposed to play in typeIIA theory.
