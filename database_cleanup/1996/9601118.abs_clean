We study a class of rotating dyonic black holes in the heterotic stringtheory in four dimension which have left, right independent electric chargesbut have same magnitude for the left and right magnetic charges. In both leftand right sector the electric and the magnetic vectors are orthogonal to eachother. The gyromagnetic(electric) ratios are in general found not to have anupper bound.
