Title: Fusion of RSOS Models as a Coset Construction

Comments: 8 pages, plain TeX, minor mistakes corrected

Using the vertex operator approach we show that fusion of the RSOS models canbe considered as a kind of coset construction which is very similar to thecoset construction of minimal models in conformal field theory. We reproducethe excitation spectrum and $S$-matrix of the fusion RSOS models in the regimeIII and show that their correlation functions and form factors can be expressedin terms of those of the ordinary (ABF) RSOS models.
