and Integrable SystemsWe announce results about the nonperturbative mathematically rigorousspace-time. The complex structure of solutions of the classical nonlinear(real-valued) wave equation and quantization are closely connected amongthemselves and allow to construct non-perturbatively the quantum field theoryvacuum averages, in particular, we construct Wightman functions and matrixelements of the scattering operator as generalized functions for finiteenergies. The constructed theory is obviously nontrivial.
