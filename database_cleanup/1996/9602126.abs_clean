In this paper we study the production of pairs of neutral and charged blackholes by domain walls, finding classical solutions and calculating theirclassical actions. We find that neutral black holes whose creation is mediatedby Euclidean instantons must be produced mutually at rest with respect to oneanother, but for charged black holes a new type of instanton is possible inwhich after formation the two black holes accelerate away from one another.These new types of instantons are not possible in Einstein-Maxwell theory witha cosmological constant. We also find that the creation of non-orientable blackhole solutions can be mediated by Euclidean instantons and that in addition ifone is prepared to consider entirely Lorentzian no-boundary type contributionsto the path integral then mutually accelerating pairs may be created even inthe neutral case. Finally we consider the production of Kaluza-Klein monopolesboth by a standard cosmological term and in the presence of a domain wall. Wefind that compactification is accompanied by the production of pairs ofKaluza-Klein monopoles.
