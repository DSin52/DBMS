In analogy with the Liouville case we study the $sl_3$ Toda theory on thelattice and define the relevant quadratic algebra and out of it we recover thediscrete $W_3$ algebra. We define an integrable system with respect to thelatter and establish the relation with the Toda lattice hierarchy. We computethe the relevant continuum limits. Finally we find the quantum version of thequadratic algebra.
