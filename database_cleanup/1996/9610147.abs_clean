Exact loop-variables formulation of pure gauge lattice QCD_3 is derived fromthe Wilson version of the model. The observation is made that the resultingmodel is two-dimensional. This significant feature is shown to be a uniqueproperty of the gauge field. The model is defined on the infinite genus surfacewhich covers regularly the original three-dimensional lattice. Similartransformation applied to the principal chiral field model in two and threedimensions for comparison with QCD.
