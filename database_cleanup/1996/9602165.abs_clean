The expectation value of a Wilson loop in a Chern--Simons theory is a knotinvariant. Its skein relations have been derived in a variety of ways,including variational methods in which small deformations of the loop are madeand the changes evaluated. The latter method only allowed to obtain approximateexpressions for the skein relations. We present a generalization of this ideathat allows to compute the exact form of the skein relations. Moreover, itrequires to generalize the resulting knot invariants to intersecting knots andlinks in a manner consistent with the Mandelstam identities satisfied by theWilson loops. This allows for the first time to derive the full expression forknot invariants that are suitable candidates for quantum states of gravity (andsupergravity) in the loop representation. The new approach leads to several newinsights in intersecting knot theory, in particular the role of non-planarintersections and intersections with kinks.
