It is argued that quantum gravity has an interpretation as a topologicalfield theory provided a certain constraint from the path intergral measure isrespected. The constraint forces us to couple gauge and matter fields togravity for space - time dimensions different from 3. We then discuss possiblemodels which may be relevant to our universe.
