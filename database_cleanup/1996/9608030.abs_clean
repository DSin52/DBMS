Within the framework of string field theory the intrinsic Hausdorff dimensiond_H of the ensemble of surfaces in two-dimensional quantum gravity has recentlybeen claimed to be 2m for the class of unitary minimal models (p = m+1,q = m).This contradicts recent results from numerical simulations, which consistentlyfind d_H approximatly 4 in the cases m = 2, 3, 5 and infinity. The string fieldcalculations rely on identifying the scaling behavior of geodesic distance andarea with respect to a common length scale l. This length scale is introducedby formulating the models on a disk with fixed boundary length l. In this paperwe study the relationship between the mean area and the boundary length forpure gravity and the Ising model coupled to gravity. We discuss how thisrelationship is modified by relevant perturbations in the Ising model. Wediscuss how this leads to a modified value for the Hausdorff dimension.
