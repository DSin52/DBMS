The Higgs mixing term coefficient $\mu_{eff}$ is calculated in the scalarpotential in supergravity theories with string origin, in a model independentapproach. A general low energy effective expression is derived, where newcontributions are included which depend on the modular weights $q_{1,2}$ of theHiggs superfields, the moduli and derivative terms. We find that in a class ofmodels obtained in the case of compactifications of the heterotic superstring,the derivative terms are identically zero. Further, the total $\mu_{eff}$-termvanishes identically if the sum of the two modular weights $q_1+q_2$ is equalto two. Subleading $\mu$- corrections, in the presence of intermediate gaugesymmetries predicted in viable string scenarios, are also discussed.
