In this paper we calculate the finite-size corrections of an anisotropicintegrable spin chain, consisting of spins s=1 and s=1/2. The calculations aredone in two regions of the phase diagram with respect to the two couplings$\bar{c}$ and $\tilde{c}$. In case of conformal invariance we obtain the finalanswer for the ground state and its lowest excitations, which generalizesearlier results.
