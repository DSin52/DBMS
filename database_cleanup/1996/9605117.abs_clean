We are presenting a general solution to the classicalEinstein--Maxwell--dilaton--axion equations starting from a metric of type--D.Namely, this stringy solution is the result of a transformation on a generalvacuum type--D solution to the Einstein's equations which was studied in detailsome years ago.
