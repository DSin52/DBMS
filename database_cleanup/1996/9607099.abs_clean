We develop a method of computing the excited state energies in IntegrableQuantum Field Theories (IQFT) in finite geometry, with spatial coordinatecompactified on a circle of circumference R. The IQFT ``commutingtransfer-matrices'' introduced by us (BLZ) for Conformal Field Theories (CFT)are generalized to non-conformal IQFT obtained by perturbing CFT with theoperator $\Phi_{1,3}$. We study the models in which the fusion relations forthese ``transfer-matrices'' truncate and provide closed integral equationswhich generalize the equations of Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz to excited states.The explicit calculations are done for the first excited state in the ``ScalingLee-Yang Model''.
