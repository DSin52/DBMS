We study general perturbations of two-dimensional conformal field theories byholomorphic fields. It is shown that the genus one partition function iscontrolled by a contact term (pre-Lie) algebra given in terms of the operatorproduct expansion. These models have applications to vertex operator algebras,two-dimensional QCD, topological strings, holomorphic anomaly equations andmodular properties of generalized characters of chiral algebras such as the$W_{1+\infty}$ algebra, that is treated in detail.
