We study the spectrum of created particles in two-dimensional black holegeometries for a linear, hermitian scalar field satisfying a Lorentznon-invariant field equation with higher spatial derivative terms that aresuppressed by powers of a fundamental momentum scale $k_0$. The preferred frameis the ``free-fall frame" of the black hole. This model is a variation ofUnruh's sonic black hole analogy. We find that there are two qualitativelygenerated by ``mode conversion" at the black hole horizon, and a non-thermalspectrum generated via scattering off the background into negative free-fallfrequency modes. This second process has nothing to do with black holes anddoes not occur for the ordinary wave equation because such modes do notpropagate outside the horizon with positive Killing frequency. The horizoncomponent of the radiation is astonishingly close to a perfect thermal$T_H\simeq0.0008k_0$, agreement is of order $(T_H/k_0)^3$ at frequency$\omega=T_H$, and agreement to order $T_H/k_0$ persists out to$\omega/T_H\simeq 45$ where the thermal number flux is $O(10^{-20}$). The fluxfrom scattering dominates at large $\omega$ and becomes many orders ofmagnitude larger than the horizon component for metrics with a ``kink", i.e. aregion of high curvature localized on a static worldline outside the horizon.This non-thermal flux amounts to roughly 10\% of the total luminosity for thekinkier metrics considered. The flux exhibits oscillations as a function offrequency which can be explained by interference between the variouscontributions to the flux.
