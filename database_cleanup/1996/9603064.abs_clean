It is shown that a particular $q$-deformation of the Virasoro algebra can beinterpreted in terms of the $q$-local field $\Phi (x)$ and the Schwinger-likepoint-splitted Virasoro currents, quadratic in $\Phi (x)$. The $q$-deformedVirasoro algebra possesses an additional index $\alpha$, which is directlyrelated to point-splitting of the currents. The generators in the $q$-deformedcase are found to exactly reproduce the results obtained by probing the fields$X(z)$ (string coordinate) and $\Phi (z)$ (string momentum) with thenon-splitted Virasoro generators and lead to a particular representation of the$SU_q (1,1)$ algebra characterized by the standard conformal dimension $J$ ofthe field. Some remarks concerning the $q$-vertex operator for the interacting$q$-string theory are made.
