If the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) is formulated with a cutoff thatbreaks gauge invariance, then gauge invariance may be recovered only once thecutoff is removed and only once a set of effective Ward identities is imposed.We show that an effective Quantum Action Principle can be formulated inperturbation theory which enables the effective Ward identities to be solvedorder by order, even if the theory requires non-vanishing subtraction points.The difficulties encountered with non-perturbative approximations are brieflydiscussed.
