The potential between two separated D-instantons at fixed (super) space-timepoints is obtained by a simple explicit integration over the `massive'variables of the zero-dimensional reduction of ten-dimensional U(2) superYang-Mills theory. This potential vanishes for asymptotically largeseparations, becoming significant at separations of around the ten-dimensionalPlanck scale with a singularity at the origin, which is resolved by the extra`massless' internal Yang-Mills super-coordinates.
