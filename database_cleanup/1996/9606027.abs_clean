We show that the self-dual Yang-Mills equations afford supersymmetrisation tosystems of equations invariant under global N-extended super-Poincar\'etransformations for arbitrary values of N, without the limitation (N\le 4)applicable to standard non-self-dual Yang-Mills theories. These systems ofequations provide novel classically consistent interactions for vectorsupermultiplets containing fields of spin up to (N-2)/2. The equations ofmotion for the component fields of spin greater than 1/2 are interactingvariants of the first-order Dirac--Fierz equations for zero rest-mass fields ofarbitrary spin. The interactions are governed by conserved currents which areconstructed by an iterative procedure. In (arbitrarily extended) chiralsuperspace, the equations of motion for the (arbitrarily large) self-dualsupermultiplet are shown to be completely equivalent to the set of algebraicsupercurvature constraints defining the self-dual superconnection.
