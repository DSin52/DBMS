We examine the non-equilibrium time evolution of the hadronic plasma producedin a relativistic heavy ion collision, assuming a spherical expansion into thevacuum. We study the $O(4)$ linear sigma model to leading order in a large-$N$expansion. Starting at a temperature above the phase transition, the systemexpands and cools, finally settling into the broken symmetry vacuum state. Weconsider the proper time evolution of the effective pion mass, the orderparameter $\langle \sigma \rangle$, and the particle number distribution. Weexamine several different initial conditions and look for instabilities(exponentially growing long wavelength modes) which can lead to the formationof disoriented chiral condensates (DCCs). We find that instabilities exist forproper times which are less than 3 fm/c. We also show that an experimentalsignature of domain growth is an increase in the low momentum spectrum ofoutgoing pions when compared to an expansion in thermal equilibrium. Incomparison to particle production during a longitudinal expansion, we find thatin a spherical expansion the system reaches the ``out'' regime much faster andmore particles get produced. However the size of the unstable region, which isrelated to the domain size of DCCs, is not enhanced.
