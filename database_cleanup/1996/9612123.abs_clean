Title: Gauge boson-monopole two particle bound states and duality

Authors: Michael Goodband

Comments: 31 pages, Latex, no figures

We consider perturbations in the fields of the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole,dyon and point electric solutions. We find a series of bound modes where thefields are confined to the core of the respective solutions, and these areinterpreted as bound states of a gauge boson with the respective solutions. Wediscuss the spectra of these bound states of the various two particle systemsof the Yang-Mills-Higgs model in connection with the duality of Sen.
