In this note we compare the moduli spaces of the heterotic stringcompactified on a two-torus and F-Theory compactified on an elliptic K3 surfacefor the case of an unbroken E8 x E8 gauge group. The explicit map relating thedeformation parameters alpha and beta of the F-Theory K3 surface to the moduliT and U of the heterotic torus is found using the close relationship betweenthe K3 discriminant and the discriminant of the Calabi-Yau-threefoldX(1,1,2,8,12)[24] in the limit of a large base P1.
