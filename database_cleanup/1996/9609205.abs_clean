In the context of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, a new observable for theAbelian BF theory is proposed whose vacuum expectation value is related to theAlexander-Conway polynomial. The three-dimensional case is analyzed explicitly,and it is proved to be anomaly free. Moreover, at the second order inperturbation theory, a new formula for the second coefficient of theAlexander-Conway polynomial is obtained. An account on the higher-dimensionalgeneralizations is also given.
