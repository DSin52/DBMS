The application of D-brane methods to large black holes whose Schwarzschildradius is larger than the compactification scale is problematic. Callan andMaldacena have suggested that despite apparent problems of strong interactionswhen the number of branes becomes large, the open string degrees of freedom mayremain very dilute due to the growth of the horizon area which they claim growsmore rapidly than the average number of open strings. Such a picture of adilute weakly coupled string system conflicts with the picture of a densestring-soup that saturates the bound of one string per planck area. A morecareful analysis shows that Callan and Maldacena were not fully consistent intheir estimates. In the form that their model was studied it can not be used toextrapolate to large mass without being in conflict with the Hawking Bekensteinentropy formula. A somewhat modified model can reproduce the correct entropyformula. In this ``improved model" the number of string bits on the horizonscales like the entropy in agreement with earlier speculations of Susskind.
