We discuss $SL(2,Z)$ subgroups appropriate for the study of $N=2$ SuperYang-Mills with $N_f=2n$ flavors. Hyperelliptic curves describing such theoriesshould have coefficients that are modular forms of these subgroups. Inparticular, uniqueness arguments are sufficient to construct the $SU(3)$ curve,up to two numerical constants, which can be fixed by making some assumptionsabout strong coupling behavior. We also discuss the situation for highergroups. We also include a derivation of the closed form $\beta$-function forthe $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ theories without matter, and the massless theories with$N_f=n$.
