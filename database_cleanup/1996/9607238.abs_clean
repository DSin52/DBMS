Authors: E. Bergshoeff

Comments: 4 pages, latex, uses sprocl.sty; talk given at the Second

International Sakharov Conference on Physics (Moscow, May 1996)We consider the actions for ten--dimensional $p$--branes and $D$--branes inan arbitrary curved background and discuss some of their properties. We commenton how the $SL(2,R)$ duality symmetry acts on the five--brane actions.
