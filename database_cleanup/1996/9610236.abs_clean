We propose a construction of five-branes which fill both light-conedimensions in Banks, Fischler, Shenker and Susskind's matrix model of M theory.We argue that they have the correct long-range fields and spectrum ofexcitations. We prove Dirac charge quantization with the membrane by showingthat the five-brane induces a Berry phase in the membrane world-volume theory,with a familiar magnetic monopole form.
