Title: Causal Propagators for the Second Order Wilson Loop

Authors: B. M. Pimentel and J. L. Tomazelli

Comments: LaTex, 06 pages, no figures

We evaluate the Wilson loop at second order in general non-covariant gaugesby means of the causal principal-value prescription for the gauge- dependentpoles in the gauge-boson propagator and show that the result agrees with theusual causal prescriptions.
