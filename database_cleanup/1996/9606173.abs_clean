In this note, we consider the reformulation of the Dirac-Born-Infeld actionfor a Dirichlet p-brane in Brink-Di Vecchia-Howe-Tucker form, i.e., includingan independent non-propagating world-volume metric. When p>2, the actionbecomes non-polynomial. A closed expression is derived for p=3. For selfdualfield-strengths, the DBI action is reproduced by an action with a simple F^2term. We speculate on supersymmetrization of the D_3-brane action. We also givethe governing equations for arbitrary p, and derive an implicit expression forthe D_4-brane lagrangian.
