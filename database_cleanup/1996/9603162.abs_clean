We analyze free-fermion conditions on vertex models. We show --by examiningexamples of vertex models on square, triangular, and cubic lattices-- how theyamount to degeneration conditions for known symmetries of the Boltzmannweights, and propose a general scheme for such a process in two and moredimensions.
