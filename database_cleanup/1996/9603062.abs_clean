We extend the idea of the generalized Pauli-Villars regularization of Frolovand Slavnov and analyze the general structure of the regularization scheme. Thegauge anomaly-free condition emerges in a simple way in the scheme, and, underthe standard prescription for the momentum assignment, the Pauli-VillarsLagrangian provides a gauge invariant regularization of chiral fermions inarbitrary anomaly-free representations. The vacuum polarization tensor istransverse, and the fermion number and the conformal anomalies have gaugeinvariant forms. We also point out that the real representation can be treatedin a straightforward manner and the covariant regularization scheme is directlyimplemented.
