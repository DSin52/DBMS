The Lagrangian field-antifield formalism of Batalin and Vilkovisky (BV) isused to investigate the application of the collective coordinate method tosoliton quantisation. It is shown how Noether identities and local symmetriesof the Lagrangian arise when collective coordinates are introduced in order toavoid divergences related to zero modes. This transformation to collective andfluctuation degrees of freedom is interpreted as a canonical transformation inthe symplectic field-antifield space which induces a time-local gauge symmetry.Separating the corresponding Lagrangian path integral of the BV scheme inlowest order into harmonic quantum fluctuations and a free motion of thecollective coordinate with the classical mass of the soliton, we show how theBV approach clarifies the relation between zero modes, collective coordinates,gauge invariance and the center-of-mass motion of classical solutions inquantum fields. Finally, we apply the procedure to the reduced nonlinear O(3)sigma-model.
