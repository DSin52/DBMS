We investigate (1,0)-superconformal Toda theories based on simple Liealgebras and find that the classical integrability properties of the underlyingbosonic theories do not survive. For several models based on algebras of lowrank, we show explicitly that none of the conserved W-algebra generators can begeneralized to the supersymmetric case. Using these results we deduce that atleast one W-algebra generator fails to generalize in any model based on aclassical Lie algebra. This argument involves a method for relating the bosonicToda theories and their conserved currents within each classical series. Wealso scrutinize claims that the (1,0)-superconformal models actually admit(1,1) supersymmetry and find that they do not. Our results are consistent withthe belief that all integrable Toda models with fermions arise from Liesuperalgebras.
