Title: String cosmology and relic gravitational radiaton

Comments: 16 pages, LATEX, five figure included using epsf, appended as ps

file. A complete collection of papers and references on the pre-big-bangscenario in string cosmology is available atString theory counterparts to Einstein's gravity, cosmology and inflation aredescribed. A very tight upper bound on the Cosmic Gravitational RadiationBackground (CGRB) of standard inflation is shown to be evaded in stringcosmology, while an interesting signal in the phenomenologically interestingfrequency range is all but excluded. The generic features of such a stringyCGRB are presented.
