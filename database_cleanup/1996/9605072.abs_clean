Title: Natural extensions of the Connes-Lott Model and comparison with the

Marseille-Mainz ModelAuthors: N.A. Papadopoulos, J. Plass

Comments: 11 pages

An extension of the Connes--Lott model is proposed. It is also within theframework of the A.Connes construction based on a generalized Dirac--Yukawaoperator and the K--cycle $(H,D)$, with $H$ a fermionic Hilbert space. Thebasic algebra $A$ which may be considered as representing the non--commutativeextension, plays a less important role in our approach. This allows a new classof natural extensions. The proposed extension lies in a sense between theConnes--Lott and the Marseille--Mainz model. It leads exactly to the standardmodel of electroweak interactions.
