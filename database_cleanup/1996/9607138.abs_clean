We generalize the rules for the free fermionic string construction to includeother asymmetric orbifolds with world-sheet bosons. We use these rules toconstruct various grand unified string models that involve level-3 currentalgebras. We present the explicit construction of three classes of3-chiral-family grand unified models in the heterotic string theory. Each modelhas 5 left-handed, and two right-handed families, and an adjoint Higgs. Two ofthem are SO(10) and the third is E_6. With Wilson lines and/or varying moduli,we show how other 3-family grand unified models, such as SO(10) and SU(5), maybe constructed from them.
