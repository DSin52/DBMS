We show that the problem of computing the vacuum expectation values of gaugeinvariant operators in the strong coupling limit of topologically massive gaugetheory is equivalent to the problem of computing similar operators in the$G_k/G$ model where $k$ is the integer coefficient of the Chern-Simons term.The $G_k/G$ model is a topological field theory and many correlators can becomputed analytically. We also show that the effective action for the Polyakovloop operator and static modes of the gauge fields of the strongly coupledtheory at finite temperature is a perturbed, non-topological $G_k/G$ model. Inthis model, we compute the one loop effective potential for the Polyakov loopoperators and explicitly construct the low-lying excited states. In the strongcoupling limit the theory is in a deconfined phase.
