Title: Gluino Condensation in F-theory

Comments: 11 pages, harvmac. One mistake and some typos corrected, two

references addedCoupling of bilinears of gauginos on D-branes to anti-symmetric tensor fieldscan be deduced by comparing F-theory compactified to 8 dimensions with theheterotic string on $R^8\times T^2$. Application to SUSY breaking in F-theorytriggered by gaugino condensation is discussed. Compactification to fourdimensions with a warp factor is briefly discussed. In this case some 3-braneswhose world-volume coincides with the open spacetime must be introduced, inaddition to 7-branes.
