Authors: K. Davis

Comments: 17 Pages, 6 Postscript Figures, Uses harvmac.tex and epsf.tex

In this article we examine the appearance of tensionless strings in M-Theory.We subsequently interpret these tensionless strings in a String Theory context.In particular, we examine tensionless strings appearing in M-Theory on $S^{1}$,M-Theory on $S^{1} / {\bf Z}_{2}$, and M-Theory on $T^{2}$; we then interpretthe appearance of such strings in a String Theory context. Then we reverse thisprocess and examine the appearance of some tensionless strings in StringTheory. Subsequently we interpret these tensionless strings in a M-Theorycontext.
