Scale-invariant actions in arbitrary dimensions are investigated in curvedspace to clarify the relation between scale-, Weyl- and conformal invariance onthe classical level. The global Weyl-group is gauged. Then the class of actionsis determined for which Weyl-gauging may be replaced by a suitable coupling tothe curvature (Ricci gauging). It is shown that this class is exactly the classof actions which are conformally invariant in flat space. The procedure yieldsa simple algebraic criterion for conformal invariance and produces the improvedenergy-momentum tensor in conformally invariant theories in a systematic way.It also provides a simple and fundamental connection between Weyl-anomalies andcentral extensions in two dimensions. In particular, the subset ofscale-invariant Lagrangians for fields of arbitrary spin, in any dimension,which are conformally invariant is given. An example of a quadratic action forwhich scale-invariance does not imply conformal invariance is constructed.
