The effective action of a Higgs theory should be gauge-invariant. However,the quantum and/or thermal contributions to the effective potential seem to begauge-dependent, posing a problem for its physical interpretation. In thispaper, we identify the source of the problem and argue that in a Higgs theory,perturbative contributions should be evaluated with the Higgs fields in thepolar basis, not in the Cartesian basis. Formally, this observation can be madefrom the derivation of the Higgs theorem, which we provide. We show explicitlythat, properly defined, the effective action for the Abelian Higgs theory isgauge invariant to all orders in perturbation expansion when evaluated in thecovariant gauge in the polar basis. In particular, the effective potential isgauge invariant. We also show the equivalence between the calculations in thecovariant gauge in the polar basis and the unitary gauge. These points areillustrated explicitly with the one-loop calculations of the effective action.With a field redefinition, we obtain the physical effective potential. TheSU(2) non-Abelian case is also discussed.
