A new numerical integration method for examining a black hole structure wasrealized. Black hole solutions with dilatonic hair of 4D low energy effectiveSuperString Theory action with Gauss-Bonnet quadratic curvature contributionwere studied, using this method, inside and outside the event horizon.Thermodynamical properties of this solution were also studied.
