We develop an algebraic approach to studying the spectral properties of thestationary Schr\"odinger equation in one dimension based on its high orderconditional symmetries. This approach makes it possible to obtain in explicitform representations of the Schr\"odinger operator by $n\times n$ matrices forany $n\in {\bf N}$ and, thus, to reduce a spectral problem to a purelyalgebraic one of finding eigenvalues of constant $n\times n$ matrices. Theconnection to so called quasi exactly solvable models is discussed. It isestablished, in particular, that the case, when conditional symmetries reduceto high order Lie symmetries, corresponds to exactly solvable Schr\"odingerequations. A symmetry classification of Sch\"odinger equation admittingnon-trivial high order Lie symmetries is carried out, which yields a hierarchyof exactly solvable Schr\"odinger equations. Exact solutions of these areconstructed in explicit form. Possible applications of the technique developedto multi-dimensional linear and one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odingerequations is briefly discussed.
