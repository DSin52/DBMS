We study the solutions of the equations of motion in the gauged(2+1)-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger model. The contribution ofChern-Simons gauge fields leads to a significant decrease of the critical powerof self-focusing. We also show that at appropriate boundary conditions in theconsidered model there exists a regime of turbulent motions of hydrodynamictype.
