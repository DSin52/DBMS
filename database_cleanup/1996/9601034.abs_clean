For the general operator product algebra coefficients derived by CremmerRoussel Schnittger and the present author with (positive integer)screening numbers, the coupling constants determine the factors additional tothe quantum group 6j symbols.They are given by path independent products over a two dimensional lattice inthe zero mode space. It is shown that the ansatz for the three point functionof Dorn-Otto and Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov precisely defines thecorresponding flat lattice connection, so that it does give a naturalgeneralization of these coupling constants to continuous screening numbers. Theconsistency of the restriction to integer screening charges is reviewed, andshown to be linked with the orthogonality of the (generalized) 6j symbols. Thusextending this last relation is the key to general screening numbers.
