Title: phi^4 Kinks - Gradient Flow and Dynamics

Comments: 23 pages, LaTex, 11 eps figures. We have added some clarification of

our methodSystemsThe symmetric dynamics of two kinks and one antikink in classical(1+1)-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory is investigated. Gradient flow is used toconstruct a collective coordinate model of the system. The relationship betweenthe discrete vibrational mode of a single kink, and the process ofkink-antikink pair production is explored.
