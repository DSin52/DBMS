We study the Calabi-Yau phase of a certain class of (0,2) models. These areconjectured to be equivalent to exact (0,2) superconformal field theories whichhave been constructed recently. Using the methods of toric geometry we discussin a few examples the problem of resolving the singularities of such models andcalculate the Euler characteristic of the corresponding gauge bundles.
