The point of this paper is see what light new results in hyperbolic geometrymay throw on gravitational entropy and whether gravitational entropy isrelevant for the quantum origin of the univeres. We introduce some newgravitational instantons which mediate the birth from nothing of closeduniverses containing wormholes and suggest that they may contribute to thedensity matrix of the universe. We also discuss the connection between theirgravitational action and the topological and volumetric entropies introduced inhyperbolic geometry. These coincide for hyperbolic 4-manifolds, and increasewith increasing topological complexity of the four manifold. We raise thequestions of whether the action also increases with the topological complexityof the initial 3-geometry, measured either by its three volume or its Matveevcomplexity. We point out, in distinction to the non-supergravity case,that universes with domains of negative cosmological constant separated bysupergravity domain walls cannot be born from nothing. Finally we point outthat our wormholes provide examples of the type of Perpetual Motion machinesenvisaged by Frolov and Novikov.
