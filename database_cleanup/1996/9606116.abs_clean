The bootstrap programme for finding exact S-matrices of integrable quantumfield theories with N=1 supersymmetry is investigated. New solutions are foundwhich have the same fusing data as bosonic theories related to the classicalaffine Lie algebras. When the states correspond to a spinor spot of the Dynkindiagram they are kinks which carry a non-zero topological charge. Using theseresults, the S-matrices of the supersymmetric O($2n$) sigma model andsine-Gordon model can be shown to close under the bootstrap.
