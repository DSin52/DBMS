In addition to the double-dimensional reduction procedure that employsworld-volume Killing symmetries of $p$-brane supergravity solutions and actsdiagonally on a plot of $p$ versus spacetime dimension $D$, there exists asecond procedure of ``vertical'' reduction. This reduces the transverse-spacedimension via an integral that superposes solutions to the underlying Laplaceequation. We show that vertical reduction is also closely related to therecently-introduced notion of intersecting $p$-branes. We illustrate this withexamples, and also construct a new $D=11$ solution describing four intersectingmembranes, which preserves $1/16$ of the supersymmetry. Given the two reductionschemes plus duality transformations at special points of the scalar modulusspace, one may relate most of the $p$-brane solutions of relevance tosuperstring theory. We argue that the maximum classifying duality symmetry forthis purpose is the Weyl group of the corresponding Cremmer-Julia supergravitysymmetry $E_{r(+r)}$. We also discuss a separate class of duality-invariant$p$-branes with $p=D-3$.
