The non-perturbative superpotential can be effectively calculated in$M$-theory compactification to three dimensions on a Calabi-Yau four-fold $X$.For certain $X$, the superpotential is identically zero, while for other $X$, anon-perturbative superpotential is generated. Using $F$-theory, these resultscarry over to certain Type IIB and heterotic string compactifications to fourdimensions with $N=1$ supersymmetry. In the heterotic string case, thenon-perturbative superpotential can be interpreted as coming from space-timeand world-sheet instantons; in many simple cases contributions come only fromfinitely many values of the instanton numbers.
