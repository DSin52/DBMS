Yang-Mills theory is studied in a variant of 't Hooft's maximal Abeliangauge. In this gauge magnetic monopoles arise in the Abelian magnetic field. Weshow, however, that the full (non-Abelian) magnetic field does not possess anymonopoles, but rather strings of magnetic fluxes. We argue that these stringsare the relevant infrared degrees of freedom. The properties of the magneticstrings which arise from a dilute instanton gas are investigated for the gaugegroup SU(2).
