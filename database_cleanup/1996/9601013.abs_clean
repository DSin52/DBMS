The formalism is furtherdeveloped and illustrated in several examples, including Yang-Mills theory,chiral $W_3$ and $W_{2,5/2}$ gravity, strings in curved backgrounds andtopological field theories. All these models are characterised by their gaugealgebra, which can be open, reducible, or even infinitly reducible. We show indetail how to perform the gauge fixing and how to compute the anomalies usingPauli-Villars regularisation and the heat kernel method. Finally, we discussthe geometrical structure of the antifield formalism.
