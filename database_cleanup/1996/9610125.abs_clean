A zero-brane is used to probe non-threshold BPS bound states of (p,p+2,p+4)-branes. At long distances the stringy calculation agrees with thesupergravity calculations. The supergravity description is given, using theinterpretation of the D=8 dyonic membrane as the bound state of a two-braneinside a four-brane. We investigate the short distance structure of these boundstates, compute the phase shift of the scattered zero-brane and find the boundstates characteristic size. It is found that there should be a supersymmetricsolution of type IIa supergravity, describing a bound state of a zero-brane andtwo orthogonal two-brane, all inside a four-brane , with an additional unboundzero-brane. We comment on the relationship between p-branes and(p-2)-branes.
