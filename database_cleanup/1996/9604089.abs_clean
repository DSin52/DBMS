We carry out a thorough survey of entropy for a large class of $p$-branes invarious dimensions. We find that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy may be given asimple world volume interpretation only for the non-dilatonic $p$-branes, thosewith the dilaton constant throughout spacetime. The entropy of extremalnon-dilatonic $p$-branes is non-vanishing only for the solutions preserving 1/8of the original supersymmetries. Upon toroidal compactification these reduce todyonic black holes in 4 and 5 dimensions. For the self-dual string in 6dimensions, which preserves 1/4 of the original supersymmetries, thenear-extremal entropy is found to agree with a world sheet calculation, insupport of the existing literature. The remaining 3 interesting cases preserve1/2 of the original supersymmetries. These are the self-dual 3-brane in 10dimensions, and the 2- and 5-branes in 11 dimensions. For all of them thescaling of the near-extremal Bekenstein-Hawking entropy with the Hawkingtemperature is in agreement with a statistical description in terms of freemassless fields on the world volume.
