based on the classical root systemAuthors: S. E. Konstein

Comments: 10 pages, LATEX

A complete set of supertraces on the algebras of observables of the rationalCalogero models with harmonic interaction based on the classical root systemsof B_N, C_N and D_N types is found. These results extend the results known forthe case A_N. It is shown that there exist Q independent supertraces whereQ(B_N)=Q(C_N) is a number of partitions of N into a sum of positive integersand Q(D_N) is a number of partitions of N into a sum of positive integers witheven number of even integers.
