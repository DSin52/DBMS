A new method for integrating anomalous Ward identities and finding theeffective action is proposed. Two-dimensional supergravity and $W_3$-gravityare used as examples to demonstrate its potential. An operator is introducedthat associates each physical quantity with a Ward identity, i.e., a quantitythat is transformed without anomalous terms and can be nullified in aconsistent manner. A covariant form of the action for matter field interactingwith a gravitational and $W_3$-gravitational background is proposed.
