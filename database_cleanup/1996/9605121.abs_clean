We apply differential renormalization method to the study ofthree-dimensional topologically massive Yang-Mills and Chern-Simons theories.The method is especially suitable for such theories as it avoids the need fordimensional continuation of three-dimensional antisymmetric tensor and theFeynman rules for three-dimensional theories in coordinate space are relativelysimple. The calculus involved is still lengthy but not as difficult as otherexisting methods of calculation. We compute one-loop propagators and verticesand derive the one-loop local effective action for topologically massiveYang-Mills theory. We then consider Chern-Simons field theory as the large masslimit of topologically massive Yang-Mills theory and show that this leads tothe famous shift in the parameter $k$. Some useful formulas for the calculus ofdifferential renormalization of three-dimensional field theories are given inan Appendix.
