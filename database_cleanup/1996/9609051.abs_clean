Title: String Theory Dualities

Comments: Plenary Talk at DPF 96, aimed at non-experts. 12 pages, latex

The past year has seen enormous progress in string theory. It has becomeclear that all of the different string theories are different limits of asingle theory. Moreover, in certain limits, one obtains a new,eleven-dimensional structure known as $M$-theory. Strings with unusual boundaryconditions, known as D-branes, turn out to be soliton solutions of stringtheory. These have provided a powerful tool to probe the structure of thesetheories. Most dramatically, they have yielded a partial understanding of thethermodynamics of black holes in a consistent quantum mechanical framework. Inthis brief talk, I attempt to give some flavor of these developments.
