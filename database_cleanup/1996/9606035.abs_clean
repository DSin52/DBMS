In this article we derive the Bekenstein-Hawking formula of black holeentropy from a single string. We consider a open string in the Rindler metricwhich can be obtained in the large mass limit from the Schwarzschild black holemetric. By solving the field equations we find a nontrivial solution with theexact value of the Hawking temperature. We see that this solution gives us theBekenstein-Hawking formula of black hole entropy to leading order ofapproximation. This string has effectively a rescaled string tension having arelation with a redshift factor. It is also pointed out that this formalism isextensible to other black holes in an arbitrary spacetime dimension. Thepresent work might lead us to a surprising idea that the recent picture whichthe black hole entropy arises from D-brane excitations has the root of thepicture that the black hole entropy is stocked in a single long string with arescaled string tension.
