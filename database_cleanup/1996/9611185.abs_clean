Title: A Nonrelativistic Chiral Soliton in One Dimension

Authors: R. Jackiw

Comments: 11 pages, Latex2e

Solvable and Integrable SystemsI analyze the one-dimensional, cubic Schr\"odinger equation, withnonlinearity constructed from the current density, rather than, as is usual,from the charge density. A soliton solution is found, where the soliton movesonly in one direction. Relation to higher-dimensional Chern--Simons theory isindicated. The theory is quantized and results for the two-body quantum problemagree at weak coupling with those coming from a semiclassical quantization ofthe soliton.
