Using the topological membrane approach to string theory, we suggest ageometric origin for the heterotic string. We show how different membraneboundary conditions lead to different string theories. We discuss theconstruction of closed oriented strings and superstrings, and demonstrate howthe heterotic construction naturally arises from a specific choice of boundaryconditions on the left and right boundaries of a cylindrical topologicalmembrane.
