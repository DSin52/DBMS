Polynomial relations for generators of $su(2)$ Lie algebra in arbitraryrepresentations are found. They generalize usual relation for Pauli operatorsin spin 1/2 case and permit to construct modified Holstein-Primakofftransformations in finite dimensional Fock spaces. The connection between$su(2)$ Lie algebra and q-oscillators with a root of unity q-parameter isconsidered. The meaning of the polynomial relations from the point of view ofquantum mechanics on a sphere are discussed.
