Alexander Friedman Seminar on Gravitation and Cosmology, Friedman Lab. Press,St. Petersburg 1995The free energy due to the vacuum fluctuations of matter fields on aclassical gravitational background is discussed. It is shown explicitly howthis energy is calculated for a non-minimally coupled scalar field in anarbitrary gravitational background, using the heat kernel method. The treatmentof (self-)interacting fields of higher spin is outlined, using a meanfieldapproximation to the gaugefield when treating the gauge boson self interactionand the fermion-gauge boson interaction.
