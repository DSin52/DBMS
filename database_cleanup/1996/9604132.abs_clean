A superposition of bosons and generalized deformed parafermions correspondingto an arbitrary paraquantization order $p$ is considered to providedeformations of parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics. New families ofparasupersymmetric Hamiltonians are constructed in connection with two examplesof su(2) nonlinear deformations such as introduced by Polychronakos andRo\v cek.
