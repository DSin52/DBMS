Method for computing scattering amplitudes of open strings with Dirichletboundary on one end and Neumann boundary condition on the other is described.Vertex operator for these states are constructed using twist fields which havebeen studied previously in the context of Ashkin-Teller model and strings onorbifolds. Using these vertex operators, we compute the three- and four-pointscattering amplitudes for (5,9) strings on 5-branes and 9-branes. In the lowenergy limit, these amplitudes are found to be in exact agreement with thefield theory amplitudes for supersymmetric Yang-Mills coupled tohypermultiplets in 6-dimensions. We also consider the 1-brane 5-brane systemand compute the amplitude for a pair of (1,5) strings to collide and to escapethe brane as a closed string. (1,5) strings are found to be remarkablyselective in their coupling to massless closed strings in NS-NS sector; theyonly couple to the dilaton.
