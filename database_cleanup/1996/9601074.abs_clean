We find black hole solutions to Euclidean 2+1 gravity coupled to arelativistic particle which have a dynamical conical singularity at thehorizon. These solutions mimic the tree level contribution to the partitionfunction of gravity coupled to a quantum field theory. They are found toviolate the standard area law for black hole entropy, their entropy beingproportional to the total opening angle. Since each solution depends on thenumber of windings of the particle path around the horizon, the significance oftheir summation in the path integral is considered.
