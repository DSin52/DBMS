We derive a simple formula for the periods associated with the low energyeffective action of $N=2$ supersymmetric $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory withmassive $N_f\le 3$ hypermultiplets.  This is given by evaluating explicitlythe integral associated to the elliptic curve using various identities ofhypergeometric functions. Following this formalism, we can calculate theprepotential with massive hypermultiplets both in the weak coupling regionand in the strong coupling region. In particular, we show how the Higgs fieldand its dual field are expressed as generalized hypergeometric functions whenthe theory has a conformal point.
