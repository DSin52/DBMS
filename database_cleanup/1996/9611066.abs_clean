Title: Target Space Supersymmetric Sigma Model Calculations

Authors: Jan de Boer (Berkeley) and Kostas Skenderis (Leuven)

Comments: LaTeX, 8 pages; to appear in proceedings of workshop on Gauge Theory,

Applied Supersymmetry and Gauge Theory, Imperial College, July 5-10 1996We briefly review the covariant formulation of the Green-Schwarz superstringby Berkovits, and describe how a detailed tree-level and one-loop analysis ofthis model leads, for the first time, to a derivation of the low-energyeffective action of the heterotic superstring while keeping target-spacesupersymmetry manifest. The resulting low-energy theory is old-minimalsupergravity coupled to tensor multiplet. The dilaton is part of thecompensator multiplet.
