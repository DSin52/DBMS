Motivated by the concept of shape invariance in supersymmetric quantummechanics, we obtain potentials whose spectrum consists of two shifted setsof equally spaced energy levels. These potentials are similar to theCalogero-Sutherland model except the singular term $\alpha x^{-2}$ alwaysfalls in the transition region $-1/4 < \alpha < 3/4$ and there is adelta-function singularity at x=0.
