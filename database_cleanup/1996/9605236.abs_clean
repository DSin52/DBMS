We consider an embedding of the extremal four-dimensionalReissner-Nordstr\"om black hole into type $IIB$ string theory. The equivalenttype $IIB$ configuration, in the D-brane weak-coupling picture, is a boundstate of D1- and D5-branes threaded by fundamental type $IIB$ strings. Thebound state involves also a NSNS solitonic 5-brane, mimicking the role of theKaluza-Klein magnetic monopole. The statistical entropy derived by counting thedegeneracy of the BPS-saturated excitations of this bound state agreesperfectly with the (semiclassical) Bekenstein-Hawking formula.
