on Physics, Moscow, May, 1996Using a field theory generalization of the spinning top motion, we constructnonabelian generalizations of the sine-Gordon theory according to eachsymmetric spaces. A Lagrangian formulation of these generalized sine-Gordontheories is given in terms of a deformed gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten action whichalso accounts for integrably perturbed coset conformal field theories. As forphysical applications, we show that they become precisely the effective fieldtheories of self-induced transparency in nonlinear optics. This provides adictionary between field theory and nonlinear optics.
