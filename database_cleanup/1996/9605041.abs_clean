In this paper we continue the investigation of an anisotropic integrable spinchain, consisting of spins $s=1$ and $s=\frac{1}{2}$, started in our paper\cite{meissner}. The thermodynamic Bethe ansatz is analysed especially for thecase, when the signs of the two couplings $\bar{c}$ and $\tilde{c}$ differ. Forthe conformally invariant model ($\bar{c}=\tilde{c}$) we have calculated heatcapacity and magnetic susceptibility at low temperature. In the isotropic limitour analysis is carried out further and susceptibilities are calculated nearphase transition lines (at $T=0$).
