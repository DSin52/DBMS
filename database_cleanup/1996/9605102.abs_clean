It is known from a work of Feigin and Frenkel that a Wakimoto type,generalized free field realization of the current algebra $\widehat{\cal G}_k$can be associated with each parabolic subalgebra ${\cal P}=({\cal G}_0+{\calG}_+)$ of the Lie algebra ${\cal G}$, where in the standard case ${\cal G}_0$is the Cartan and ${\cal P}$ is the Borel subalgebra. In this letter we obtainan explicit formula for the Wakimoto realization in the general case. UsingHamiltonian reduction of the WZNW model, we first derive a Poisson bracketrealization of the ${\cal G}$-valued current in terms of symplectic bosonsbelonging to ${\cal G}_+$ and a current belonging to ${\cal G}_0$. We thenquantize the formula by determining the correct normal ordering. We also showthat the affine-Sugawara stress-energy tensor takes the expected quadratic formin the constituents.
