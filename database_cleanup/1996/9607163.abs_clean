We study four dimensional $N=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories on $R^3 \timesS^1$ with a circle of radius $R$. They interpolate between four dimensionalgauge theories ($R=\infty$) and $N=4$ supersymmetric gauge theories in threedimensions ($R=0$). The vacuum structure can be determined quite precisely as afunction of $R$, agreeing with three and four-dimensional results in the twolimits.
