Non-trivial extensions of the three dimensional Poincar\'e algebra, beyondthe supersymmetric one, are explicitly constructed. These algebraic structuresare the natural three dimensional generalizations of fractional supersymmetryof order $F$ already considered in one and two dimensions. Representations ofthese algebras are exhibited, and unitarity is explicitly checked. It is thenshown that these extensions generate symmetries which connect fractional spinstates or anyons. Finally, a natural classification arises according to thedecomposition of $F$ into its product of prime numbers leading to sub-systemswith smaller symmetries.
