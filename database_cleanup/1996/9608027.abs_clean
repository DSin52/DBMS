The coordinate-free formulation of canonical quantization, achieved by aflat-space Brownian motion regularization of phase-space path integrals, isextended to a special class of closed first-class constrained systems that isbroad enough to include Yang-Mills type theories with an arbitrary compactgauge group. Central to this extension are the use of coherent state pathintegrals and of Lagrange multiplier integrations that engender projectionoperators onto the subspace of gauge invariant states.
