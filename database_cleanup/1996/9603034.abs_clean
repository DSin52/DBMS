We consider supersymmetric Sp(2N) gauge theories with F matter fields in thedefining representation, one matter field in the adjoint representation, and nosuperpotential. We construct a sequence of dual descriptions of this theoryusing the dualities of Seiberg combined with the ``deconfinement'' methodintroduced by Berkooz. Our duals hint at a new non-perturbative phenomenon thatsmall F some of the degrees of freedom form massless, non-interacting boundstates while the theory remains in an interacting non-Abelian Coulomb phase.This phenomenon is the result of strong coupling gauge dynamics in the originaldescription, but has a simple classical origin in the dual descriptions. Themethods used for constructing these duals can be generalized to any modelinvolving arbitrary 2-index tensor representations of Sp(2N), SO(N), or SU(N)groups.
