Title: On the Strong CP Problem without Axion Field

Comments: 7 pages, LaTex, no figures, the connection with the CP-problem is

emphasizedIn this letter we present a topological observation related to the CP problemin non-Abelian gauge theories, based on significant differences betweenspace-times and their Wick-rotation. We point out that models containingstationary black holes the problem of CP breaking does not appear.
