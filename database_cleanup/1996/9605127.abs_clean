We study the partition function for the low-energy edge excitations of theincompressible electron fluid. On an annular geometry, these excitations haveopposite chiralities on the two edges; thus, the partition function takes thestandard form of rational conformal field theories. In particular, it isinvariant under modular transformations of the toroidal geometry made by theangular variable and the compact Euclidean time. The Jain series of plateausW-infinity algebra of quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms, and theirnon-minimal version, the theories with U(1)xSU(m) affine algebra. We findmodular invariant partition functions for the latter models. Moreover, werelate the Wen topological order to the modular transformations and theVerlinde fusion algebra. We find new, non-diagonal modular invariants whichdescribe edge theories with extended symmetry algebra; their Hallconductivities match the experimental values beyond the Jain series.
