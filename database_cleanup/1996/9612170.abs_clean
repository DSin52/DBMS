The exact effective field equations of motion, corresponding to theperturbative mixed theory of open and closed (2,2) world-sheet supersymmetricstrings, are investigated. It is shown that they are only integrable in thecase of an abelian gauge group. The gravitational equations are then stationarywith respect to the Born-Infeld-type effective action.
