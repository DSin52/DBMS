We apply the SL(2,C) lattice Kac-Moody algebra of Alekseev, Faddeev andSemenov-Tian-Shansky to obtain a new lattice description of the SU(2) chiralmodel in two dimensions. The system has a global quantum group symmetry and itcan be regarded as a deformation of two different theories. One is thenonabelian Toda lattice which is obtained in the limit of infinite centralcharge, while the other is a nonstandard Hamiltonian description of the chiralmodel obtained in the continuum limit.
