A two-dimensional string model with dynamical cancellation of folds isconsidered. The action of the model contains the self-intersection number whichis defined for surfaces immersed into 4D targets. The two additional variablesare not dynamical and live on a compact manifold. In this sense the model is acompactification of a 4D theory. The cancellation forces the string $\th$ angleto be equal $\pi$. Candidates for string states are constructed. Somemathematical background is given.
