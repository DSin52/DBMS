In order to obtain a consistent formulation of octonionic quantum mechanics(OQM), we introduce left-right barred operators. Such operators enable us tofind the translation rules between octonionic numbers and $8\times 8$ realmatrices (a translation is also given for $4\times 4$ complex matrices). Wedevelop an octonionic relativistic free wave equation, linear in thederivatives. Even if the wave functions are only one-component we show thatfour independent solutions, corresponding to those of the Dirac equation,exist.
