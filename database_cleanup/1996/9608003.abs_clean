I review results from recent investigations of anomalies in fermion--YangMills systems in which basic notions from noncommutative geometry (NCG) wherefound to naturally appear. The general theme is that derivations of anomaliesfrom quantum field theory lead to objects which have a natural interpretationas generalization of de Rham forms to NCG, and that this allows a geometricinterpretation of anomaly derivations which is useful e.g. for making thesecalculations efficient. This paper is intended as selfcontained introduction tothis line of ideas, including a review of some basic facts about anomalies. Ifirst explain the notions from NCG needed and then discuss several differentalgebras, Chern--Simons terms from effective fermion actions in arbitrary odddimensions. I also discuss the descent equations which summarize much of thegeometric structure of anomalies, and I describe that these have a naturalgeneralization to NCG which summarize the corresponding structures on the levelof quantum field theory.Contribution to Proceedings of workshop `New Ideas in the Theory ofFundamental Interactions', Szczyrk, Poland 1995; to appear in Acta PhysicaPolonica B.
