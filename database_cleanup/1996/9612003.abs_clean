Title: Incorporating the Scale-Relativity Principle in String Theory and

Extended ObjectsAuthors: Carlos Castro (University of Texas and World Laboratory, Lausanne,

First steps in incorporating Nottale's scale-relativity principle to stringtheory and extended objects are taken. Scale Relativity is to scales whatmotion Relativity is to velocities. The universal, absolute, impassible,invariant scale under dilatations, in Nature, is taken to be the Planck scalewhich is not the same as the string scale. Starting with Nambu-Goto actions forstrings and other extended objects, we show that the principle ofscale-relativity invariance of the world-volume measure associated with theextended objects ( Lorentzian-scalings transformations with respect to theresolutions of the world-volume coordinates) is compatible with the vanishing$\beta^G_{\mu\nu}=\beta^X=0$, of the target spacetime metric and coordinates,respectively. Preliminary steps are taken to merge motion relativity with scalerelativity and, in this fashion, analogs of Weyl-Finsler geometries make theirappearance. The quantum case remains to be studied.
