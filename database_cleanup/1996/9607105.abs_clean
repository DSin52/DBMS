Four-dimensional supergravity theories are reinterpreted in a 12-dimensionalF-theory framework. The O(8) symmetry of N=8 supergravity is related to areduction of F-theory on T_8, with the seventy scalars formally associated, byO(8) triality, to a fully compactified four-form A_4. For the N=1 type I modelrecently obtained from the type IIB string on the Z orbifold, we identify theK\"ahler manifold of the untwisted scalars in the unoriented closed sector withthe generalized Siegel upper-half plane Sp(8,R)/(SU(4) \times U(1)). The SU(4)factor reflects the holonomy group of Calabi-Yau fourfolds.
