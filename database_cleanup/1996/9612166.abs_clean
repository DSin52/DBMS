The exact operator solutions of two-dimensional anomaly-free chiral abeliangauge theories are obtained. We show that anomaly-cancellation conditions ariseas consistency requirements of these solutions. For a certain class of flavoursymmetries, fermion condensates are constructed. These are shown to violate thefermion-number conservation rule. The models are extended to include massivefermions. We propose a bosonised lagrangian for the massive theory and verifythat it complies with the Gupta-Bleuler condition.
