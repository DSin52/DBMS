We show how toroidally-compactified eleven-dimensional supergravity can beconsistently truncated to yield a variety of maximally-supersymmetric``massive'' supergravities in spacetime dimensions $D\le 8$. The mass terms ariseas a consequence of making a more general ansatz than that in usualKaluza-Klein dimensional reduction, in which one or more axions are given anadditional linear dependence on one of the compactification coordinates. Thelower-dimensional theories are nevertheless consistent truncations ofeleven-dimensional supergravity. Owing to the fact that the generalisedreduction commutes neither with U-duality nor with ordinary dimensionalreduction, many different massive theories can result. The simplest examplesarise when just a single axion has the additional linear coordinate dependence.We find five inequivalent such theories in $D=7$, and 71 inequivalent ones in$D=4$. The massive theories admit no maximally-symmetric vacuum solution, butthey do admit $(D-2)$-brane solutions, i.e. domain walls, which preservehalf the supersymmetry. We present examples of these solutions, and theiroxidations to $D=11$. Some of the latter are new solutions of $D=11$supergravity.
