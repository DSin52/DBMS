We present a microscopic index formula for the degeneracy of dyons infour-dimensional N=4 string theory. This counting formula is manifestlysymmetric under the duality group, and its asymptotic growth reproduces themacroscopic Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We give a derivation of this result interms of the type II five-brane compactified on K3, by assuming that itsfluctuations are described by a closed string theory on its world-volume. Wefind that the degeneracies are given in terms of the denominator of ageneralized super Kac-Moody algebra. We also discuss the correspondence of thisresult with the counting of D-brane states.
