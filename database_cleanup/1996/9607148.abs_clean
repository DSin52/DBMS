Implications of string-string dualities to cosmological string vacua arediscussed. Cosmological vacua of classical string theories comprise of disjointclassses mapped one another by scale-factor T-duality. Each classes are,however, afflicted with initial/final cosmological singularities. It is arguedthat quantum string theories and string-string dualities dramatically resolvethese cosmological singularities out so that disjoint classical cosmologicalvacua are continuously connected in a unified manner. A natural inflationarycosmology follows from this.
