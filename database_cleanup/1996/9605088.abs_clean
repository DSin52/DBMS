The issue of spontaneous breaking of Lorentz and CPT invariance is studied inthe open bosonic string using a truncation scheme to saturate the string-fieldaction at successively higher levels. We find strong evidence for the existenceof extrema of the action with nonzero expectation values for certain fields.The Lorentz- and CPT-preserving solution previously suggested in the literatureis confirmed through level 12 in the action. A family of Lorentz-breaking,CPT-preserving solutions of the equations of motion is found to persist andconverge through level 18 in the action. Two sequences of solutionsspontaneously breaking both Lorentz invariance and CPT are discussed. Theanalysis at this level involves the analytical form of over 20,000 terms in thestatic potential.
