We address the issue of topological angles in the context of two dimensionalSU(N) Yang-Mills theory coupled to massive fermions in the adjointrepresentation. Classification of the resulting multiplicity of vacua iscarried outin terms of asymptotic fundamental Wilson loops, or equivalently,charges at the boundary of the world. We explicitly demonstrate that themultiplicity of vacuum states is equal to N for SU(N) gauge group. Differentworlds of the theory are classified by the integer number k=0,1,...N-1(superselection rules) which plays an analogous role to the $\theta$ parameterin QCD. Via two completely independent approaches we study the physicalproperties of these unconnected worlds as a function of k. First, we apply thewell known machinery of the loop calculus in order to calculate the effectivestring tensions in the theory as function of $k$. The second way of doing thesame physics is the standard particle/field theoretic calculation for thebinding potential of a pair of infinitely massive fermions. We also calculatethe vacuum energy as function of k.
