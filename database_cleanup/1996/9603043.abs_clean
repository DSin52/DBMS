We semi-classically calculate the entropy of a scalar field in the backgroundof the BTZ black hole, and derive the perimeter law of the entropy. The properlength from the horizon to the ultraviolet cutoff is independent of both themass and the angular momentum of the black hole. It is shown that thesuperradiant scattering modes give the sub-leading order contribution to theentropy while the non-superradiant modes give the leading order one, and thussuperradiant effect is minor.
