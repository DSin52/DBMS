The influence of spatial geometry on the vacuum polarization in2+1-dimensional spinor electrodynamics is investigated. The vacuum angularmomentum induced by an external static magnetic field is found to depend onglobal geometric surface characteristics connected with curvature. Therelevance of the results obtained for the fermion number fractionization isdiscussed.
