The Schrodinger picture description of vacuum states in curved spacetime isfurther developed. General solutions for the vacuum wave functional are givenfor both static and dynamic (Bianchi type I) spacetimes and for conformallystatic spacetimes of Robertson-Walker type. The formalism is illustrated forsimple cosmological models with time-dependent metrics and the phenomenon ofparticle creation is related to a special form of the kernel in the vacuum wavefunctional.
