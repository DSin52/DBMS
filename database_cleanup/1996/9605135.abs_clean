We suggest the quasiparticle picture behind the integrable structure of N=2SYM theory,which arises if the Lax operator is considered as a Hamiltonian forthe fermionic system. We compare the meaning of BPS states with the one comingfrom the D-brane interpretation and give some evidence for the compositeness ofthe selfdual strings. The temperature phase transition with the disappearanceof the mass gap is conjectured.
