We reconsider the issue of large-volume compactifications of the heteroticstring in light of the recent discoveries about strongly-coupled stringtheories. Our conclusion remains firmly negative with respect to classicalWhen the internal sixfold becomes large in heterotic units, the theory acquiresan additional threshold at energies much less then the naive Kaluza-Kleinscale. It is this additional threshold that imposes the ultimate limit on the4*10^7 Gev; for most compactifications, the actual limit is much higher.(Generically, M_{Kaluza Klein} > alpha_{GUT} M_{Planck} in either SO(32) orE_8*E_8 heterotic string.)
