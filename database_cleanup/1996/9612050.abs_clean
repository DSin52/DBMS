We demonstrate in two minisuperspace models that a perturbation expansion ofquasiclassical Euclidean gravity has a factorial dependence on the order of theterm at large orders. This behavior indicates that the expansion is anasymptotic series which is suggestive of an effective field theory. The seriesmay or may not be Borel summable depending on the classical solution expandedaround. We assume that only the positive action classical solution contributesto path integrals. We close with some speculative discussion on possibleimplications of the asymptotic nature of the expansion.
