We study the structures of partition functions of the large $N$ generalizedtwo-dimensional Yang-Mills theories ($gYM_2$) by recasting the higher Casimirs.We clarify the appropriate interpretations of them and try to extend theCordes-Moore-Ramgoolam's topological string model describing the ordinary$YM_2$ \cite{CMR} to those describing $gYM_2$. We present the expressions ofthe appropriate operators to reproduce the higher Casimir terms in $gYM_2$. Theconcept of ''deformed gravitational descendants'' will be introduced for thispurpose.
