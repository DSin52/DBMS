We propose the theory of quantum gravity with interactions introduced bytopological principle. The fundamental property of such a theory is that itsenergy-momentum tensor is an BRST anticommutator. Physical states are elementsof BRST cohomology group. The model with only topological excitations,introduced recently by Witten is discussed from the point of view of inducedgravity program. We find that the mass scale is induced dynamically bygravitational instantons. The low energy effective theory has gravitons, whichoccur as the collective excitations of geometry, when the metric becomesdynamical. Applications of cobordism theory to QG are discussed.
