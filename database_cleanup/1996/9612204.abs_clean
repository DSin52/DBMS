We show that the M-theory/IIA and IIA/IIB superstring dualities together withthe diffeomorphism invariance of the underlying theories require the presenceof certain p-brane bound states in IIA and IIB superstring theories preserving1/2 of the spacetime supersymmetry. We then confirm the existence of IIA andIIB supergravity solutions having the appropriate p-brane bound statesinterpretation.
