Connes has extended Einstein's principle of general relativity tononcommutative geometry. The new principle implies that the Dirac operator iscovariant with respect to Lorentz and internal gauge transformations and theDirac operator must include Yukawa couplings. It further implies that theaction for the metric, the gauge potentials and the Higgs scalar is coded inthe spectrum of the covariant Dirac operator. This ``universal'' action hasbeen computed by Chamseddine & Connes, it is the coupled Einstein-Hilbert andYang-Mills-Higgs action. This result is rederived and we discuss the physicalconsequences.
