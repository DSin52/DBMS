The Goddard, Nuyts and Olive conjecture for electric-magnetic duality inYang-Mills theory with an arbitrary gauge group G is extended by including anon-vanishing vacuum angle $\theta$. This extended S-duality conjectureincludes the case when the unbroken gauge group is non-abelian and a definiteprediction for the spectrum of dyons results.
