A 2D- fractional supersymmetry theory is algebraically constructed. TheLagrangian is derived using an adapted superspace including, in addition to ascalar field, two fields with spins 1/3,2/3. This theory turns out to be arational conformal field theory. The symmetry of this model goes beyond thesuper Virasoro algebra and connects these third-integer spin states. Besidesthe stress-momentum tensor, we obtain a supercurrent of spin 4/3. Cubicrelations are involved in order to close the algebra; the basic algebra is nolonger a Lie or a super-Lie algebra. The central charge of this model is foundto be 5/3. Finally, we analyse the form that a local invariant action shouldtake.
