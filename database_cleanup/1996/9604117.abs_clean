A quantum deformation of 3-dimensional lattice gauge theory is defined byapplying the Reshetikhin-Turaev functor to a Heegaard diagram associated to agiven cell complex. In the root-of-unity case, the construction is carried outwith a modular Hopf algebra. In the topological (weak-coupling) limit, thegauge theory partition function gives a 3-fold invariant, coinciding in thesimplicial case with the Turaev-Viro one. We discuss bounded manifolds as wellas links in manifolds. By a dimensional reduction, we obtain a q-deformed gaugetheory on Riemann surfaces and find a connection with the algebraicAlekseev-Grosse-Schomerus approach.
