We built up a explicit realization of (0+1)-dimensional q-deformed superspacecoordinates as operators on standard superspace. A q-generalization ofsupersymmetric transformations is obtained, enabling us to introduce scalarsuperfields and a q-supersymmetric action. We consider a functional integralbased on this action. Integration is implemented, at the level of thecoordinates and at the level of the fields, as traces over the correspondingrepresentation spaces. Evaluation of these traces lead us to standardfunctional integrals. The generation of a mass term for the fermion fieldleads, at this level, to an explicitely broken version of supersymmetricquantum mechanics.
