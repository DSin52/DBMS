We investigate the usefulness of the "string-inspired technique" for gaugetheory calculations in a constant external field background. Our approach isbased on Strassler's worldline path integral approach to the Bern-Kosowerformalism, and on the construction of worldline (super--) Green's functionsincorporating external fields as well as internal propagators. The worldlinepath integral representation of the gluon loop is reexamined in detail. Wecalculate the two-loop effective actions induced for a constant external fieldby a scalar and spinor loop, and the corresponding one-loop effective action inthe gluon loop case.
