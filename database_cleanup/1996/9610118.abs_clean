Quantum tunneling between degenerate ground states through the centralbarrier of a potential is extended to excited states with the instanton method.This extension is achieved with the help of an LSZ reduction technique as infield theory and may be of importance in the study of macroscopic quantumphenomena in magnetic systems.
