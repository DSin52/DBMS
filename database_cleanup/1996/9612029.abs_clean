We present an elementary derivation of the soliton-like solutions in the$A_n^{(1)}$ Toda models which is alternative to the previously used Hirotamethod. The solutions of the underlying linear problem corresponding to theN-solitons are calculated. This enables us to obtain explicit expression forthe element which by dressing group action, produces a generic solitonsolution. In the particular example of monosolitons we suggest a relation tothe vertex operator formalism, previously used by Olive, Turok and Underwood.Our results can also be considered as generalization of the approach to thesine-Gordon solitons, proposed by Babelon and Bernard.
