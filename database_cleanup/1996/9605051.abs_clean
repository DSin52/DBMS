We construct generating solutions for general D-dimensional ($4 \le D \le 9$)rotating, electrically charged, black holes in the effective action oftoroidally compactified heterotic (or Type IIA) string. The generating solutionis parameterized by the ADM mass, two electric charges and $[{D-1}\over 2]$angular momenta (as well as the asymptotic values of one toroidal modulus andthe dilaton field). For $D \ge 6$, those are generating solutions for {\itgeneral} black holes in toroidally compactified heterotic (or type IIA) string.Since in the BPS-limit (extreme limit) these solutions have singular horizonsor naked singularities, we address the near extreme solutions with all theangular momenta small enough. In this limit, the thermodynamic entropy can becast in a suggestive form, which has a qualitative interpretation asmicroscopic entropy of (near)-BPS-saturated charged string states of toroidallycompactified heterotic string, whose target-space angular momenta areidentified as $[{{D-1}\over 2}]$ U(1) left-moving world-sheet currents.
