We obtain a family of type IIB superstring backgrounds involvingRamond-Ramond fields in ten dimensions starting from a heterotic stringbackground with vanishing gauge fields. To this end the global $SL(2,R)$symmetry of the type IIB equations of motion is implemented as a solutiongenerating transformation. Using a geometrical analysis we show that the typeIIB backgrounds obtained are solutions to all orders in $\alpha^{\prime}$.
