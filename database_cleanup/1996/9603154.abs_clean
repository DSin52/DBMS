In this paper, we present a new solution for the effective theory ofMaxwell--Einstein--Dilaton, Low energy string and Kaluza--Klein theories, whichcontains among other solutions the well known Kaluza--Klein monopole solutionof Gross--Perry--Sorkin as special case. We show also the magnetic and electricdipole solutions contained in the general one.
