We present new regular static isolated cylindrically symmetric solutions forthe Ginzburg-Landau model which have finite Gibbs free energy. Theseconfigurations (which we call the {\it flux tube} and {\it type B} solutions)are energetically favorable in the interval of the external magnetic fieldsbetween the thermodynamic critical value $H_{c}$ and the upper critical field$H_{c_2}$ which indicates that they are important new elements of the mixedstate describing a transition from vortices to the normal state.
