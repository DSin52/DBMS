Higher dimensional Chern-Simons theories, even though constructed along thesame topological pattern as in 2+1 dimensions, have been shown recently to havegenerically a non-vanishing number of degrees of freedom. In this paper, wecarry out the complete Dirac Hamiltonian analysis (separation of first andsecond class constraints and calculation of the Dirac bracket) for a groupGxU(1). We also study the algebra of surface charges that arise in the presenceof boundaries and show that it is isomorphic to the WZW4 discussed in theliterature. Some applications are then considered. It is shown, in particular,that Chern-Simons gravity in dimensions greater than or equal to five has apropagating torsion.
