A general structure of effective action in new chiral superfield modelassociated with $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity is investigated. This modelcorresponds to finite quantum field theory and does not demand theregularization and renormalization at effective action calculation. It is shownthat in local approximation the effective action is defined by two objectscalled general superfield effective lagrangian and chiral superfield effectivelagrangian. A proper-time method is generalized for calculation of these twoeffective lagrangians in superfield manner. Power expansion of the effectiveaction in supercovariant derivatives is formulated and the lower terms of suchan expansion are calculated in explicit superfield form.
