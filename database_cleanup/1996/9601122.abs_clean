We make some comments on the renormalization of Wilson operators (not justvacuum -expectation values of Wilson operators), and the features which arisein Minkowski space. If the Wilson loop contains a straight light-like segment,charge renormalization does not work in a simple graph-by-graph way; but doeswork when certain graphs are added together. We also verify that, in a simpleexample of a smooth loop in Minkowski space, the existence of pairs of pointswhich are light-like separated does not cause any extra divergences.
