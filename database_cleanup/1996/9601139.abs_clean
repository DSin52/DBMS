Chepelev former Hla Win PeWe consider matrix-model representations of the meander problem whichdescribes, in particular, combinatorics for foldings of closed polymer chains.We introduce a supersymmetric matrix model for describing the principal meandernumbers. This model is of the type proposed by Marinari and Parisi fordiscretizing a superstring in D=1 while the supersymmetry is realized in D=0 asa rotational symmetry between bosonic and fermionic matrices. Usingnon-commutative sources, we reformulate the meander problem in a BoltzmannianFock space whose annihilation and creation operators obey the Cuntz algebra. Wediscuss also the relation between the matrix models describing the meanderproblem and the Kazakov-Migdal model on a D-dimensional lattice.
