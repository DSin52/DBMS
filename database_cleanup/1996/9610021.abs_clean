I review some recent work that describes the close analogy between self-dualYang--Mills amplitudes and QCD amplitudes with external gluons of positivehelicity. This analogy is carried at tree level for amplitudes with twoexternal quarks and up to one-loop for amplitudes involving only externalgluons.
