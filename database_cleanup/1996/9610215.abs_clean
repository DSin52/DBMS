We study the production and the equilibration of a non-Abelian $q\bar{q}$plasma in an external chromoelectric field, by solving the Boltzmann equationwith the non-Abelian features explicitly incorporated. We consider the gaugegroup $SU(2)$ and show that the colour degree of freedom has a major anddominant role in the dynamics of the system. It is seen that the assumption ofthe so called Abelian dominance is not justified. Finally, it is also shownthat many of the features of microscopic studies of the system appear naturallyin our studies as well.
