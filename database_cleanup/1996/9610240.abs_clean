AmbiguityAuthors: R. Banerjee

We present a gauge independent Lagrangian method of abstracting the reducedspace of a solvable model with Gribov-like ambiguity, recently proposed byFriedberg, Lee, Pang and Ren. The reduced space is found to agree with theexplicit solutions obtained by these authors. Complications related to gaugefixing are analysed. The Gribov ambiguity manifests by a nonuniqueness in thecanonical transformations mapping the hamiltonian in the afflicted gauge withthat obtained gauge independently. The operator ordering problem in this gaugeis investigated and a prescription is suggested so that the results coincidewith the usual hamiltonian formalism using the Schr\"odinger representation.Finally, a Dirac analysis of the model is elaborated. In this treatment it isshown how the existence of a nontrivial canonical set in the ambiguity-riddengauge yields the connection with the previous hamiltonian formalism.
