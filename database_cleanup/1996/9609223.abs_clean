Quantum dissipation in thermal environment is investigated, using the pathintegral approach. The reduced density matrix of the harmonic oscillator systemcoupled to thermal bath of oscillators is derived for arbitrary spectrum ofbath oscillators. Time evolution and the end point of two-body decay ofparticles undergo the exponential decay, followed by the power law decay andfinally ending in a mixed state of residual particles containing contributionsfrom both on and off the mass shell, whose abundance does not suffer from theBoltzmann suppression.
