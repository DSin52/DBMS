Comments: 31 pages, 1 Latex file and 8 Postscript files

The canonical front form Hamiltonian for non-Abelian SU(N) gauge theory in3+1 dimensions is mapped on an effective Hamiltonian which acts only in theFock space of one quark and one antiquark. The approach is non-perturbative andexact. It is based on Discretized Light-Cone Quantization and the Method ofIterated Resolvents. The method resums the diagrams of perturbation theory toall orders in the coupling constant and is free of Tamm-Dancoff truncations inthe Fock-space. Emphasis is put on dealing accurately with the many-bodyaspects of gauge field theory. Pending future renormalization group analysisthe running coupling is derived to all orders in the bare couplingconstant.~--- The derived effective interaction has an amazingly simplestructure and is gauge invariant and frame independent. It is solvable on asmall computer like a work station. The many-body amplitudes can be retrievedself-consistently from these solutions, by quadratures without solving anothereigenvalue problem. The structures found allow also for developing simplephenomenological models consistent with non-Abelian gauge field theory.
