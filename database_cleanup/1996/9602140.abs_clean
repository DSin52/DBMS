In this paper, we study the actions of the Weyl groups of the U dualitygroups for type IIA string theory toroidally compactified to all dimensions$D\ge 3$. We show how these Weyl groups implement permutations of the fieldstrengths, and we discuss the Weyl group multiplets of all supersymmetric$p$-brane solitons.
