Journal-ref: J.Korean Phys.Soc. 29 (1996) 559-562

We examine the detail of the analytic structure of an exact analytic solutionof three anyons, which interpolates to the fermion ground state in a harmonicpotential well. The analysis is done on the fundamental domain with appropriateboundary conditions. Some remarks on the hard-core conditions andself-adjointness are made.
