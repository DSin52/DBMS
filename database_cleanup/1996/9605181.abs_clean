Conventional weak-coupling perturbation theory suffers from problems thatarise from resonant coupling of successive orders in the perturbation series.Multiple-scale perturbation theory avoids such problems by implicitlyperforming an infinite reordering and resummation of the conventionalperturbation series. Multiple-scale analysis provides a good description of theclassical anharmonic oscillator. Here, it is extended to study the Heisenbergoperator equations of motion for the quantum anharmonic oscillator. Theanalysis yields a system of nonlinear operator differential equations, which issolved exactly. The solution provides an operator mass renormalization of thetheory.
