Compactifying the $E_8$ non-critical string in 6D down to 5D the 6D stringsgive rise to particles and strings in 5D. Using the dual M-theory descriptioncompactified on an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau we compare some of the 5DBPS states to what one expects from non-critical strings with an $E_8$ chiralcurrent algebra. The $E_8$ multiplets of particle states comprise of 2-braneswrapping on irreducible curves together with bound states of several 2-branes.
