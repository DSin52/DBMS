Title: A Nonlocal Transcendental Realization of the Sugawara Operators at

Arbitrary LevelAuthors: R. W. Gebert (IAS, Princeton, U.S.A.)

Comments: 5 pages, LaTeX 2e, talk presented at XXI International Colloquium on

Group Theoretical Methods in Physics, 15 - 20 July 1996, Goslar, GermanyA recently found new free field realization of the affine Sugawara operatorsat arbitrary level is reviewed, which involves exponentials of the well-knownDDF operators in string theory.
