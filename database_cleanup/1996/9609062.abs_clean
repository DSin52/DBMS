We explicitly determine the instanton corrections to the prepotential for N=2supersymmetric SU(3) Yang-Mills theory with massless hypermultiplets in theweak coupling regions $u\to\infty$ and $v\to\infty$. We construct thePicard-Fuchs equations for $N_f<6$ and calculate the monodromies usingPicard-Lefschetz theorem for $N_f=2,4$. For all $N_f<6$ the instantoncorrections to the prepotential are determined using the relation between $Tr<\phi^2>$ and the prepotential.
