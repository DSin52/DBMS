The homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation is solved in the quenched ladderapproximation for the vector positronium states of 4-component quantumelectrodynamics in 2 space and 1 time dimensions. Fermion propagator input isfrom a Rainbow approximation Dyson-Schwinger solution, with a broad range offermion masses considered. This work is an extension of earlier work on thescalar spectrum of the same model. The non-relativistic limit is alsoconsidered via the large fermion mass limit. Classification of states via theirtransformation properties under discrete parity transformations allowsanalogies to be drawn with the meson spectrum of QCD.
