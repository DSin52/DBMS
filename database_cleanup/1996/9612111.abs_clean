It is shown that the four dimensional antiferromagnetic lattice phi4 modelhas the usual non-asymptotically free scaling law in the UV regime around thechiral symmetrical critical point. The theory describes a scalar and apseudoscalar particle. A continuum effective theory is derived for lowenergies. A possibility of constructing a model with a single chiral boson ismentioned.
