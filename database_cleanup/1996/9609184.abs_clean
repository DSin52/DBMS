The $N=4$ SU(2)$_k$ superconformal algebra has the global automorphism ofSO(4) $\approx$ SU(2)$\times$SU(2) with the {\it left} factor as the Kac-Moodygauge symmetry. As a consequence, an infinite set of independent algebraslabeled by $\rho$ corresponding to the conjugate classes of the {\it outer}automorphism group SO(4)/SU(2)=SU(2) are obtained \`a la Schwimmer and Seiberg.We construct Feigin-Fuchs representations with the $\rho$ parameter embeddedfor the infinite set of the $N=4$ nonequivalent algebras. In our constructionthe extended global SU(2) algebras labeled by $\rho$ are self-consistentlyrepresented by fermion fields with appropriate boundary conditions.
