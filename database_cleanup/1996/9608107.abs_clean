A systematic method of constructing manifestly supersymmetric$1+1$-dimensional KP Lax hierarchies is presented. Closed expressions for theLax operators in terms of superfield eigenfunctions are obtained. All hierarchyequations being eigenfunction equations are shown to be automatically invariantunder the (extended) supersymmetry. The supersymmetric Lax models existing inthe literature are found to be contained (up to a gauge equivalence) in ourformalism.
