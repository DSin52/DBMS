Title: String loop correction and the condensation of tachyon in 2d gravity

Authors: Kazuo Ghoroku

Comments: 13 pages, latex

Quantum theory of 2d gravity is examined by including a special quantumcorrection, which corresponds to the open string loop corrections and providesa new conformal anomaly for the corresponding $\sigma$ model. This anomalyleads to the condensation of the tachyon, and the resultant effective theoryimplies a possibility of extending the 2d gravity to the case of $c>1$.
