We discuss the singularities in the moduli space of string compactificationsto six dimensions with $N=1$ supersymmetry. Such singularities arise fromeither massless particles or non-critical tensionless strings. The points withtensionless strings are sometimes phase transition points between differentphases of the theory. These results appear to connect all known $N=1$supersymmetric six-dimensional vacua.
