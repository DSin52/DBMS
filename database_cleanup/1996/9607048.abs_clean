By using the gauge Ward identities, we study correlation functions of gaugedWZNW models. We show that the gauge dressing of the correlation functions canbe taken into account as a solution of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation. Ourmethod is analogous to the analysis of the gravitational dressing of 2D fieldtheories.
