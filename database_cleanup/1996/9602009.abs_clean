A dynamical non-abelian two-form potential gives masses to vector bosons viaa topological coupling. Unlike in the abelian case, the two-form cannot bedualized to Goldstone bosons. Duality is restored by coupling a flat connectionto the theory in a particular way, and the new action is then dualized to anon-linear sigma model. The presence of the flat connection is crucial, whichsaves the original mechanism of Higgs-free topological mass generation frombeing dualized to a sigma model.
