Title: From Nonperturbative SUSY Gauge Theories to Integrable Systems

Comments: 10 pages, LaTeX, no figures; based on a talk given at 10th

International Conference Problems of Quantum Field Theory, 13-18 May 1996,Alushta, UkraineI review the appearence of integrable structures in the formulation of exactnonperturbative solutions to $4d$ supersymmetric quantum gauge theories.Various examples of ${\cal N}\geq 2$ SUSY Yang-Mills nonperturbative solutionsare adequately described in terms of the (deformations of the) finite-gap$\tau$-function. One of the basic definitions of generating differential isdiscussed and its role in the theory of integrable systems is demonstrated.
