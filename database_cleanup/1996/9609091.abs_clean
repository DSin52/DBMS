Title: Quantum Groups and Quantum Field Theory in Rindler Space-Time

Comments: LaTex file, 13 pages

Quantum Field Theory (QFT) developed in Rindler space-time and its thermalproperties are analyzed by means of quantum groups approach. The quantumdeformation parameter, labelling the unitarily inequivalent representations,turns out to be related to the acceleration of the Rindler frame.
