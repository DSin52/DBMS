Renormalization Group - 96, Dubna, Russia, 26 - 31 August 1996The loop-expansion of the effective potential in the $O(N)$-symmetric$\phi^4$-model contains generically two types of large logarithms. To resumthose systematically a new minimal two-scale subtraction scheme $\tMS$ isintroduced in an $O(N)$-invariant generalization of $\MS$. As the $\tMS$ betafunctions depend on the renormalization scale-ratio a large logarithmsresummation is performed on them. Two partial $\tMS$ renormalization groupequations are derived to turn the beta functions into $\tMS$ runningparameters. With the use of standard perturbative boundary conditions, whichbecome applicable in $\tMS$, the leading logarithmic $\tMS$ effective potentialis computed. The calculation indicates that there is no stable vacuum in thebroken phase of the theory for $1<N\leq 4$.
