A path-integral quantization on a homogeneous space G/H is proposed based onthe guiding principle `first lift to G and then project to G/H'. It is thenshown that this principle gives a simple procedure to obtain the inequivalentquantizations (superselection sectors) along with the holonomy factor (inducedgauge field) found earlier by algebraic approaches. We also prove that theresulting matrix-valued path-integral is physically equivalent to thescalar-valued path-integral derived in the Dirac approach, and thereby presenta unified viewpoint to discuss the basic features of quantizing on $G/H$obtained in various approaches so far.
