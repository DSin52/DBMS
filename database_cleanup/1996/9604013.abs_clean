We examine non-abelian duality transformations in the open string case. Aftergauging the isometries of the target space and developing the generalformalism, we study in details the duals oftarget spaces with SO(N) isometrieswhich, for the SO(2) case, reduces to the known abelian T-duals. We apply theformalism to electrically and magnetically charged 4D black hole solutions and,as in the abelian case, dual coordinates satisfy Dirichlet conditions.
