We analyze how string theory dualities may be described in M theory. Tdualities arise from scalar-vector dualities in the worldvolume of the membraneof M theory. ``Electric-magnetic'' dualities arise from a dualitytransformation in M theory compactified on a 3-torus, which takes the membraneinto a fivebrane wrapped around the 3-torus.
