A detailed quantitative analysis of the transition process mediated by asphaleron type non-Abelian gauge field configuration in a static Einsteinuniverse is carried out. By examining spectra of the fluctuation operators andapplying the zeta function regularization scheme, a closed analyticalexpression for the transition rate at the one-loop level is derived. This is aunique example of an exact solution for a sphaleron model in $3+1$ spacetimedimensions.
