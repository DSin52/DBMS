Planckian scattering of particles with angular momenta is studied bydescribing them as sources of Kerr metric. In the shock wave formalism, it isfound that the angular momenta do not contribute to the scattering amplitude inthe eikonal limit. This is confirmed by using the wave equation of the testparticle in the Kerr background.
