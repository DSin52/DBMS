The action of the isometry subgroup which preserves the trivial values of thefields is studied for the stationary D=4 Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton--Axiontheory. The technique for generation of charges and the corresponding procedurefor construction of new solutions is formulated. A solution describing thedouble rotating dyon with independent values of all physical charges ispresented.
