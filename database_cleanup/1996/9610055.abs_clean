As in an earlier paper we start from the hypothesis that physics on thePlanck scale should be described by means of concepts taken from ``discretemathematics''. This goal is realized by developing a scheme being based on thedynamical evolution of a particular class of ``cellular networks'' beingcapable of performing an ``unfolding phase transition'' from a (presumed)chaotic initial phase towards a new phase which acts as an ``attractor'' intotal phase space and which carries a fine or super structure which isidentified as the discrete substratum underlying ordinary continuous space-time(or rather, the physical vacuum). Among other things we analyze the internalstructure of certain particular subclusters of nodes/bonds (maximal connectedsubsimplices, $mss$) which are the fundamental building blocks of this newphase and which are conjectured to correspond to the ``physical points'' ofordinary space-time. Their mutual entanglement generates a certain near- andfar-order, viz. a causal structure within the network which is again set intorelation with the topological/metrical and causal/geometrical structure ofcontinuous space-time. The mathematical techniques to be employed consistmainly of a blend of a fair amount of ``stochastic mathematics'' with severalrelatively advanced topics of discrete mathematics like the ``theory ofrandom graphs'' or ``combinatorial graph theory''. Our working philosophy isit to create a scenario in which it becomes possible to identify both gravityand quantum theory as the two dominant but derived(!) aspects of an underlyingdiscrete and more primordial theory (dynamical cellular network) on a muchcoarser level of resolution, viz. continuous space-time.
