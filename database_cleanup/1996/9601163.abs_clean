We demonstrate that all rational models of the N=2 super Virasoro algebra arealgebra (for which we give a physically motivated derivation) explicitly forcertain theories, we analyse the modular properties of some of the vacuumcharacters, and we use the coset realisation of the algebra in terms of su_2and two free fermions.Some of our arguments generalise to the Kazama-Suzuki models indicating thatall rational N=2 supersymmetric models might be unitary.
