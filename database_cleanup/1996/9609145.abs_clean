We calculate the effective prepotentials for N=2 supersymmetric SO(N_c) andSp(N_c) gauge theories, with an arbitrary number of hypermultiplets in thedefining representation, from restrictions of the prepotentials for suitableN=2 supersymmetric gauge theories with unitary gauge groups. (This extendsprevious work in which the prepotential for N=2 supersymmetric SU(N_c) gaugetheories was evaluated from the exact solution constructed out of spectralcurves.) The prepotentials have to all orders the logarithmic singularities ofthe one-loop perturbative corrections, as expected from non-renormalizationtheorems. We evaluate explicitly the contributions of one- and two-instantonprocesses.
