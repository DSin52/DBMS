It is known that the naive version of D-brane theory is inadequate to explainthe black hole entropy in the limit in which the Schwarzschild radius becomeslarger than all compactification radii. We present evidence that a moreconsistent description can be given in terms of strings with rescaled tensions.We show that the rescaling can be interpreted as a redshift of the tension of afundamental string in the gravitational field of the black hole. An interestingconnection is found between the string level number and the Rindler energy.Using this connection, we reproduce the entropies of Schwarzschild black holesin arbitrary dimensions in terms of the entropy of a single string at theHagedorn temperature.
