2947In 1+1 dimensions two different formulations exist of SU(N) Yang Millstheories in light-cone gauge; only one of them gives results which comply withthe ones obtained in Feynman gauge. Moreover the theory, when considered in1+(D-1) dimensions, looks discontinuous in the limit D=2. All those featuresare proven in Wilson loop calculations as well as in the study of the $q\bar q$bound state integral equation in the large N limit.
