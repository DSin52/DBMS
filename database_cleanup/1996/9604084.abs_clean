Title: Peak and end point of the relic graviton background in string cosmology

Authors: R. Brustein, M. Gasperini and G. Veneziano

Comments: 11 pages, LATEX, one figure included using eps. A complete collection

Using general arguments we determine the allowed region for the end pointfrequency and the peak energy density of the stochastic background of gravitywaves expected in string cosmology. We provide an accurate estimate of theminimal experimental sensitivity required to detect a signal in the Hz to GHzrange.
