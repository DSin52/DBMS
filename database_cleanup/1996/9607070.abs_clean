The free action for massless Ramond-Ramond fields is derived from closedsuperstring field theory using the techniques of Siegel and Zwiebach. For theuncompactified Type IIB superstring, this gives a manifestly Lorentz-covariantaction for a self-dual five-form field strength. Upon compactification to fourdimensions, the action depends on a U(1) field strength from 4D N=2supergravity. However, unlike the standard Maxwell action, this action ismanifestly invariant under the electromagnetic duality transformation whichrotates $F_{mn}$ into $\epsilon_{mnpq} F^{pq}$.
