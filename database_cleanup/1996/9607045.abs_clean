Title: Asymptotic Limits and Sum Rules for Propagators in Quantum

ChromodynamicsComments: 42 pages, Latex

In gauge field theories with asymptotic freedom, the short distanceproperties of Green's functions can be obtained on the basis of weak couplingperturbation expansions. Within this framework, the large momentum behavior ofthe structure functions for gluon, quark and ghost propagators is derived. Thelimits are found for general, covariant, linear gauges, and in all directionsof the complex $k^2-$plane. Except for the coefficients, the functional formsof the leading asymptotic terms for the various structure functions areindependent of the gauge parameter. They are determined exactly in terms ofone-loop expressions (two-loop expressions in cases where one-loop termsvanish). With the exception of the Landau gauge, the asymptotic expressions forthe gauge field propagator play an important r\^{o}le for the correspondinglimits of quark and ghost propagators. For {\it all} gauges considered, it isthe sign of the one-loop anomalous dimension coefficient of the gluon field inLandau gauge (as a fixed point of the gauge parameter) which is of considerablerelevance for the asymptotics of the various propagators. The bounds obtainedfrom the asymptotic expressions, together with the analytic properties of thestructure functions, generally lead to un-subtracted dispersionrepresentations. In special cases, for a limited number of flavors, sum rulesare obtained for the discontinuities along the real axis. The sum rule for thegluon propagator is a generalization of the superconvergence relation derivedpreviously in the Landau gauge.
