Title: On Zero-Mass Bound States in Super-Membrane Models

Authors: Jens Hoppe

Comments: 6 pages Latex

For the simplest case of a supermembrane matrix model, various symmetryreductions are given, with the fermionic contribution(s) (to an effectiveSchr\"odinger equation) corresponding to an attractive $\delta$-functionpotential (towards zero-area configurations). The differential equations arereal, and are shown not to admit square-integrable real solutions (even whenallowing non-vanishing boundary conditions at infinity). Complex solutions,however, are not excluded by this argument.
