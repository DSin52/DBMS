Domain walls in strongly coupled gauge theories are discussed. A generalmechanism is suggested automatically leading to massless gauge bosons localizedon the wall. In one of the models considered, outside the wall the theory is inthe non-Abelian confining phase, while inside the wall it is in the AbelianCoulomb phase. Confining property of the non-Abelian theories is a keyingredient of the mechanism which may be of practical use in the context of thedynamic compactification scenarios.In supersymmetric (N=1) Yang-Mills theories the energy density of the wallcan be exactly calculated in the strong coupling regime. This calculationpresents a further example of non-trivial physical quantities that can be foundexactly by exploiting specific properties of supersymmetry. A key observationis the fact that the wall in this theory is a BPS-saturated state.
