Two-step mechanisms in the $N\bar{N}$ annihilation and their role in the OZIrule violating reactions are discussed. In particular the two mesonrescattering mechanism for $\pi\phi$ channel including all off-shell effects istypically two orders of magnitude bigger than the OZI tree level expectationand explains the observed ratio $\phi \pi/\omega \pi$ in the annihilation atrest. The rates for the final states including photons, $\gamma\omega$ and$\gamma\phi$, can be explained in the vector dominance model. The observed ratefor $p\bar{p}\to\gamma\omega$ is suppressed due to destructive interferencebetween the intermediate $\rho$ and $\omega$ states while the interference in$p\bar{p}\to\gamma\phi$ is required to be constructive leading to a large ratio$\gamma\phi/\gamma\omega$.
