Title: Large $N$ Matrix Models and $q$-Deformed Quantum Field Theories

Comments: 17 pages, latex. To appear in "From Field Theory to Quantum Groups",

World Scientific. Proceedings to honor J.Lukierski in his 60th birthdayRecently it was shown that an asymptotic behaviour of $SU(N)$ gauge theoryfor large $N$ is described by q-deformed quantum field. The master fields forlarge N theories satisfy to standard equations of relativistic field theory butfields satisfy $q$-deformed commutation relations with $q=0$. These commutationrelations are realized in the Boltzmannian Fock space. The master field forgauge theory does not take values in a finite-dimensional Lie algebra howeverthere is a non-Abelian gauge symmetry. The gauge master field for a subclass ofplanar diagrams, so called half-planar diagrams, is also considered. Arecursive set of master fields summing up a matreoshka of 2-particles reducibleplanar diagrams is briefly described.
