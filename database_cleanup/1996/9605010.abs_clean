We explicitly construct massive (0,4) supersymmetric ADHM sigma models whichhave heterotic p-brane solitons as their conformal fixed points. These yieldthe familiar gauge 5-brane and a new 1-brane solution which preserve 1/2 and1/4 of the spacetime supersymmetry respectively. We also discuss an analogousconstruction for the type II NS-NS p-branes using (4,4) supersymmetric models.
