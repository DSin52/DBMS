A modification of the Abelian Duality transformations is proposedguaranteeing that a (not necessarily conformally invariant) $\sigma$-model bequantum equivalent (at least up to two loops in perturbation theory) to itsdual. This requires a somewhat non standard perturbative treatment of the {\sldual} $\sigma$-model. Explicit formulae of the modified duality transformationare presented for a special class of block diagonal purely metric$\sigma$-models.
