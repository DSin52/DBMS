Title: Disorder Operators, Quantum Doubles, and Haag Duality in 1+1 Dimensions

Authors: Michael Mueger

Comments: 8 pages, latex, 1 figure. Seminar given at the NATO ASI `Quantum

Fields and Quantum Spacetime', Carg\`ese, 1996We demonstrate the role of Drinfeld's quantum double D(G) as a spontaneouslybroken hidden symmetry in a large class of massive quantum field theories in1+1 dimensions with compact symmetry group G. Our considerations areindependent of exact integrability. The main technical ingredient is anassumption concerning the statistical independence of fields localized inspacelike separated regions which should hold in all reasonable massive models.The present note is an abridged version of hep-th/9606175.
