In a Wheeler-de Witt approach to quantum string cosmology, the present stateof the Universe arises from the scattering and reflection of the wave functionrepresenting the initial string vacuum in superspace. This scenario isdescribed and compared with the more conventional quantum cosmology picture, inwhich the birth of the Universe is represented as a process of tunnelling "fromnothing" in superspace.
