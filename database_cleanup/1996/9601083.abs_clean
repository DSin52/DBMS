Typically the moduli fields acquire mass m =C H in the early universe, whichshifts the position of the minimum of their effective potential and leads to anexcessively large energy density of the oscillating moduli fields at the laterstages of the evolution of the universe. This constitutes the cosmologicalmoduli problem, or Polonyi field problem. We show that the cosmological moduliproblem can be solved or at least significantly relaxed in the theories inwhich C >> 1, as well as in some models with C << 1.
