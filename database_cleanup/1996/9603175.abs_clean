The thermodynamical one-loop entropy $S^{TD}$ of a two-dimensional black holein thermal equilibrium with the massless quantum gas is calculated. It is shownthat $S^{TD}$ includes the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, evaluated for thequantum corrected geometry, and the finite difference of statistical mechanicalentropies $-Tr\hat{\rho}\ln\hat{\rho}$ for the gas on the black hole andRindler spaces. This result demonstrates in an explicit form that the relationbetween thermodynamical and statistical-mechanical entropies of a black hole isnon-trivial and requires special subtraction procedure.
