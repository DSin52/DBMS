Title: Quantum mechanics in multiply connected spaces

Comments: Latex 15 pages

This paper analyses quantum mechanics in multiply connected spaces. It isshown that the multiple connectedness of the configuration space of a physicalsystem can determine the quantum nature of physical observables, such as theangular momentum. In particular, quantum mechanics in compactified Kaluza-Kleinspaces is examined. These compactified spaces give rise to an additionalangular momentum which can adopt half-integer values and, therefore, may beidentified with the intrinsic spin of a quantum particle.
