We propose a generalization of non-commutative geometry and gauge theoriesbased on ternary Z_3-graded structures. In the new algebraic structures wedefine, we leave all products of two entities free, imposing relations onternary products only. These relations reflect the action of the Z_3-group,which may be either trivial, i.e. abc=bca=cab, generalizing the usualcommutativity, or non-trivial, i.e. abc=jbca, with j=e^{(2\pi i)/3}. The usualZ_2-graded structures such as Grassmann, Lie and Clifford algebras aregeneralized to the Z_3-graded case. Certain suggestions concerning the eventualuse of these new structures in physics of elementary particles are exposed.
