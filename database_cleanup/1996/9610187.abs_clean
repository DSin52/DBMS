We investigate the structure of an infinite-dimensional symmetry of thefour-dimensional K\"ahler WZW model, which is a possible extension of thetwo-dimensional WZW model. We consider the SL(2,R) group and, using the Gaussdecomposition method, we derive a current algebra identified with atwo-toroidal Lie algebra, a generalization of the affine Kac-Moody algebra. Wealso give an expression of the energy-momentum tensor in terms of currents andextra terms.
