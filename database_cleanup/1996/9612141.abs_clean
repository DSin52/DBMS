We consider several orbifold compactifications of M-theory and theircorresponding type II duals in two space-time dimensions. In particular, weshow that while the orbifold compactification of M-theory on $T^9/J_9$ is dualto the orbifold compactification of type IIB string theory on $T^8/I_8$, thesame orbifold $T^8/I_8$ of type IIA string theory is dual to M-theorycompactified on a smooth product manifold $K3 \times T^5$. Similarly, while theorbifold compactification of M-theory on $(K3 \times T^5)/\sigma ... J_5$ isdual to the orbifold compactification of type IIB string theory on $(K3 \timesT^4)/\sigma ... I_4$, the same orbifold of type IIA string theory is dual tothe orbifold $T^4 \times (K3 \times S^1)/\sigma ... J_1$ of M-theory. Thespectrum of various orbifold compactifications of M-theory and type II stringtheories on both sides are compared giving evidence in favor of these dualityconjectures. We also comment on a connection between Dasgupta-Mukhi-Wittenconjecture and Dabholkar-Park-Sen conjecture for the six-dimensional orbifoldmodels of type IIB string theory and M-theory.
