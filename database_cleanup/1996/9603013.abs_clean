We study the interaction of non-Abelian topological $BF$ theories defined ontwo dimensional manifolds with point sources carrying non-Abelian charges. Weidentify the most general solution for the field equations on simply andmultiply connected two-manifolds. Taking the particular choice of the so-calledextended Poincar\'e group as the gauge group we discuss how recent discussionsof two dimensional gravity models do fit in this formalism.
