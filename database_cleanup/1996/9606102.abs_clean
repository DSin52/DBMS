We construct the pair of logarithmic operators associated with the recoil ofa $D$-brane. This construction establishes a connection between a translationin time and a world-sheet rescaling. The problem of measuring the centre ofmass coordinate of the $D$-brane is considered and the relation between thestring uncertainty principle and the logarithmic operators is discussed.
