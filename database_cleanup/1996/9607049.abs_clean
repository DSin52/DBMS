We propose a hypothesis that all gauge theories are equivalent to a certainnon-standard string theory. Different gauge groups are accounted for by weightsascribed to the world sheets of different topologies. The hypothesis is checkedin the case of the compact abelian theories, where we show how condensingmonopole -instanton fields are reproduced by the summation over surfaces. Inthe non-abelian case we prove that the loop equations are satisfied modulocontact terms. The structure of these terms unfortunately remains undetermined.
