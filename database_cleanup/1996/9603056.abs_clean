We present a (2+1)-dimensional gauged $O(3) \sigma$-model with an AbelianChern--Simons term. It shows topologically stable, anyonic vortices asclassical solutions. The fields are studied in the case of rotational symmetryand analytic approximations are found for their asymptotic behaviour. Thestatic Euler--Lagrange equations are solved numerically, where particularattention is paid to the dependence of the vortex' properties on the couplingto the gauge field. We compute the vortex mass and charge as a function of thiscoupling and obtain bound states for two--vortices as well as two--vorticeswith masses above the stability threshold.
