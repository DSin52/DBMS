We describe a class of 4d N=1 compactifications of the $SO(32)$heterotic/type I string theory which are destabilized by nonperturbativelygenerated superpotentials. In the type I description, the destabilizingsuperpotential is generated by a one instanton effect or gaugino condensationin a nonperturbative $SU(2)$ gauge group. The dual, heterotic descriptioninvolves destabilization due to worldsheet instanton or $\it half$ worldsheetinstanton effects in the two cases. A genericity argument suggests that a(global) supersymmetry-breaking model of Intriligator and Thomas might betypical in a class of string theory models. Our analysis also suggests that thetensionless strings which arise in the $E_8 \times E_8$ theory in sixdimensions when an instanton shrinks to zero size should, in some cases, havesupersymmetry breaking dynamics upon further compactification to fourdimensions. We provide explicit examples, constructed using F-theory, of thetwo cases of dynamically generated superpotentials.
