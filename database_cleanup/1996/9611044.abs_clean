Title: Relativistic QFTH - Couplings on the Worldline

Authors: Michael G. Schmidt, Christian Schubert

Comments: 8 pages, standard Latex, no figures, talk given by M.G. Schmidt at

the International Seminar and Conference on Path Integrals, Dubna, Russia, 27- 31 May 1996In the framework of the worldline path integral approach to QFTH we discussspin and relativistic couplings, in particular Yukawa and axial couplings tospin 1/2, and the case of spin 1 in the loop.
