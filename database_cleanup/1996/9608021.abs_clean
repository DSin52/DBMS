We consider a simple model of d families of scalar field interacting withgeometry in two dimensions. The geometry is locally flat and has only globaldegrees of freedom. When d<0 the universe is locally two dimensional but ford>0 it collapses to a one dimensional manifold. The model has some, but notall, of the characteristics believed to be features of the full theory ofconformal matter interacting with quantum gravity which has local geometricdegrees of freedom.
