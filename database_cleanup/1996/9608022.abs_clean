We study the CPT theorem for a two-dimensional conformal field theory on anarbitrary Riemann surface. On the sphere the theorem follows from theassumption that the correlation functions have standard hermiticity propertiesand are invariant under the transformation $z \rightarrow 1/z$. The theorem canthen be extended to higher genus surfaces by sewing. We show that, as aconsequence of the CPT theorem on the world-sheet, the scattering $T$-matrix instring theory is {\sl formally\/} hermitean at any loop order.
