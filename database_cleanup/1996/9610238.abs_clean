A general framework for studying a large class of cosmological solutions ofthe low-energy limit of type II string theory and of M-theory, with non-trivialRamond form fields excited, is presented. The framework is applicable tospacetimes decomposable into a set of flat or, more generally, maximallysymmetric spatial subspaces, with multiple non-trivial form fields spanning oneor more of the subspaces. It is shown that the corresponding low-energyequations of motion are equivalent to those describing a particle moving in amoduli space consisting of the scale factors of the subspaces together with thedilaton. The choice of which form fields are excited controls the potentialterm in the particle equations. Two classes of exact solutions are given, thosecorresponding to exciting only a single form and those with multiple formsexcited which correspond to Toda theories. Although typically these solutionsbegin or end in a curvature singularity, there is a subclass with positivespatial curvature which appears to be singularity free. Elements of this classare directly related to certain black p-brane solutions.
