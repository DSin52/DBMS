Title: $R^2$ 2D Quantum Gravity and Dually Weighted Graphs

Comments: 13 pages, LATEX, uses sprocl.sty; Talk based on a recent paper of

M.Staudacher, T.Wynter and myself and presented on the Conference``Frontiers in Quantum Field theory'', December 1995, Osaka, JapanA recently introduced model of dually weighted planar graphs is solved interms of an elliptic parametrization for some particular collection of planargraphs describing the 2D $R^2$ quantum gravity. Along with the cosmologicalconstant $\lambda$ one has a coupling $\beta$ in the model corresponding to the$R^2$-coupling constant. It is shown that for any value of $\beta$ the largescale behavior of the model corresponds to that of the standard pure 2D quantumgravity. On small distances it describes the dynamics of point-like curvaturedefects introduced into the flat 2D space. The scaling function in the vicinityof almost flat metric is obtained. The major steps of the exact solution aregiven.
