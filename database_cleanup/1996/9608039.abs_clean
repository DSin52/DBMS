We study the geometric realization of the Higgs phenomenon in type II stringcompactifications on Calabi--Yau manifolds. The string description is mostdirectly phrased in terms of confinement of magnetic flux, with magneticcharged states arising from D-branes wrapped around chains as opposed tocycles. The rest of the closed cycle of the D-brane worldvolume is manifestedas a confining flux tube emanating from the magnetic charges, in theuncompactified space. We also study corrections to hypermultiplet moduli fortype II compactifications, in particular for type IIA near the conifold point.
