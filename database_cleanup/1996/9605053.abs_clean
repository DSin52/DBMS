We show that in certain compactifications of ${\cal M}$-theory oneight-manifolds to three-dimensional Minkowski space-time the four-form fieldstrength can have a non-vanishing expectation value, while an $N=2$supersymmetry is preserved. For these compactifications a warp factor for themetric has to be taken into account. This warp factor is non-trivial in threespace-time dimensions due to Chern-Simons corrections to the fivebrane Bianchiidentity. While the original metric on the internal space is not K\"ahler, itcan be conformally transformed to a metric that is K\"ahler and Ricci flat, sothat the internal manifold has $SU(4)$ holonomy.
