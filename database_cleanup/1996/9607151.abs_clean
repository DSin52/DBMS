Effective superpotentials for the phase with a confined photon are obtainedin $N=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories. We use the results to derive thehyperelliptic curves which describe the Coulomb phase of $N=2$ theories withclassical gauge groups, and thus extending the prior result for $SU(N_c)$ gaugetheory by Elitzur et al. Moreover, adjusting the coupling constants in $N=1$effective superpotentials to the values of $N=2$ non-trivial critical points wefind new classes of $N=1$ superconformal field theories with an adjoint matterwith a superpotential.
