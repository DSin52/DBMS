We formulate boundary conditions for an open membrane that ends on thefivebrane of {\cal M}-theory. We show that the dynamics of theeleven-dimensional fivebrane can be obtained from the quantization of a ``smallmembrane'' that is confined to a single fivebrane and which moves with thespeed of light. This shows that the eleven-dimensional fivebrane has aninterpretation as a $D$-brane of an open supermembrane as has recently beenproposed by Strominger and Townsend. We briefly discuss the boundary dynamicsof an infinitely extended planar membrane that is stretched between twoparallel fivebranes
