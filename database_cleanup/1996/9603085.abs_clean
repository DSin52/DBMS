The duality symmetry group of the cosets ${\textstyle SU(n,1)\over \textstyleSU(n)\otimes U(1)}$, which describe the moduli space of a two-dimensionalsubspace of an orbifold model with $(n-1)$ complex Wilson lines moduli, isdiscussed. The full duality group and its explicit action on the moduli fieldsare derived.
