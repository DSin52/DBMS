We derive exact analytical expressions for the critical amplitudes$A_\psi$, $A_{gap}$ in the scaling laws for the fermion condensate $<\bar\psi \psi> = A_\psi m^{1/3} g^{2/3}$ and for the mass of the lightest state$M_{gap} = A_{gap} m^{2/3} g^{1/3}$ in the Schwinger model with two lightflavors, $m \ll g$. $A_\psi$ and $A_{gap}$ are expressed via certainuniversal amplitude ratios being calculated recently in TBA technique and theknown coefficient $A_{\psi\psi}$ in the scaling law $<\bar \psi \psi (x) \bar\psi \psi (0)> = A_{\psi\psi} (g/x)$ at the critical point. Numerically,$A_\psi = -0.388..., A_{gap} = 2.008...$ . The same is done for the standardsquare lattice Ising model at $T = T_c$. Using recent Fateev's results, weget $<\sigma_{lat}> = 1.058... (H_{lat}/T_c)^{1/15}$ for the magnetizationand $M_{gap} = a/\xi = 4.010... (H_{lat}/T_c)^{8/15}$ for the inversecorrelation length ($a$ is the lattice spacing). The theoretical predictionfor $<\sigma^{lat}>$ is in a perfect agreement with numerical data. Twoavailable numerical papers give the values of $M_{gap}$ which differ fromeach other by a factor $\approx \sqrt{2}$ . The theoretical result for$M_{gap}$ agrees with one of them.
