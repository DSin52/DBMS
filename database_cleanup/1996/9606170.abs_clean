Title: Quantum Deformations of Space-Time Symmetries and Interactions

Authors: Jerzy Lukierski, Peter C. Stichel

Comments: LaTeX, 10 pages

We discuss quantum deformations of Lie algebra as described by thenoncoassociative modification of its coalgebra structure. We consider forboost $B$, momentum $P$ and central generator $M$ (mass generator). We describethe nonprimitive coproducts for $H$ and $B$ and show that theirnoncocommutative and noncoassociative structure is determined by the two-bodyinteraction terms. Further we consider the case of physical Galilei symmetry inthree dimensions. Finally we discuss the noninteraction theorem for manifestlycovariant two-body systems in the framework of quantum deformations of $D=4$\poin algebra and a possible way out.
