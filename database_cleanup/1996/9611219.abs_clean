We construct a one-loop effective metric describing the evaporation phase ofa Schwarzschild black hole in a spherically symmetric null-dust model. This isachieved by quantising the Vaidya solution and by chosing a time dependentquantum state. This state describes a black hole which is initially in thermalequilibrium and then the equilibrium is switched off, so that the black holestarts to evaporate, shrinking to a zero radius in a finite proper time. Thenaked singularity appears, and the Hawking flux diverges at the end-point.However, a static metric can be imposed in the future of the end-point.Although this end-state metric cannot be determined within our construction, weshow that it cannot be a flat metric.
