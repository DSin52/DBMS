The 3-anyon problem is studied using a set of variables recently proposed inan anyon gauge analysis by Mashkevich, Myrheim, Olaussen, and Rietman (MMOR).Boundary conditions to be satisfied by the wave functions in order to renderthe Hamiltonian self-adjoint are derived, and it is found that the boundaryconditions adopted by MMOR are one of the ways to satisfy these generalself-adjointness requirements. The possibility of scale-dependent boundaryconditions is also investigated, in analogy with the corresponding analyses ofthe 2-anyon case. The structure of the known solutions of the 3-anyon inharmonic potential problem is discussed in terms of the MMOR variables. Withina series expansion in a boson gauge framework the problem of finding any anyonwavefunction is reduced to a (possibly infinite) set of algebraic equations,whose numerical analysis is proposed as an efficient way to study anyonphysics.
