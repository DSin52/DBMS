Title: Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equations as a quantization of

nonstationary Hitchin systemAuthors: D. Ivanov

Comments: 12 pages, TeX

The KZB equations for conformal blocks of the WZNW theory are written on themoduli space of holomorphic principal bundles on the surface. They become themulti-time Schroedinger equation for the nonstationary Hitchin system. From theknown form of the equations we learn about the covariance of quantization withrespect to changes of the coordinate frame.
