It was observed some time ago by Shatashvili and Vafa that superstringcompactification on manifolds of exceptional holonomy gives rise tosuperconformal field theories with extended chiral algebras. In their paper,free field realisations are given of these extended superconformal algebrasinspired by Joyce's constructions of such manifolds as desingularised toroidalorbifolds. The purpose of this note is to give another realisation of thesealgebras starting not from free fields, but from the superconformal algebrasassociated to Calabi--Yau manifolds. These superconformal algebras, originallystudied by Odake, are extensions of the N=2 Virasoro algebra. For the case ofG_2 holonomy, our realisation is inspired in the conjectured construction ofsuch manifolds as a desingularisation of (K x S^1)/Z_2, where K is aCalabi--Yau 3-fold admitting an antiholomorphic involution. Similarly, for thecase of Spin(7) holonomy our realisation suggests a construction of suchmanifolds as desingularisations of K'/Z_2, where K' is a Calabi-Yau 4-foldadmitting an antiholomorphic involution.
