In this letter the algebraic renormalization method, which is independent ofany kind of regularization scheme, is presented for the parity-preservingQED_3 coupled to scalar matter in the symmetric regime, where the scalarassumes vanishing vacuum expectation value, $<\phi>=0$. Themodel shows to be stable under radiative corrections and anomaly free.
