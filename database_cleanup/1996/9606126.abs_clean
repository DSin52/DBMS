The Kowalewski top on Lie algebras $o(4)$, $e(3)$ and $o(3,1)$ is embedded inthe SUSY quantum mechanics. In two dimensions we give the new prescription forconstruction of the pairs of integrable systems by using a standard SUSYalgebra. At the proposed scheme the Goryachev-Chapligin top is shown to be anatural partner of the Kowalewski top.
