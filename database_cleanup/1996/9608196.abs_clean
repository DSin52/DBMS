It is known that the critical N=(2,2) string describes 2+2 dimensionalself-dual gravity in a non-covariant form, since it requires the choice of acomplex structure in the target, which leaves only U(1,1) Lorentz symmetry. Webriefly review picture-changing and spectral flow and show that the world-sheetMaxwell instantons individually break the Lorentz group further to SU(1,1).However, their contributions conspire to restore full SO(2,2) global symmetryif dilaton and axion fields are assembled in a null anti-self-dual two-form,denying them the status of Lorentz scalars. We present the fully SO(2,2)invariant tree-level three-point amplitude and the corresponding extension ofthe Plebanski action for self-dual gravity.
