The generating functionals for the local composite operators, $\Phi^2(x)$ and$\Phi^4(x)$, are used to study excitations in the scalar quantum field theorywith $\lambda \Phi^4$ interaction. The effective action for the compositeoperators is obtained as a series in the Planck constant $\hbar$, and the two-and four-particle propagators are derived. The numerical results are studied inthe space-time of one dimension, when the theory is equivalent to the quantummechanics of an anharmonic oscillator. The effective potential and the poles ofthe composite propagators are obtained as series in $\hbar$, with effectivemass and coupling determined by non-perturbative gap equations. This provides asystematic approximation method for the ground state energy, and for the secondand fourth excitations. The results show quick convergence to the exact values,better than that obtained without including the operator $\Phi^4$.
