We find a general p-1-brane solution to supergravity coupled to a p+1-formfield strength using the ``standard ansatz'' for the fields. In addition to thewell-known elementary and solitonic p-1-brane solutions, which are the onlyones preserving half of the supersymmetry (for the cases where thesupersymmetry transformations are known), there are other possibilities, themost interesting of which is an elementary type~I string solution with anon-dynamical string source and no conserved charge.
