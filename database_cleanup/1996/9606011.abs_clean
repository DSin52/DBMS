We present examples of many-body Wigner quantum systems. The position and themomentum operators ${\bf R}_A$ and ${\bf P}_A,\; A=1,\ldots,n+1$, of theparticles are noncanonical and are chosen so that the Heisenberg and theHamiltonian equations are identical. The spectrum of the energy with respect tothe centre of mass is equidistant and has finite number of energy levels. Thecomposite system is spread in a small volume around the centre of mass andwithin it the geometry is noncommutative. The underlying statistics is anexclusion statistics.
