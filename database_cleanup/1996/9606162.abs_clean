A quantization scheme based on the extension of phase space with applicationof constrained quantization technic is considered. The obtained method issimilar to the geometric quantization. For constrained systems the problem ofscalar product on the reduced Hilbert space is investigated and possiblesolution of this problem is done. Generalization of the Gupta-Bleuler likeconditions is done by the minimization of quadratic fluctuations of quantumconstraints. The scheme for the construction of generalized coherent states isconsidered and relation with Berezin quantization is found. The quantumdistribution functions are introduced and their physical interpretation isdiscussed.
