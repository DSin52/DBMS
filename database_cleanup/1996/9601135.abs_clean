An integral solution to the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov ($q$KZ) equationwith $|q|=1$ is presented. Upon specialization, it leads to a conjecturalformula for correlation functions of the XXZ model in the gapless regime. Thevalidity of this conjecture is verified in special cases, including the nearestneighbor correlator with an arbitrary coupling constant, and generalcorrelators in the XXX and XY limits.
