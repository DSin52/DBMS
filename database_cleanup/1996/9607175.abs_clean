The existence of an electromagnectic field with parallel electric andmagnetic components is readdressed in the presence of a gravitational field. Anon-parallel solution is shown to exist. Next, we analyse the possibility offinding stationary gravitational waves in de nature. Finaly, We construct a D=4effective quantum gravity model. Tree-level unitarity is verified.
