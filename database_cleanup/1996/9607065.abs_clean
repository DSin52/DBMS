We develop a method based on the generalised St\"uckelberg prescription fordiscussing bosonisation in the low energy regime of the SU(2) massive Thirringmodel in 2+1 dimensions. For arbitrary values of the coupling parameter thebosonised theory is found to be a nonabelian gauge theory whose physical sectoris explicitly obtained. In the case of vanishing coupling this gauge theory canbe identified with the SU(2) Yang-Mills Chern-Simons theory in the limit whenthe Yang-Mills term vanishes. Bosonisation identities for the fermionic currentare derived.
