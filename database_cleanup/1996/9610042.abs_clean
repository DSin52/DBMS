Title: Topological Membrane Solitons and Loop Orders of Membrane Scatterings in

M-theoryComments: 38 pages, 14 figures in .eps files

(1) Soliton is an important subject in M-theory. Under the framework ofobstruction theory with the help from framed links in $S^3$, we give a completeenumeration of topological membrane solitons in a string-admissibletarget-space of the form a product of Minkowskian space-times, tori, andK3-surfaces. Patching of these solitons and their topological charges are alsodefined and discussed.(2) Loop order of membrane scatterings is the basis for a perturbativeM-theory. We explore this concept with emphases on its distinct features frompointlike and stringlike particles.For completeness, a light exposition on homologies of compact oriented3-manifolds is given in the Appendix.
