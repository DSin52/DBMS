Authors: A. Ghosh and P. Mitra

Comments: 8 pages, LATEX; it is pointed out that the classical action vanishes

For extremal charged black holes, the thermodynamic entropy is proportionalnot to the area but to the mass or charges. This is demonstrated here fordyonic extremal black hole solutions of string theory. It is pointed out thatthese solutions have zero classical action although the area is nonzero. Bycombining the general form of the entropy allowed by thermodynamics with recentobservations in the literature it is possible to fix the entropy almostcompletely.
