In the first part of this paper we review several formalisms which giveand the Majorana-Oppenheimer form of electrodynamics, the Sachs' theory ofElementary Matter, the Dirac-Fock-Podol'sky model, its development byStaruszkiewicz, the Evans-Vigier ${\bf B}^{(3)}$ field, the theory with aninvariant evolution parameter of Horwitz, the analysis of theaction-at-a-distance concept, presented recently by Chubykalo andSmirnov-Rueda, and the analysis of the claimed `longitudity' of theantisymmetric tensor field after quantization. The second part is devoted tothe discussion of the Weinberg formalism and its recent development byAhluwalia and myself.
