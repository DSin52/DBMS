We consider the action, in arbitrary curved background, of theeleven-dimensional five-brane to second order in the curvature of theworldvolume tensor field. We show that this action gives upon doubledimensional reduction the action of the Dirichlet four-brane up to the sameorder. We use this result as a starting point to discuss the structure of theaction including terms of higher order in the worldvolume curvature.
