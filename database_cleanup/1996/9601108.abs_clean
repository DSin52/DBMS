We show how enhanced gauge symmetry in type II string theory compactified ona Calabi--Yau threefold arises from singularities in the geometry of the targetspace. When the target space of the type IIA string acquires a genus $g$ curve$C$ of $A_{N-1}$ singularities, we find that an $SU(N)$ gauge theory with $g$adjoint hypermultiplets appears at the singularity. The new massless statescorrespond to solitons wrapped about the collapsing cycles, and their dynamicsis described by a twisted supersymmetric gauge theory on $C\times \R^4$. Wereproduce this result from an analysis of the $S$-dual $D$-manifold. We checkthat the predictions made by this model about the nature of the Higgs branch,the monodromy of period integrals, and the asymptotics of the one-looptopological amplitude are in agreement with geometrical computations. In one ofour examples we find that the singularity occurs at strong coupling in theheterotic dual proposed by Kachru and Vafa.
