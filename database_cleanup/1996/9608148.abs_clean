Dilatation, i.e. scale, symmetry in the presence of the dilaton in Minkowskispace is derived from diffeomorphism symmetry in curved spacetime,incorporating the volume-preserving diffeomorphisms. The conditions for scaleinvariance are derived and their relation to conformal invariance is examined.In the presence of the dilaton scale invariance automatically guaranteesconformal invariance due to diffeomorphism symmetry. Low energy scale-invariantphenomenological Lagrangians are derived in terms of dilaton-dressed fields,which are identified as the fields satisfying the usual scaling properties. Thenotion of spontaneous scale symmetry breaking is defined in the presence of thedilaton. In this context, possible phenomenological implications are advocatedand by computing the dilaton mass the idea of PCDC (partially conserveddilatation current) is further explored.
