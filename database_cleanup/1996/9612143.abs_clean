We comment on various aspects of topological gauge theories possessingVafa-Witten and Dijkgraaf-Moore of `balanced' topological field theories isequivalent to an earlier construction in terms of N_{T}=2 superfields inspiredby Susy QM. (2) We explain the relation between topological field theoriescalculating signed and unsigned sums of Euler numbers of moduli spaces. (3) Weshow that the topological twist of N=4 d=4 Yang-Mills theory recentlyconstructed by Marcus is formally a deformation of four-dimensional super-BFtheory. (4) We construct a novel N_{T}=2 topological twist of N=4 d=3Yang-Mills theory, a `mirror' of the Casson invariant model, with some unusualfeatures. (5) We give a complete classification of the topological twists ofN=8 d=3 Yang-Mills theory and show that they are realised as world-volumetheories of Dirichlet two-brane instantons wrapping supersymmetric three-cyclesof Calabi-Yau three-folds and G_{2}-holonomy Joyce manifolds. (6) We describethe topological gauge theories associated to D-string instantons on holomorphiccurves in K3s and Calabi-Yau 3-folds.
