We extend our study of the field-theoretic description of matrix-vectormodels and the associated many-body problems of one dimensional particles withspin. We construct their Yangian-su(R) invariant Hamiltonian. It describes aninteracting theory of a c=1 collective boson and a k=1 su(R) current algebra.When $R \geq 3$ cubic-current terms arise. Their coupling is determined by therequirement of the Yangian symmetry. The Hamiltonian can be consistentlyreduced to finite-dimensional subspaces of states, enabling an explicitcomputation of the spectrum which we illustrate in the simplest case.
