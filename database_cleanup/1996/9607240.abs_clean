We propose the ternary generalization of the classical anti-commutativity andstudy the algebras whose generators are ternary anti-commutative. The integralover an algebra with an arbitrary number of generators N is defined and theformula of a change of variables is proved. In analogy with the fermionintegral we define an analogue of the Pfaffian for a cubic matrix by means ofGaussian type integral and calculate its explicit form in the case of N=3.
