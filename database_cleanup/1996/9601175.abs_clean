String theory, if it describes nature, is probably strongly coupled. In lightof recent developments in string duality, this means that the ``real world''should correspond to a region of the classical moduli space which admits noweak coupling description. We exhibit, in the heterotic string, one such regionof the moduli space, in which the coupling, $\lambda$, is large and the``compactification radius'' scales as $\lambda^{1/3}$. We discuss some of theissues raised by the conjecture that the true vacuum lies in such a region.These include the question of coupling constant unification, and more generallythe problem of what quantities one might hope to calculate and compare withexperiment in such a picture.
