Twistor phase spaces are used to provide a general description of thedynamics of a finite number of directly interacting massless spinning particlesforming a closed relativistic massive and spinning system with an internalstructure. A Poincare invariant canonical quantization of the so obtainedtwistor phase space dynamics is performed.
