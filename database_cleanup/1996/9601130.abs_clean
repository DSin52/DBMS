The sequence of intertwined T-S-T duality transformations acting on the 4Dstatic uncharged black hole leads to a new black hole background with horizonand singularity exchanged. It is shown that this space-time is extendible too.In particular we will see that a string moving into a black hole is dual to astring leaving a white hole. That offers the possibility that a test-stringdoes not see the singularity.
