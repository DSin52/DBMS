Title: Coordinate-free derivation of Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons field equations

Comments: 4 pages, no special macro

In this paper we derive in a coordinate-free manner the field equations for alagrangean consisting of Yang-Mills kinetical term plus Chern-Simonsself-coupling term. This equation turns out to be an eigenvalue equation forthe covariant laplacian.
