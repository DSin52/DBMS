Field equations with general covariance are interpreted as equations for atarget space describing physical space time co-ordinates, in terms of anunderlying base space with conformal invariance. These equations admit aninfinite number of inequivalent Lagrangian descriptions. A model forreparametrisation invariant membranes is obtained by reversing the roles ofbase and target space variables in these considerations.
