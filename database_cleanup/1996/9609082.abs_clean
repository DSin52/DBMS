We discuss the structure of heterotic/type II duality in four dimensions as aconsequence of string-string duality in six dimensions. We emphasize the newfeatures in four dimensions which go beyond the six dimensional vacuumstructure and pertain to the way particular K3 fibers can be embedded inCalabi-Yau threefolds. Our focus is on hypersurfaces as well as completeintersections of codimension two which arise via conifold transitions.
