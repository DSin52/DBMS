Possible Dirichlet boundary states for WZW models with untwisted affine superKac-Moody symmetry are classified for all compact simple Lie groups. They areobtained by inner- and outer-automorphism of the group. D-brane world-volumeturns out to be a group manifold of a symmetric subgroup, so that the modulispace of D-brane is a irreducible Riemannian symmetric space. It is alsoclarified how these D-branes are transformed to each other under abelianT-duality of WZW model. Our result implies, for example, there is no D-particleon the compact simple group manifold. When the D-brane world-volume contains$S^1$ factor, the D-brane moduli space becomes hermitian symmetric space andthe open string world-sheet instantons are allowed.
