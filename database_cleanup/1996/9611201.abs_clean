We present M-theory compactifications on $K_3 \times K_3$ with membranes nearthe $A_n$ or $D_n$ singularities of the $K_3$ spaces. By realizing each ofthese compactifications in two different ways as type I' models with 2- and6-branes, we explain the three-dimensional duality between gauge theoriesrecently found by Intriligator and Seiberg. We also find new pairs of dualgauge theories, which we briefly describe.
