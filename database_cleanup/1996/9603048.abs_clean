We show that the classical non-abelian pure Chern-Simons action is related ina natural way to completely integrable systems of the Davey-Stewartsonhyerarchy, via reductions of the gauge connection in Hermitian spaces and byperforming certain gauge choices. The B\"acklund Transformations areinterpreted in terms of Chern-Simons equations of motion or, on the other hand,as a consistency condition on the gauge. A mapping with a nonlinear$\sigma$-model is discussed.
