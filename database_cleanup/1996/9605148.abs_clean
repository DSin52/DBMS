The space of physical states in relativistic scattering theory isconstructed, using a rigorous version of the Dirac formalism, where the Hilbertspace structure is extended to a Gel'fand triple. This extension enables theconstruction of ``a complete set of states'', the basic concept of the originalDirac formalism, also in the cases of unbounded operators and continuousspectra. We construct explicitly the Gel'fand triple and a complete set of``plane waves'' -- momentum eigenstates -- using the group of space-timesymmetries. This construction is used (in a separate article) to prove ageneralization of the Coleman-Mandula theorem to higher dimension.
