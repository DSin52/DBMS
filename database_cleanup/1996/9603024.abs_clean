We present a general method of constructing Winf and winf gauge theories interms of d+2 dimensional local fields. In this formulation the \Winf gaugetheory Lagrangians involve non-local interactions, but the winf theories areentirely local. We discuss the so-called classical contraction procedure bywhich we derive the Lagrangian of winf gauge theory from that of thecorresponding Winf gauge theory. In order to discuss the relationship betweenquantum Winf and quantum winf gauge theory we solve d=1 gauge theory models ofa Higgs field exactly by using the collective field method. Based on this weconclude that the Winf gauge theory can be regarded as the large N limit of thecorresponding SU(N) gauge theory once an appropriate coupling constantrenormalization is made, while the winf gauge theory cannot be.
