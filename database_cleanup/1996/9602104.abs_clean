In this paper we consider some analytic properties of the high--energyquark--quark scattering amplitude, which, as is well known, can be described bythe expectation value of two lightlike Wilson lines, running along theclassical trajectories of the two colliding particles. We shall prove that theexpectation value of two infinite Wilson lines, forming a certain hyperbolicangle in Minkowski space--time, and the expectation value of two infiniteEuclidean Wilson lines, forming a certain angle in Euclidean four--space, areconnected by an analytic continuation in the angular variables. This could openthe possibility of evaluating the high--energy scattering amplitude directly onthe lattice or using the stochastic vacuum model. The Abelian case (QED) isalso discussed.
