The generalized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations of irrational conformalfield theory provide a uniform description of rational and irrational conformalfield theory. Starting from the known high-level solution of these equations,we first construct the high-level conformal blocks and correlators of all theaffine-Sugawara and coset constructions on simple g. Using intuition gainedfrom these cases, we then identify a simple class of irrational processes whosehigh-level blocks and correlators we are also able to construct.
