A formula is presented for the modular transformation matrix S for any simplecurrent extension of the chiral algebra of a conformal field theory. Thisprovides in particular an algorithm for resolving arbitrary simple currentfixed points, in such a way that the matrix S we obtain is unitary andsymmetric and furnishes a modular group representation. The formalism works inprinciple for any conformal field theory. A crucial ingredient is a set ofmatrices S^J_{ab}, where J is a simple current and a and b are fixed points ofJ. We expect that these input matrices realize the modular group for the torusone-point functions of the simple currents. In the case of WZW-models thesematrices can be identified with the S-matrices of the orbit Lie algebras thatwe introduced in a previous paper. As a special case of our conjecture weobtain the modular matrix S for WZW-theories based on group manifolds that arenot simply connected, as well as for most coset models.
