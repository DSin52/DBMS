We study (non-renormalizable) five dimensional supersymmetric field theories.The theories are parametrized by quark masses and a gauge coupling. We derivethe metric on the Coulomb branch exactly. We use stringy considerations tolearn about new non-trivial interacting field theories with exceptional globalsymmetry $E_n$ ($E_8$, $E_7$, $E_6$, $E_5=Spin(10)$, $E_4=SU(5)$,$E_3=SU(3)\times SU(2)$, $E_2=SU(2)\times U(1)$ and $E_1=SU(2)$). Their Coulombbranch is ${\bf R}^+$ and their Higgs branch is isomorphic to the moduli spaceof $E_n$ instantons. One of the relevant operators of these theories leads to aflow to $SU(2)$ gauge theories with $N_f=n-1$ flavors. In terms of these$SU(2)$ IR theories this relevant parameter is the inverse gauge couplingconstant. Other relevant operators (which become quark masses after flowing tothe $SU(2)$ theories) lead to flows between them. Upon furthercompactifications to four and three dimensions we find new fixed points withexceptional symmetries.
