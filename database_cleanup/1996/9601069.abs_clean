We exactly solve a special matrix model of dually weighted planar graphsdescribing pure two-dimensional quantum gravity with an R^2 interaction. Itpermits us to study the intermediate regimes between the gravitating and flatmetric. Flat space is modeled by a regular square lattice, while localisedcurvature is introduced through lattice defects. No ``flattening'' phasethe system is that of pure gravity for any finite R^2 coupling. In the limit ofinfinite coupling, we are able to extract a scaling function interpolatingbetween pure gravity and a dilute gas of curvature defects on a flatbackground. We introduce and explain some novel techniques concerning ourmethod of large N character expansions and the calculation of Schur characterson big Young tableaux.
