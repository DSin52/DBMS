The four dimensional SU(2) WZW model coupled to elecromagnetism is treated asa constraint system in the context of the BFV approach. We show that theDarboux's transformations which are used to diagonalize the canonical one-formin the Faddeev-Jackiw formalism, transform the fields of the model into BRSTinvariant ones. The same analysis is also carried out in the case of spinorelectrodynamics.
