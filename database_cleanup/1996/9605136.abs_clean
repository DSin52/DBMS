If nature is described by string theory, and if the compactification radiusis large (as suggested by the unification of couplings), then the theory is ina regime best described by the low energy limit of $M$-theory. We discuss somephenomenological aspects of this view. The scale at which conventional quantumfield theory breaks down is of order the unification scale and consequently(approximate) discrete symmetries are essential to prevent proton decay. Thereare one or more light axions, one of which solves the strong CP problem.Modular cosmology is still problematic but much more complex than inperturbative string vacua. We also consider a range of more theoretical issues,focusing particularly on the question of stabilizing the moduli. We give asimple, weak coupling derivation of Witten's expression for the dependence ofthe coupling constants on the eleven dimensional radius. We discuss thecriteria for the validity of the long wavelength analysis and find that the"real world" seems to sit just where this analysis is breaking down. On theother hand, residual constraints from N=2 supersymmetry make it difficult tosee how the moduli can be stabilized while at the same time yielding a largehierarchy.
