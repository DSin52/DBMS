In this paper we find an explicit formula for the most general vectorevolution of curves on $RP^{n-1}$ invariant under the projective action of$SL(n,R)$. When this formula is applied to the projectivization of solutioncurves of scalar Lax operators with periodic coefficients, one obtains acorresponding evolution in the space of such operators. We conjecture that thisevolution is identical to the second KdV Hamiltonian evolution underappropriate conditions. These conditions give a Hamiltonian interpretation ofgeneral vector differential invariants for the projective action of $SL(n,R)$,namely, the $SL(n,R)$ invariant evolution can be written so that a generalvector differential invariant corresponds to the Hamiltonianpseudo-differential operator. We find common coordinates and simplify bothevolutions so that one can attempt to prove the equivalence for arbitrary $n$.
