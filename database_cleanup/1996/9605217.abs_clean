Title: The gravitational and electroweak interactions unified as a gauge theory

of the De Sitter groupComments: Revision, based on the preliminary version in Physics Letters B,

contains calculational details and novel findings. Latex, 17 pages, nofiguresThe complexified gauging of the de Sitter group gives a unified theory forthe electroweak and gravitational interactions. The standard spectrum for theelectroweak gauge bosons is recovered with the correct mass assignments,following a spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry imposed by the geometry.There is no conventional Higgs sector. New physics is predicted withgravity-induced electroweak processes (at the electroweak and at anintermediate scale of about $10^{10}Gev$) as well as with novel-type of effects(such as gravitational Aharonov-Bohm and violations of the Principle ofequivalence to 1 part in $10^{17}$). The new theoretical perspectives emergingfrom this geometric unification are briefly discussed.
