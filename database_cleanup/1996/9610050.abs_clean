We derive the (matrix-valued) Feynman rules of mass perturbation theory ofthe massive Schwinger model for non-zero vacuum angle theta. Further, wediscuss the properties of the three-boson bound state and compute -- by apartial resummation of the mass perturbation series -- its mass and its partialdecay widths.
