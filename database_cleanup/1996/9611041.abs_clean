We investigate the string theory on three dimensional black holes discoveredby Ba\~{n}ados, Teitelboim and Zanelli in the framework of conformal fieldtheory. The model is described by an orbifold of the $\widetilde{SL}(2,R)$ WZWmodel. The spectrum is analyzed by solving the level matching condition and weobtain winding modes. We then study the ghost problem and show explicitexamples of physical states with negative norms. We discuss the tachyonpropagation and the target space geometry, which are irrelevant to the detailsof the spectrum. We find a self-dual T-duality transformation reversing theblack hole mass. We also discuss difficulties in string theory on curvedspacetime and possibilities to obtain a sensible string theory on threedimensional black holes. This work is the first attempt to quantize a stringtheory in a black hole background with an infinite number of propagating modes.
