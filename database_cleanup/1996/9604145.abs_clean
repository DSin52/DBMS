Representations of the quantum q-oscillator algebra are studied withparticular attention to local Hamiltonian representations of the Schroedingertype. In contrast to the standard harmonic oscillators such systems exhibit acontinuous spectrum. The general scheme of realization of the q-oscillatoralgebra on the space of wave functions for a one-dimensional SchroedingerHamiltonian shows the existence of non-Fock irreducible representationsassociated to the continuous part of the spectrum and directly related to thedeformation. An algorithm for the mapping of energy levels is described.
