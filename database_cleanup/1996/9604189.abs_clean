We find extremal four dimensional black holes with finite area constructedentirely from intersecting D-branes. We argue that the microscopic degeneracyof these configurations agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula. Theabsence of solitonic objects in these configurations may make them useful fordynamical studies of black holes.
