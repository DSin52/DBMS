Title: On the Seiberg-Witten Approach to electric-magnetic Duality

Comments: 4 pages, plain TeX

Electric-magnetic duality allows to calculate the central charges of N=2supersymmetric theories with massless hypermultiplets as derivatives of simplemodular forms. The procedure reproduces the Seiberg-Witten results forN_f=0,2,3 in a uniform way, but indicates open problems for N_f=1.
