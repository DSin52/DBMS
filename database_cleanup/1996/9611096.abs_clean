Comments: REVTEX, 11 pages, 4 EPS figures

The spherically and cylindrically symmetric solutions of the $SU(3)$ Yang -Mills theory are obtained. The corresponding gauge potential has the confiningfield distribution of the classical ``quark'' and in this sense it is similarto the Coulomb potential; b) the cylindrically symmetric solution describes aclassical field ``string'' (flux tube) between two ``quarks''. It is noticedthat these solutions are typically for the classical $SU(3)$ Yang - Millstheory in contradiction to monopole that is an exceptional solution. Thisallows to conclude that the confining properties of the classical $SU(3)$ Yang
