We compute the corrections to the transition amplitudes of an acceleratedUnruh ``box'' that arise when the accelerated box is replaced by a ``twolevel ion'' immersed in a constant electric field and treated in secondquantization. There are two kinds of corrections, those due to recoil effectsinduced by the momentum transfers and those due to pair creation. Takentogether, these corrections show that there is a direct relationship betweenpair creation amplitudes described by the Heisenberg-Euler-Schwingermechanism and the Unruh effect, i.e. the thermalisation of acceleratedsystems at temperature $a/ 2 \pi$ where $a$ is the acceleration. Inparticular, there is a thermodynamical consistency between both effects whoseorigin is that the euclidean action governing pair creation rates acts as anentropy in delivering the Unruh temperature. Upon considering pair creationof charged black holes in an electric field, these relationships explain whyblack holes are created from vacuum in thermal equilibrium, i.e. with theirHawking temperature equal to their Unruh temperature.
