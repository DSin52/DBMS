The covariant path integral for chiral bosons obtained by McClain, Wu and Yuis generalized to chiral p-forms. In order to handle the reducibility of thegauge transformations associated with the chiral p-forms and with the newvariables (in infinite number) that must be added to eliminate the second classconstraints, the field-antifield formalism is used.
