Title: Noncommutative Kaluza-Klein Theory

Authors: J. Madore, J. Mourad

Efforts have been made recently to reformulate traditional Kaluza-Kleintheory by using a generalized definition of a higher-dimensional extendedspace-time. Both electromagnetism and gravity have been studied in thiscontext. We review some of the models which have been proposed, with a specialeffort to keep the mathematical formalism to a very minimum.
