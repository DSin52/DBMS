We discuss T-duality for open strings in general background fields both inthe functional integral formulation as well as in the language of canonicaltransformations. The Dirichlet boundary condition in the dual theory has to betreated as a constraint on the functional integration. Furthermore, we givemeaning to the notion of matrix valued string end point position in thepresence of nonabelian gauge field background.
