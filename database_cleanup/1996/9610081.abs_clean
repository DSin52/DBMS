We supplement the discussion of Moore and Reshetikhin and others by findingnew semiclassical nonabelian vertex operators for the chiral, antichiral andnonchiral primary fields of WZW theory. These new nonabelian vertex operatorsinvolve only the representation matrices of Lie $g$, the currents of affine $(g\times g)$ and certain chiral and antichiral zero modes, and they reduce to theabelian vertex operators in the limit of abelian algebras. Using the newconstructions, we also discuss semiclassical operator product expansions, braidrelations and relations to the known form of the semiclassical affine-Sugawaraconformal blocks.
