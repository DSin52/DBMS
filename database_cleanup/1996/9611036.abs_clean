Using U-duality transformations we map perturbative Type IIA string theorycompactified on a class of Joyce 7-manifolds to a D-strings on D-manifolddescription in Type IIB theory. For perturbative Type IIB theory on the sameclass of Joyce manifolds we use duality transformations to map to anM-theory, M-manifold description, which is an orientifold with fivebranetwisted sectors. D and M-manifold descriptions of discrete torsion arefound. For the same class of compactifications we show that Type IIA/IIB theoryon a Joyce orbifold without (with) discrete torsion is T-dual to Type IIB/IIAtheory on the same orbifold with (without) discrete torsion. For this class ofType II compactifications this proves an extension of the Papadopoulos-Townsendconjecture, which states that the Type IIA and IIB theories compactified on thesame Joyce 7-manifold are equivalent. Finally we note that thePapadopoulos-Townsend conjecture is a special case of the Generalised MirrorConjecture.
