We combine analytical and numerical techniques to study the collapse ofconformally coupled massless scalar fields in semiclassical 2D dilaton gravity,with emphasis on solutions just below criticality when a black hole almostforms. We study classical information and quantum correlations. We showexplicitly how recovery of information encoded in the classical initial datafrom the outgoing classical radiation becomes more difficult as criticality isapproached. The outgoing quantum radiation consists of a positive-energy flux,which is essentially the standard Hawking radiation, followed by anegative-energy flux which ensures energy conservation and guarantees unitaryevolution through strong correlations with the positive-energy Hawkingradiation. As one reaches the critical solution there is a breakdown ofunitarity. We show that this breakdown of predictability is intimately relatedto a breakdown of the semiclassical approximation.
