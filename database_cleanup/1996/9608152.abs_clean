The front form Hamiltonian for quantum chromodynamics, reduced to aneffective Hamiltonian acting only in the $q\bar q$ space, is solvedapproximately. After coordinate transformation to usual momentum space andFourier transformation to configuration space a second order differentialequation is derived. This retarded Schr\"odinger equation is solved byvariational methods and semi-analytical expressions for the masses of all 30pseudoscalar and vector mesons are derived. In view of the direct relation toquantum chromdynamics without free parameter, the agreement with experiment isremarkable, but the approximation scheme is not adequate for the mesons withone up or down quark. The crucial point is the use of a running couplingconstant $\alpha_s(Q^2)$, in a manner similar but not equal to the one ofRichardson in the equal usual-time quantization. Its value is fixed at the Zmass and the 5 flavor quark masses are determined by a fit to the vector mesonquarkonia.
