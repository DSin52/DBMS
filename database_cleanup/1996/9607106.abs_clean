I review the covariant quantization of the closed fermionic string with (2,2)extended world-sheet supersymmetry on R^{2,2}. Results on n-point scatteringamplitudes are presented, for tree- and one-loop world-sheets with arbitraryMaxwell instanton number. I elaborate the connection between Maxwell moduli,spectral flow, and instantons. It is argued that the latter serve to extend theLorentz symmetry from U(1,1) to SO(2,2) by undoing the choice of spacetimecomplex structure.
