We calculate the leading order interactions of massless D-brane excitations.Their 4-point functions are found to be identical to those found in type Itheory. The amplitude for two massless D-brane fluctuations to produce amassless closed string is found to possess interesting new structure. As afunction of its single kinematic invariant, it displays an infinite sequence ofalternating zeros and poles. At high transverse momenta, this amplitude decaysexponentially, indicating a growing effective thickness of the D-brane. Thisamplitude is the leading process by which non-extremal D-branes produceHawking radiation.
