Actual calculations of monopole and dyon spectra have previously beenperformed in N=4 SYM and in N=2 SYM with gauge group SU(2), and are in totalagreement with duality conjectures for the finite theories. These calculationsare extended to N=2 SYM with higher rank gauge groups, and it turns out thatthe SU(2) model with four fundamental hypermultiplet is an exception in thatits soliton spectrum supports duality. This may be an indication that the otherperturbatively finite N=2 theories have non-perturbative contributions to thebeta-function. This talk contains a short summary of recent results.
