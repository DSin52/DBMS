Summer SchoolIn this paper, based on the author's lectures at the 1995 les Houches Summerschool, explicit expressions for the Friedan--Shenker connection on the vectorbundle of WZW conformal blocks on the moduli space of curves with tangentvectors at $n$ marked points are given. The covariant derivatives are expressedin terms of ``dynamical $r$-matrices'', a notion borrowed from integrablesystems. The case of marked points moving on a fixed Riemann surface is studiedmore closely. We prove a universal form of the (projective) flatness of thecoefficients in the universal enveloping algebra -- not just when acting onconformal blocks.
