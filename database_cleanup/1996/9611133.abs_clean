Two-loop contributions to the anomalous correlation function<J_mu(x)J_nu(y)J_rho(z)> of three chiral currents are calculated by a methodbased on the conformal properties of massless field theories. The method waspreviously applied to virtual photon diagrams in quantum electrodynamics, andit is extended here to diagrams with scalars and chiral spinors in the abelianHiggs model and in the SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) standard model. In each case there arenonvanishing contributions to the gauge current correlator from self-energyinsertions, vertex insertions and nonplanar diagrams, but their sum exactlyvanishes. The two-loop contribution to the anomaly therefore also vanishes, inagreement with the Adler-Bardeen theorem. An application of the method to thecorrelator <R_mu(x)R_nu(y)K_rho(z)> of the R and Konishi axial currents insupersymmetric gauge theories which was reported in hep-th/9608125 is discussedhere. The net two-loop contribution to this correlator also vanishes.
