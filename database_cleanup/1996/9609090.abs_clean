Title: Harmonic Superspace

Comments: 12 pages, LaTeX, Talk given at the 10th International Conference on

Problems Of Quantum Field Theory, Alushta (Crimea, Ukraine) 13-18 May 1996(to be published in Proceedings)We sketch recent applications of the harmonic superspace approach foroff-shell formulations of $(4,4)$, $2D$ sigma models with torsion and forconstructing super KdV hierarchies associated with "small" and "large" $N=4$superconformal algebras.
