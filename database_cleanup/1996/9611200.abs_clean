We define certain extensions of affine Weyl groups (distinct from theseconsidered by K. Saito [S1] in the theory of extended affine root systems),prove an analogue of Chevalley theorem for their invariants, and construct aFrobenius structure on their orbit spaces. This produces solutions $F(t_1, ...,t_n)$ of WDVV equations of associativity polynomial in $t_1, ..., t_{n-1}, \expt_n$.
