The new spacetime-supersymmetric description of the superstring is used tocompute tree-level scattering amplitudes for an arbitrary number of masslessfour-dimensional states. The resulting Koba-Nielsen formula is manifestlySO(3,1) super-Poincare invariant and is easily generalized to scattering in thepresence of a D-brane.
