The (1,0) supersymmetry in six dimensions admits a tensor multiplet whichcontains a second-rank antisymmetric tensor field with a self-dual fieldstrength and a dilaton. We describe the fully supersymmetric coupling of thismultiplet to Yang-Mills multiplet, in the absence of supergravity. Theself-duality equation for the tensor field involves a Chern-Simons modifiedfield strength, the gauge fermions, and an arbitrary dimensionful parameter.
