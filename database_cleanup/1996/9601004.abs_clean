We construct a new extreme black hole solution in toroidally compactifiedheterotic string theory. The black hole saturates the Bogomol'nyi bound, haszero angular momentum, but nonzero electric dipole moment. It is obtained bystarting with a higher dimensional rotating charged black hole, andcompactifying one direction in the plane of rotation.
