The c<1 and c>1 matrix models are analyzed within large N renormalizationgroup, taking into account touching (or branching) interactions. The c<1modified matrix model with string exponent gamma>0 is naturally associated withan unstable fixed point, separating the Liouville phase (gamma<0) from thebranched polymer phase (gamma=1/2). It is argued that at c=1 this multicriticalfixed point and the Liouville fixed point coalesce, and that both fixed pointsdisappear for c>1. In this picture, the critical behavior of c>1 matrix modelsis generically that of branched polymers, but only within a scaling regionwhich is exponentially small when c -> 1. It also explains the behavior ofmultiple Ising spins coupled to gravity. Large crossover effects occur for c-1small enough, with a c ~ 1 pseudo-scaling which explains numerical results.
