Wilson's approximation scheme of RG recursion formula dropping momentumdependence of the propagators is applied to large-$N$ vector and matrix modelsin dimensions $2<d<4$ by making use of their exact solutions in zero dimension.In spite of apparent dependence of critical exponents upon the dilatationalparameter $\rho$ involved by the approximation, the exact exponents arereproduced for vector models in the limit $\rho\rightarrow 0$. Application tomatrix models is then reexamined after the same fashion. It predicts criticalexponents $\nu=2/d$ and $\eta=2-d/2$ for the $\tr \Phi^4$ matrix model.
