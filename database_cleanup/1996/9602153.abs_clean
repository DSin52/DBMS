Under the six-dimensional heterotic/type $IIA$ duality map, a solitonicmembrane solution of heterotic string theory transforms into a singularsolution of type $IIA$ theory, and should therefore be interpreted as afundamental membrane in the latter theory. This finding pointed to a gap in theformulation of string theory that was subsequently filled by the discovery ofthe role of $D$-branes as the carriers of Ramond-Ramond charge in type $II$string theory. The roles of compactified eleven-dimensional membranes andfivebranes in five-dimensional string theory are also discussed.
