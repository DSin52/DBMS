We review the recent exact solution of a matrix model which interpolatesFirstly, we have developed a new large N technique capable of treating a classof matrix models previously thought to be unsolvable. Secondly, we are able tomake a first precise statement about two-dimensional R^2 gravity. These notesare based on a lecture given at the Cargese summer school 1995. They containsome previously unpublished results.
