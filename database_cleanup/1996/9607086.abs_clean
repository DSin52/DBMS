consistent with a revision of the application to a GUT in hep-th/9607237We develop a mathematical concept towards gauge field theories based upon aHilbert space endowed with a representation of a skew-adjoint Lie algebra andan action of a generalized Dirac operator. This concept shares common featureswith the non-commutative geometry a la Connes/Lott, differs from that, however,by the implementation of skew-adjoint Lie algebras instead of unitalassociative *-algebras. We present the physical motivation for our approach andsketch its mathematical strategy. Moreover, we comment on the application ofour method to the standard model and the flipped SU(5) x U(1)-grand unificationmodel.
