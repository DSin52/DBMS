We analyse abelian T-duality for WZW models of simply-connected groups. Wedemonstrate that the dual theory is a certain orbifold of the original theory,and check that it is conformally invariant. We determine the spectrum of thedual theory, and show that it agrees with the spectrum of the original theory.
