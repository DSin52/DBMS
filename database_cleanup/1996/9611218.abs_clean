Title: On the Eleventh Dimension of String Theory

Comments: 8 pages, Latex

An explanation of the origin of the hidden eleventh dimension in stringtheory is given. It is shown that any two sigma models describing thepropagation of string backgrounds are related to each other by a Weyltransformation of the world-sheet metric. To avoid this ambiguity in definingtwo-dimensional sigma models, extra fields are needed. An interestingconnection is established with Abelian T-duality.
