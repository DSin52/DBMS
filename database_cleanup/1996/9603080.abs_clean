The spin - 3/2 Ising model on a square lattice is investigated. It is shownthat this model is reducible to an eight - vertex model on a surface in theparameter space spanned by coupling constants J, K, L and M. It is shown thatthis model is equivalent to an exactly solvable free fermion model along twolines in the parameter space.
