We investigate the conformal string $\sigma $-model corresponding to ageneral five-dimensional non-extremal black hole solution. In the horizonregion the theory reduces to an exactly solvable conformal field theory. Wedetermine the modular invariant spectrum of physical string states, whichexpresses the Rindler momentum operator in terms of three charges and stringoscillators. For black holes with winding and Kaluza-Klein charges, we findthat states made with only right-moving excitations have ADM mass equal to theblack hole ADM mass, and thus they can be used as sources of the gravitationalfield. A discussion on statistical entropy is included.
