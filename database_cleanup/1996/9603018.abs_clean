The significance of zero modes in the path-integral quantization of somesolitonic models is investigated. In particular a Skyrme-like theory withtopological vortices in (1+2) dimensions is studied, and with a BRST invariantgauge fixing a well defined transition amplitude is obtained in the one loopapproximation. We also present an alternative method which does not necessitateevoking the time-dependence in the functional integral, but is equivalent tothe original one in dealing with the quantization in the background of thestatic classical solution of the non-linear field equations. The considerationsgiven here are particularly useful in - but also limited to - the one-loopapproximation.
