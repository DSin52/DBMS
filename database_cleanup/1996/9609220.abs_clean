We show that the BRST operator of Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond superstring is closelyrelated to de Rham differential on the moduli space of decorated super-Riemannsurfaces P. We develop formalism where superstring amplitudes are computed viaintegration of some differential forms over a section of P over the supermoduli space M. We show that the result of integration does not depend on thechoice of section when all the states are BRST physical. Our approach is basedon the geometrical theory of integration on supermanifolds of which we give ashort review.
