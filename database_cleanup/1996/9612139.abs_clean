Title: O(d, d)-Symmetry and Ernst Formulation for Einstein-Kalb-Ramond Theory

in Three DimensionsAuthors: A. Herrera and O. Kechkin

Comments: 10 pages, RevTex. Talk given at Lobachevski International Seminar,

JINR, Dubna, Russia; 8-12 December 1996The Ernst-like matrix representation of the multidimensionalEinstein-Kalb-Ramond theory is developed and the O(d,d)-symmetry is presentedin the matrix-valued SL(2,R)-form. The analogy with the Einstein andEinstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theories is discussed.
