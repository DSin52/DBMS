The modular symmetries of string loop threshold corrections for gaugecoupling constants are studied in the presence of discrete Wilson lines for allexamples of abelian orbifolds, where the point group is realised by the actionof Coxeter elements or generalised Coxeter elements on the root lattices of theLie groups.
