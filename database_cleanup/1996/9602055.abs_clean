We review some recent results on the calculation of renormalization constantsin Yang-Mills theory using open bosonic strings. The technology of stringamplitudes, supplemented with an appropriate continuation off the mass shell,can be used to compute the ultraviolet divergences of dimensionally regularizedgauge theories. The results show that the infinite tension limit of stringamplitudes corresponds to the background field method in field theory.(Proceedings of the Workshop ``Strings, Gravity and Physics at the Planckscale'', Erice (Italy), September 1995.
