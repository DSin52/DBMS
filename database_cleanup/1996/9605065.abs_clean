The one and two-particle form factors of the energy operator in thetwo-dimensional Ising model in a magnetic field at $T=T_c$ are exactly computedwithin the form factor bootstrap approach. Together with the matrix elements ofthe magnetisation operator already computed in ref.\,\cite{immf}, they are usedto write down the large distance expansion for the correlators of the tworelevant fields of the model.
