By using the brick wall method we calculate the free energy and the entropyof the scalar field in the rotating black holes. As one approaches thestationary limit surface rather than the event horizon in comoving frame, thosebecome divergent. Only when the field is comoving with the black hole (i.e.$\Omega_0 = \Omega_H$) those become divergent at the event horizon. In theHartle-Hawking state the leading terms of the entropy are $ A \frac{1}{h} + B\ln(h) + finite$, where $h$ is the cut-off in the radial coordnate near thehorizon. In term of the proper distance cut-off $\epsilon$ it is written as $ S= N A_H/\epsilon^2$. The origin of the divergence is that the density of stateon the stationary surface and beyond it diverges.
