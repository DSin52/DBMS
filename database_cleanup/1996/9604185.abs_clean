We provide an alternative interpretation for the topological terms in physicsby investigating the low-energy gauge interacting system. The asymptoticbehavior of the gauge field at infinity indicates that it traces out a closedargument of geometric phase, we show that the adiabatic evolution of the gaugethe Chern-Simons term for three-dimensional spacetime, and the Pontrjagin termfor the four-dimensional spacetime.
