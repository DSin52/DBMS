Title: A continuous Wick rotation for spinor fields and supersymmetry in

Euclidean spaceAuthors: Peter van Nieuwenhuizen and Andrew Waldron (ITP S.U.N.Y. Stony Brook)

Comments: Proceedings of the String conference held at Imperial College,

London, July 1996. 9 pages, LatexWe obtain a continuous Wick rotation for Dirac, Majorana and Weyl spinors$\psi \to \exp ({1\over 2} \theta \gamma^4 \gamma^5)\psi$ which interpolatesbetween Minkowski and Euclidean field theories.
