We present another concrete realization of a quantum field theory, envisagedmany years ago by Bargmann, Wightman and Wigner. Considering the special caseof the $(1/2,0)\oplus (0,1/2)$ field and developing theMajorana-McLennan-Case-Ahluwalia construct for neutrino we show that fermionand its antifermion can have same intrinsic parities. The construct can beapplied to explanation of the present situation in neutrino physics.
