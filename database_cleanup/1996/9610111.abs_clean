We study F-theory on elliptic threefold Calabi-Yau near collidingsingularities. We demonstrate that resolutions of those singularitiesgenerically correspond to transitions to phases characterized by new tensormultiplets and enhanced gauge symmetry. These are governed by the dynamics oftensionless strings. We also find new transition points which are associatedwith several small instantons simultaneously shrinking to zero size.
