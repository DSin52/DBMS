Title: Compactification of Tensionless String Theories

Comments: 22pp LaTeX, refs. and minor changes added

We study compactifications of the $N=2$ 6D tensionless string on variouscomplex two-folds down to two-dimensions. In the IR limit they becomenon-trivial conformal field theories in 2D. Using results of Vafa and Witten onthe partition functions of twisted Super-Yang-Mills theories, we can study theresulting CFT. We also discuss the contribution of instantons made by wrappingstrings on 2-cycles of the complex two-fold.
