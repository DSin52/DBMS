We present a rigurous disscusion for abelian $BF$ theories in which the basemanifold of the $U(1)$ bundle is homeomorphic to a Hilbert space. The theoryhas an infinte number of stages of reducibility. We specify conditions on thebase manifold under which the covarinat quantization of the system can beperformed unambiguously. Applications of the formulation to the superparticleand the supertstring are also discussed.
