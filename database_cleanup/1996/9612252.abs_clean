Correlation functions of exactly solvable models can be described bydifferential equation [Barough, McCoy, Wu]. In this paper we show that for nonfree fermionic case differential equations should be replaced byintegro-differential equations.We derive an integro-differential equation, which describes time andtemperature dependent correlation function $<\psi(0,0)\psi^\dagger(x,t)>_T$of penetrable Bose gas. The integro-differential equation turns out be thecontinuum generalization of classical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.
