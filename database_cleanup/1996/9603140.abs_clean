The form of the spectral curve for $4d$ $N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Millstheory with matter fields in the fundamental representation of the gauge groupsuggests that its $1d$ integrable counterpart should be looked for among(inhomogeneous) $sl(2)$ spin chains with the length of the chain being equal tothe number of colours $N_c$. For $N_f < 2N_c$ the relevant spin chain is thesimplest $XXX$-model, and this identification is in agreement with the knownresults in Seiberg-Witten theory.
