The renormalization group (RG) is used to study the asymptotically free$\phi_6^3$-theory in curved spacetime. Several forms of the RG equations forthe effective potential are formulated. By solving these equations we obtainthe one-loop effective potential as well as its explicit forms in the case ofstrong gravitational fields and strong scalar fields. Using zeta functiontechniques, the one-loop and corresponding RG improved vacuum energies arefound for the Kaluza-Klein backgrounds $R^4\times S^1\times S^1$ and $R^4\timesS^2$. They are given in terms of exponentially convergent series, appropriatefor numerical calculations. A study of these vacuum energies as a function ofcompactification lengths and other couplings shows that spontaneouscompactification can be qualitatively different when the RG improved energy isused.
