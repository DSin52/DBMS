We implement the inverse scattering method in the case of the $A_n$ affineToda field theories, by studying the space-time evolution of simple poles inthe underlying loop group. We find the known single soliton solutions, as wellas additional solutions with non-linear modes of oscillation around thestandard solution, by studying the particularly simple case where the residueat the pole is a rank one projection. We show that these solutions with extramodes have the same mass and topological charges as the standard solutions, sowe do not shed any light on the missing topological charge problem in thesemodels. We also show that the integrated energy-momentum density can becalculated from the central extension of the loop group.
