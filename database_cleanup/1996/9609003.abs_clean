We consider the combined Yang Mills-Dilaton-Gravity system in the presence ofa Gauss-Bonnet term as it appears in the $4D$ Effective Superstring Action. Wegive analytical arguments and demonstrate numerically the existence of blackhole solutions with non-trivial dilaton and Yang Mills hair for the particularcase of SU(2) gauge fields. The thermodynamical properties of the solutions arealso discussed.
