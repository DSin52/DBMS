Using stochastic quantization method we derive equations for correlators ofquantum fluctuations around the classical solution in the massless phi^4theory. The obtained equations are then solved in the lowest orders ofperturbation theory, and the first correction to the free propagator of aquantum fluctuation is calculated.
