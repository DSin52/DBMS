We study the dynamics of D-particles (D0-branes) in type I' string theory andof the corresponding states in the dual heterotic description. We account forthe presence of the two 8-orientifolds (8 dimensional orientifold planes) andsixteen D8-branes by deriving the appropriate quantum mechanical system. Werecover the familiar condition of eight D8-branes for each 8-orientifold. Weinvestigate bound states and compute the phase shifts for the scattering ofsuch states and find that they agree with the expectations from thesupergravity action. In the type I' regime we study the motion transverse tothe 8-orientifold and find an interesting cancellation effect.
