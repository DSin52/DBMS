The equivalence between the Dirac method and Faddeev-Jackiw analysis forgauge theories is proved. In particular we trace out, in a stage by stageprocedure, the standard classification of first and second class constraints ofDirac's method in the F-J approach. We also find that the Darbouxtransformation implied in the F-J reduction process can be viewed as acanonical transformation in Dirac approach. Unlike Dirac's method the F-Janalysis is a classical reduction procedure, then the quantization can beachieved only in the framework of reduce and then quantize approach with allthe know problems that this type of procedures presents. Finally we illustratethe equivalence by means of a particular example.
