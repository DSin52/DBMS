Chern-Simons-Matter Lagrangian with noncompact gauge symmetry group isconsidered. The theory is quantized in the holomorphic gauge with a complexgauge fixing condition. The model is discussed, in which the the gauge andmatter fields are accompanied by the complex conjugate counterparts. It isargued, that such a theory represents an adequate framework for the descriptionof the quantum Hall states.
