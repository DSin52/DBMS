Title: The Noncritical W(infinity) String Sector of the Membrane

Authors: Carlos Castro

Comments: 15 pages, tex file. A review of work that appeared in the Journal of

Chaos, Solitons and Fractals with some new resultsThe exact quantum integrability aspects of a sector of the membrane isinvestigated. It is found that spherical membranes ( in the lightcone gauge)moving in flat target spacetime backgrounds admit a class of integrablesolutions linked to $SU(\infty)$ SDYM equations ( dimensionally reduced to onetemporal dimension) which, in turn, are related to Plebanski 4D SDGravitational equations. A further rotational Killing-symmetry reduction yieldsthe 3D continuous Toda theory. It is precisely the latter which bears a directrelationship to non critical $W_\infty$ string theory. The expected criticaldimensions for the ( super) membrane , (D=11) and D=27, are easily obtained.This suggests that this particular sector of the membrane's spectrum (connectedto the $SU(\infty)$ SDYM equations ) bears a direct connection to a critical$W_\infty$ string spectrum adjoined to a q=N+1 unitary minimal model of the W_Nalgebra in the $N\rightarrow \infty$ limit. Final comments are made about theconnection to Jevicki's observation that the 4D quantum membrane is linked todilatonic-self dual gravity plus matter . 2D dilatonic ( super) gravity wasstudied by Ikeda and its relation to nonlinear $W_\infty$ algebras fromnonlinear integrable deformations of 4D self dual gravity was studied by theauthor.The full $SU(\infty)$ YM theory remains to be explored as well as theincipient role that noncritical nonlinear $W_\infty$ strings might have in thefull quantization program.
