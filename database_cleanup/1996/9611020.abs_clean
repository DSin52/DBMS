We note that the accidental symmetries which are present in some examples ofduality imply the existence of continuously infinite sets of theories with thesame infrared behavior. These sets interpolate between theories of differentflavors and colors; the change in color and flavor is compensated byinteractions (often non-perturbative) induced by operators in thesuperpotential. As an example we study the behavior of SU(2) gauge theorieswith 2\nf doublets; these are dual to SU(\nf-2) gauge theories whoseultraviolet flavor symmetry is SU(\nf)xSU(\nf)xU(1) but whose flavor symmetryis SU(2\nf) in the infrared. The infrared SU(2\nf) flavor symmetry isimplemented in the ultraviolet as a non-trivial transformation on theLagrangian and matter content of the magnetic theory, involving (generallynon-renormalizable) baryon operators and non-perturbative dynamics. We discussvarious implications of this fact, including possible new chiral fixed pointsand interesting examples of dangerously irrelevant operators.
