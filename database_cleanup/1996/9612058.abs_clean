Title: Whirling Waves and the Aharonov-Bohm Effect for Relativistic Spinning

ParticlesAuthors: H. O. Girotti and F. Fonseca Romero

The formulation of Berry for the Aharonov-Bohm effect is generalized to therelativistic regime. Then, the problem of finding the self-adjoint extensionsof the (2+1)-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian, in an Aharonov-Bohm backgroundpotential, is solved in a novel way. The same treatment also solves the problemof finding the self-adjoint extensions of the Dirac Hamiltonian in a backgroundAharonov-Casher.
