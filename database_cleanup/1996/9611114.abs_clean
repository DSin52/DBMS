Title: Exercises in equivariant cohomology

Authors: Raymond Stora

Comments: 17 pages, LaTeX, also available at

Equivariant cohomology is a mathematical framework particularly well adaptedto a kinematical understanding of topological gauge theories of thecohomological type. It also sheds some light on gauge fixing, a necessary fieldtheory operation connected with the non compactness of the gauge group. Therespective roles of fields and observables are emphasized throughout.
