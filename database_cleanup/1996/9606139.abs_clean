We show that configurations of multiple D-branes related by SU(N) rotationswill preserve unbroken supersymmetry. This includes cases in which two D-branesare related by a rotation of arbitrarily small angle, and we discuss some ofthe physics of this. In particular, we discuss a way of obtaining 4D chiralfermions on the intersection of D-branes.We also rephrase the condition for unbroken supersymmety as the conditionthat a `generalized holonomy group' associated with the brane configuration andmanifold is reduced, and relate this condition (in Type IIA string theory) to acondition in eleven dimensions.
