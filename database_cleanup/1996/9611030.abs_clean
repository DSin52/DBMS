We analyse the one-loop fermionic contribution for the scalar effectivepotential in the temperature dependent Yukawa model. In order to regularize themodel a mix between dimensional and analytic regularization procedures is used.We find a general expression for the fermionic contribution in arbitraryspacetime dimension. It is found that in D=3 this contribution is finite.
