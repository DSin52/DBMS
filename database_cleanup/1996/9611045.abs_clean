Title: Multiloop Feynman Integrals in the Worldline Approach

Authors: Michael G. Schmidt, Christian Schubert

Comments: 6 pages, standard Latex, no figures, talk given by M.G. Schmidt at

the International Seminar and Conference on Path Integrals, Dubna, Russia, 27- 31 May 1996We explain the concept of worldline Green functions on classes of multiloopgraphs. The QED beta function and the 2-loop Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian arediscussed for illustration.
