In this paper we compute the low energy absorption cross-section forminimally coupled massles scalars and spin-$1/2$ particles, into a generalspherically symmetric black hole in arbitrary dimensions. The scalars have across section equal to the area of the black hole, while the spin-$1/2$particles give the area measured in a flat spatial metric conformally relatedto the true metric.
