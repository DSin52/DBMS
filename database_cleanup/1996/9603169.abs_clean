We present an equivariant extension of the Thom form with respect to a vectorfield action, in the framework of the Mathai-Quillen formalism. The associatedTopological Quantum Field Theories correspond to twisted $N=2$ supersymmetrictopological sigma models and non-abelian monopoles on four-manifolds.
