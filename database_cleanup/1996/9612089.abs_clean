Multidimensional gravitational model on the manifold $M = M_0 \times\prod_{i=1}^{n} M_i$, where $M_i$ are Einstein spaces ($i \geq 1$), isconsidered. The action contains $m = 2^n -1$ dilatonic scalar fields$\phi^I$ and $m$ (antisymmetric) forms $A^I$. When all fields and scalefactors of the metric depend (essentially) on the point of $M_0$ and any $A^I$is "proportional" to the volume form of submanifold $M_{i_1} \times ...\times M_{i_k}$, $1 \leq i_1 < ... < i_k \leq n$, the sigma-modelrepresentation is obtained. A family of "Majumdar-Papapetrou type" solutionsare obtained, when all $M_{\nu}$ are Ricci-flat. A special class of solutions(related to the solution of some Diophantus equation on dimensions of$M_{\nu}$) is singled out. Some examples of intersecting p-branes (e.g.solution with seven Euclidean 2-branes for D = 11 supergravity) areconsidered.}
