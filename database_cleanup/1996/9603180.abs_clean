Gauge invariant local creation operators of charged states are introduced andstudied in pure gauge theories of the Maxwell type in 2+1D. These states areusually unphysical because of the subsidiary condition imposed on the physicalsubspace by Gauss' law. A dual Maxwell theory which possesses a topologicalelectric charge is introduced. Pure Electrodynamics lies in the sector wherethe topological charge identically vanishes. Charge bearing operators fullyexpressed in terms of the gauge field, however, can create physical states inthe nontrivial topological sectors which thereby generalize QED. An orderdisorder structure exists relating the charged operators and the magnetic fluxcreating (vortex) operators, both through commutation rules and correlationfunctions. The relevance of this structure for bosonization in 2+1D isdiscussed.
