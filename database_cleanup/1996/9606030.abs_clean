Title: 2-D gravisolitons in string theory

Comments: latex, 5pp

Several gravitational string backgrounds can be interpreted as 2-dim solitonsolutions of reduced axion-dilaton gravity. They include black-hole andworm-hole solutions as well as cosmological models with an exact conformalfield theory description. We illustrate the use of gravisolitons for theparticular example of Nappi-Witten universe which is thus "created" from flatspace by soliton dressing. We also make some general comments about the statusof gravisolitons in comparison to soliton solutions of other 2-dim integrablesystems without gravity.
