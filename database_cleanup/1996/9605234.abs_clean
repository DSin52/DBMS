Classically a black hole can absorb but not emit energy. We discuss how thisT-asymmetric property of black holes arises in the recently proposed(T-symmetric) microscopic models of black holes based on bound states ofD-branes. In these string theory based models, the nonvanishing classicalabsorption is made possible essentially by the exponentially increasingdegeneracy of quantum states with mass of the black hole. The classical limitof the absorption crosssection computed in the microscopic model agrees withthe result obtained from a classical analysis of a wave propagating in thebackground metric of the corresponding black hole (upto a numerical factor).
