Using the Steiner-Weyl expansion formula for parallel manifolds and the socalled gonihedric principle we find a large class of discrete integralinvariants which are defined on simplicial manifolds of various dimensions.These integral invariants include the discrete version of the Hilbert-Einsteinaction found by Regge and alternative actions which are linear with respect tothe size of the manifold. In addition the concept of generalized deficit anglesappear in a natural way and is related to higher order curvature terms. Theseangles may be used to introduce various aspects of rigidity in simplicialquantum gravity.
