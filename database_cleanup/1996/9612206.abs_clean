The time evolution of correlation functions in statistical systems isdescribed by an exact functional differential equation for the correspondinggenerating functionals. This allows for a systematic discussion ofnon-equilibrium physics and the approach to equilibrium without the need ofsolving the nonlinear microscopic equations of motion or computing the timedependence of the probability distribution explicitly.
