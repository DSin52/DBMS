A new tool for the investigation of $2+1$ dimensional gravity is proposed. Itis shown that in a stationary $2+1$ dimensional spacetime, the eigenvectors ofthe covariant derivative of the timelike Killing vector form a rigid structure,the {\it principal Killing triad}. Two of the triad vectors are null, and inmany respects they play the role similar to the principal null directions inthe algebraically special 4-D spacetimes. It is demonstrated that the principalKilling triad can be efficiently used for classification and study ofstationary $2+1$ spacetimes.One of the most interesting applications is a study of minimal surfaces in astationary spacetime. A {\it principal Killing surface} is defined as a surfaceformed by Killing trajectories passing through a null ray, which is tangent toone of the null vectors of the principal Killing triad. We prove that aprincipal Killing surface is minimal if and only if the corresponding nullvector is geodesic. Furthermore, we prove that if the $2+1$ dimensionalspacetime contains a static limit, then the only regular stationary timelikeminimal 2-surfaces that cross the static limit, are the minimal principalKilling surfaces.A timelike minimal surface is a solution to the Nambu-Goto equations ofmotion and hence it describes a cosmic string configuration. A stationarystring interacting with a $2+1$ dimensional rotating black hole is discussed indetail.
