Title: Topology Change and Nonperturbative Instability of Black Holes in

Quantum GravityComments: 17 pages, TeX, requires phyzzx.tex

Topology change in quantum gravity is considered. An exact wave function ofthe Universe is calculated for topological Chern-Simons 2+1 dimensionalgravity. This wave function occurs as the effect of a quantum anomaly whichleads to the induced gravity. We find that the wave function dependsuniversally on the topology of the two-dimensional space. Indeed, the propertyof the ground state wave function of Chern-Simons gravity which has anattractive physical interpretation is that it becomes large in the infrared(large distances) if the Universe has ``classical'' topology $S^2\times R$. Onthe other hand, nonclassical topologies ${\Sigma}_g\times R$, where${\Sigma}_g$ is the Riemann surface of genus g, are driven by quantum effectsinto the Planckian regime (``space-time foam''). The similar behavior of thequantum gravitational measure on four-manifolds constructed recently isdiscussed as the next example. We discuss the new phenomenon of thenonperturbative instability of black holes discovered recently. One finds thatthe Planck- sized black holes are unstable due to topology change. The decayrate is estimated using the instanton approximation. A possible solution to theprimordial black hole problem in quantum cosmology is suggested.
