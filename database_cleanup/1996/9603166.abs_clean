Complex frequency modes occur for a scalar field near a rapidly rotating star{\it with ergoregion but no event horizon}. Such complex frequency modes mustbe included in the quantization of the field. As a model for this system, wehave investigated a real scalar field with mass $\mu $ in a one-dimensionalsquare-well potential. If the depth of the potential is greater than $\mu^2$,then there exist imaginary frequency modes. It is possible to quantize thissimple system, but the mode operators for imaginary frequencies satisfy unusualcommutation relations and do not admit a Fock-like representation or a groundstate. Similar properties have been discussed already by Fulling for a complexscalar field interacting with an external electrostatic potential. We areinterested in the field dynamics in the physical case where the initial stateof the quantum field is specified before the complex frequency modes develop.As a model for this, we investigated a free scalar field whose ``mass" isnormal in the past and becomes ``tachyonic" in the future. A particle detectorin the far future placed in the in-vacuum state shows non-vanishing excitationsrelated to the imaginary frequency modes as well. Implications of these resultsfor the question of vacuum stability near rapidly rotating stars and possibleapplications to other fields in physics are discussed briefly.
