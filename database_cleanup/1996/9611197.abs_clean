We study the patterns in the duality of a wide class of N=1 supersymmetricgauge theories in four dimensions. We present many new generalizations of theclassic duality models of Kutasov and Schwimmer, which have themselves beengeneralized numerous times in works of Intriligator, Leigh and the presentauthors. All of these models contain one or two fields in a two-index tensorrepresentation, along with fields in the defining representation. Thesuperpotential for the two-index tensor(s) resembles A_k or D_k singularityforms, generalized from numbers to matrices. Looking at the ensemble of thesemodels, classifying them by superpotential, gauge group, and ``level'' -- forterminology we appeal to the architecture of a typical European-style theatre
