Novgorod, 24-30 June 1996Minimal N=1/2 supersymmetric extension of bosonic Polyakov's string isconstructed. This model is natural generalization of Di Vecchia-Ravndalsuperparticle. The classical sector of the model is investigated, Noethercurrents and Virosoro supercondition are found. Minimal spinning string is moresimple, than the standard N=1 spinning string of Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond and has anumber of unusial properties such as a chiral symmetry, parabolic type ofequations of movement, non-triviality fermionic sectors for closed strings onlyand e.t.c.
