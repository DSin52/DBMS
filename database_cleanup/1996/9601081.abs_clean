The dependence of the effective action for gauge theories on the backgroundfield obeys an exact identity. We argue that for Abelian theories the Wardidentity follows from the more general background field identity. Thisobservation is particularly relevant for the anomalous Ward identity valid forgauge theories with an effective infrared cutoff as used for flow equations.
