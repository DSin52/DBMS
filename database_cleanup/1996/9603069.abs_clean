Seiberg-Witten solutions of four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theoriespossess rich but involved integrable structures. The goal of this paper is toshow that an isomonodromy problem provides a unified framework forunderstanding those various features of integrability. The Seiberg-Wittensolution itself can be interpreted as a WKB limit of this isomonodromy problem.The origin of underlying Whitham dynamics (adiabatic deformation of anisospectral problem), too, can be similarly explained by a more refinedasymptotic method (multiscale analysis). The case of $N=2$ SU($s$)supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory without matter is considered in detail forillustration. The isomonodromy problem in this case is closely related to thethird Painlev\'e equation and its multicomponent analogues. An implicitrelation to $t\tbar$ fusion of topological sigma models is thereby expected.
