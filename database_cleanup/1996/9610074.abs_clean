The Beckenstein-Hawking black hole entropy in string theory and itsextensions, as expressed in terms of charges that correspond to centralextensions of the supersymmetry algebra, has more symmetries than U-duality. Itis invariant under transformations of the charges, involving a 12th (or 13th)``dimension''. This is an indication that the secret theory behind stringtheory has a superalgebra involving Lorentz non-scalar extensions (that are notstrictly central), as suggested in S-theory, and which could be hidden in M- orF- theories. It is suggested that the idea of spacetime is broader than usual,and that a larger ``spacetime" is partially present in black holes.
