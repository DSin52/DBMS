We discuss $SU(N_c)$ gauge theory coupled to two adjoint chiral superfields$X$ and $Y$, and a number of fundamental chiral superfields $Q^i$. We add asuperpotential that has the form of Arnold's $D$ series $W = \Tr X^{k+1} + \TrXY^2$. We present a dual description in terms of an $SU(3kN_f - N_c)$ gaugetheory, and we show that the duality passes many tests. At the end of thepaper, we show how a deformation of this superpotential flows to anotherduality having a product gauge group $SU(N_c)\times SU(N_c')$, with an adjointfield charged under $SU(N_c)$, an adjoint field charged under $SU(N_c')$,fields in the $(N_c,N_c')$ and $(\overline N_c,\overline N_c')$ representation,and a number of fundamentals. The dual description is an $SU(2kN_f' + kN_f -N_c')\times SU(2kN_f + kN_f' - N_c)$ gauge theory.
