The initial classification of fusion rules have shown that rational conformalfield theory is very limited. In this paper we study the fusion rules of extended current algebras. Explicit formulas are given for the S matrix and thefusion rules, based on the full splitting of the fixed point fields. We findthat in s ome cases sensible fusion rules are obtained, while in others thisprocedure lea ds to fractional fusion constants.
