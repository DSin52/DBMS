The conditions leading to a nontrivial renormalization of the topologicalcharge in four--dimensional Yang--Mills theory are discussed. It is shown thatif the topological term is regarded as the limit of a certain nontopologicalinteraction, quantum effects due to the gauge bosons lead to a finitemultiplicative renormalization of the theta--parameter while fermions give riseto an additional shift of theta. A truncated form of an exact renormalizationgroup equation is used to study the scale dependence of the theta--parameter.Possible implications for the strong CP--problem of QCD are discussed.
