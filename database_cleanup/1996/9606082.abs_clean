We investigate higher-dimensional analogues of the $bc$ systems of 2D RCFT.When coupled to gauge fields and Beltrami differentials defining integrableholomorphic structures the $bc$ partition functions can be explicitly evaluatedusing anomalies and holomorphy. The resulting induced actions generalize thechiral algebras of 2D RCFT to $2n$ dimensions. Moreover, $bc$ systems in fourand six dimensions are closely related to supersymmetric matter. In particular,we show that $d=4, \CN=2$ hypermultiplets induce a theory of self-dualYang-Mills fields coupled to self-dual gravity. In this way the $bc$ systemsfermionize both the algebraic sector of the $WZW_4$ theory, as defined by Losevet. al., and the classical open $\CN_{ws}=2$ string.
