We study critical and universal behaviors of unitary invariant non-gaussianrandom matrix ensembles within the framework of the large-N renormalizationgroup. For a simple double-well model we find an unstable fixed point and astable inverse-gaussian fixed point. The former is identified as the criticalpoint of single/double-arc phase transition with a discontinuity of the thirdderivative of the free energy. The latter signifies a novel universality oflarge-N correlators other than the usual single arc type. This phase structureis consistent with the universality classification of two-level correlators formultiple-arc models by Ambjorn and Akemann. We also establish the stability ofthe gaussian fixed point in the multi-coupling model.
