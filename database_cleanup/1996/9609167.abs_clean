We generalize the previously established (0,2) triality of exactly solvablemodels, Landau-Ginzburg theories and Calabi-Yau manifolds to a number ofdifferent classes of (0,2) compactifications derived from (2,2) vacua. For theresulting models we show that the known (2,2) mirror constructions inducemirror symmetry in the (0,2) context.
