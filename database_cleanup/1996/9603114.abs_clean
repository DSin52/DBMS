Poisson algebraic structures on current manifolds (of maps from a finitedimensional Riemannian manifold into a 2-dimensional manifold) are investigatedin terms of symplectic geometry. It is shown that there is a one to onecorrespondence between such current manifolds and Poisson current algebras withthree generators. A geometric meaning is given to q-deformations of currentalgebras. The geometric quantization of current algebras and quantum currentalgebraic maps is also studied.
