A family of type IIB superstring backgrounds involving Ramond-Ramond fieldsare obtained in ten dimensions starting from a K-model through a generalizationof our recent results. The unbroken global $SL(2,R)$ symmetry of the type IIBequations of motion are implemented in this context as a solution generatingtransfromation. A geometrical analysis, based on the tensor structure of thehigher order $\alpha^{\prime}$ terms in the equations of motion, is employed toshow that these backgrounds are exact.
