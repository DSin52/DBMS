Title: Boundary Operators in Euclidean Quantum Gravity

Authors: Ivan G. Avramidi, Giampiero Esposito and Alexander Yu. Kamenshchik

Comments: 29 pages, plain-tex. In this revised version, the analysis of the

self-adjointness problem with Barvinsky boundary conditions has been amended.For this purpose, section 4 has been completely revised, and a new sectionhas been added. The literature on the axial gauge is also describedJournal-ref: Class.Quant.Grav. 13 (1996) 2361-2374

Gauge-invariant boundary conditions in Euclidean quantum gravity can beobtained by setting to zero at the boundary the spatial components of metricperturbations, and a suitable class of gauge-averaging functionals. This papershows that, on choosing the de Donder functional, the resulting boundaryoperator involves projection operators jointly with a nilpotent operator.Moreover, the elliptic operator acting on metric perturbations is symmetric.Other choices of mixed boundary conditions, for which the normal components ofmetric perturbations can be set to zero at the boundary, are then analyzed indetail. Last, the evaluation of the 1-loop divergence in the axial gauge forgravity is obtained. Interestingly, such a divergence turns out to coincidewith the one resulting from transverse-traceless perturbations.
