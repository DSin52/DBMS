We present a generalization of the Frolov-Slavnov invariant regularizationscheme for chiral fermion theories in curved spacetimes. local gauge symmetriesof the theory, including local Lorentz invariance. The perturbative schemeworks for arbitrary representations which satisfy the chiral gauge anomaly andthe mixed Lorentz-gauge anomaly cancellation conditions. Anomalous theories onthe other hand manifest themselves by having divergent fermion loops whichremain unregularized by the scheme. Since the invariant scheme is promoted toalso include local Lorentz invariance, spectator fields which do not couple togravity cannot be, and are not, introduced. Furthermore, the scheme is trulychiral (Weyl) in that all fields, including the regulators, are left-handed;and only the left-handed spin connection is needed. The scheme is, therefore,well suited for the study of the interaction of matter with all four knownforces in a completely chiral fashion. In contrast with the vectorlikeformulation, the degeneracy between the Adler-Bell-Jackiw current and thefermion number current in the bare action is preserved by the chiralregularization scheme.
