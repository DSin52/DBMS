We prove the universality of correlation functions of chiral complex matrixmodels in the microscopic limit (N->\infty, z->0, N z=fixed) which magnifiesthe crossover region around the origin of the eigenvalue distribution. Theproof exploits the fact that the three-term difference equation for orthogonalpolynomials reduces into a universal second-order differential (Bessel)equation in the microscopic limit.
