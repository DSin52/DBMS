We consider the standard vector gauging of Lorentz group $ SO(3,1) $ WZWmodel by its non-semisimple null Euclidean subgroup in two dimensions $ E(2) $.The resultant effective action of the theory is seen to describe a onedimensional bosonic field in the presence of external charge that we interpretit as a Liouville field. Gauging a boosted $ SO(3) $ subgroup, we find that inthe limit of the large boost, the theory can be interpreted as an interactingToda theory. We also take the generalized non-standard bilinear form for$SO(3,1) $ and gauge both $ SO(3) $ and $E(2)$ subgroups and discuss theresultant theories.
