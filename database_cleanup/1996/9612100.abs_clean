A generalization of the classical one-dimensional Darboux transformation toarbitrary n-dimensional oriented Riemannian manifolds is constructed using anintrinsic formulation based on the properties of twisted Hodge Laplacians. Theclassical two-dimensional Moutard transformation is also generalized tonon-compact oriented Riemannian manifolds of dimension n greater than one. Newexamples of quasi-exactly solvable multidimensional matrix Schr\"odingeroperators on curved manifolds are obtained by applying the above results.
