An elementary introduction into the Seiberg-Witten theory is given. Manyefforts are made to get it as pedagogical as possible, within a reasonablesize. The selection of the relevant material is heavily oriented towardsgraduate students. The basic ideas about solitons, monopoles, supersymmetry andduality are reviewed from first principles, and they are illustrated on thesimplest examples. The exact Seiberg-Witten solution to the low-energyeffective action of the four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric pure Yang-Millstheory with the gauge group SU(2) is the main subject of the review. Othergauge groups are also considered. Some related issues (like adding matter,confinement, string dualities) are outlined.
