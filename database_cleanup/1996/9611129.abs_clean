Title: Interlinked 3D and 4D 3-Quark Wave Functions in a Bethe-Salpeter Model

Comments: 13 pages, Latex.  e.mail

Using the method of Green's functions within the framework of aBethe-Salpeter formalism characterized by a pairwise $qq$ interaction with a 3Dsupport to its kernel (expressed in a Lorentz-covariant manner), the 4D BS wavefunction for a system of three identical relativistic spinless quarks isreconstructed from the corresponding 3D form which satisfies a {\it fullyconnected} 3D BSE. This result is a 3-body generalization of a similarinterconnection between the 3D and 4D 2-body wave functions that had been foundearlier under identical conditions of a 3D support to the corresponding BSkernel, using the ansatz of Covariant Instaneity for the pairwise $q\bar q$interaction. The generalization from spinless to fermion quarks isstraightforward.
