Scalar field theory with an asymmetric potential is studied at zerotemperature and high-temperature for phi^4 theory with both phi and phi^3symmetry breaking. The equations of motion are solved numerically to obtainO(4) symmetric and O(3) cylindrical symmetric bounce solutions. These solutionscontrol the rates for tunneling from the false vacuum to the true vacuum bybubble formation. The range of validity of the thin-wall approximation (TWA) isinvestigated. An analytical solution for the bounce is presented, whichreproduces the action in the thin-wall as well as the thick-wall limits.
