Elizalde, Vanzo, and Zerbini have shown that the effective action of two freeEuclidean scalar fields in flat space contains a `multiplicative anomaly' whenzeta-function regularization is used. This is related to the Wodzicki residue.I show that there is no anomaly when using a wide range of other regularizationschemes and further that this anomaly can be removed by an unusual choice ofrenormalisation scales. I define new types of anomalies and show that they havesimilar properties. Thus multiplicative anomalies encode no novel physics. Theymerely illustrate some dangerous aspects of zeta-function and Schwinger propertime regularization schemes.
