We study the space-times of non-extremal intersecting p-brane configurationsin M-theory, where one of the components in the intersection is a ``NUT,'' i.e.a configuration of the Taub-NUT type. Such a Taub-NUT configurationcorresponds, upon compactification to D=4, to a Gross-Perry-Sorkin (GPS)monopole. We show that in the decoupling limit of the CFT/AdS correspondence,the 4-dimensional transverse space of the NUT configuration in D=5 is foliatedby surfaces that are cyclic lens spaces S^3/Z_N, where N is the quantisedmonopole charge. By contrast, in D=4 the 3-dimensional transverse space of theGPS monopole is foliated by 2-spheres. This observation provides astraightforward interpretation of the microscopics of a D=4 string-theory blackhole, with a GPS monopole as one of its constituents, in terms of thecorresponding D=5 black hole with no monopole. Using the fact that thenear-horizon region of the NUT solution is a lens space, we show that if theeffect of the Kaluza-Klein massive modes is neglected, p-brane configurationscan be obtained from flat space-time by means of a sequence of dimensionalreductions and oxidations, and U-duality transformations.
