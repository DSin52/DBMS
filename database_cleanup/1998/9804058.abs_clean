Conformal techniques are applied to the calculation of integrals on AdS(d+1)space which define correlators of composite operators in the superconformalfield theory on the d-dimensional boundary. The 3-point amplitudes for scalarfields of arbitrary mass and gauge fields in the AdS supergravity arecalculated explicitly. For 3 gauge fields we compare in detail with the knownconformal structure of the SU(4) flavor current correlator <J_i^a J_j^b J_k^c>of the N=4, d=4 SU(N) SYM theory. Results agree with the free fieldapproximation as would be expected from superconformal non-renormalizationtheorems. In studying the Ward identity relating <J_i^a O^I O^J> to <O^I O^J>for (non-marginal) scalar composite operators O^I, we find that there is asubtlety in obtaining the normalization of <O^I O^J> from the supergravityaction integral.
