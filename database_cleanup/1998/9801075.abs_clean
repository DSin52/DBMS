Effects of boundary conditions of fields for compactified space directions onthe supersymmetric gauge theories are discussed. For general and possibleboundary conditions the supersymmetry is explicitly broken to yield universalsoft supersymmetry breaking terms, and the gauge symmetry of the theory canalso be broken through the dynamics of non-integrable phases, depending onnumber and the representation under the gauge group of matters. The4-dimensional supersymmetric QCD is studied as a toy model when one of thespace coordinates is compactified on $S^1$.
