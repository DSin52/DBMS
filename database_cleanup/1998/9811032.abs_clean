Non--minimal repulsive singularities (``repulsons'') in extended supergravitytheories are investigated. The short distance antigravity properties of therepulsons are tested at the classical and the quantum level by a scalartest--particle. Using a partial wave expansion it is shown that the particlegets totally reflected at the origin. A high frequency incoming particleundergoes a phase shift of $\frac{\pi}{2}$. However, the phase shift for alow--frequency particle depends upon the physical data of the repulson. Thecurvature singularity at a finite distance $r_h$ turns out to be transparentfor the scalar test--particle and the coordinate singularity at the originserves as a repulsive barrier at which particles bounce off.
