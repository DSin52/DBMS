The complete spectrum of D=6, N=4b supergravity with n tensor multipletscompactified on AdS_3 x S^3 is determined. The D=6 theory obtained from the K_3compactification of Type IIB string requires that n=21, but we let n bearbitrary. The superalgebra that underlies the symmetry of the resultingsupergravity theory in AdS_3 coupled to matter is SU(1,1|2)_L x SU(1,1|2)_R.The theory also has an unbroken global SO(4)_R x SO(n) symmetry inherited fromD=6. The spectrum of states arranges itself into a tower of spin-2supermultiplets, a tower of spin-1, SO(n) singlet supermultiplets, a tower ofspin-1 supermultiplets in the vector representation of SO(n) and a specialspin-1/2 supermultiplet also in the vector representation of SO(n). The SU(2)_Lx SU(2)_R Yang-Mills states reside in the second level of the spin-2 tower andthe lowest level of the spin-1, SO(n) singlet tower and the associated fieldtheory exhibits interesting properties.
