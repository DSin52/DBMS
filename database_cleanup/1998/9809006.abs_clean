We study the strong coupling limit of the 2-flavor lattice Schwinger model inthe Hamiltonian formalism using staggered fermions. We show that the problem offinding the low-lying states is equivalent to solving the Heisenbergantiferromagnetic spin chain. We find good agreement with the continuum theory.
