We analyze a particular SU(2) invariant sector of the scalar manifold ofgauged N=8 supergravity in five dimensions, and find all the critical points ofthe potential within this sector. The critical points give rise to Anti-deSitter vacua, and preserve at least an SU(2) gauge symmetry. Consistenttruncation implies that these solutions correspond to Anti-de Sittercompactifications of IIB supergravity, and hence to possible near-horizongeometries of 3-branes. Thus we find new conformal phases of softly broken N=4Yang--Mills theory. One of the critical points preserves N=2 supersymmetry inthe bulk and is therefore completely stable, and corresponds to an N=1superconformal fixed point of the Yang--Mills theory. The correspondingrenormalization group flow from the N=4 point has c_{IR}/c_{UV} = 27/32. Wealso discuss the ten-dimensional geometries corresponding to these criticalpoints.
