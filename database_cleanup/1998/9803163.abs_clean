We investigate the solutions of Nambu-Goto-type actions associated withcalibrations. We determine the supersymmetry preserved by these solutions usingthe contact set of the calibration and examine their bulk interpretation asintersecting branes. We show that the supersymmetry preserved by such solutionsis closely related to the spinor singlets of the subgroup $G$ of $Spin (9,1)$or $Spin (10,1)$ that rotates the tangent spaces of the brane. We find that thesupersymmetry projections of the worldvolume solutions are precisely those ofthe associated bulk configurations. We also investigate the supersymmetricsolutions of a Born-Infeld action. We show that in some cases this problem alsoreduces to counting spinor singlets of a subgroup of $Spin (9,1)$ acting on theassociated spinor representations. We also find new worldvolume solutions whichpreserve 1/8 of the supersymmetry of the bulk and give their bulkinterpretation.
