Superconformal symmetry in six-dimensions is analyzed in terms of coordinatetransformations on superspace. A superconformal Killing equation is derived andits solutions are identified in terms of supertranslations, dilations, Lorentztransformations, R-symmetry transformations and special superconformaltransformations. The full superconformal symmetry, which is shown to form thegroup OSp(2,6|N), is possible only if the supersymmetry algebra has N spinorialgenerators of the same chirality, corresponding to (N,0) supersymmetry. TheR-symmetry group is then Sp(N) and the corresponding superspace is R^{6|8N}. Wedefine superinversion as a map to the associated superspace of oppositechirality. General formulae for two-point and three-point correlation functionsof quasi-primary superfields are exhibited. The superconformal group insix-dimensions is reduced to a corresponding extended superconformal group infour-dimensions. Superconformally covariant differential operators are alsodiscussed.
