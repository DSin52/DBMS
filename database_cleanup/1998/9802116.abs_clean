Recently, Maldacena proposed that the large N limit of the N=4 supersymmetricgauge theory in four dimensions with U(N) gauge group is dual to the type IIBsuperstring theory on AdS_5 x S^5. We use this proposal to study the spectrumof the large N gauge theory on R x S^3 in a low energy regime. We find that thespectrum is discrete and evenly spaced, and the number of states at each energylevel is smaller than the one predicted by the naive extrapolation of theBekenstein-Hawking formula to the low energy regime. We also show that thegauge theory describes a region of spacetime behind the horizon as well as theregion in front.
