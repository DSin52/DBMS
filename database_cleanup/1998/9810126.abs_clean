We find new, local, non-supersymmetric conformal field theories obtained byrelevant deformations of the N=4 super Yang Mills theory in the large $N$limit. We contruct interpolating supergravity solutions that naturallyrepresent the flow from the N=4 super Yang Mills UV theory to thesenon-supersymmetric IR fixed points. We also study the linearization around theN=4 superconformal point of N=1 supersymmetric, marginal deformations. We showthat they give rise to N=1 superconformal fixed points, as expected fromfield-theoretical arguments.
