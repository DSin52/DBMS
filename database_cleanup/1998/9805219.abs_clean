Title: The Mass Operator in the Light-Cone Representation

Comments: Revtex, 8 pages

Journal-ref: Phys.Rev. D60 (1999) 105004

I argue that for the case of fermions with nonzero bare mass there is a termin the matter density operator in the light-cone representation which has beenomitted from previous calculations. The new term provides agreement withprevious results in the equal-time representation for mass perturbation theoryin the massive Schwinger model. For the DLCQ case the physics of the new termcan be represented by an effective operator which acts in the DLCQ subspace,but the form of the term might be hard to guess and I do not know how todetermine its coefficient from symmetry considerations.
