We introduce a set of scalar fields as test fields to study the dynamicalbehaviors of the BTZ (Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli) black hole. These includeminimally coupled scalar, conformally coupled scalar, dilaton, and tachyon. Tocalculate the decay rate of the BTZ black hole, we consider both the Dirichletboundary condition at spatial infinity and the stability condition. It turnsout that the tachyon may be a relevant field to get information of the BTZblack hole.
