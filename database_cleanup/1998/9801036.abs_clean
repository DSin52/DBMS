Five dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory compactified on a circle definesan effective N=2 supersymmetric theory for massless fields in four dimensions.Based on the relativistic Toda chain Hamiltonian proposed by Nekrasov, wederive the Picard-Fuchs equation on the moduli space of the Coulomb branch ofSU(2) gauge theory. Our Picard-Fuchs equation agrees with those from otherapproaches; the spectral curve of XXZ spin chain and supersymmetric cycle incompactified M theory. By making use of a relation to the Picard-Fuchs equationof SU(2) Seiberg-Witten theory, we obtain the prepotential and the effectivecoupling constant that incorporate both a perturbative effect of Kaluza-Kleinmodes and a non-perturbative one of four dimensional instantons. In the weakcoupling regime we check that the prepotential exhibits a consistent behaviorin large and small radius limits of the circle.
