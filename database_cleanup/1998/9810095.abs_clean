Using the background-metric independence for the traceless mode as well asthe conformal mode, 4D quantum gravity is described as a quantum field theorydefined on a non-dynamical background-metric. The measure then induces anaction with 4 derivatives. So we think that 4-th order gravity is essential andthe Einstein-Hilbert term should be treated like a mass term. We introduce thedimensionless self-coupling constant t for the traceless mode. In this paper westudy a model where the measure can be evaluated in the limit $t \to 0$exactly, using the background-metric independence for the conformal mode. Thet-dependence of the measure is determined perturbatively using thebackground-metric independence for the traceless mode.
