We discuss the relation between string quantization based on the Schild pathintegral and the Nambu-Goto path integral. The equivalence between the twoapproaches at the classical level is extended to the quantum level by asaddle--point evaluation of the corresponding path integrals. A possiblerelationship between M-Theory and the quantum mechanics of string loops ispointed out. Then, within the framework of ``loop quantum mechanics'', weconfront the difficult question as to what exactly gives rise to the structureof spacetime. We argue that the large scale properties of the string condensateare responsible for the effective Riemannian geometry of classical spacetime.On the other hand, near the Planck scale the condensate ``evaporates'', andwhat is left behind is a ``vacuum'' characterized by an effective fractalgeometry.
