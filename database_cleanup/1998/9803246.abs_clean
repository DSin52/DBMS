We consider the gravitationally induced particle production from the quantumvacuum which is defined by a free, massless and minimally coupled scalar fieldduring the formation of a gauge cosmic string. Previous discussions of thistopic estimate the power output per unit length along the string to be of theorder of $10^{68}$ ergs/sec/cm in the s-channel. We find that this productionmay be completely suppressed. A similar result is also expected to hold for thenumber of produced photons.
