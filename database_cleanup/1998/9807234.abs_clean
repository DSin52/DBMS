Verma modules of superconfomal algebras can have singular vector spaces withdimensions greater than 1. Following a method developed for the Virasoroalgebra by Kent, we introduce the concept of adapted orderings onsuperconformal algebras. We prove several general results on the orderingkernels associated to the adapted orderings and show that the size of anordering kernel implies an upper limit for the dimension of a singular vectorspace. We apply this method to the topological N=2 algebra and obtain themaximal dimensions of the singular vector spaces in the topological Vermasingular vector. As a consequence we prove the conjecture of Gato-Rivera andRosado on the possible existing types of topological singular vectors (4 inchiral Verma modules and 29 in complete Verma modules). Interestingly, we havefound two-dimensional spaces of singular vectors at level 1. Finally, by usingthe topological twists and the spectral flows, we also obtain the maximaldimensions of the singular vector spaces for the Neveu-Schwarz N=2 algebra (0,1 or 2) and for the Ramond N=2 algebra (0, 1, 2 or 3).
