Three-point functions of analytic (chiral primary) operators in N=4Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions are calculated using the harmonicsuperspace formulation of this theory. In the case of the energy-momentumtensor multiplet anomaly considerations determine the coefficient. Analyticityin N=2 harmonic superspace is explicitly checked in a two-loop calculation.
