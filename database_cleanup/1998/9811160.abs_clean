PhysThe paper contains successive description of the strong-coupling perturbationtheory. Formal realization of the idea is based on observation that thepath-integrals measure for absorption part of amplitudes $\R$ is Diracian($\d$-like). New form of the perturbation theory achieved mapping the quantumdynamics in the space $W_G$ of (action, angle) type collective variables. It isshown that the transformed perturbation theory contributions are accumulated onthe boundary $\pa W_G$, i.e. are sensible to the $topology$ of factor space$W_G$ and,therefore, to the theory symmetry group $G$. The abilities of ourperturbation theory are illustrated by examples from quantum mechanics andfield theory. Considering the Coulomb potential $1/|x|$ the total reduction ofquantum degrees of freedom is demonstrated mapping the dynamics in the (angle,angular momentum, Runge-Lentz vector) space. To solve the (1+1)-dimensionalsin-Gordon model the theory is considered in the space (coordinates, momenta)of solitons. It is shown the total reduction of quantum degrees of freedom and,in result, there is not multiple production of particles. This result weinterpret as the $S$-matrix form of confinement. The scalar $O(4,2)$-invariantfield theoretical model is quantized in the $W_O=O(4,2)/O(4) {\times} O(2)$factor manifold. It is shown that the corresponding $\R$ is nontrivial becauseof the scale invariance breaking.
