In these lecture notes prepared for the 11th Taiwan Spring School, Taipei1997}, and updated for the Saalburg summer school 1998, we review the solutionsof O(N) or U(N) models in the large N limit and as 1/N expansions, in the caseof vector representations. The general idea is that invariant composite fieldshave small fluctuations for N large. Therefore the method relies onconstructing effective field theories for these composite fields afterintegration over the initial degrees of freedom. We illustrate these ideas byshowing that the large N expansion allows to relate the phib^2^2 theory and thenon-linear sigma-model, models which are renormalizable in differentdimensions. In the same way large N techniques allow to relate theGross--Neveu, an example of a theory with four-fermi self-interaction, with aYukawa-type theory renormalizable in four dimensions, a topic relevant for fourdimensional field theory. Among other issues for which large N methods are alsouseful we will briefly discuss finite size effects and finite temperature fieldtheory, because they involve a crossover between different dimensions.\parFinally we consider the case of a general scalar V(phib^2) field theory,explain how the large N techniques can be generalized, and discuss someconnected issues like tricritical behaviour and double scaling limit. Somesections in these notes are directly adapted from the work Zinn-Justin J.,1989, Quantum Field Theory and Critical Phenomena, Clarendon Press (Oxfordthird ed. 1996).
