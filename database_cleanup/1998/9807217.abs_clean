We investigate some properties of a system of Dirac fermions in 2+1dimensions, with a space dependent mass having domain wall like defects.Thesedefects are defined by the loci of the points where the mass changes sign. Ingeneral, they will be curves lying on the spatial plane. We show how to treatthe dynamics of the fermions in such a way that the existence of localizedfermionic zero modes on the defects is transparent. Moreover, effects due tothe higher, non zero modes, can be quantitatively studied. We also consider therelevance of the profile of the mass near the region where it changes sign.Finally, we apply our general results to the calculation of the inducedfermionic current, in the linear response approximation, in the presence of anexternal electric field and defects.
