The SL(2,Z) anomaly recently derived for type IIB supergravity in 10dimensions is shown to be a consequence of T-duality with the type IIA string,after compactification to 2 dimensions on an 8-fold. This explains the identityof the gravitational 8-forms appearing in different contexts in the effectiveactions of type IIA and IIB string theories. In this framework, constraints onthe compactification manifold arise from modular invariance of the 2d theory.Related issues in 6 dimensions are examined, and it is argued that similaranomalies are present on the worldvolumes of M-theory 5-branes and orientifold5-planes.
