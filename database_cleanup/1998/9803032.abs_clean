Title: Quantum radiation from spherical mirrors

Authors: L. Hadasz, M. Sadzikowski and P. Wegrzyn

Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX

We consider mirrors of the spherical shape, that can expand or contract. Dueto the excitation of the vacuum around, some spherical waves radiated fromvibrating mirrors are encountered. Using experience from well-known literatureon studies of two-dimensional conformal models, we adopt a similar framework toinvestigate such quantum phenomena in four dimensions. We calculate quantumaverages of the energy-momentum tensor for s-wave approximation.
