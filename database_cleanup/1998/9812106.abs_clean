In a recent paper it was shown that the response of an integrable QFT undervariation of the Unruh temperature can be computed from a S-matrix preservingdeformation of the form factor approach. We give explicit expressions for theSine-Gordon and SU(2) Thirring model, several perturbed minimal CFTs and thereal coupling affine Toda series. A uniform pattern is found to emerge whenboth the S-matrix and the deformed form factors are expressed in terms Barnes'multi-periodic functions.
