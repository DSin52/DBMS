We consider a model which in a certain limit reduces to the large N ${\calN}=1$ supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory without matter. The gaugino condensatein this model is controlled by the dynamics of an additional singletsuperfield. Using this model we explicitly construct BPS domain walls arisingdue to the chiral symmetry breaking. In particular, in the large N limit weobtain the exact shapes of the domain walls corresponding to solitons, and alsoof the domain walls interpreted as D-branes on which the SQCD string can end,whose existence was previously argued by Witten in the context of the large NSQCD. We also discuss various points which appear to support the consistency ofthe D-brane interpretation for these domain walls within the SQCD stringcontext.
