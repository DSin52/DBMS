Supersymmetry is used to derive conditions on higher derivative terms in theeffective action of type IIB supergravity. Using these conditions, we are ableto prove earlier conjectures that certain modular invariant interactions oforder alpha' **3 relative to the Einstein-Hilbert term are proportional toeigenfunctions of the Laplace operator on the fundamental domain of SL(2,Z). Wealso discuss how these arguments generalize to terms of higher order in alpha',as well as to compactifications of supergravity.
