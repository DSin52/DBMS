11-25Poisson-Lie T-duality in quantum N=2 superconformal WZNW models isconsidered. The Poisson-Lie T-duality transformation rules of thesuper-Kac-Moody algebra currents are found from the conjecture that, as in theclassical case, the quantum Poisson-Lie T-duality is given by an automorphismwhich interchanges the isotropic subalgebras of the underlying Manin triple ofthe model. It is shown that quantum Poisson-Lie T-duality acts on thegenerators of the N=2 super-Virasoro algebra of the quantum models as a mirrorwhile in another chirality sector it changes the sign of the U(1) current andinterchanges the spin-3/2 currents. A generalization of Poisson-Lie T-dualityfor the Kazama-Suzuki models is proposed. It is shown that quantum Poisson-LieT-duality acts in these models as a mirror symmetry also.
