If G is a simple non-compact Lie group, with K its maximal compact subgroup,such that K contains a one-dimensional center C, then the coset space G/K is anHermitian symmetric non-compact space. SL(2,R)/U(1) is the simplest example ofsuch a space. It is only when G/K is an Hermitian symmetric space that thereexists unitary discrete representations of G. We will here study stringtheories defined as G/K', K'=K/C, WZNW models. We will establish unitarity forsuch string theories for certain discrete representations. This proofgeneralizes earlier results on SL(2,R), which is the simplest example of thisclass of theories. We will also prove unitarity of G/K conformal field theoriesgeneralizing results for SL(2,R)/U(1). We will show that the physical space ofstates lie in the subspace of the G/K state space.
