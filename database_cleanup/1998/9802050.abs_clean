It is shown that SU(N) gauge theory coupled to adjoint Higgs can beexplicitly re-written in terms of SU(N) gauge invariant dynamical variableswith local physical interactions. The resultant theory has a novel compactabelian $U(1)^{(N - 1)}$ gauge invariance. The above abelian gauge invarianceis related to the adjoint Higgs field and not to the gauge group SU(N). In thisabelianized version the magnetic monopoles carrying the magnetic charges of$(N-1)$ types have a natural origin and therefore appear explicitly in thepartition function as Dirac monopoles along with their strings. The gaugeinvariant electric and magnetic charges with respect to $U(1)^{(N-1)}$ gaugegroups are shown to be vectors in root and co-root lattices of SU(N)respectively. Therefore, the Dirac quantization condition corresponds to SU(N)Cartan matrix elements being integers. We also study the effect of the $\theta$term in the abelian version of the theory.
