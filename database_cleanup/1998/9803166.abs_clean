Following the recent work of Connes, Douglas and Schwarz, we study theM(atrix) model compactified on a torus with a background of the three-formfield. This model is given by a super Yang-Mills theory on a quantum torus. Toconsider twisted gauge field configurations, we construct twisted U(n) bundleson the quantum torus as a deformation of its classical counterpart. By properlytaking into account membranes winding around the light-cone direction, wederive from the M(atrix) model the BPS spectrum which respects the fullSL(2,Z)*SL(2,Z) U-duality in M theory.
