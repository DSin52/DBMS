Title: Thermostring Quantization. Interpretation of Strings as Particles at

Finite TemperatureAuthors: Zahid Zakir

Comments: 7 pages, 24 Kb, LaTeX

Temperature paths of a point particle in the space - temperature manyfold canbe represented as strings with length L=1 /kT (thermostrings). During the timeevolution the thermostring swept any surface in the space-time-temperaturemanyfold. The thermostring is closed, it's points can be rearranged and thecharge is to be distributed along the length. Some predictions of thermostringquantization for statistical mechanics and string theory cases are discussed.It is shown that superstrings IIA and heterotic strings can be interpreted asthermostrings at Planck temperature.
