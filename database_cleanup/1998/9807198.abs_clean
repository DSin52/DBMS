``Relativity, Particle Physics, and Cosmology'', Texas A&M University, April1998, published by World Scientific; references addedAfter a brief review of matrix theory compactification leading tononcommutative supersymmetric Yang-Mills gauge theory, we present solutions forthe fundamental and adjoint sections on a two-dimensional twisted quantum torusin two different gauges. We also give explicit transformations connectingdifferent representations which have appeared in the literature. Finally wediscuss the more mathematical concept of Morita equivalence of C*-algebras asit applies to our specific case.
