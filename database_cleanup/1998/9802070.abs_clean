With the third order Monge-Amp\`ere equation as an example, we show thatthere exists an infinite number of nonlocal conserved charges associated withthe Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde equations. A general prescription forthe construction of these charges is given and the charge algebra is calculatedbringing out various other interesting features associated with such systems.
