The magnetic response of the charged anyon fluid at temperatures larger thanthe fermion energy gap is investigated in the self-consistent fieldapproximation. In this temperature region a new phase, characterized by aninhomogeneous magnetic penetration, is found. The inhomogeneity is linked tothe existence of an imaginary magnetic mass which increases with thetemperature. The system stability in the new phase is proved by investigatingthe electromagnetic field rest-energy spectrum.
