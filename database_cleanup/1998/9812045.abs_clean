Comments: Cover plus 9 Latex pages, no figures

We construct a partition function for fields obeying a quasiperiodic boundarycondition at finite temperature, $\psi(0;\vec x)= e^{i\theta} \psi(\beta;\vecx)$, which interpolate continously that ones corresponding to bosons andfermions and discuss the possibility of condensation for these fields.
