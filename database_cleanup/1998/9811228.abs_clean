We show how certain F^4 couplings in eight dimensions can be computed usingthe mirror map and K3 data. They perfectly match with the correspondingheterotic one-loop couplings, and therefore this amounts to a successful testof the conjectured duality between the heterotic string on T^2 and F-theory onK3. The underlying quantum geometry appears to be a 5-fold, consisting of ahyperk"ahler 4-fold fibered over a IP^1 base. The natural candidate for thisfiber is the symmetric product Sym^2(K3). We are lead to this structure byanalyzing the implications of higher powers of E_2 in the relevant Borcherdscounting functions, and in particular the appropriate generalizations of thePicard-Fuchs equations for the K3.
