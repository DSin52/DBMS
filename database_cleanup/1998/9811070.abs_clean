The unconstrained classical system equivalent to spatially homogeneous SU(2)Yang-Mills theory with theta angle is obtained and canonically quantized. TheSchr\"odinger eigenvalue problem is solved approximately for the low lyingstates using variational calculation. The properties of the groundstate arediscussed, in particular its electric and magnetic properties, and the value ofthe "gluon condensate" is calculated. Furthermore it is shown that the energyspectrum of SU(2) Yang-Mills quantum mechanics is independent of the thetaangle. Explicit evaluation of the Witten formula for the topologicalsusceptibility gives strong support for the consistency of the variationalresults obtained.
