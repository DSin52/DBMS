Applications, Regensburg 1998Non equilibrium effective field theory is presented as an inhomogeneous fieldtheory, using a formulation which is analogous to that of a gauge theory. Thisformulation underlines the importance of structural aspects of non-equilibrium,effective field theories. It is shown that, unless proper attention is paid tosuch structural features, hugely different answers can be obtained for a givenmodel. The exactly soluble two-level atom is used as an example of both thecovariant methodology and of the conclusions.
