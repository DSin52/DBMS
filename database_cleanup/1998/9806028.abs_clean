Higher derivative terms in the effective action of certain Yang-Millstheories can be severely constrained by supersymmetry. We show that requiringsixteen supersymmetries in quantum mechanical gauge theory determines the $v^6$term in the effective action. Even the numerical coefficient of the $v^6$ termis fixed in terms of lower derivative terms in the effective action.
