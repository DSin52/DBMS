We consider QCD_3 with an odd number of flavors in the mesoscopic scalingregion where the field theory finite-volume partition function is equivalent toa random matrix theory partition function. We argue that the theory is parityinvariant at the classical level if an odd number of masses are zero. Byintroducing so-called pseudo-orthogonal polynomials we are able to relate thekernel to the kernel of the chiral unitary ensemble in the sector oftopological charge $\nu={1/2}$. We prove universality and are able to write thekernel in the microscopic limit in terms of field theory finite-volumepartition functions.
