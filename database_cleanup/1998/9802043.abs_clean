The conformal anomaly for 4D gravity-matter theories, which are non-minimallyrescaling of fields, treatment of total derivatives, hermiticity of the systemoperator and choice of measure. Scalar, spinor and vector fields are taken asthe matter quantum fields and their explicit conformal anomalies in thegravity-dilaton background are found. The cohomology analysis is done and somenew conformal invariants and trivial terms, involving the dilaton, areobtained. The symmetry of the constant shift of the dilaton field plays animportant role. The general structure of the conformal anomaly is examined. Itis shown that the dilaton affects the conformal anomaly characteristically forconformal invariant, $I_4$; 2)[Spinor] The dilaton does {\it not} change theconformal anomaly; 3)[Vector] The dilaton changes the conformal anomaly bythree new (generalized) conformal invariants, $I_4,I_2,I_{1}$. We present somenew anomaly formulae which are useful for practical calculations. Finally, theanomaly induced action is calculated for the dilatonic Wess-Zumino model. Wepoint out that the coefficient of the total derivative term in the conformalanomaly for the 2D scalar coupled to a dilaton is ambiguous. This resolves thedisagreement between calculations in refs.\cite{ENO,NO,SI97,KLV} and the resultof Hawking-Bousso\cite{BH}.
