Symposium on Nuclear Physics (NuSS'98), Seoul National University, June23-26, 1998, KoreaThis is an elementary introduction to Wilson renormalization group andcontinuum effective field theories. We first review the idea of Wilsonianeffective theory and derive the flow equation in a form that allows multipleinsertion of operators in Green functions. Then, based on this formalism, weprove decoupling and heavy-mass factorization theorems, and discuss how thecontinuum effective field theory is formulated in this approach.
