In the light of $\phi$-mapping method and topological current theory, thetopological structure and the topological quantization of arbitrary dimensionaltopological defects are obtained under the condition that the Jacobian$J(\phi/v) \neq 0$. When $J(\phi/v)=0$, it is shown that there exist thecrucial case of branch process. Based on the implicit function theorem and theTaylor expansion, we detail the bifurcation of generalized topological currentand find different directions of the bifurcation. The arbitrary dimensionaltopological defects are found splitting or merging at the degenerate point offield function $\vec \phi$ but the total charge of the topological defects isstill unchanged.
