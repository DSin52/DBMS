The self-field approach to quantum electrodynamics (QED) is used to study thebound state problem in light-front two-dimensional QED with massive matterfields. A composite matter field describing bound states is introduced and therelativistic bound state equation for the composite field including aself-potential is obtained. The Hamiltonian form of the bound state equation interms of the invariant mass squared operator is given. The eigenvalue problemof this operator is solved for a fixed value of the self-potential, thecorresponding eigenfunctions and the mass spectrum are found. In the case ofmassless matter fields, there are no self-field terms in the bound stateequation, and the invariant mass spectrum can be evaluated explicitly. Possibleways of deriving more complete information about the bound state spectrum arebriefly discussed.
