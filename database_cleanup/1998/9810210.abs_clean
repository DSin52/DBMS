We discuss two-dimensional sigma models on moduli spaces of instantons on K3surfaces. These N=(4,4) superconformal field theories describe the near-horizondynamics of the D1-D5-brane system and are dual to string theory on AdS_3. Wederive a precise map relating the moduli of the K3 type IIB stringcompactification to the moduli of these conformal field theories and thecorresponding classical hyperkaehler geometry. We conclude that, in the absenseof background gauge fields, the metric on the instanton moduli spacesdegenerates exactly to the orbifold symmetric product of K3. Turning on aself-dual NS B-field deforms this symmetric product to a manifold that isdiffeomorphic to the Hilbert scheme. We also comment on the mathematicalapplications of string duality to the global issues of deformations ofhyperkaehler manifolds.
