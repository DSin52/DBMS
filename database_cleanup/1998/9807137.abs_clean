approximations in the dual frame is discussed, (2) connection between theholographic energy/distance relation and the dual frame is madeJournal-ref: JHEP 9901 (1999) 003

We extend the correspondence between adS-supergravities and superconformalfield theories on the adS boundary to a correspondence between gaugedsupergravities (typically with non-compact gauge groups) and quantum fieldtheories on domain walls.
