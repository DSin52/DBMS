We consider the generation of Fayet-Iliopoulos terms at one string loop insome recently found N=1 open string orbifolds with anomalous U(1) factors withnonvanishing trace of the charge. Low-energy field theory arguments lead one toexpect a one loop quadratically divergent Fayet-Iliopoulos term. We show that aone loop Fayet-Iliopoulos term is not generated, due to a cancellation betweencontributions of worldsheets of different topology. The vanishing of the oneloop Fayet-Iliopoulos term in open string compactifications is related to thecancellation of twisted Ramond-Ramond tadpoles.
