We give another derivation of quark confinement in QCD from the viewpoint ofthe low-energy effective Abelian gauge theory of QCD obtained via Abelianprojection. It is based on the recently discoveredBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition in the four-dimensionalAbelian gauge theory. Moreover, we show that there exists a critical gaugecoupling constant in QCD, above which confinement set in and below which thereis no confinement. In a SU(N) gauge theory with $N_f$ flavored fermions, weargue that this leads to a critical value of fermion flavors $N_f^c$ for theconfinement as well as the chiral symmetry breaking, which separates thedeconfinement and chiral symmetric phase. A finite-temperature deconfinementtransition is also discussed briefly.
