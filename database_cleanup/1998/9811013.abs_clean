We determine the spectrum of D-string bound states in various classes ofgeneralized type I vacuum configurations with sixteen and eight supercharges.The precise matching of the BPS spectra confirms the duality betweenunconventional type IIB orientifolds with quantized NS-NS antisymmetric tensorand heterotic CHL models in D=8. A similar analysis puts the duality betweentype II (4,0) models and type I strings {\it without open strings} on a firmerground. The analysis can be extended to type II (2,0) asymmetric orbifolds andtheir type I duals that correspond to unconventional K3 compactifications.Finally we discuss BPS-saturated threshold corrections to the correpondinglow-energy effective lagrangians. In particular we show how the exact modulidependence of some F^4 terms in the eight-dimensional type II (4,0) orbifold isreproduced by the infinite sum of D-instanton contributions in the dual type Itheory.
