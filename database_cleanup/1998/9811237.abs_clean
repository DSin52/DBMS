Boundary conformal field theory is the suitable framework for a microscopictreatment of D-branes in arbitrary CFT backgrounds. In this work, we developboundary deformation theory in order to study the changes of boundaryconditions generated by marginal boundary fields. The deformation parametersmay be regarded as continuous moduli of D-branes. We identify a large class ofboundary fields which are shown to be truly marginal, and we derive closedformulas describing the associated deformations to all orders in perturbationtheory. This allows us to study the global topology properties of the modulispace rather than local aspects only. As an example, we analyse in detail themoduli space of c=1 theories, which displays various stringy phenomena.
