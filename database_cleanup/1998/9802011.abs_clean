Conference on Squeezed States and Uncertainty Relations (Lake Balatonfured,Hungary, May 27-31, 1997), to be published in the ProceedingsIf Einstein's photon is $E = cp = \hbar\omega$, Wigner's photon is itshelicity which is a Lorentz-invariant concept coming from the E(2)-like littlegroup for massless particles. In addition, the E(2)-like little group has twotranslation-like degrees of freedom. What happens to them? They are associatedwith the gauge degree of freedom. Since the physics of polarized light wavescan be formulated within the framework of the Lorentz group, it is now possibleto use polarization experiments to study the E(2)-like little group in terms ofquantities that can be measured in laboratories.
