Science PublishersA representation of the Lorentz group is given in terms of 4 X 4 matricesdefined over the hyperbolic number system. The transformation properties of thecorresponding four component spinor are studied, and shown to be equivalent tothe transformation properties of the complex Dirac spinor. As an application,we show that there exists an algebra of automorphisms of the complex Diracspinor that leaves the transformation properties of its eight real componentsinvariant under any given Lorentz transformation. Interestingly, therepresentation of the Lorentz algebra presented here is naturally embedded inthe Lie algebra of a group isomorphic to SO(3,3;R) instead of the conformalgroup SO(2,4;R).
