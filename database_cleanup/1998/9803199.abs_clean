Title: Constraints on the scalar potential from spectral action principle

Authors: T. Krajewski

Comments: Latex file, 21 pages and 8 eps figures included

Using noncommutative geometry, the standard tools of differential geometrycan be extended to a broad class of spaces whose coordinates are noncommutingoperators acting on a Hilbert space. In the simplest case of coordinates beingmatrix valued functions on space-time, the standard model of particle physicscan be reconstructed out of a few basic principles. Following these ideas, weinvestigate the general case of models arising from matrices and give theresulting constraints on the scalar potential and gauge couplings constants, aswell as some relations between fermionic and bosonic masses.
