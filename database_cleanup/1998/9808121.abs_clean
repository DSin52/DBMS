We consider the detailed renormalization of two (1+1)-dimensional gaugeand the "anomalous" Schwinger models. By regularizing the non-perturbativedivergences that appear in fermionic Green's functions of both models, we showthat the "tree level" photon propagator is ill-defined, thus forcing one to usethe complete photon propagator in the loop expansion of these functions. Weperform the renormalization of these divergences in both models to one looplevel, defining it in a consistent and semi-perturbative sense that we proposein this paper.
