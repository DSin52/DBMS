correctedWe generalize the recently proposed noncommutative ADHM construction to thecase of $\Gamma$-equivariant instantons over $\R^4$, with $\Gamma$ a Kleiniangroup. We show that a certain form of the inhomogeneous ADHM equationsdescribes instantons over a noncommutative deformation of the Kleinian orbifold$\C^2/\Gamma$ and we discuss the relation of this with Nakajima's descriptionof instantons over ALE spaces. In particular, we obtain a noncommutativeinterpretation of the minimal resolution of Kleinian singularities.
