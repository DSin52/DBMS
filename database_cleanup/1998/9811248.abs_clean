We investigate the Abelian projection with respect to the Polyakov loopoperator for SU(N) gauge theories on the four torus. The gauge fixed $A_0$ istime-independent and diagonal. We construct fundamental domains for $A_0$. Insectors with non-vanishing instanton number such gauge fixings are alwayssingular. The singularities define the positions of magnetically chargedmonopoles, strings or walls. These magnetic defects sit on the Gribov horizonand have quantized magnetic charges. We relate their magnetic charges to theinstanton number.
