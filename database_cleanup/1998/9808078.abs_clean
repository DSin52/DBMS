Using a novel approach to renormalization in the Hamiltonian formalism, westudy the connection between asymptotic freedom and the renormalization groupflow of the configuration space metric. It is argued that in asymptoticallyfree theories the effective distance between configuration decreases as highmomentum modes are integrated out.
