A conjectured duality between supergravity and $N=\infty$ gauge theoriesgives predictions for the glueball masses as eigenvalues for a supergravitywave equations in a black hole geometry, and describes a physics, most relevantto a high-temeperature expansion of a lattice QCD. We present an analyticalsolution for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, with eigenvalues given by zeroesof a certain well-computable function $r(p)$, which signify that the twosolutions with desired behaviour at two singular points become linearlydependent. Our computation shows corrections to the WKB formula $m^2= 6n(n+1)$for eigenvalues corresponding to glueball masses QCD-3, and gives the firststates with masses $m^2=$ 11.58766; 34.52698; 68.974962; 114.91044; 172.33171;241.236607; 321.626549, ... . In $QCD_4$, our computation gives squares ofmasses 37.169908; 81.354363; 138.473573; 208.859215; 292.583628; 389.671368;500.132850; 623.97315 ... for $O++$. In both cases, we have a powerful methodwhich allows to compute eigenvalues with an arbitrary precision, if needed so,which may provide quantative tests for the duality conjecture. Our resultsmatches with the numerical computation of [5] well withing precision reportedthere in both $QCD_3$ and $QCD_4$ cases. As an additional curiosity, we reportthat for eigenvalues of about 7000, the power series, although convergent, hascoefficients of orders ${10}^{34}$; tricks we used to get reliably the function$r(p)$, as also the final answer gets small, of order ${10}^{-6}$ in $QCD_4$.In principle we can go to infinitely high eigenavalues, but such computationsmaybe impractical due to corrections.
