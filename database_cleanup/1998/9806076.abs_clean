at the XXXIIIrd Rencontres de Moriond, Electroweak Interactions and UnifiedTheories, Les Arcs, Savoie, France, March 14-21, 1998Starting with two supersymmetric dual theories, we imagine adding a chiralperturbation that breaks supersymmetry dynamically. At low energy we then gettwo theories with soft supersymmetry-breaking terms that are generateddynamically. With a canonical Kahler potential, some of the scalars of the"magnetic" theory typically have negative mass-squared, and the vector-likesymmetry is broken. Since for large supersymmetry breaking the "electric"theory becomes ordinary QCD, the two theories are then incompatible. For smallsupersymmetry breaking, if duality still holds, the magnetic theory analysisimplies specific patterns of chiral symmetry breaking in supersymmetric QCDwith small soft masses.
