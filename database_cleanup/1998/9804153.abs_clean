It is outlined how deformations of field theoretical rigid symmetries can beconstructed and classified by cohomological means in the extended antifieldformalism. Special attention is devoted to deformations referring only to asubset of the rigid symmetries of a given model and leading to a nontrivialextension of the graded Lie algebra associated with that subset. The method isillustrated for a D=4, N=2 supersymmetric model where the central extension ofthe supersymmetry algebra emerges via a deformation. Deformations of gaugefixed actions with a BRST symmetry are discussed too and illustrated by theCurci-Ferrari model.
