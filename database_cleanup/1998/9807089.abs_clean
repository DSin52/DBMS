Naschie, C. Castro, editors), LaTeX file, 17 pages, typos correctedA massive vector gauge theory constructed from the matrix derivative approachof noncommutative geometry is compared with the Higgs-Connes-Lott theory. Inthe massive vector gauge theory, a new extra shift-like symmetry which is dueto the one form constant matrix derivative allows the theory to have a massterm while keeping the gauge symmetry intact. In the Higgs-Connes-Lott theory,the transformation of scalar field makes up the deficiency of symmetry due tothe mass term. Thus, when the scalar field is absent there remains no gaugesymmetry just like the Proca model. In the massive vector gauge theory, theshift-like symmetry makes up the deficiency of symmetry due to the mass termeven in the absence of the scalar field.
