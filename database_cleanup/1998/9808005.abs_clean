We find an expression for the effective superpotential describing the $N_c$vacua of $SU(N_c)$ SUSY gluodynamics. The superpotential reduces in someapproximation to the Veneziano-Yankielowicz expression amended by the termrestoring the discrete $Z_{2N_c}$ symmetry. Moreover, the superpotential, beingrestricted to one particular vacuum state, yields the expression which wasderived recently to describe all the lowest-spin physical states of the theory.The corresponding scalar potential has no cusp singularities and can be used tostudy the domain walls interpolating between the chirally asymmetric vacua ofthe model.
