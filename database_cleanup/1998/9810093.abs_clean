A representation of the Lorentz group is given in terms of 4 X 4 matricesdefined over a simple non-division algebra. The transformation properties ofthe corresponding four component spinor are studied, and shown to be equivalentto the transformation properties of the usual complex Dirac spinor. As anapplication, we show that there exists an algebra of automorphisms of thecomplex Dirac spinor that leave the transformation properties of its eight realcomponents invariant under any given Lorentz transformation. Interestingly, therepresentation of the Lorentz group presented here has a natural embedding inSO(3,3) instead of the conformal symmetry SO(2,4).
