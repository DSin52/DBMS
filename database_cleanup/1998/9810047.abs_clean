"Supersymetry and Quantum Symmetries", DubnaWe desribe the minimal configurations of the bosonic membrane potential, whenthe membrane wraps up in an irreducible way over $S^{1}\times S^{1}$. Themembrane 2-dimensional spatial world volume is taken as a Riemann Surface ofgenus $g$ with an arbitrary metric over it. All the minimal solutions areobtained and described in terms of 1-forms over an associated U(1) fiberbundle, extending previous results. It is shown that there are no infinitedimensional valleys at the minima.
