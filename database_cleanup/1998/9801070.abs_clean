Title: Probing Matrix Black Holes

Comments: 17 pages, harvmac

Black holes in matrix theory may consist of interacting clusters (correlateddomains) which saturate the uncertainty principle. We show that this assumptionqualitatively accounts for the thermodynamic properties of both charged andneutral black holes, and reproduces the asymptotic geometry seen by probes.
