Novel 3+1 dimensional N=2 superconformal field theories (with tensionless BPSstring solitons) are believed to arise when two sets of M5 branes intersectover a 3+1 dimensional hyperplane. We derive a DLCQ description of thesetheories as supersymmetric quantum mechanics on the Higgs branch of suitable 4dN=1 supersymmetric gauge theories. Our formulation allows us to determine thescaling dimensions of certain chiral primary operators in the conformal fieldtheories. We also discuss general criteria for quantum mechanical DLCQdescriptions of supersymmetric field theories (and the resulting multiplicitiesand scaling dimensions of chiral primary operators).
