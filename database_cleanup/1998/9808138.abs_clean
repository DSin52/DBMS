Recently, a new framework for solving the hierarchy problem was proposedwhich does not rely on low energy supersymmetry or technicolor. The fundamentalPlanck mass is at a TeV and the observed weakness of gravity at long distancesis due the existence of new sub-millimeter spatial dimensions. In this letter,we study how the properties of black holes are altered in these theories. Smallblack holes---with Schwarzschild radii smaller than the size of the new spatialdimensions---are quite different. They are bigger, colder, and longer-livedthan a usual $(3+1)$-dimensional black hole of the same mass. Furthermore, theyprimarily decay into harmless bulk graviton modes rather than standard-modeldegrees of freedom. We discuss the interplay of our scenario with theholographic principle. Our results also have implications for the bounds on thespectrum of primordial black holes (PBHs) derived from the photo-dissociationof primordial nucleosynthesis products, distortion of the diffuse gamma-rayspectrum, overclosure of the universe, gravitational lensing, as well as thephenomenology of black hole production. For example, the bound on the spectralindex of the primordial spectrum of density perturbations is relaxed from 1.25to 1.45-1.60 depending on the epoch of the PBH formation. In these scenariosPBHs provide interesting dark matter candidates; for 6 extra dimensions MACHOcandidates with mass $\sim 0.1M_\odot$ can arise. For 2 or 3 extra dimensionsPBHs with mass $\sim 2000 M_\odot$ can occur and may act as both dark matterand seeds for early galaxy and QSO formation.
