We verify the QED Ward identity for the two- and three -point functions atnon-equilibrium in the HTL limit. We use the Keldysh formalism of real timefinite temperature field theory. We obtain an identity of the same form as theWard identity for a set of one loop self-energy and one loop three-point vertexdiagrams which are constructed from HTL effective propagators and vertices.
