Duality symmetries are discussed for non-linear gauge theories of (n-1)-thrank antisymmetric tensor fields in general even dimensions d=2n. When thereare M field strengths and no scalar fields, the duality symmetry groups shouldbe compact. We find conditions on the Lagrangian required by compact dualitysymmetries and show an example of duality invariant non-linear theories. Wealso discuss how to enlarge the duality symmetries to non-compact groups bycoupling scalar fields described by non-linear sigma models.
