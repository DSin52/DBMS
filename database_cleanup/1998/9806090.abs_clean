We propose an alternative description of the spectrum of local fields in theclassical limit of the integrable quantum field theories. It is close tosimilar constructions used in the geometrical treatment of W-gravities. Ourapproach provides a systematic way of deriving the null-vectors that appear inthis construction. We present explicit results for the case of theA_1^{1}-(m)KdV and the A_2^{2}-(m)KdV hierarchies, different classical limitsof 2D CFT's. In the former case our results coincide with the classical limitof the construction of Babelon, Bernard and Smirnov.Some hints aboutquantization and off-critical treatment are also given.
