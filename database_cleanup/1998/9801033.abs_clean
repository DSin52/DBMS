We show that the stationary quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation ofnon-relativistic 1D systems, underlying Bohmian mechanics, takes the classicalform with $\partial_q$ replaced by $\partial_{\hat q}$ where $d\hat q={dq\over\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}$. The $\beta^2$ term essentially coincides with the quantumpotential that, like $V-E$, turns out to be proportional to a curvature arisingin projective geometry. In agreement with the recently formulated equivalenceprinciple, these ``quantum transformations'' indicate that the classical andquantum potentials deform space geometry.
