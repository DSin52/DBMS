The composite operator effective potential is compared with the conventionalDyson-Schwinger method as a calculational tool for (2+1)-dimensional quantumelectrodynamics. It is found that when the fermion propagator ansatz is putdirectly into the effective potential, it reproduces exactly the usual gapequations derived in the Dyson-Schwinger approach.
