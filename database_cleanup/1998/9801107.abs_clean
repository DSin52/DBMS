We show that the generators of canonical transformations in the triplecticmanifold must satisfy constraints that have no parallel in the usual fieldantifield quantization. A general form for these transformations is presented.Then we consider gauge fixing by means of canonical transformations in thisSp(2) covariant scheme, finding a relation between generators and gauge fixingfunctions. The existence of a wide class of solutions to this relation nicelyreflects the large freedom of the gauge fixing process in the triplecticquantization. Some solutions for the generators are discussed. Our results arethen illustrated by the example of Yang Mills theory.
