Title: Anti-symmetric Tensor Matter Fields and Non-Linear Sigma-Model

Comments: 9 pages, Latex

The equivalence between rank-2 anti-symmetric tensor fields, considered asgauge potentials, and torsionless non-linear $\sigma$-models suggests us tostudy the possibility of coupling tensorial matter with Yang-Mills fields,through the gauging of the isometries of the target space. We show that thiscoupling is actually possible; however, the matter appears no longer as anelementary field, but rather as a composite one, expressed in terms of thebosonic degrees of freedom of the $\sigma$-model. A possible phenomenologicalapplication is presented that describes the interactions among vector mesons interms of the geometrical properties of the target manifold. Also, spin-2 mesonresonances may naturally be accommodated whenever the $\sigma$-model's targetmanifold is non-symmetric.
