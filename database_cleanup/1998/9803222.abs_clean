The general conditions for the applicability of the Faddeev-Jackiw approachto gauge theories are studied. When the constraints are effective a new proofin the Lagrangian framework of the equivalence between this method and theDirac approach is given. We find, however, that the two methods may givedifferent descriptions for the reduced phase space when ineffective constraintsare present. In some cases the Faddeev-Jackiw approach may lose someconstraints or some equations of motion. We believe that this inequivalence canbe related to the failure of the Dirac conjecture (that says that the DiracHamiltonian can be enlarged to an Extended Hamiltonian including all firstclass constraints, without changes in the dynamics) and we suggest that whenthe Dirac conjecture fails the Faddeev-Jackiw approach fails to give thecorrect dynamics. Finally we present some examples that illustrate thisinequivalence.
