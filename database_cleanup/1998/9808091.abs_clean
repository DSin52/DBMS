The basic features of a quantum field theory which is Poincar\'e invariant,gauge invariant, finite and unitary to all orders of perturbation theory arereviewed. Quantum gravity is finite and unitary to all orders of perturbationtheory. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for a black hole is investigatedin a conical Rindler space approximation to a black hole event horizon. Arenormalization of the gravitational coupling constant is performed leading toa finite Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at the horizon.
