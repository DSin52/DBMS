We study all three-point functions of normalized chiral operators in D=4,$\CN=4$, U(N) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in the large $N$ limit. Wecompute them for small 't Hooft coupling $\lambda=g_{YM}^2N<<1$ using freefield theory and at strong coupling $\lambda=g_{YM}^2>>1$ using the $AdS$/CFTcorrespondence. Surprisingly, we find the same answers in the two limits. Weconjecture that at least for large $N$ the exact answers are independent of$\lambda $ .
