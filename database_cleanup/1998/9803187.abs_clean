The coupling to a 2+1 background geometry of a quantized charged testparticle in a strong magnetic field is analyzed. Canonical operators adaptingto the fast and slow freedoms produce a natural expansion in the inverse squareroot of the magnetic field strength. The fast freedom is solved to the secondorder.At any given time, space is parameterized by a couple of conjugate operatorsand effectively behaves as the `phase space' of the slow freedom. The slowHamiltonian depends on the magnetic field norm, its covariant derivatives, thescalar curvature and presents a peculiar coupling with the spin-connection.
