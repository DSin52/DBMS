Title: Open inflation without anthropic principle

Comments: 15 pages, LaTeX, a misprint in the Euclidean action algorithm is

correctedWe propose the mechanism of quantum creation of the open Universe in theobservable range of values of $\Omega$. This mechanism is based on theno-boundary quantum state with the Hawking-Turok instanton in the model withnonminimally coupled inflaton field and does not use any anthropicconsiderations. Rather, the probability distribution peak with necessaryparameters of the inflation stage is generated on this instanton due to quantumloop effects. In contrast with a similar mechanism for closed models, existingonly for the tunneling quantum state of the Universe, open inflation originatesfrom the no-boundary cosmological wavefunction.
