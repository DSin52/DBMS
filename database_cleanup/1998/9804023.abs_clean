Exact non-perturbative results have been conjectured for R^4 couplings intype II maximally supersymmetric string theory. Strong evidence has alreadybeen obtained, but contributions of cusp forms, invisible in perturbationtheory, have remained an open possibility. In this note, we use the D=8 N=2superfield formalism of Berkovits to prove that supersymmetry requires theexact R^4 threshold to be an eigenmode of the Laplacian on the scalar manifoldwith a definite eigenvalue. Supersymmetry and U-duality invariance thenidentify the exact result with the order-3/2 Eisenstein series, and rule outcusp form contributions.
