Starting from determinants at finite temperature obeying an intermediateboundary condition between the periodic (bosonic) and antiperiodic (fermionic)cases, we find results which can be mapped onto the ones obtained from anyonsfor the second virial coefficient. Using this approach, we calculate thecorresponding higher virial coefficients and compare them with the resultsknown in the literature.
