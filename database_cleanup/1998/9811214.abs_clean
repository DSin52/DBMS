We consider Donaldson-Witten theory on four-manifolds of the form $X=Y \times{\bf S}^1$ where $Y$ is a compact three-manifold. We show that there areinteresting relations between the four-dimensional Donaldson invariants of $X$and certain topological invariants of $Y$. In particular, we reinterpret aresult of Meng-Taubes relating the Seiberg-Witten invariants toReidemeister-Milnor torsion. If $b_1(Y)>1$ we show that the partition functionreduces to the Casson-Walker-Lescop invariant of $Y$, as expected on formalgrounds. In the case $b_1(Y)=1$ there is a correction. Consequently, in thecase $b_1(Y)=1$, we observe an interesting subtlety in the standardexpectations of Kaluza-Klein theory when applied to supersymmetric gauge theorycompactified on a circle of small radius.
