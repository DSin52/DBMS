We study issues pertaining to the Ricci-flatness of metrics on orbifoldsresolved by D-branes. We find a K\"ahler metric on the three-dimensionalorbifold $\C^3/\Z_3$, resolved by D-branes, following an approach due toGuillemin. This metric is not Ricci-flat for any finite value of the blow-upparameter. Conditions for the envisaged Ricci-flat metric for finite values ofthe blow-up parameter are formulated in terms of a correction to the K\"ahlerpotential. This leads to an explicit construction of a Ricci-flat K\"ahlermetric on the resolved orbifold. The correction can be interpreted as a part ofthe superspace-interaction in the corresponding gauged linear sigma-model.
