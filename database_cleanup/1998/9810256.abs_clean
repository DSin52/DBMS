An algorithm to obtain the Weyl anomaly in higher dimensions is presented. Itis based on the heat-kernel method. Feynman rules, such as the vertex rule andthe propagator rule, are given in (regularized) coordinate space. Graphicalcalculation is introduced. The 6 dimensional scalar-gravity theory is taken asan example, and its explicit result is obtained.
