We construct vacua of M-theory on S^1/Z_2 associated with Calabi-Yauthree-folds. These vacua are appropriate for compactification to N=1supersymmetry theories in both four and five dimensions. We allow for generalE_8 x E_8 gauge bundles and for the presence of five-branes. The five-branesspan the four-dimensional uncompactified space and are wrapped on holomorphiccurves in the Calabi-Yau space. Properties of these vacua, as well as of theresulting low-energy theories, are discussed. We find that the low-energy gaugegroup is enlarged by gauge fields that originate on the five-braneworld-volumes. In addition, the five-branes increase the types of new E_8 x E_8breaking patterns allowed by the non-standard embedding. Characteristicfeatures of the low-energy theory, such as the threshold corrections to thegauge kinetic functions, are significantly modified due to the presence of thefive-branes, as compared to the case of standard or non-standard embeddingswithout five-branes.
