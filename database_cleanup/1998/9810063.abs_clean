It is argued that N=6 supergravity on $AdS_5$, with gauge group $SU(3)\timesU(1)$ corresponds, at the classical level, to a subsector of the ``chiral''primary operators of N=4 Yang-Mills theories. This projection involves a``duality transformation'' of N=4 Yang-Mills theory and therefore can be validif the coupling is at a self-dual point, or for those amplitudes that do notdepend on the coupling constant.
