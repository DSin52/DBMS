By using a classical Liouville-type model of two dimensional dilaton gravitywe show that the one-loop theory implies that the fate of a black hole dependson the conformal frame. There is one frame for which the evaporation processnever stops and another one leading to a complete disappearance of the blackhole. This can be seen as a consequence of the fact that thermodynamicvariables are not conformally invariant. In the second case the evaporationalways produces the same static and regular end-point geometry, irrespective ofthe initial state.
