We prove Abelian magnetic monopole dominance in the string tension of QCD.Abelian and monopole dominance in low energy physics of QCD has been confirmedfor various quantities by recent Monte Carlo simulations of lattice gaugetheory. In order to prove this dominance, we use the reformulation of continuumYang-Mills theory in the maximal Abelian gauge as a deformation of atopological field theory of magnetic monopoles, which was proposed in theprevious article by the author. This reformulation provides an efficient wayfor incorporating the magnetic monopole configuration as a topologicalnon-trivial configuration in the functional integral. We derive a version ofthe non-Abelian Stokes theorem and use it to estimate the expectation value ofthe Wilson loop. This clearly exhibits the role played by the magnetic monopoleas an origin of the Berry phase in the calculation of the Wilson loop in themanifestly gauge invariant manner. We show that the string tension derived fromthe diagonal (abelian) Wilson loop in the topological field theory (studied inthe previous article) converges to that of the full non-Abelian Wilson loop inthe limit of large Wilson loop. Therefore, within the above reformulation ofQCD, this result (together with the previous result) completes the proof ofquark confinement in QCD based on the criterion of the area law of the fullnon-Abelian Wilson loop.
