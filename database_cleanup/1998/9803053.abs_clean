1 identify a correspondence between the various spherical harmonic modes ofmassless 11 dimensional fields propagating on the $AdS_{4/7}$ in an $AdS_{4/7}\times S^{7\4}$ compactification of M theory, and the corresponding operators,primary under the conformal group, on the world volume of $M_2,M_5$ branes.This is achieved by matching representations of the superconformal algebra onthe two sides of the correspondence.
