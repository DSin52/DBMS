Title: Algebraic Realization of Quark-Diquark Supersymmetry

Authors: Sultan Catto

Comments: 20 pages, Latex

Algebraic realizations of supersymmetry through SU(m,n) type superalgebrasare developed. We show their applications to a bilocal quark-antiquark or aquark-diquark systems. A new scheme based on SU(6/1) is fully exploited and thebilocal approximation is shown to get carried unchanged into it. Color algebrabased on octonions allows the introduction of a new larger algebra that putsquarks, diquarks and exotics in the same supermultiplet as hadrons andnaturally suppresses quark configurations that are symmetrical in color spaceand antisymmetrical in remaining flavor, spin and position variables. Apreliminary work on the first order relativistic formulation through the spinrealization of Wess-Zumino super-Poincare algebra is presented.
