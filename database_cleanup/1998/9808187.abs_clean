A four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric non-linear sigma-model with theEguchi-Hanson (ALE) target space and a non-vanishing central charge isrewritten to a classically equivalent and formally renormalizable gauged`linear' sigma-model over a non-compact coset space in N=2 harmonic superspaceby making use of an N=2 vector gauge superfield as the Lagrange multiplier. Itis then demonstrated that the N=2 vector gauge multiplet becomes dynamicalafter taking into account one-loop corrections due to quantizedhypermultiplets. This implies the appearance of a composite gauge boson, acomposite chiral spinor doublet and a composite complex Higgs particle, alldefined as the physical states associated with the propagating N=2 vector gaugesuperfield. The composite N=2 vector multiplet is further identified with thezero modes of a superstring ending on a D-6-brane. Some non-perturbativephenomena, such as the gauge symmetry enhancement for coincident D-6-branes andthe Maldacena conjecture, turn out to be closely related to our NLSM viaM-theory. Our results support a conjecture about the composite nature ofsuperstrings ending on D-branes.
