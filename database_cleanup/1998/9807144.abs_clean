Title: Fusion rules for N=2 superconformal modules

Comments: 11 pages, Latex 2e

In this note we calculate the fusion coefficients for minimal seriesrepresentations of the N=2 superconformal algebra by using a modifiedVerlinde's formula, and obtain associative and commutative fusion algebras withnon-negative integral fusion coefficients at each level. Some references areadded.
