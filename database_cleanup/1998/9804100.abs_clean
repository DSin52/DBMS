Title: Self-field QED(1+1) with massless matter fields

Comments: enlarged and revised version, LATEX file, 17 pp

We consider two-body problem in the self-field (1+1)-dimensional quantumelectrodynamics on the circle. We present two formulations of the problem whichcorrespond to two different types of variational principles and prove that bothformulations lead to the same spectrum of the two-body Hamiltonian withmassless matter fields. We give the exact and complete solution of therelativistic two-body equation in the massless case.
