Several quantum proper time derivatives are obtained from the Beck one in theusual framework of relativistic quantum mechanics (spin 1/2 case). The ``scalarHamiltonians'' of these derivatives should be thought of as the conjugatevariables of the proper time. Then, the Hamiltonians would play the role ofmass operators, suggesting the formulation of an adequate extended indefinitemass framework. We propose and briefly develop the framework corresponding tothe Feynman parametrization of the Dirac equation. In such a case we derive theother parametrizations known in the literature, linking the extension of thedifferent proposals of quantum proper time derivatives again.
