added; no other significant change)Performing functional integration of the free Lagrangian, we find the vacuumenergy of a field. The functional integration is performed in a way whicheasily generalizes to systems at non-zero temperature. We use this technique toobtain the Casimir energy density and pressure at arbitrary temperatures.
