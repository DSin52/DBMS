The periods of arbitrary abelian forms on hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces, inparticular the periods of the meromorphic Seiberg-Witten differential, areshown to be in one-to-one correspondence with the conformal blocks ofcorrelation functions of the rational logarithmic conformal field theory withcentral charge c=c(2,1)=-2. The fields of this theory precisely simulate thebranched double covering picture of a hyperelliptic curve, such that genericperiods can be expressed in terms of certain generalised hypergeometricfunctions, namely the Lauricella functions of type F_D.
