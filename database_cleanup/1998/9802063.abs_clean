Strong-weak duality invariance can only be defined for particular sectors ofsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. Nevertheless, for full non-Abeliannon-supersymmetric theories, dual theories with inverted couplings, have beenfound. We show that an analogous procedure allows to find the dual action tothe gauge theory of gravity constructed by the MacDowell-Mansouri model plusthe superposition of a $\Theta$ term.
