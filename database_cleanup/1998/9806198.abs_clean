Chaos, Solitons and FractalsThe Wigner-Weyl- Moyal approach to Quantum Mechanics is recalled, andsimilarities to classical probability theory emphasised. The Wignerdistribution function is generalised and viewed as a construction of a bosonicobject, a target space co-ordinate, for example, in terms of a bilinearconvolution of two fermionic objects, e.g. a quark antiquark pair. Thisconstruction is essentially non-local, generalising the idea of a localcurrent. Such Wigner functions are shown to solve a BPS generalised Moyal-Nahmequation.
