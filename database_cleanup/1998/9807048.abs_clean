Eigenstates of the parabose and parafermi creation operators are constructed.In the Dirac contour representation, the parabose eigenstates correspond to thedual vectors of the parabose coherent states. In order $p=2$, conserved-chargeparabose creation operator eigenstates are also constructed. The contour formsof the associated resolutions of unity are obtained.
