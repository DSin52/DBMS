By considering N=2 string amplitudes we determine the (2+2)-dimensionalself-dual Yang-Mills, together with their respective infinite towers ofhigher-spin inequivalent picture states. Novel `stringy' couplings amongstthese fields are essential ingredients of an action principle for the effectivetarget space field theory. We discuss the covariant description of this theoryin terms of self-dual fields on a hyperspace parametrised by the target spacecoordinate and a commuting chiral spinor.
