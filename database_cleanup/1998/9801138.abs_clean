Title: Event horizon - Magnifying glass for Planck length physics

Journal-ref: Phys.Rev. D59 (1999) 124012

An attempt is made to describe the `thermodynamics' of semiclassicalspacetime without specifying the detailed `molecular structure' of the quantumspacetime, using the known properties of blackholes. I give detailed arguments,essentially based on the behaviour of quantum systems near the event horizon,which suggest that event horizon acts as a magnifying glass to probe Plancklength physics even in those contexts in which the spacetime curvature isarbitrarily low. The quantum state describing a blackhole, in any microscopicdescription of spacetime, has to possess certain universal form of density ofstates which can be ascertained from general considerations. Since a blackholecan be formed from the collapse of any physical system with a low energyHamiltonian H, it is suggested that when such a system collapses to form ablackhole, it should be described by a modified Hamiltonian of the form$H^2_{\rm mod} =A^2 \ln (1+ H^2/A^2)$ where $A^2 \propto E_P^2$.I also showthat it is possible to construct several physical systems which have theblackhole density of states and hence will be indistinguishable from ablackhole as far as thermodynamic interactions are concerned. In particular,blackholes can be thought of as one-particle excitations of a class of {\itnonlocal} field theories with the thermodynamics of blackholes arisingessentially from the asymptotic form of the dispersion relation satisfied bythese excitations. These field theoretic models have correlation functions witha universal short distance behaviour, which translates into the genericbehaviour of semiclassical blackholes. Several implications of this paradigmare discussed.
