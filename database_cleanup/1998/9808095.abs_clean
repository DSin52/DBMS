Following Kachru, Kumar and Silverstein, we construct a set ofnon-supersymmetric Type II string models which have equal numbers of bosons andfermions at each mass level. The models are asymmetric {\bf Z}_2 \otimes {\bfZ}_2^{\prime} orbifolds. We demonstrate that this bose-fermi degeneracy featureimplies that both the one-loop and the two-loop contributions to thecosmological constant vanish. We conjecture that the cosmological constantactually vanishes to all loops. We construct a strong-weak dual pair of models,both of which have bose-fermi degeneracy. This implies that at least some ofthe non-perturbative corrections to the cosmological constant are absent.
