We discuss the open string ending on D $p$-branes in IKKT framework. First wedetermine the boundary conditions of Green-Schwarz superstring which areconsistent with supersymmetry and $\kappa$-symmetry. We point out somesubtleties arising from taking the Schild gauge and show that in this gauge thesystem incorporates the limited dimensional D $p$-branes ($p=3,7$). The matrixregularization for the Dirichlet open string is given by gauge group SO(N).When $p=3$, the matrix model becomes the dimensional reduction of a 6dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ super Yang-Mills theory.
