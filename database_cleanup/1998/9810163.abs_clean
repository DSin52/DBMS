Title: Brane Death via Born-Infeld String

Authors: Konstantin G. Savvidy

Comments: 5 pages, 1 figure

I revisit the solution of Born-Infeld theory which corresponds to a 3-braneand anti-brane joined by a (fundamental) string. The global instability of thisconfiguration makes possible the semiclassical tunneling into a wide, shorttube which keeps expanding out, thus annihilating the brane . This tunneling issuppressed exponentially as $\exp(- S_{cl}/g)$. The attraction between thebranes causes them to approach and at some point to tunnel, because the actionof the bounce solution goes to zero. The energy of the solution at the top ofthe barrier, the sphaleron, goes like $\sim D^3$ for large separarions D, whilethe energy of the string is proportional to its length D.
