We discuss higher-dimensional gravitational instantons by studyingappropriate self-duality equations for the spin connection. In seven and ineight dimensions, the corresponding spaces admit a covariantly constant spinorand have holonomies in G_2 and Spin(7), respectively. We find a non-compactsolution to the self-duality equations in eight dimensions in which theself-dual space has an elliptically-fibered structure.
