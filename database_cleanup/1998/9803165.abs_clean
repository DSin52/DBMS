We show that these Galileo-invariant systems, as wellas others related to them, admit a peculiar diffeomorphism symmetry, where thetransformation rule for coordinates involves the fields. The symmetry algebracoincides with that of the Poincare group in one higher dimension. Therefore,these models provide a nonlinear representation for a dynamical Poincare group.
