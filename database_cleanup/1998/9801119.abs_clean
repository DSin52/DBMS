In super-symmetric quantum theory, or in string theory, (includinggeneralizations of these theories to underlying quantum spaces) we study acertain partition function Z(Q,A,g). Here Q denotes a supercharge, A denotes anobservable with the property A^2 = I, and g denotes an element of a symmetrygroup of Q. The supercharge may depend on a parameter lambda, namely Q =Q(lambda). We give an elementary argument to show that Z, as defined, does notactually depend on lambda.
