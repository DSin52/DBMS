referencesThe generating functional of correlation functions of the currentscorresponding to general massless $p$-form potential is calculated in $AdS/CFT$correspondence of Maldacena. For this we construct the boundary-to-bulk Green'sfunctions of $p$-form potentials. The proportional constant of thecurrent-current correlation function, which is related to the central charge ofthe operator product expansion, is shown to be $c=(d-p\over 2\pi^{d/2})(\Gamma (d-p) \over \Gamma ({d\over 2}-p)).$ The result agrees with theknown cases such as $p=1$ or 2.
