Title: Field-antifield formalism in a non-Abelian theory with one and two form

gauge fields coupled in a topological wayComments: 15 pages, Latex, final version to appear in Photon and Poincare group

(Nova Science)We make a systematic development of the non-Abelian formulation of two-formgauge fields with topological coupling with the Yang-Mills one-form connection.An analysis of the gauge structure, reducibility conditions and physicaldegrees of freedom is presented. We employ the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism toquantize the resulting theory.
