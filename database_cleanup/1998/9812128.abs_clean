Title: Induced charges as probes of low energy effective theories

Comments: 13 pages, no figures

We suggest that the correspondence between gauge theories strongly coupled inthe infrared and their low energy effective theories may be probed byintroducing topologically non-trivial background scalar fields. We argue thatone loop expressions for the global charges induced in vacuum by thesebackground fields are in some cases exact in the fundamental theory, and henceshould be matched in the effective theory. These matching conditions aresometimes inequivalent to 't Hooft ones. A few examples of induced chargematching are presented.
