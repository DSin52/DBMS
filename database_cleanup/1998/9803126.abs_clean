We present a simple proof of the WDVV equations for the prepotential offour-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with all ADE gaugegroups. According to our proof it is clearly seen that the WDVV equations infour dimensions have their origin in the associativity of the chiral ring intwo-dimensional topological Landau-Ginzburg models. The WDVV equations for theBC gauge groups are also studied in the Landau-Ginzburg framework. We speculateabout the topological field theoretic interpretation of the Seiberg-Wittensolution of N=2 Yang-Mills theory.
