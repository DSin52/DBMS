Title: Soldering Formalism

Comments: LaTex file, 42 pages, Talk presented at Universite de Montreal, Nov.

24-27, 1997The soldering mechanism is a new technique to work with distinctmanifestations of dualities that incorporates interference effects, leading tonew physical results that includes quantum contributions. This approach wasused to investigate the cases of electromagnetic dualities, and $D\geq 2$bosonization. In the former context this technique is applied for the quantummechanical harmonic oscillator, the scalar field theory in two dimensions andthe Maxwell theory in four dimensions. The soldered actions in any dimensionleads to a master action which is duality invariant under a much bigger set ofsymmetries. The effects of coupling to gravity are also elaborated. In thelater context, a technique is developed that solders the dual aspects of somesymmetry following from the bosonisation of two distinct fermionic models,leading to new results which cannot be otherwise obtained. Exploiting thistechnique, the two dimensional chiral determinants with opposite chirality aresoldered to reproduce either the usual gauge invariant expression leading tothe Schwinger model or, alternatively, the Thirring model. Likewise, twoapparently independent three dimensional massive Thirring models with samecoupling but opposite mass signatures, in the long wavelegth limit, combine bythe process of bosonisation and soldering to yield an effective massive Maxwelltheory. The current bosonisation formulas are given, both in the originalindependent formulation as well as the effective theory, and shown to yieldconsistent results for the correlation functions.
