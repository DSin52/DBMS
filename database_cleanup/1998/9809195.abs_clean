The cosmological solutions of Horava-Witten theory discovered by Lukas, Ovrutand Waldram are generalized to allow non vanishing spatial curvature. Thesolution with closed spatial sections has initial and final curvaturesingularities. We find two solutions with open spatial sections, both of whichevolve from an initial curvature singularity to the supersymmetric domain wallsolution at late times. We also present a solution with open spatial sectionsand a non-zero Ramond-Ramond scalar. The behaviour of the solutions in elevendimensions is discussed.
