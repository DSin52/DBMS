We reconsider the issue of the existence of a complex structure in theGupta-Bleuler quantization scheme. We prove an existence theorem for thecomplex structure associated with the $d=10$ Casalbuoni-Brink-Schwarzsuperparticle, based on an explicitly constructed Lagrangian that allows aholomorphic-antiholomorphic splitting of the fermionic constraints consistentwith the vanishing of all first class constraints on the physical states.
