We derive the Gell-Mann and Low renormalization group equation in theWilsonian approach to renormalization of massless $g\phi^4$ in four dimensions,as a particular case of a non-linear equation satisfied at any scale by theWilsonian effective action.We give an exact expression for the $\beta$ and $\gamma_{\phi}$ functions interms of the Wilsonian effective action at the Wilsonian renormalization scale$\L_R$; at the first two loops they are simply related to the gradient of theflow of the relevant couplings and have the standard values; beyond two loopsthis relation is spoilt by corrections due to irrelevant couplings. Wegeneralize this analysis to the case of massive $g\phi^4$, introducing amass-independent Wilsonian renormalization scheme; using the flow equationtechnique we prove renormalizability and we show that the limit of vanishingmass parameter exists. We derive the corresponding renormalization groupequation, in which $\beta$ and $\gamma_{\phi}$ are the same as in the masslesscase; $\gamma_m$ is also mass-independent; at one loop it is the gradient of arelevant coupling and it has the expected value.
