Comments: 12 pages plain TeX, 1 figure PostScript. Erice lecture notes Aug/Sept

1998. Small cosmetic - yet important - changes were made in the originalmanuscriptAbsolute confinement of its color charges is a natural property of gaugetheories such as quantum chromodynamics. On the one hand, it can be attributedto the existence of color-magnetic monopoles, a topological feature of thetheory, but one can also maintain that all non-Abelian gauge theories confine.It is illustrated how ``confinement'' works in the SU(2) sector of the StandardModel, and why for example the electron and its neutrino can be viewed asSU(2)-hadronic bound states rather than a gauge doublet.The mechanism called `Abelian projection' then puts the Abelian sector of anygauge theory on a separate footing.
