We propose a solution to the problem of renormalizing light-cone Hamiltoniantheories while maintaining Lorentz invariance and other symmetries. The methoduses generalized Pauli--Villars regulators to render the theory finite. Wediscuss the method in the context of Yukawa theory at one loop and for asoluble model in 3+1 dimensions. The model is studied nonperturbatively.Numerical results obtained with use of discretized light-cone quantization,special integration weighting factors, and the complex symmetric Lanczosdiagonalization algorithm compare well with the analytic answers.
