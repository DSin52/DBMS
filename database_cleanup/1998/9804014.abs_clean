1997 on "Integrable Systems and Algebraic Geometry", Kobe/KyotoFor a Calabi-Yau threefold admitting both a $K3$ fibration and an ellipticfibration (with some extra conditions) we discuss candidate asymptoticexpressions of the genus 0 and 1 Gromov-Witten potentials in the limit(possibly corresponding to the perturbative regime of a heterotic string) wherethe area of the base of the $K3$ fibration is very large. The expressions areconstructed by lifting procedures using nearly holomorphic Weyl-invariantJacobi forms. The method we use is similar to the one introduced by Borcherdsfor the constructions of automorphic forms on type IV domains as infiniteproducts and employs in an essential way the elliptic polylogarithms ofBeilinson and Levin. In particular, if we take a further limit where the baseof the elliptic fibration decompactifies, the Gromov-Witten potentials areexpressed simply by these elliptic polylogarithms. The theta correspondenceconsidered by Harvey and Moore which they used to extract the expression forthe perturbative prepotential is closely related to the Eisenstein-Kroneckerdouble series and hence the real versions of elliptic polylogarithms introducedby Zagier.
