Using the ADM formulation of the Einstein-Maxwell axion-dilaton gravity wederived the formulas for the variation of mass and other asymptotic conservedquantities in the theory under consideration. Generalizing this kind ofreasoning to the initial dota for the manifold with an interior boundary we gotthe generalized first law of black hole mechanics. We consider anasymptotically flat solution to the Einstein-Maxwell axion-dilaton gravitydescribing a black hole with a Killing vector field timelike at infinity, thehorizon of which comprises a bifurcate Killing horizon with a bifurcatesurface. Supposing that the Killing vector field is asymptotically orthogonalto the static hypersurface with boundary S and compact interior, we find thatthe solution is static in the exterior world, when the timelike vector field isnormal to the horizon and has vanishing electric and axion- electric fields onstatic slices.
