Title: On the Initial Conditions for Pre-Big-Bang Cosmology

The beautiful scenario of pre-big-bang cosmology is appealling not onlybecause it is more or less derived from string theory, but also because itseparates clearly the problem of the initial conditions for the universe fromthat of high curvatures. Recently, the pre-big-bang program was subject toattack from on the grounds that pre-big-bang cosmology does not solve thehorizon and flatness problems in a ``natural'' way, as customary exponential``new'' inflation does. In particular, it appears that an arbitrarily smalldeviation from perfect flatness in the initial state can not be accommodated.For this analysis, matter in the universe before the big bang was assumed to beradiation. We perform a similar analysis to theirs, but using the equation ofstate for ``string matter'' $\rho=-3p$ which seems more appropriate to thephysical situation and, also, is motivated by the scale factor duality (in theflat case) with respect to our expanding, radiation dominated, universe. For anopen universe we find, exactly, the same time-dependence of the scale factor asin the Milne universe, recently found to represent the universal attractor at$t=-\infty $ of all pre big bang cosmologies. We conclude that our radiationdominated universe comes from a flat rather than a curved region.
