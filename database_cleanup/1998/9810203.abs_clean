Title: SL(2,Z) S-duality of Super D-string Action in Type IIB Supergravity

BackgroundComments: 8 pages, LaTex2e, non-constant dilaton and axion considered

It is shown in a quantum-mechanically exact manner that a supersymmetric and$\kappa$-symmetric D-string action in a general type IIB supergravitybackground is transformed to a form of the type IIB Green-Schwarz superstringaction with the SL(2,Z) covariant tension through an S-duality transformation.This result precisely proves a conjecture mentioned previously that the SL(2,Z)S-duality of a super D-string action in a flat background is also valid even ina curved IIB background geometry. We point further out the validity of the moregeneralized conjecture that various duality relations of super D-brane andM-brane actions originally found in a flat background also hold true in generalten dimensional type II supergravity and eleven dimensional supergravitybackground geometries by applying the present formalism to those cases.
