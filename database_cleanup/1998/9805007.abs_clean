$M$-theory is believed to be described in various dimensions by large $N$field theories. It has been further conjectured that at finite $N$, thesetheories describe the discrete light cone quantization (DLCQ) of $M$ theory.Even at low energies, this is not necessarily the same thing as the DLCQ ofsupergravity. It is believed that this is only the case for quantities whichare protected by non-renormalization theorems. In 0+1 and 1+1 dimensions, weprovide further evidence of a non-renormalization theorem for the $v^4$ terms,but also give evidence that there are not such theorems at order $v^8$ andhigher.
