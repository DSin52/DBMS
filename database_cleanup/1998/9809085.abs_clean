We introduce a new class of duality symmetries amongst quantum fieldtheories. The new class is based upon global spacetime symmetries, such asPoincare invariance and supersymmetry, in the same way as the existing dualitytransformations are based on global internal symmetries.We illustrate these new duality transformations by dualizing several scalarand spin-half theories in 1+1 spacetime dimensions, involving nonsupersymmetricas well as (1,1) and (2,2) supersymmetric models. For(2,2) models the new duality transformations can interchange chiral andtwisted-chiral multiplets.
