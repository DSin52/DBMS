The Wess-Zumino term is constructed for supersymmetric QCD with two colorsand flavors, and is shown to correctly reproduce the anomalous Ward identities.Supersymmetric QCD is also shown not to have topologically stable skyrmionsolutions because of baryon flat directions, which allow them to unwind. Thegeneralization of these results to other supersymmetric theories with quantummodified constraints is discussed.
