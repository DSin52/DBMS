of the "Trieste Conference on Superfivebranes and Physics in 5 + 1dimensions", Trieste, April 1-3, 1998, to appear in the proceedings, minorin the exceptional superalgebra F(4)We show how the anti-de Sitter isometries of a brane solution of supergravitytheory produce superconformal invariance of their world-volume action. In thisway linear as well as non-linear superconformal actions are obtained in variousdimensions. Two particular examples are a conformal action with theantisymmetric tensor in 6 dimensions in Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin formulation, andsuperconformal mechanics.
