Title: Collective Excitations in Thermal QED_{3+1}

Comments: LaTeX, 17 pages, 6 figures

The spectrum of collective fermionic excitations in a finite temperatureQED_{3+1} is studied in different regimes. It is shown that within the standardperturbation approach the one-loop dispersion equation, besides the ordinaryone-particle excitation, has four new solutions. The additional excitations aregauge-dependent and two of them have nonphysical signs of residues in thepropagator poles. The temperature evolution of the solutions is investigatedand it is shown that the use of effective propagators leaves no more than oneadditional mode which becomes propagating at $T \bolpor 10M$, when the gaugeinvariance is restored. The other three modes, including those with nonphysicalresidues in the propagator poles, are always strongly damped, thus the thermaleffects do not produce pathologies in QED_{3+1}.
