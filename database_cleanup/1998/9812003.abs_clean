Sen has shown that tachyon condensation in Dbrane-anti-Dbrane configurationscan lead to remarkable connections between string theories. A consequence ofhis results is that there is a minimal value of the radial coordinate $r_{c}\propto \sqrt{\alpha'} (gN)^{1/(9-p)}$ such that N units of D$p$brane chargecannot be localized to values smaller than $r_{c}.$ At this value of $r_{c}$the curvature and the gradient of the Ramond-Ramond field strength are of order$1/\alpha',$ and the vacuum, regarded as a Dbrane-anti-Dbrane configurationwith a tachyon condensate, is rendered unstable, leading to a separation of theDbrane and the anti-Dbrane. This value of $r_{c}$ lies in the regionintermediate between the near-horizon regime and the asymptotic regime forDbrane classical solutions for small $g$. This vacuum stability bound on thecurvature can be interpreted as an uncertainty relation for Dbrane charge.
