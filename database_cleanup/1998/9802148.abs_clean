We compactify M-theory in the Horava-Witten formulation on S^1/Z_2 \times K3\times T^2. Focusing on the moduli-space of vector multiplets of the resultingfour-dimensional N=2 theory, we determine the prepotential as an expansion intwo dimensionless parameters which both scale as \kappa^{2/3}. We determine theprepotential completely to relative order \kappa^{4/3} and compare theexpression with the results obtained for the perturbative string theories. Wefind complete agreement to relative order \kappa^{4/3} between the strong andweak coupling regimes. The sources of higher order perturbative andnon-perturbative corrections to the prepotential are also briefly discussedfrom the M-theory perspective.
