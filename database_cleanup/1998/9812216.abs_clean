Light-cone gauge quantization procedures are given, for superstring theory on$AdS_3$ space charged with NS-NS background, both in NSR and GS formalism. Thespacetime (super)conformal algebras are constructed in terms of the transversalphysical degrees of freedom. The spacetime conformal anomaly agrees with thatof covariant formalism, provided that the worldsheet conformal anomaly $c$equals 26 or 15 for bosonic string or superstring, respectively. The spacetime(super)conformal field theory is found to correspond to orbifold constructionon symmetric product space $\it{Sym_p} {\cal{M}}/Z_p$.
