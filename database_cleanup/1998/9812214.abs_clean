Authors: R.Myrzakulov

Comments: 9 pages, Latex, no figures

The gauge equivalent counterparts of the some (1+1)-, or (2+0)-dimensionalsigma models with potentials are found. The gauge equivalence between the somesoliton equations of spin-phonon systems and the Yajima-Oikawa and Ma equationsare also established.
