T-Duality on a timelike circle does not interchange IIA and IIB stringtheories, but takes the IIA theory to a type $IIB^*$ theory and the IIB theoryto a type $IIA^*$ theory. The type $II^*$ theories admit E-branes, which arethe images of the type II D-branes under timelike T-duality and correspond toimposing Dirichlet boundary conditions in time as well as some of the spatialdirections. The effective action describing an E$n$-brane is the$n$-dimensional Euclidean super-Yang-Mills theory obtained by dimensionallyreducing 9+1 dimensional super-Yang-Mills on $9-n$ spatial dimensions and onetime dimension. The $IIB^*$ theory has a solution which is the product of5-dimensional de Sitter space and a 5-hyperboloid, and the E4-brane correspondsto anon-singular complete solution which interpolates between this solution andflat space. This leads to a duality between the large $N$ limit of theEuclidean 4-dimensional U(N) super-Yang-Mills theory and the $IIB^*$ stringtheory in de Sitter space, and both are invariant under the same de Sittersupergroup. This theory can be twisted to obtain a large $N$ topological gaugetheory and its topological string theory dual. Flat space-time may be anunstable vacuum for the type $II^*$ theories, but they have supersymmetriccosmological solutions.
