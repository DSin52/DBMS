spinor states in type I theory correspond to tachyonic kink solution onD-string anti-D-string pairJournal-ref: JHEP 9808 (1998) 012

A coincident D-brane - anti-D-brane pair has a tachyonic mode. We present anargument showing that at the classical minimum of the tachyonic potential thenegative energy density associated with the potential exactly cancels the sumof the tension of the brane and the anti-brane, thereby giving a configurationof zero energy density and restoring space-time supersymmetry.
