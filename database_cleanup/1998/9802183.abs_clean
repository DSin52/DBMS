We propose correspondences between 4d quantum field theories with N=2,1,0(super)conformal invariance and Type IIB string theory on various orbifolds. Weargue using the spacetime string theory, and check using the beta functions(exactly for N=2,1 and so far at 1-loop for the gauge couplings in the N=0case), that these theories have conformal fixed lines. The latter casepotentially gives well-defined non-supersymmetric vacua of string theory, witha mechanism for making the curvature and cosmological constant small atnontrivial string coupling. We suggest a correspondence betweennonsupersymmetric conformal fixed lines and nonsupersymmetric string vacua withvanishing vacuum energy.
