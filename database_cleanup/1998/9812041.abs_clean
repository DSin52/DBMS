In (2+1)-dimensional QED with a Chern-Simons term, we show that spontaneousmagnetization occurs in the context of finite density vacua, which are thelowest Landau levels fully or half occupied by fermions. Charge condensation isshown to appear so as to complement the fermion anti-fermion condensate, whichbreaks the flavor U(2N) symmetry and causes fermion mass generation. Thesolutions to the Schwinger-Dyson gap equation show that the fermion self-energycontributes to the induction of a finite fermion density and/or fermion mass.The magnetization can be supported by charge condensation for theories with theChern-Simons coefficient $\kappa=N e^2/2 \pi$, and $\kappa=N e^2/4 \pi$, underthe Gauss law constraint. For $\kappa=N e^2/4 \pi$, both the magnetic field andthe fermion mass are simultaneously generated in the half-filled ground state,which breaks the U(2N) symmetry as well as the Lorentz symmetry.
