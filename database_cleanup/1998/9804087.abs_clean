We present Wess-Zumino actions for general IIA D-p-branes in explicit forms.We perform the covariant and irreducible separation of the fermionicconstraints of IIA D-p-branes into the first class and the second class. Anecessary condition which guarantees this separation is discussed. Thegenerators of the local supersymmetry (kappa symmetry) and the kappa algebraare obtained. We also explicitly calculate the conserved charge of the globalsupersymmetry (SUSY) and the SUSY algebra which contains topological charges.
