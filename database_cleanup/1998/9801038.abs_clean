In this paper we obtain supersymmetric brane-like configurations in thevacuum of N=4 gauged $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ supergravity theory in four spacetimedimensions. Almost all of these vacuum solutions preserve either half or onequarter of the supersymmetry in the theory. We also study the solutions inpresence of nontrivial axionic and gauge field backgrounds. In the case of puregravity with axionic charge the geometry of the spacetime is $AdS_3\times R^1$with N=1 supersymmetry. An interesting observation is that the domain walls ofthis theory cannot be given an interpretation of a 2-brane in four dimensions.But it still exists as a stable vacuum. This feature is quite distinct from thedomain-wall configuration in massive type IIA supergravity in ten dimensions.
