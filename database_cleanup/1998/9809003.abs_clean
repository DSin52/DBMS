Comments: 10 pages, LaTex. Talk given at the Conference in memory of V.I.

Ogievetsky, Dubna July 1997. To be published in the ProceedingsThe link between (super)-affine Lie algebras as Poisson brackets structuresand integrable hierarchies provides both a classification and a tool forobtaining superintegrable hierarchies. The lack of a fully systematic procedurefor constructing matrix-type Lax operators, which makes the supersymmetric caseessentially different from the bosonic counterpart, is overcome via the notionof Poisson embeddings (P.E.), i.e. Poisson mappings relating affine structuresto conformal structures (in their simplest version P.E. coincide with theSugawara construction). A full class of hierarchies can be recovered by usinguniquely Lie-algebraic notions. The group-algebraic properties implicit in thesuper-affine picture allow a systematic derivation of reduced hierarchies byimposing either coset conditions or hamiltonian constraints (or possibly both).
