Extending our previous work on SU(3), we construct spherically symmetric BPSsaturated regular configurations of N=4 SU(N) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theorypreserving 1/4 supersymmetry, and investigate their features. We also giveexact solutions in the case some of the free parameters of the generalsolutions take certain values. These field theory BPS states correspond to thestring theory BPS states of multi-pronged strings connecting N differentD3-branes by regarding the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory as an effectivefield theory on parallel D3-branes. We compare our solutions with multi-prongedstrings in string picture.
