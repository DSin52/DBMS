Characters of $E_8\otimes E_8$ and SO(32) heterotic strings involving thefull internal symmetry Cartan subalgebra generators are defined after circlecompactification so that they are T dual. The novel point, as compared with anearlier study of the type II case (hep-th/9707107), is the appearence of Wilsonlines. Using SO(17,1) transformations between the weight lattices reveals theexistence of an intermediate theory where T duality transformations aredisentangled from the internal symmetry. This intermediate theory correspondsto a sort of twisted compactification of a novel type. Its modular invariancefollows from an interesting interplay between three representations of themodular group.
