We consider four-dimensional charged black-holes occuring in toroidallycompactified heterotic string theory, whose ten-dimensional interpretationinvolves a Kaluza-Klein monopole and a five-brane. We show that thesefour-dimensional black-holes can be connected to two-dimensional chargedheterotic black-holes upon removal of the constants appearing in the harmonicfunctions associated with the Kaluza-Klein monopole and the five-brane.
