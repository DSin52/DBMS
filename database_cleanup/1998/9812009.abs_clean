We study the scattering theory for the Gross-Neveu model on the half-line. Wefind the reflection matrices for the elementary fermions, and by fusion wecompute the ones for the two-particle bound-states, showing that they satisfynon-trivial bootstrap consistency conditions. We also compute more generalreflection matrices for the Gross-Neveu model and the nonlinear sigma model,and argue that they correspond to the integrable boundary conditions weidentified in our previous paper hep-th/9809178.
