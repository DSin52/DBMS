Theory, 26-30 June 1995, Protvino, Russia, Eds.V.A.Petrov, A.P.Samokhin,R.N.Rogalyov (IHEP, Protvino, 1996) pp. 322-327We present BRST gauge fixing approach to quantum mechanics in phase space.The theory is obtained by $\hbar$-deformation of the cohomological classicalmechanics described by d=1, N=2 model. We use the extended phase space suppliedby the path integral formulation with $\hbar$-deformed symplectic structure.
