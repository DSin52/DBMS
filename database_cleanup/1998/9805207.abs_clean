We discuss quotients of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime by a discrete group inlight of the AdS-CFT correspondence. Some quotients describe closed universeswhich expand from zero volume to a maximum size and then contract. Maldacena'sconjecture suggests that they should be represented in string theory bysuitable quotients of the boundary conformal field theory. We discuss therequired identifications, and construct the states associated with thelinearized supergravity modes in the cosmological background.
