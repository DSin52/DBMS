Using the method of correlation dynamics we investigate the properties of afield-theory for fermions and scalar bosons coupled via a Yukawa interaction.Within this approach, which consists in an expansion of full equal-time Greenfunctions into connected equal-time Green functions and a correspondingtruncation of the hierarchy of equations of motion we carry out calculations upto 4th order in the connected Green functions and evaluate the effectivepotential of the theory in 1+1 dimensions on a torus. Comparing the differentapproximations we find a strong influence of the connected 4-point functions onthe properties of the system.
