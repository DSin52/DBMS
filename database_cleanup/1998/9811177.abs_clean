Title: Brane Dynamics and Four-Dimensional Quantum Field Theory

Authors: N.D. Lambert and P.C. West

Comments: 10 pages, sprocl.sty. To appear in the proceedings of the Trieste

Conference on Superfivebranes and Physics in 5+1 Dimensions, April 1998We review the relation between the classical dynamics of the M-fivebrane andthe quantum low energy effective action for N=2 Yang-Mills theories. We alsodiscuss some outstanding issues in this correspondence.
