Comments: 22 pages, LaTex, no figure

SystemsWe construct quantum deformations of the integrals of motion of thegeneralized mKdV equations for $\hat {\SL}_2$. For this, we give the relevantvertex operator algebra and prove quantum Serre relations for vertex operators,it allows to construct a $q$-BGG resolution and to deform the classicalintegrals of motion in a commutativ family.
