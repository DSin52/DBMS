A class of background independent matrix models is made for which thestructure of both local gauge symmetries and classical solutions is clarified.These matrix models do not involve a space-time metric and provide the matrixanalogs of topological Chern-Simons and BF theories. It is explicitly shownthat the BF type of matrix model can be formulated in any space-time dimensionand include 3+1 dimensional gravity as a special case. Moreover, we discusssome generalization of the model to include a fermionic BRST-like symmetrywhose partition function is related to the Casson invariant.
