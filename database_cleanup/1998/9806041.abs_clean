We study the correspondence between the large $N$ limit of ${\cal N} = 2$three dimensional superconformal field theories and M theory on orbifolds of$AdS_4 \times {\bf S^7}$. We identify the brane configuration which gives$C^3/Z_3$ as a background for the M theory in terms of a Brane Box Model or a(p, q) web model.By taking the orbifold projection on the known spectrum of Kaluza-Kleinharmonics of supergravity, we obtain information about the chiral primaryoperators at the orbifold singularities.
