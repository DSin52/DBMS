PhysicsThe best candidate for a fundamental unified theory of all physical phenomenais no longer ten-dimensional superstring theory but rather eleven-dimensional{\it M-theory}. In the words of Fields medalist Edward Witten, ``M stands for`Magical', `Mystery' or `Membrane', according to taste''. New evidence in favorof this theory is appearing daily on the internet and represents the mostexciting development in the subject since 1984 when the superstring revolutionfirst burst on the scene.
