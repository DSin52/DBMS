In a previous paper (hep-th/9801040), the superconnection formalism was usedto fit the Higgs field into a U(n) gauge theory with particular emphasis on then=2 case, aiming at the reconstruction of certain parts of the Standard Model.The approach provides an alternative to the one bases on non-commutativegeometry. This work is continued by including matter fields (leptons only). Weextend the Standard Model by including the right-handed neutrino field. Thepossibility of a finite neutrino mass is thus accounted for.
