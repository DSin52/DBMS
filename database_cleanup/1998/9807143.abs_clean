We study the simplest geometrical particle model associated with null pathsin four-dimensional Minkowski space-time. The action is given by thepseudo-arclength of the particle worldline. We show that the reduced classicalphase space of this system coincides with that of a massive spinning particleof spin $s=\alpha^2/M$, where $M$ is the particle mass, and $\alpha$ is thecoupling constant in front of the action. Consistency of the associated quantumtheory requires the spin $s$ to be an integer or half integer number, thusimplying a quantization condition on the physical mass $M$ of the particle.Then, standard quantization techniques show that the corresponding Hilbertspaces are solution spaces of the standard relativistic massive wave equations.Therefore this geometrical particle model provides us with an unifieddescription of Dirac fermions ($s=1/2$) and massive higher spin fields.
