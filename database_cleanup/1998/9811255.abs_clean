We show that the logarithmically rising static potential betweenopposite-charged sources in two dimensions is screened by dynamical fields evenif the probe charges are fractional, in units of the charge of the dynamicalscreening charges are superpositions of two bumps localized both near theopposite- and the same-charge sources, so that each of them gets exactlyscreened.
