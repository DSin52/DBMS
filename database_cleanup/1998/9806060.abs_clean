Title: Generating new supergravity solutions using Ehlers-Harrison-type

transformationsAuthors: H. Gustafsson, P. Haggi-Mani

Comments: Latex, 18 pages

The technique of generating new solutions to 4D gravity/matter systems bydimensional reduction to a sigma-model is extended to supersymmetricconfigurations of supergravity. The conditions required for the preservation ofsupersymmetry under isometry transformations in the sigma-model target spaceare found. Some examples illustrating the technique are given.
