We consider firstly simple D=4 superalgebra with six real tensorial centralcharges $Z_{\mu\nu}$, and discuss its possible realizations in massive andmassless cases. Massless case is dynamically realized by generalizedFerber-Shirafuji (FS) model with fundamental bosonic spinor coordinates. TheLorentz invariance is not broken due to the realization of central chargesgenerators in terms of bosonic spinors. The model contains four fermioniccoordinates and possesses three kappa-symmetries thus providing the BPSconfiguration preserving 3/4 of the target space supersymmetries. We show thatthe physical degrees of freedom (8 real bosonic and 1 real Grassmann variable)of our model can be described by OSp(8|1) supertwistor. The relation withrecent superparticle model by Rudychev and Sezgin is pointed out. Finally wepropose a higher dimensional generalization of our model with one realfundamental bosonic spinor. D=10 model describes massless superparticle withcomposite tensorial central charges and in D=11 we obtain 0-superbrane modelwith nonvanishing mass which is generated dynamically.
