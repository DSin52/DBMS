The SO(32) heterotic string can be obtained from the type IIB string bygauging a discrete symmetry that acts as $(-1)^{F_L}$ on the perturbativestring states and reverses the parity of the D-string. Consistency requires thepresence of 32 NS 9-branes -- the S-duals of D9-branes -- which give SO(32)Chan-Paton factors to open D-strings. At finite string coupling, there areSO(32) charges tethered to the heterotic string world-sheet by open D-strings.At zero-coupling, the D-string tension becomes infinite and the SO(32) chargesare pulled onto the world-sheet, and give the usual SO(32) world-sheet currentsof the heterotic string.
