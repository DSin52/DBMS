We consider the classical solution of the type IIB supergravity spontaneouslycompactified on S^5, whose metric depends only on the radial coordinate andwhose asymptotic geometry is locally that of AdS_5, i.e., R \times S^1 \timesT^2. We solve the equations of motion to obtain the general solutionssatisfying these conditions, and find that the only naked-singularity-freesolutions are the AdS black holes and AdS solitons. The other solutions, thatsmoothly interpolate these two solutions, are shown to have naked singularitieseven though their Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric with a negativeconstant. Thus, among the possible solutions of this type, the AdS solitons arethe unique lowest energy solution; this result is consistent with the recentlyproposed positive energy conjecture for the IIB AdS supergravity on S^5.
