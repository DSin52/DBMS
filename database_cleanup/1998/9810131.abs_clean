We compute the expectations of the squares of the electric and magneticfields in the vacuum region outside a half-space filled with a uniformnon-dispersive dielectric. This gives predictions for the Casimir-Polder forceon an atom in the `retarded' regime near a dielectric. We also find a positiveenergy density due to the electromagnetic field. This would lead, in the caseof two parallel dielectric half-spaces, to a positive, separation-independentcontribution to the energy density, besides the negative, separation-dependentCasimir energy. Rough estimates suggest that for a very wide range of cases,perhaps including all realizable ones, the total energy density between thehalf-spaces is positive.
