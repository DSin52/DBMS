We address the delocalization of low dimensional D-branes and NS-branes whenthey are a part of a higher dimensional BPS black brane, and the homogeneity ofthe resulting horizon. We show that the effective delocalization of such branesis a classical effect that occurs when localized branes are brought together.Thus, the fact that the few known solutions with inhomogeneous horizons arehighly singular need not indicate a singularity of generic D- and NS-branestates. Rather, these singular solutions are likely to be unphysical as theycannot be constructed from localized branes which are brought together from afinite separation.
