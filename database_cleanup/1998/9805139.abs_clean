Brane Box Models of intersecting NS and D5 branes are mapped to D3 branes atC^3/Gamma orbifold singularities and vise versa, in a setup which gives rise toN=1 supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions. The Brane Box Models areconstructed on a two-torus. The map is interpreted as T-duality along the twodirections of the torus. Some Brane Box Models contain NS fivebranes windingaround (p,q) cycles in the torus, and our method provides the geometric T-dualto such objects. An amusing aspect of the mapping is that T-dual configurationsare calculated using D=4 N=1 field theory data. The mapping to the singularitypicture allows the geometrical interpretation of all the marginal couplings infinite field theories. This identification is further confirmed using theAdS/CFT correspondence for orbifold theories. The AdS massless fields couplingto the marginal operators in the boundary appear as stringy twisted sectors ofS^5/Gamma. The mapping for theories which are non-finite requires theintroduction of fractional D3 branes in the singularity picture.
