We consider N=1 supersymmetric SU(N_c) gauge theories, using the type IIBbrane construction recently proposed by Hanany and Zaffaroni. At non-zerostring coupling, we find that the bending of branes imposes consistencyconditions that allow only non-anomalous gauge theories with stable vacua,i.e., N_f >= N_c, to be constructed. We find qualitative differences betweenthe brane configurations for N_f <= 3N_c and N_f > 3N_c, corresponding toasymptotically free and infrared free theories respectively. We also discusssome properties of the brane configurations that may be relevant toconstructing Seiberg's duality in this framework.
