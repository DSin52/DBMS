Title: Quantization of Massive Non-Abelian Gauge Fields in The Hamiltonian Path

Integral FormalismComments: 8 pages, latex, no figures

It is argued that the massive non-Abelian gauge field theory withoutinvolving Higgs bosons may be well established on the basis of gauge-invarianceprinciple because the dynamics of the field is gauge-invariant in the physicalspace defined by the Lorentz constraint condition. The quantization of thefield can readily be performed in the Hamiltonian path-integral formalism andleads to a quantum theory which shows good renormalizability and unitarity.
