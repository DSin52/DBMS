The assumptions behind the recently conjectured relation between gauge theoryand supergravity are elaborated on. It is pointed out that the scaling limitthat preserves supergravity solutions, gives the entire DBI action on the gaugetheory side, but in the low energy limit the relation between the conformalfield theory and Anti-de Sitter supergravity emerges. We also argue that recentwork on these issues may help in understanding the physics of five (four)dimensional black hole with three (four) charges in the so-called dilute gasregion.
