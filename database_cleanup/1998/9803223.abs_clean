Title: Renormalization Ambiguities in Casimir Energy

Comments: 16 pages, Latex

Some questions were recently raised about the equivalence of two methodsthe one-loop effective potential. In this respect, we argue that the scaledependence induced by renormalization effects, displayed by the effectivepotential approach, also appears in the MS method.
