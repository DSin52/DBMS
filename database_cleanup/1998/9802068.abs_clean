We show that the resolution of moduli space of ideal instantons parameterizesthe instantons on non-commutative $\IR^{4}$. This moduli space appears as aHiggs branch of the theory of $k$ $D0$-branes bound to $N$ $D4$-branes by theexpectation value of the $B$ field. It also appears as a regularized version ofthe target space of supersymmetric quantum mechanics arising in the light conedescription of $(2,0)$ superconformal theories in six dimensions.
