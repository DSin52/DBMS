We discuss the spectrum of states of IIB supergravity on $AdS_5\times S^5$ ina manifest $SU(2,2/4)$ invariant setting. The boundary fields are described interms of N=4 superconformal Yang-Mills theory and the proposed correspondencebetween supergravity in $AdS_5$ and superconformal invariant singleton theoryat the boundary is formulated in an N=4 superfield covariant language.
