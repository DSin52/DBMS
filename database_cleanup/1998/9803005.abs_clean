We derive the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equation for the situation inwhichthe statistical interaction of a multi-particle system is governed by Haldanestatistics. We formulate a macroscopical equivalence principle for suchsystems. Particular CDD-ambiguities play a distinguished role in compensatingthe ambiguity in the exclusion statistics. We derive Y-systems related togeneralized statistics. We discuss several fermionic, bosonic and anyonicversions of affine Toda field theories and Calogero-Sutherland type models inthe context of generalized statistics.
