Title: Schwarzschild Black Hole Quantum Statistics, Droplet Nucleation and DLCQ

Matrix TheoryComments: 21 pages, Latex; References and few remarks added

Generalizing previous quantum gravity results for Schwarzschild black holesfrom 4 to D>4 spacetime dimensions yields an energy spectrum E_n =n^{1-1/(D-2)} sigma E_P, n=1,2,..., sigma = O(1). Assuming the degeneracies ofthese levels to be given by g^n, g>1, leads to a partition function which isthe same as that of the primitive droplet nucleation model for 1st-order phasetransitions in D-2 spatial dimensions. Exploiting the well-known properties ofthe so-called critical droplets of this model immediately leads to the Hawkingtemperature and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of Schwarzschild black holes.Thus, the "holographic principle" of 't Hooft and Susskind is naturallyrealised. The values of temperature and entropy appear closely related to theimaginary part of the partition function which describes metastable states.Finally some striking conceptual similarities ("correspondence point" etc.)between the droplet nucleation picture and the very recent approach to thequantum statistics of Schwarzschild black holes in the framework of the DLCQMatrix theory are pointed out.
