Title: Towards the low energy effective degrees of freedom in N=2 SUSY

Comments: 10 pages, Latex, talk given at "Quarks-98", Suzdal, May 98

We discuss the brane interpretation of the integrable dynamics behind theexact solution to the N=2 SUSY YM theory. Degrees of freedom in the firstintegrable system responsible for the spectral Riemann surfaces comes from thehidden Higgs branch of the moduli space. The second integrable system of theWhitham type yields the dynamics on the Coulomb branch and can be considered asthe scattering of branes.
