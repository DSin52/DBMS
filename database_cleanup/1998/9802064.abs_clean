We present a formulation of non-Abelian gauge theories in general axialgauges using a Wilsonian (or 'Exact') Renormalisation Group. No 'spurious'propagator divergencies are encountered in contrast to standard perturbationtheory. Modified Ward identities, compatible with the flow equation, ensuregauge invariance of physical Green functions. The axial gauge $n A=0$ is shownto be a fixed point under the flow equation. Possible non-perturbativeapproximation schemes and further applications are outlined.
