We analyze the induction and restriction of sectors for nets of subfactorsdefined by Longo and Rehren. Picking a local subfactor we derive a formulawhich specifies the structure of the induced sectors in terms of the originalDHR sectors of the smaller net and canonical endomorphisms. We also obtain areciprocity formula for induction and restriction of sectors, and we prove acertain homomorphism property of the induction mapping.Developing further some ideas of F. Xu we will apply this theory in aforthcoming paper to nets of subfactors arising from conformal field theory, inparticular those coming from conformal embeddings or orbifold inclusions ofSU(n) WZW models. This will provide a better understanding of the labeling ofmodular invariants by certain graphs, in particular of the A-D-E classificationof SU(2) modular invariants.
