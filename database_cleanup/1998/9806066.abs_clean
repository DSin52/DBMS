We consider a subset of the terms in the effective potential describingthree-graviton interactions in Matrix theory and in classicaleleven-dimensional supergravity. In agreement with the results of Dine andRajaraman, we find that these terms vanish in Matrix theory. We show that theabsence of these terms is compatible with the classical supergravity theorywhen the theory is compactified in a lightlike direction, resolving an apparentdiscrepancy between the two theories. A brief discussion is given of how thiscalculation might be generalized to compare the Matrix theory and supergravitydescriptions of an arbitrary 3-body system.
