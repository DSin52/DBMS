We find a simple relation between the first subleading terms in theasymptotic expansion of the metric field in AdS$_3$, obeying the Brown-Henneauxboundary conditions, and the stress tensor of the underlying Liouville theoryon the boundary. We can also provide an more explicit relation between the bulkmetric and the boundary conformal field theory when it is described in terms ofa free field with a background charge.
