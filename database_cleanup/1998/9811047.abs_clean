General conjectures about the SL(2,Z) modular transformation properties ofN=4 super-Yang-Mills correlation functions are presented. It is shown how thesemodular transformation properties arise from the conjectured duality with IIBstring theory on AdS_5 x S^5. We discuss in detail a prediction of the AdSsymmetries, corresponding to the enhanced symmetries of IIB string theory inits supergravity limit.
