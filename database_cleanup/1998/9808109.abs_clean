Dilaton coupled electromagnetic field is essential element of low-energystring effective action or it may be considered as result of sphericalcompactification of Maxwell theory in higher dimensions. The large $N$ andlarge curvature effective action for $N$ dilaton coupled vectors is calculated.Adding such quantum correction to classical dilaton gravity action we show thateffective dilaton-Maxwell gravity under consideration may generateSchwarzschild-de Sitter black holes (SdS BHs) with constant dilaton assolutions of the theory. That suggests a mechanism (alternative to BHsproduction) for quantum generation of SdS BHs in early universe (actually, forquantum creation of inflationary Universe) due to back-reaction of dilatoncoupled matter. The possibility of proliferation of anti-de Sitter space isbriefly discussed.
