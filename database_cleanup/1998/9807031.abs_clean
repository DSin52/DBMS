We apply the resolvent technique to the computation of the QED effectiveaction in time dependent electric field backgrounds. The effective action hasboth real and imaginary parts, and the imaginary part is related to the pairproduction probability in such a background. The resolvent technique has beenapplied previously to spatially inhomogeneous magnetic backgrounds, for whichthe effective action is real. We explain how dispersion relations connect thesetwo cases, the magnetic case which is essentially perturbative in nature, andthe electric case where the imaginary part is nonperturbative. Finally, we usea uniform semiclassical approximation to find an expression for very generaltime dependence for the background field. This expression is remarkably similarin form to Schwinger's classic result for the constant electric background.
