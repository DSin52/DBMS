Gauge theories coupled to fermions in generation are reformulated in amodified version of extended differential geometry with the symbol $\chi$.After discussing several toy models, we will reformulate in our framework thestandard model based on Connes' real structure. It is shown that for the mostgeneral bosonic lagrangin which is required to also reconstruct N=2 superYang-Mills theory Higgs mechanism operates only for more than one generation asfirst pointed out by Connes and Lott.
