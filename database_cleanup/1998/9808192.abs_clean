Title: Towards a background independent approach to M theory

Authors: Lee Smolin

Comments: 21 pages, LATEX, no figures. Contribution to a special issue of

Chaos, Solitons and Fractals on " Superstrings, M,F,S....Theory"Work in progress is described which aims to construct a backgroundindependent formulation of M theory by extending results about backgroundindependent states and observables from quantum general relativity andsupergravity to string theory. A list of principles for such a theory isproposed which is drawn from results of both string theory and backgroundindependent approaches to quantum gravity. Progress is reported on a backgroundindependent membrane field theory and on a realization of the holographicprinciple based on finite surfaces.
