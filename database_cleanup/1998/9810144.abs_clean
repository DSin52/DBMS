The effective potential for the composite fields responsible for chiralsymmetry breaking in weakly coupled QED in a magnetic field is derived. Theglobal minimum of the effective potential is found to acquire a non-vanishingexpectation value of the composite fields that leads to generating thedynamical fermion mass by an external magnetic field. The results are comparedwith those for the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model.
