We describe type IIB compactifications with varying coupling constant ind=6,7,8,9 dimensions, where part of the ten-dimensional SL(2,Z) symmetry isbroken by a background with Gamma_0(n) or Gamma(n) monodromy for n=2,3,4. Thisextends the known class of F-theory vacua to theories which are dual toheterotic compactifications with reduced rank. On compactifying on a furthertorus, we obtain a description of the heterotic moduli space of G bundles overelliptically fibered manifolds without vector structure in terms of complexgeometries.
