Title: Some comments on S-duality in four-dimensional QCD

Comments: 4 pages, latex, no figures. Basic references on duality added

We show that a necessary condition, for the partition function offour-dimensional Yang-Mills theory to satisfy a S-duality property, is thatcertain functional determinants, generated by the dual change of variables,cancel each other. This result holds up to non-topological boundary terms inthe dual action and modulo the problem of field-strength copies for the Bianchiidentity constraint.
