In a recent paper we considered the type 0 string theories, obtained from theten-dimensional closed NSR string by a GSO projection which excludes space-timefermions, and studied the low-energy dynamics of N coincident D-branes. Thisled us to conjecture that the four-dimensional SU(N) gauge theory coupled to 6adjoint massless scalars is dual to a background of type 0 theory carrying Nunits of R-R 5-form flux and involving a tachyon condensate. The tachyonbackground leads to a ``soft breaking'' of conformal invariance, and we derivedthe corresponding renormalization group equation. Minahan has subsequentlyfound its asymptotic solution for weak coupling and showed that the couplingexhibits logarithmic flow, as expected from the asymptotic freedom of the dualgauge theory. We study this solution in more detail and identify the effect ofthe 2-loop beta function. We also demonstrate the existence of a fixed point atinfinite coupling. Just like the fixed point at zero coupling, it ischaracterized by the AdS_5\times S^5 Einstein frame metric. We argue that thereis a RG trajectory extending all the way from the zero coupling fixed point inthe UV to the infinite coupling fixed point in the IR.
