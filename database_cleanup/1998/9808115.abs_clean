pages, 2 figures, 1 tabA general theory of the Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type phasetransitions in low-dimensional systems is proposed. It is shown that ind-dimensional case the necessary conditions for it can take place are 1)conformal invariance of kinetic part of model action and 2) vacuum homotopygroup $\pi_{d-1}$ must be nontrivial and discrete. It means a discrete vacuumdegeneracy for $1d$ systems and continuous vacuum degeneracy for higher $d$systems. For such systems topological exitations have logariphmically divergentenergy and they can be described by corresponding effective field theories. Ingeneral case the sufficient conditions for existence of the BKT type phasetransition are 1) constraint $d \le 2$ and 2) $\pi_{d-1}$ must have somecrystallographic symmetries. Critical properties of possible low-dimensionaleffective theories are determined and it is shown that in two-dimensional casethey are characterized by the Coxeter numbers $h_G$ of lattices from the series${A,D,E,Z}$ and can be interpreted as those of conformal field theories withinteger central charge $c=r,$ where $r$ is a rank of groups $\pi_1$ and $G.$ Inone-dimensional case analogous critical properties have ferromagnetic Dysonchains with discrete Cartan-Ising spins. In contrast, critical properties ofone-dimensional models with periodic potentials have a weak dependence on group$G.$
