Keeping N=1 supersymmetry in 4-dimension and in the leading order, we disussthe various orbifold compactifications of M-theory suggested by Horava andWitten on $T^6/Z_3$, $T^6/Z_6$, $T^6/Z_{12}$, and the compactification bykeeping singlets under $SU(2)\times U(1)$ symmetry, then the compactificationon $S^1/Z_2$. We also discuss the next to leading order K\"ahler potential,superpotential, and gauge kinetic function in the $Z_{12}$ case. In addition,we calculate the SUSY breaking soft terms and find out that the universality ofthe scalar masses will be violated, but the violation might be very small.
