the ICTP Summer School in 1996 and 1997. Misprints correctedThis review considers the properties of classical solutions to supergravitytheories with partially unbroken supersymmetry. These solutions saturateBogomol'ny-Prasad-Sommerfield bounds on their energy densities and are thecarriers of the $p$-form charges that appear in the supersymmetry algebra. Thesimplest such solutions have the character of $(p+1)$-dimensionalPoincar\'e-invariant hyperplanes in spacetime, i.e. $p$-branes. Topics coveredinclude the relations between mass densities, charge densities and thepreservation of unbroken supersymmetry; interpolating-soliton structure;diagonal and vertical Kaluza-Klein reduction families; multiple-chargesolutions and the four D=11 elements; duality-symmetry multiplets; chargequantisation; low-velocity scattering and the geometry of worldvolumesupersymmetric $\sigma$-models; and the target-space geometry of BPS instantonsolutions obtained by the dimensional reduction of static $p$-branes.
