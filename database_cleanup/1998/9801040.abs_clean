Within the mathematical framework of Quillen, one interprets the Higgs fieldas part of the superconnection on a superbundle. We propose to take assuperbundle the exterior algebra obtained from a Hermitian bundle withstructure group U(n). Spontaneous symmetry breaking appears as a consequence ofa non-vanishing scalar curvature. The U(1) Higgs model reformulates theGinzburg-Landau theory, while the U(2) model relates to the electroweak theorywith the relation $g^2=3g4^2$ for the gauge coupling constants, the formula$\sin^2\theta=1/4$ for the Weinberg angle, and the ratiofor the masses (squared) of the W, Z, and Higgs boson (at tree level).
