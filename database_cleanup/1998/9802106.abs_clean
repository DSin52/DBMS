In this note, we first obtain the decomposition of the non-relativistic fieldvelocity into the classical part (i.e., the velocity w=p/m OF thecenter-of-mass (CM), and the so-called quantum part (i.e., the velocity V ofthe motion IN the CM frame (namely, the internal spin-motion orZitterbewegung), these two parts being orthogonal. Our starting point is thePauli current. Then, by inserting such a composite expression of the velocityinto the kinetic energy term of the non-relativistic newtonian lagrangian, weget the appearance of the so-called "quantum potential" (which makes thedifference between classical and quantum behaviour) as a pure consequence ofthe internal motion. Such a result carries further evidence about thepossibility that the quantum behaviour of micro-systems be a direct consequenceof the fundamental existence of spin.
