We simplify and generalize an approach proposed by Di Vecchia and Ravndal todescribe a massive Dirac particle in external vector and scalar fields. Twodifferent path integral representations for the propagator are derivedsystematically without the usual five-dimensional extension and shown to beequivalent due to the supersymmetry of the action. They correspond to aprojection on the mass of the particle either continuously or at the end of thetime evolution. It is shown that the supersymmetry transformations aregenerated by shifting and scaling the supertimes and the invariant differenceof two supertimes is given for the general case. A nonrelativistic reduction ofthe relativistic propagator leads to a three-dimensional path integral with theusual Pauli Hamiltonian. By integrating out the photons we obtain the effectiveaction for quenched QED and use it to derive the gauge-transformationproperties of the general Green function of the theory.
