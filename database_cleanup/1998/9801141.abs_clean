We discuss the generalization of recently discovered BPS configurations,corresponding to the planar string networks, to non-planar ones by consideringthe U-duality symmetry of type II string theory in various dimensions. As anexplicit example, we analyze the string solutions in 8-dimensional space-time,carrying SL(3) charges, and show that by aligning the strings along variousdirections appropriately, one can obtain a string network which preserves 1/8supersymmetry.
