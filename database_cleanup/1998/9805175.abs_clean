We consider interaction of a probe monopole-antimonopole pair in the vacuumof the Abelian Higgs model. For simplicity, the mass of the Higgs particle isassumed to be much larger than the mass of the photon (London limit). In caseof a massive photon the straightforward application of the Zwanziger formalismto accommodate both magnetic and electric charges is known to result in gaugedependence and infrared instabilities. We argue that the use of the stringrepresentation of the Abelian Higgs model allows to ameliorate bothdifficulties. In particular, we arrive at a well defined expression for thepotential energy of the static monopole sources. We argue that themonopole-antimonopole interaction cannot be described by a massive photonexchange with a definite propagator having simple analytical properties.
