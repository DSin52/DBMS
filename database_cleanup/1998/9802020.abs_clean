We show that the ``time'' t_s defined via spin clusters in the Ising modelcoupled to 2d gravity leads to a fractal dimension d_h(s) = 6 of space-time atthe critical point, as advocated by Ishibashi and Kawai. In the unmagnetizedphase, however, this definition of Hausdorff dimension breaks down. Numericalmeasurements are consistent with these results. The same definition leads tod_h(s)=16 at the critical point when applied to flat space. The fractaldimension d_h(s) is in disagreement with both analytical prediction andnumerical determination of the fractal dimension d_h(g), which is based on theuse of the geodesic distance t_g as ``proper time''. There seems to be nosimple relation of the kind t_s = t_g^{d_h(g)/d_h(s)}, as expected bydimensional reasons.
