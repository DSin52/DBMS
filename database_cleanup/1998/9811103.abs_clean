We analyse the structure of N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric non-linearsigma-models built up with a pair of real superfields defined in the superspaceof Atiyah-Ward space-time. The geometry arising has new features such as theexistence of a locally product structure (N=1 case) and a set of automorphismsof the tangent space that is isomorphic to the split-quaternionic algebra (N=2case).
