By exploiting relations between gravity and gauge theories, we present twohelicity-violating' amplitudes in N=8 supergravity, and the `all-plus' helicityamplitudes in gravity with any minimally coupled massless matter content. Theall-plus amplitudes correspond to self-dual field configurations and vanish insupersymmetric theories. We make use of the tree-level Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT)relations between open and closed string theory amplitudes, which in thelow-energy limit imply relations between gravity and gauge theory treeamplitudes. For n < 7, we determine the all-plus amplitudes explicitly fromtheir unitarity cuts. The KLT relations, applied to the cuts, allow us toextend to gravity a previously found `dimension-shifting' relation between (thecuts of) the all-plus amplitudes in gauge theory and the maximallyhelicity-violating amplitudes in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory. The gravitationalversion of the relation lets us determine the n < 7 N=8 supergravity amplitudesfrom the all-plus gravity amplitudes. We infer the two series of amplitudes forall n from their soft and collinear properties, which can also be derived fromgauge theory using the KLT relations.
