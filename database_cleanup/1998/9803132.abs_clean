Bekenstein has proposed the bound S < pi M_P^2 L^2 on the total entropy S ina volume L^3. This non-extensive scaling suggests that quantum field theorybreaks down in large volume. To reconcile this breakdown with the success oflocal quantum field theory in describing observed particle phenomenology, wepropose a relationship between UV and IR cutoffs such that an effective fieldtheory should be a good description of Nature. We discuss implications for thecosmological constant problem. We find a limitation on the accuracy which cancorrection to (g-2) for the electron from the constrained IR and UV cutoffs islarger than the contribution from the top quark.
