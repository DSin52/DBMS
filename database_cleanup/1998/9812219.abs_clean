In this paper we consider the quantization of open strings ending on D-braneswith a background B field. We find that spacetime coordinates of the openstring end-points become noncommutative, and correspondingly the D-braneworldvolume also becomes noncommutative. This provides a string theoryderivation and generalization of the noncommutativity obtained previously inthe Matrix model compactification. For Dp-branes with p>=2 our results are newand agree with that of Matrix theory for the case of A=0 (where $A$ is theworldvolume gauge field) if the T-duality radii are used.
