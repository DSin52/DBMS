We consider the problem of extremizing the tension for BPS strings in D=6supergravities with different number of supersymmetries. General formulae forfixed scalars and a discussion of degenerate directions is given. Quantizedmoduli, according to recent analysis, are supposed to be related to conformalfield theories which are the boundary of three dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime.
