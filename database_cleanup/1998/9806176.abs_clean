We study curved space versions of matrix string theory taking as a definitionof the theory a gauged matrix sigma model. By analyzing the divergent terms inthe loop expansion for the effective action we reduce the problem to a simplematrix generalization of the standard string theory beta function calculation.It is then demonstrated that the model can only be consistent for Ricci flatmanifolds with vanishing six-dimensional Euler density.
