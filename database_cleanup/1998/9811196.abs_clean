The neutral kaon system can be effectively described by non-unitary,dissipative, completely positive dynamics that extend the usual treatment. Inthe framework of open quantum systems, we show how the origin of thesenon-standard time evolutions can be traced to the interaction of the kaonsystem with a large environment. We find that D-branes, effectively describedby a heat-bath of quanta obeying infinite statistics, could constitute arealistic example of such an environment.
