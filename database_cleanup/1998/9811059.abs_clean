Two-dimensional matterless dilaton gravity with arbitrary dilatonic potentialcan be discussed in a unitary way, both in the Lagrangian and canonicalframeworks, by introducing suitable field redefinitions. The new fields aredirectly related to the original spacetime geometry and in the canonicalpicture they generalize the well-known geometrodynamical variables used in thediscussion of the Schwarzschild black hole. So the model can be quantized usingthe techniques developed for the latter case. The resulting quantum theoryexhibits the Birkhoff theorem at the quantum level.
