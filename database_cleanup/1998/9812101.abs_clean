We use finite field-dependent BRS transformations (FFBRS) to connect theGreen functions in a set of two otherwise unrelated gauge choices. We choosethe Lorentz and the axial gauges as examples. We show how the Green functionsin axial gauge can be written as a series in terms of those in Lorentz gauges.Our method also applies to operator Green's functions. We show that thisprocess involves another set of related FFBRS transfomations that is derivablefrom infinitesimal FBRS. We suggest possible applications.
