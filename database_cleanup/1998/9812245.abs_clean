The calculation of the interaction energy in pure QED andMaxwell-Chern-Simons gauge theory is re-examined by exploiting the pathdependence of the gauge-invariant variables formalism. In particular, weconsider a spacelike straight line which leads to the Poincar\'{e} gauge.Subtleties related to the problem of exhibiting explicitly the interactionenergies are illustrated.
