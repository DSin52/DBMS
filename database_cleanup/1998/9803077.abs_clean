We calculate the dimensions of operators in three and six dimensionalsuperconformal field theories by using the duality between these theories atlarge N and D=11 supergravity on $AdS_{4/7} \times S^{7/4}$. We find that forthe duality relations to work the Kaluza--Klein masses given in thesupergravity literature must be rescaled and/or shifted.
