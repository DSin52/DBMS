The pure-Skyrme limit of a scale-breaking Skyrmed O(3) sigma model in 1+1dimensions is employed to study the effect of the Skyrme term on thesemiclassical analysis of a field theory with instantons. The instantons ofthis model are self-dual and can be evaluated explicitly. They are alsolocalised to an absolute scale, and their fluctuation action can be reduced toa scalar subsystem. This permits the explicit calculation of the fluctuationdeterminant and the shift in vacuum energy due to instantons. The model alsoillustrates the semiclassical quantisation of a Skyrmed field theory.
