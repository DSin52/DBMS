The BRST approach is applied to the description of irreducible masslesshigher spins representations of the Poincare group in arbitrary dimensions. Thetotal system of constraints in such theory includes both the first and thesecond class constraints. The corresponding nilpotent BRST charge containsterms up to the seventh degree in ghosts.
