The theory of a complex scalar interacting with a pure Chern-Simons gaugefield is quantized canonically. Dynamical and nondynamical variables areseparated in a gauge-independent way. In the physical subspace of the fullHilbert space, this theory reduces to a pure scalar theory with nonlocalinteraction. Several scattering processes are studied and the cross sectionsare calculated.
