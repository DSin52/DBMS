Title: Path Integral for the Dirac Equation

Authors: Janos Polonyi

Comments: 5 pages, revtex. Argument extended, several equations corrected, more

references addedA c-number path integral representation is constructed for the solution ofthe Dirac equation. The integration is over the real trajectories in thecontinuous three-space and other two canonical pairs of compact variablescontrolling the spin and the chirality flips.
