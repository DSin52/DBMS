It has been shown that a procedure analogous to orbifolding in string theory,when applied to certain large N field theories, leaves correlators invariantperturbatively. We test nonperturbative agreement of some aspects of theorbifolded and non-orbifolded theories. More specifically, we find that theperiod matrices of parent and orbifolded Seiberg-Witten theories are related,even away from the 't Hooft limit. We also check that any large N theory whichhas an infrared conformal fixed point and satisfies certain anomaly positivityconstraints required by theories with fixed points will continue to satisfythose constraints after orbifolding. We discuss extensions of these results tofinite N.
