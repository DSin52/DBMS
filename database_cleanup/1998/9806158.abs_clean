We study the construction of baryons via supergravity along the linesuggested recently by Witten and by Gross and Ooguri. We calculate the energyof the baryon as a function of its size. As expected the energy is linear withN. For the non-supersymmetric theories (in three and four dimensions) we find alinear relation which is an indication of confinement. For the {\cal N} = 4theory we obtain the result (E L= - {const.}) which is compatible withconformal invariance. Surprisingly, our calculation suggests that there is abound state of k quarks if N\geq k\geq 5N/8. We study the {\cal N} = 4 theoryalso at finite temperature and find the zero temperature behavior for smallsize of the baryon, and screening behaviour for baryon, whose size is largecompared to the thermal wavelength.
