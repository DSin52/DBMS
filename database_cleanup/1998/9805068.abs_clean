By undertaking additional analyses postponed in a previous paper, we completeour construction of a manifestly supersymmetric gauge-covariant regularizationevaluation of the covariant gauge anomaly; a proof of the integrability of thecovariant gauge current in anomaly-free cases; a calculation of a one-loopsuperconformal anomaly in the gauge supermultiplet sector. On the last point,we find that the ghost-anti-ghost supermultiplet and the Nakanishi-Lautrupsupermultiplet give rise to BRST exact contributions which, due to``tree-level'' Slavnov-Taylor identities in our regularization scheme, cansafely be neglected, at least at the one-loop level.
