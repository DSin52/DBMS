In the context of N=8 supergravity we construct the general form of BPS0--branes that preserve either 1/2 or 1/4 of the original supersymmetry. Weshow how such solutions are related to suitable decompositions of the 70dimensional solvable Lie algebra that describes the scalar field sector. Wecompare our new results to those obtained in a previous paper for the case of1/8 supersymmetry preserving black holes. Each of the three cases is based on adifferent solvable Lie algebra decomposition and leads to a different structureof the scalar field evolution and of their fixed values at the horizon of theblack hole.
