We consider the dimensional reduction of N = 1 SYM_{2+1} to 1+1 dimensions,which has (1,1) supersymmetry. The gauge groups we consider are U(N) and SU(N),where N is a finite variable. We implement Discrete Light-Cone Quantization todetermine non-perturbatively the bound states in this theory. A carefulanalysis of the spectrum is performed at various values of N, including thecase where N is large (but finite), allowing a precise measurement of the 1/Neffects in the quantum theory. The low energy sector of the theory is shown tobe dominated by string-like states. The techniques developed here may beapplied to any two dimensional field theory with or without supersymmetry.
