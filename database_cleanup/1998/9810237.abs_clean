The nonabelian Berry phase is computed in the T dualized quantum mechanicsobtained from the USp(2k) matrix model. Integrating the fermions, we find thateach of the spacetime points X_{\nu}^{(i)} is equipped with a pair of su(2) Liealgebra valued pointlike singularities located at a distance m_{(f)} from theorientifold surface. On a four dimensional paraboloid embedded in the fivedimensional Euclidean space, these singularities are recognized as the BPSTinstantons.
