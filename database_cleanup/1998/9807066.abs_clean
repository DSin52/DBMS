We present the full action for the unoriented open-closed string field theorywhich is based on the \alpha=p^+ HIKKO type vertices. The BRS invariance of theaction is proved up to the terms which are expected to cancel the anomalousone-loop contributions. This implies that the system is invariant under thegauge transformations with open and closed string field parameters up to theanomalies.
