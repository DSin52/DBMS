Theoretical Methods in PhysicsThe exceptional superalgebra $D(2,1;\alpha)$ has been classified as acandidate conformal supersymmetry algebra in two dimensions. We propose analternative interpretation of it as extended BFV-BRST quantisationsuperalgebras in 2D ($D(2,1;1) \simeq osp(2,2|2)$). A superfield realization ispresented wherein the standard extended phase space coordinates can beidentified. The physical states are studied via the cohomology of the BRSToperator. It is conjectured that the underlying model giving rise to this`quantisation' is that of a scalar relativistic particle in 1+1 dimensions, forwhich the light cone coordinates $x_R$, $x_L$ transform under worldlinediffeomorphisms as scalar densities of appropriate weight.
