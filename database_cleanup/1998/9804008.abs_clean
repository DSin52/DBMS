The renormalization group flows of the coupling constants for the gauged U(N)vector model, with N_f massless fermions in the defining representation, arestudied in the large N limit, to all orders in the scalar coupling lambda,leading order in 1/N, and lowest two orders in the gauge coupling g^2. It isshown that the restrictions of asymptotic freedom, and the reality of thecoupling constants throughout the flows, places important restrictions onN_f/N. For the case with massless mesons, these conditions are sufficientlyrestrictive to imply the existence of an infrared fixed-point (g_*,lambda_*) inboth couplings. Thus, the consistent massless theory is scale invariant, and ina non-abelian Coulomb phase. The case of massive mesons, and of spontaneouslybroken symmetry is also discussed, with similar, but not identical,conclusions. Speculations related to the possibility that there is anon-perturbative (in g^2) breakdown of chiral symmetry are presented.
