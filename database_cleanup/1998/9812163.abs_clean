Recently we proposed a TeV-scale Supersymmetric Standard Model in which thegauge coupling unification is as precise (at one loop) as in the MSSM, andoccurs in the TeV range. One of the key ingredients of this model is thepresence of new states neutral under $SU(3)_c\otimes SU(2)_w$ but charged under$U(1)_Y$ whose mass scale is around that of the electroweak Higgs doublets. Inthis paper we show that introduction of these states allows to gauge novelanomaly free discrete (as well as continuous) symmetries (similar to ``lepton''and ``baryon'' numbers) which suppress dangerous higher dimensional operatorsand stabilize proton. Moreover, we argue that these gauge symmetries areessential for successfully generating small neutrino masses via a recentlyproposed higher dimensional mechanism. Furthermore, the mass hierarchy betweenthe up and down quarks (e.g., $t$ vs. $b$) can be explained without appealingto large $\tan\beta$, and the $\mu$-term for the electroweak Higgs doublets (aswell as for the new states) can be generated. We also discuss variousphenomenological implications of our model which lead to predictions testablein the present or near future collider experiments. In particular, we point outthat signatures of scenarios with high vs. low unification (string) scale mightbe rather different. This suggest a possibility that the collider experimentsmay distinguish between these scenarios even without a direct production ofheavy Kaluza-Klein or string states.
