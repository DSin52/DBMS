Using the boundary state formalism, we perform a microscopic string analysisof the interaction between two D-branes and provide a local interpretation forthe R-R force in the D0-D8 brane system. To do so, we construct BRST invariantvertex operators for the massless R-R states in the asymmetric picture that areproportional to potentials rather than field strengths. The Hilbert space ofsuch R-R states contains combinations of two vectors that decouple from allphysical amplitudes, even in the presence of boundaries. Identifying thesevectors, we remove the null states and recover duality relations among R-Rpotentials. If we specify to the D0-D8 brane system, this mechanism impliesthat the R-R 1-form state has a non-zero overlap with both the D0-brane and theD8-brane, thus explaining from a local point of view the non-vanishing R-Rcontribution in the interaction for the D0-D8 brane system and those related toit by duality.
