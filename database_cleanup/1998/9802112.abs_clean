The correlation of the fractionally represented hypercharge group with theisospin and colour group in the standard model determines as faithfullyrepresented internal group the quotient group${\U(1)\x\SU(2)\x\SU(3)\over\Z_2\x\Z_3}$. The discrete cyclic centralabelian-nonabelian internal correlation involved is considered with respect toits consequences for the representations by the standard model fields, theelectroweak mixing angle and the symmetry breakdown. There exists a furtherdiscrete $\Z_2$-correlation between chirality and Lorentz properties and also acontinuous $\U(1)$-external-internal one between hyperisospin and chirality.
