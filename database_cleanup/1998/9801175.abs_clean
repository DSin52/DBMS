Title: On extremal transitions of Calabi-Yau threefolds and the singularity of

the associated 7-space from rollingComments: 38 pages, 7 Postscript figures. A computer code by V.B. is added and

used to check and select possible local admissible pairs of extremaltransitions in the previous version by C.-H.LTopologyM-theory compactification leads one to consider 7-manifolds obtained byrolling Calabi-Yau threefolds in the web of Calabi-Yau moduli spaces. Theresulting 7-space in general has singularities governed by the extremaltransition undergone. After providing some background in Sec. 1, the simplestcase of conifold transitions is studied in Sec. 2. In Sec. 3 we employtopological methods, Smale's classification theorem of smooth simply-connectedspin closed 5-manifolds, and a computer code in the Appendix to understand the5-manifolds that appear as the link of the singularity of a singuler Calabi-Yauthreefolds from a Type II primitive contraction of a smooth one.From this we obtain many locally admissible extremal transition pairs ofCalabi-Yau threefolds, listed in Sec. 4. Their global realization will requirefurther study. As a mathematical byproduct in the pursuit of the subject, weobtain a formula to compute the topology of the boundary of the tubularneighborhood of a Gorenstein rational singular del Pezzo surface embedded in asmooth Calabi-Yau threefold as a divisor.
