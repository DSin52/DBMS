We further develop the new approach, proposed in part I (hep-th/9807072), tocomputing the heat kernel associated with a Fermion coupled to vector and axialvector fields. We first use the path integral representation obtained for theheat kernel trace in a vector-axialvector background to derive a Bern-Kosowertype master formula for the one-loop amplitude with $M$ vectors and $N$axialvectors, valid in any even spacetime dimension. For the massless case wethen generalize this approach to the full off-diagonal heat kernel. In the D=4case the SO(4) structure of the theory can be broken down to $SU(2) \timesSU(2)$ by use of the 't Hooft symbols. Various techniques for explicitlyevaluating the spin part of the path integral are developed and compared. Wealso extend the method to external fermions, and to the inclusion of isospin.On the field theory side, we obtain an extension of the second order formalismfor fermion QED to an abelian vector-axialvector theory.
