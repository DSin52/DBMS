We study M5-brane configuration of the chiral gauge theory whose Type IIAbrane configuration with orientifold 6-plane(O6) is studied by various authors.Much of the paper is devoted to studying M-theory picture of SO/Sp gauge theorywith fundamental flavors realized in Type IIA setup with O6-plane. The Higgsbranch of N=2 SO/Sp gauge theory is studied and the curve corresponding torotated brane configuration is presented. In the chiral gauge theory, themiddle NS$^{\prime}$5-brane on top of the O6 plane is realized as a detachedrational curve. Depending on a location of the rational curve in $x^7$direction, the same curve plus the rational curve can be interpreted asdescribing the Coulomb branch of $SU(2N_c)$ chiral gauge theory,$SO(2N_c)/Sp(N_c)$ gauge theory with $N_f/(N_f+4)$ fundamental hypermultiplets.Various consistency checks for this proposal are made. By introducing two morerational curves corresponding to NS$^{\prime}$5-branes, one can produce anon-trivial fixed point which mediates chiral non-chiral transition.
