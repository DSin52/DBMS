Kaluza-Klein monopole and H-monopole solutions, which are T-dual to eachother, are the well-known solutions of string theory compactified on $T^6$.Since string theory in this case has an S-duality symmetry, we explicitlyconstruct the corresponding dyonic solutions by expressing the $D = 4$ stringeffective action in a manifestly $SL(2, R)$ invariant form with an $SL(2, R)$invariant constraint. The Schwarz-Sen charge spectrum, the BPS saturated massformula as well as the stability of these states are discussed briefly.
