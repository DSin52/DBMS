figures, Habilitation Thesis (in French)After a short introduction on Clifford algebras of polynomials, we give ageneral method of constructing a matrix representation. This process ofClifford algebra (GCA) and the generalized Grassmann algebra (GGA) which arestudied. Then, it is proved that if we equip the GGA with a differentialstructure, we obtain the $q-$deformed Heisenberg algebra or the$q-$oscillators. Finally, it is shown that the $q-$deformed Heisenberg algebrais the basic tool to define an adapted superspace leading to the extension ofsupersymmetry called fractional supersymmetry of order $F$ (FSUSY), $F=2$corresponding to the usual supersymmetry. Local FSUSY in one dimension is thencontructed in the world-line formalism, and an extension of the Dirac equationis obtained. In two dimensions, it turns out that FSUSY is a conformal fieldtheory and in addition to the stress energy tensor, a supercurrent of conformalweight $1+1/F$, which generates a symmetry between the primary fields ofconformal weight $(0,1, \cdots, 1-1/F$), is obtained. The algebra is explicitlyconstructed. We also show that in $1+2$ dimensions FSUSY is a non-trivialextension of the Poincar\'e algebra which generates a symmetry among fractionalspin states or anyons. Unitarity of the representation is checked. Finally, weprove that, independently of the dimension, a natural classification emergesaccording to the decomposition of $F$ as a product of prime numbers and thatFSUSY is a symmetry which closes non-linearly, and is sustained by mathematicalstructures that go beyond Lie or super-Lie algebras.
