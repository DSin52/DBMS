The exact Wilson loop expression for the pure Yang-Mills U(N) theory on asphere $S^2$ of radius $R$ exhibits, in the decompactification limit $R\to\infty$, the expected pure area exponentiation. This behaviour can beunderstood as due to the sum over all instanton sectors. If only the zeroinstanton sector is considered, in the decompactification limit one exactlyrecovers the sum of the perturbative series in which the light-cone gaugeYang-Mills propagator is prescribed according to Wu-Mandelstam-Leibbrandt. Wheninstantons are disregarded, no pure area exponentiation occurs, the stringtension is different and, in the large-N limit, confinement is lost.
