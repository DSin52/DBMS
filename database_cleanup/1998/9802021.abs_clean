A systematic analysis of a continuous version of a binomial lattice,containing a real parameter $\gamma$ and covering the Toda field equation as$\gamma\to\infty$, is carried out in the framework of group theory. Thesymmetry algebra of the equation is derived. Reductions by one-dimensional andtwo-dimensional subalgebras of the symmetry algebra and their correspondingsubgroups, yield notable field equations in lower dimensions whose solutionsallow to find exact solutions to the original equation. Some reduced equationsturn out to be related to potentials of physical interest, such as theFermi-Pasta-Ulam and the Killingbeck potentials, and others. An instanton-likeapproximate solution is also obtained which reproduces the Eguchi-Hansoninstanton configuration for $\gamma\to\infty$. Furthermore, the equation underconsideration is extended to $(n+1)$--dimensions. A spherically symmetric formof this equation, studied by means of the symmetry approach, providesconformally invariant classes of field equations comprising remarkable specialcases. One of these $(n=4)$ enables us to establish a connection with theEuclidean Yang-Mills equations, another appears in the context of DifferentialGeometry in relation to the socalled Yamabe problem. All the properties of thereduced equations are shared by the spherically symmetric generalized fieldequation.
