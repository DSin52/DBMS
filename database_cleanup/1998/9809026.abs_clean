We consider the realization of affine ADE Lie algebras as string junctions onmutually non-local 7-branes in Type IIB string theory. The existence of theaffine algebra is signaled by the presence of the imaginary root junction``delta'', which is realized as a string encircling the 7-brane configuration.The level k of an affine representation partially constrains the asymptotic(p,q) charges of string junctions departing the configuration. The junctionintersection form reproduces the full affine inner product, plus terms in theasymptotic charges.
