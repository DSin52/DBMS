Local effective action is derived to describe Regge asymptotic of Yang-Millstheories. Local symmetries of the effective action originating from the gaugesymmetry of the underlying Yang-Mills theory are studied. Multicomponenteffective action is introduced to express the symmetry transformations as fieldtransformations. The algebra of these symmetries is decomposed onto asemi-direct sum of commutative algebras and four copies of the gauge algebra ofthe underlying Yang-Mills theory. Possibility of existence of solitonscorresponding to the commutative subalgebra of the symmetry algebra ismentioned.
