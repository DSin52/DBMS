Authors: Cumrun Vafa

Comments: 5 pages

We review some aspects of minimal cycles in string compactifications andtheir role in constructing new critical theories in six and lower dimensions aswell as in accounting for black hole entropy. (Based on a talk presented at theSalam Memorial Meeting, the Abdus Salam International Center for TheoreticalPhysics, Fall 1997)
