Title: BPS and non-BPS domain walls in supersymmetric QCD

Authors: A.V. Smilga

Comments: Invited talk at 3rd Workshop "Continuous Advances in QCD",

Minneapolis, April 16-19, 1998 and at the International Seminar "Quarks 98",Suzdal, May 18-24, 1998. LaTeX 14 pages, 6 figuresWe study the spectrum of the domain walls interpolating between differentchirally asymmetric vacua in supersymmetric QCD with the SU(N) gauge group andincluding N-1 pairs of chiral matter multiplets in fundamental andanti-fundamental representations. There are always "real walls" interpolatingbetween the chirally symmetric and a chirally asymmetric vacua which are BPSsaturated. For small enough masses, there are two different "complex" BPS wallsolutions interpolating between different chirally asymmetric vacua and twotypes of "wallsome sphalerons". At some m = m_*, two BPS branches join togetherand, in some interval m_* < m < m_{**}, BPS equations have no solutions, butthere are solutions to the equations of motion describing a non--BPS domainwall and a sphaleron. For m > m_{**}, there are no complex wall solutionswhatsoever.
