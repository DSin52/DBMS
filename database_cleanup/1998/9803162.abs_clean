A `reduced' action formulation for a general class of the supergravitysolutions, corresponding to the `marginally' bound `distributed' systems ofvarious types of branes at arbitrary angles, is developed. It turns out thatall the information regarding the classical features of such solutions isencoded in a first order Lagrangian (the `reduced' Lagrangian) corresponding tothe desired geometry of branes. The marginal solution for a system of $N$ suchdistributions (for various distribution functions) span an $N$ dimensionalsubmanifold of the fields' configuration (target) space, parametrised by a setof $N$ independent harmonic functions on the transverse space. Thissubmanifold, which we call it as the `$H$-surface', is a null surface withrespect to a metric on the configuration space, which is defined by the reducedLagrangian. The equations of motion then transform to a set of equationsdescribing the embedding of a null geodesic surface in this space, which isidentified as the $H$-surface. Using these facts, we present a very simplederivation of the conventional orthogonal solutions together with theirintersection rules. Then a new solution for a (distributed) pair of $p$-branesat SU(2) angles in $D$ dimensions is derived.
