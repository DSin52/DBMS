The most general gauge-invariant marginal deformation of four-dimensionalabelian BF-type topological field theory is studied. It is shown that thedeformed quantum field theory is topological and that its observables compute,in addition to the usual linking numbers, smooth intersection indices ofimmersed surfaces which are related to the Euler and Chern characteristicclasses of their normal bundles in the underlying spacetime manifold. Canonicalquantization of the theory coupled to non-dynamical particle and string sourcesis carried out in the Hamiltonian formalism and explicit solutions of theSchroedinger equation are obtained. The wavefunctions carry a one-dimensionalunitary representation of the particle-string exchange holonomies and ofnon-topological string-string intersection holonomies given by adiabatic limitsof the worldsheet Euler numbers. They also carry a multi-dimensional projectiverepresentation of the deRham complex of the underlying spatial manifold anddefine a generalization of the presentation of its motion group from Euclideanspace to an arbitrary 3-manifold. Some potential physical applications of thetopological field theory as a dual model for effective vortex strings arediscussed.
