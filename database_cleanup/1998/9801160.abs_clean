Starting with the D-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-antisymmetric form equationsand assuming a block-diagonal form of a metric we derive a $(D-d)$-dimensional$\sigma$-model with the target space $SL(d,R)/SO(d) \times SL(2,R)/SO(2) \timesR$ or its non-compact form. Various solution-generating techniques aredeveloped and applied to construct some known and some new $p$-brane solutions.It is shown that the Harrison transformation belonging to the $SL(2,R)$subgroup generates black $p$-branes from the seed Schwarzschild solution. Afluxbrane generalizing the Bonnor-Melvin-Gibbons-Maeda solution is constructedas well as a non-linear superposition of the fluxbrane and a spherical blackhole. A new simple way to endow branes with additional internal structure suchas plane waves is suggested. Applying the harmonic maps technique we generatenew solutions with a non-trivial shell structure in the transverse space(`matrioshka' $p$-branes). It is shown that the $p$-brane intersection ruleshave a simple geometric interpretation as conditions ensuring the symmetricspace property of the target space. Finally, a Bonnor-type symmetry is used toconstruct a new magnetic 6-brane with a dipole moment in the ten-dimensionalIIA theory.
