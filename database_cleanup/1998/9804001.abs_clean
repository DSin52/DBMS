By exploiting the relation between Fredholm modules and theSegal-Shale-Stinespring version of canonical quantization, and taking asstarting point the first-quantized fields described by Connes' axioms fornoncommutative spin geometries, a Hamiltonian framework for fermion quantumfields over noncommutative manifolds is introduced. We analyze the ultravioletbehaviour of second-quantized fields over noncommutative 3-tori, and discusswhat behaviour should be expected on other noncommutative spin manifolds.
