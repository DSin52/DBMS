dark matter candidates. (iii) Cosmological solutions from p-branes. The threetopics are discussed in the framework of Ho\v{r}ava-Witten compactifications.Part (iii) includes comments on cosmological solutions in M-theory describingnucleation of universes through instanton effects and expansions towardasymptotically flat or anti-de-Sitter spaces.
