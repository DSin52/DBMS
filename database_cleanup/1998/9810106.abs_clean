In 2+1 dimensions, for low momenta, using dimensional renormalization westudy the effect of a Chern-Simons field on the perturbative expansion offermions self interacting through a Gross Neveu coupling. For the case of justone fermion field, we verify that the dimension of operators of canonicaldimension lower than three decreases as a function of the Chern-Simonscoupling.
