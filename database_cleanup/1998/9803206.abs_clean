Title: Wrapping Branes in Space and Time

Authors: G W Gibbons

Comments: Latex, 12 pages, no figures

Branes may be approximated semi-classically by solutions of supergravitytheories with event and Cauchy horizons. I suggest that if one wishes to avoidsingularities and to capture accurately some of the properties of branes thenthese classical spacetimes must be identified so as to render them periodic intime.
