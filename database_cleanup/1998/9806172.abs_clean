A thought experiment is formulated to unify quantum mechanics and generalrelativity in a topological manner. An analysis of the interactions in Natureis then presented. The universal ground state of the constructed theory derivesfrom the cyclic properties ($S^1$ homotopy) of the topological manifold$Q=2T^3\oplus 3S^1\times S^2$ which has 23 intrinsic degrees of freedom,discrete $Z_3$ and $Z_2\times Z_3$ internal groups, an SU(5) or SO(10) gaugegroup, and leads to an anomalous U(1) symmetry on a lattice. These propertiescan in principle reproduce the standard model with a stable proton. The generalequation of motion for the unified theory is derived up to the Planck energyand leads to a Higgs field with possible inflation. The thermodynamicproperties of $Q$ are discussed and yield a consistent amplitude for the cosmicmicrowave background fluctuations. The manifold $Q$ possesses internal energyscales which are independent of the field theory defined on it, but whichconstrain the predicted mass hierarchy of such theories. In particular theelectron and its neutrino are identified as particle ground states and theirmasses are predicted. The mass of the electron agrees very well withobservations. A heuristic argument for the occurrence and magnitude of CPviolation is given. Future extensions of the presented framework are discussed.
