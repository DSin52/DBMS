Title: Lectures on D-branes, Gauge Theory and M(atrices)

Authors: Washington Taylor (Princeton)

Comments: 80 pages LaTeX, 8 figures; lectures presented at Trieste summer

typo correctedThese notes give a pedagogical introduction to D-branes and Matrix theory.The development of the material is based on super Yang-Mills theory, which isthe low-energy field theory describing multiple D-branes. The main goal ofthese notes is to describe physical properties of D-branes in the language ofYang-Mills theory, without recourse to string theory methods. This approach ismotivated by the philosophy of Matrix theory, which asserts that all thephysics of light-front M-theory can be described by an appropriate superYang-Mills theory.
