The renormalization group flow of the worldvolume theory depends very muchfrom the number of unbroken supersymmetries. In the dual $AdS$ picture we breaksupersymmetry by adding different types of BPS black holes. We argue, that thisBPS black hole causes a non-trivial renormalization group flow in theworldvolume field theory and especially a regular horizon translates into anon-trivial IR fixpoint. For this interpretation we have to rewrite the $AdS$models into a flat space description with a linear dilaton vacuum. The dualmodels (linear dilaton and the $AdS$ vacuum) can be seen as the different sidesof a domain wall. We discuss the cases of $AdS_3$ and $AdS_5$.
