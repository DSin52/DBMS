We calculate the density of states of the 2+1 dimensional BTZ black hole inthe micro- and grand-canonical ensembles. Our starting point is the relationbetween 2+1 dimensional quantum gravity and quantised Chern-Simons theory. Inthe micro-canonical ensemble, we find the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy byrelating a Kac-Moody algebra of global gauge charges to a Virasoro algebra witha classical central charge via a twisted Sugawara construction. Thisconstruction is valid at all values of the black hole radius. At infinity itgives the asymptotic isometries of the black hole, and at the horizon it givesan explicit form for a set of deformations of the horizon whose algebra is thesame Virasoro algebra. In the grand-canonical ensemble we define the partitionfunction by using a surface term at infinity that is compatible with fixing thetemperature and angular velocity of the black hole. We then compute thepartition function directly in a boundary Wess-Zumino-Witten theory, and findthat we obtain the correct result only after we include a source term at thehorizon that induces a non-trivial spin-structure on the WZW partitionfunction.
