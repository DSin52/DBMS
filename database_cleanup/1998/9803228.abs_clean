The limiting procedure of special Kahler manifolds to their rigid limit isstudied for moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau manifolds in the neighbourhood ofcertain singularities. In two examples we consider all the periods in andaround the rigid limit, identifying the nontrivial ones in the limit as periodsof a meromorphic form on the relevant Riemann surfaces. We show how the Kahlerpotential of the special Kahler manifold reduces to that of a rigid specialKahler manifold. We extensively make use of the structure of these Calabi-Yaumanifolds as K3 fibrations, which is useful to obtain the periods even beforethe K3 degenerates to an ALE manifold in the limit. We study various methods tocalculate the periods and their properties. The development of these methods isan important step to obtain exact results from supergravity on Calabi-Yaumanifolds.
