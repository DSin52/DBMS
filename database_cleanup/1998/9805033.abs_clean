Title: (2+1)-Dimensional QED, Anomalous Surface-Term Contributions and

SuperconductivityComments: Application to high-T_c superconductivity is noted

It is shown that (2+1)-dimensional QED reveals several unusual effects due tothe surface-term contributions. It is also shown that this system provides anew pairing mechanism for the high-$T_c$ superconductivity on the plane.
