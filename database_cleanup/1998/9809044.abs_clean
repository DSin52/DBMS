Comments: 18 pages, TeX, Contribution to the Abdus Salam Memorial Meeting,

19-22 November 1997, Trieste, ItalyIn this contribution some aspects of supergravity and super Yang-Millssystems in D=6 are briefly reviewed and, in some cases, are contrasted with theanalogous features in D=4. Particular emphasis is laid on the stringy solutionsof the D=6 super Yang-Mills systems.
