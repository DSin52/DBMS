The quadratic form of the Dirac equation in a Riemann spacetime yields agravitational gyromagnetic ratio \kappa_S = 2 for the interaction of a Diracspinor with curvature. A gravitational gyromagnetic ratio \kappa_S = 1 is alsofound for the interaction of a vector field with curvature. It is shown thatthe Dirac equation in a curved background can be obtained as the square--rootof the corresponding vector field equation only if the gravitationalgyromagnetic ratios are properly taken into account.
