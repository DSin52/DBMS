The constrained structure of the duality invariant form of Maxwell theory isconsidered in the Hamiltonian formulation of Dirac as well as from thesymplectic viewpoint. Compared to the former the latter approach is found to bemore economical and elegant. Distinctions from the constrained analysis of theusual Maxwell theory are pointed out and their implications are also discussed.
