Title: Two-dimensional Quantum Gravity

Authors: Juri Rolf

Comments: 90 pages, PhD thesis at the Faculty of Science, University of

Copenhagenof two-dimensional quantum gravity and in particular its fractal nature. Toaddress these questions we review the continuum formalism of quantum gravitywith special focus on the scaling properties of the theory. We discuss severalconcepts of fractal dimensions which characterize the extrinsic and intrinsicgeometry of quantum gravity. This work is partly based on work done incollaboration with Jan Ambj{\o}rn, Dimitrij Boulatov, Jakob L. Nielsen andYoshiyuki Watabiki (1997).The other goal is the discussion of the discretization of quantum gravity andto address the so called quantum failure of Regge calculus. We review dynamicaltriangulations and show that it agrees with the continuum theory in twodimensions. Then we discuss Regge calculus and prove that a continuum limitcannot be taken in a sensible way and that it does not reproduce continuumresults. This work is partly based on work done in collaboration with JanAmbj{\o}rn, Jakob L. Nielsen and George Savvidy (1997).
