We systematically study the exclusion statistics for quasi-particles forConformal Field Theory spectra by employing a method based on recursionrelations for truncated spectra. Our examples include generalized fermions inc<1 unitary minimal models, Z_k parafermions, and spinons for the su(n)_1,so(n)_1 and sp(2n)_1 Wess-Zumino-Witten models. For some of the latter exampleswe present explicit expressions for finitized affine characters and for theN-spinon decomposition of affine characters.
