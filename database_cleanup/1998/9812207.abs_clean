We present a convenient method for deriving the transformation of the dilatonunder T-duality in the path-integral approach. Subtleties arising in performingthe integral over the gauge fields are carefully analysed using Pauli-Villarsregularization, thereby clarifying existing ambiguities in the literature. Theformalism can not only be applied to the abelian case, but, and this for thefirst time, to the non-abelian case as well. Furthermore, by choosing aparticular gauge, we directly obtain the target-space covariant expression forthe dual geometry in the abelian case. Finally it is shown that the conditionsfor gauging non-abelian isometries are weaker than those generally found in theliterature.
