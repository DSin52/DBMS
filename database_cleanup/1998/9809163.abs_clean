Advances in QCD, Minneapolis, April 16-19, 1998We discuss nontrivial examples illustrating that perturbative gravity is insome sense the `square' of gauge theory. This statement can be made precise attree-level using the Kawai, Lewellen and Tye relations between open and closedstring tree amplitudes. These relations, when combined with modern methods forcomputing amplitudes, allow us to obtain loop-level relations, and thereby newsupergravity loop amplitudes. The amplitudes show that N=8 supergravity is lessultraviolet divergent than previously thought. As a different application, weshow that the collinear splitting amplitudes of gravity are essentially squaresof the corresponding ones in QCD.
