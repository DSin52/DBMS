Title: The Principle of Equivalence as a Guide towards Matrix Theory

CompactificationsAuthors: Jes\'us Puente Pe\~nalba (U. of Oviedo)

Comments: 18 pages, no figures. A few clarifications. Minor changes

The principle of equivalence is translated into the language of theworld-volume field theories that define matrix and string theories. This idealeads to explore possible matrix descriptions of M-theory compactifications. Aninteresting case is the relationship between D=6 N=1 U(M) SYM and Matrix Theoryon K3.
