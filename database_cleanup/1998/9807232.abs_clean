The Matrix String Theory, i.e. the two dimensional U(N) SYM with N=(8,8)supersymmetry, has classical BPS solutions that interpolate between an initialand a final string configuration via a bordered Riemann surface. The MatrixString Theory amplitudes around such a classical BPS background, in the strongYang--Mills coupling, are therefore candidates to be interpreted in a stringyway as the transition amplitude between given initial and final stringconfigurations. In this paper we calculate these amplitudes and show that theleading contribution is proportional to the factor g_s^{-\chi}, where \chi isthe Euler characteristic of the interpolating Riemann surface and g_s is thestring coupling. This is the factor one expects from perturbative stringinteraction theory.
