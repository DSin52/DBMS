The recent proposal by Hawking and Turok for obtaining an open inflationaryuniverse from singular instantons makes use of low-energy effective Lagrangiansdescribing gravity coupled to scalars and non-propagating antisymmetrictensors. In this paper we derive some exact results for Lagrangians of thistype, obtained from spherical compactifications of M-theory and string theory.In the case of the S^7 compactification of M-theory, we give a detaileddiscussion of the cosmological solutions. We also show that thelower-dimensional Lagrangians admit domain-wall solutions, which preserve onehalf of the supersymmetry, and which approach AdS spacetimes near theirhorizons.
