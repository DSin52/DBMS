We formulate Yang-Mills theory in terms of the large-N limit, viewed as aclassical limit, of gauge-invariant dynamical variables, which are closelyrelated to Wilson loops, via deformation quantization. We obtain a Poissonalgebra of these dynamical variables corresponding to normal-ordered quantum(at a finite value of $\hbar$) operators. Comparing with a Poisson algebra oneof us introduced in the past for Weyl-ordered quantum operators, we find, usingideas closly related to topological graph theory, that these two Poissonalgebras are, roughly speaking, the same. More precisely speaking, there existsan invertible Poisson morphism between them.
