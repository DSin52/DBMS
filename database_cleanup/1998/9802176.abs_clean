We construct a locally supersymmetric worldsheet formulation of a non-AbelianRamond-Neveu-Schwarz (NARNS) string theory where the string coordinates arenoncommuting matrices in a group U(N). This is described by the two dimensionalsupergravity coupled to supersymmetric Yang-Mills fields and adjoint matters inthe gauge group U(N). We show that our NARNS string theory has a free stringlimit where it becomes N-copies of usual RNS string which can be described bythe orbifold conformal field theory corresponding to the covariant worldsheetversion of the Matrix string theory of Dijkgraaf, Verlinde and Verlinde. In theweak coupling limit, i.e. $g_s \to 0$ where $g_s$ is the coupling constant ofour theory related with the Yang-Mills coupling as $g_{YM}^{-2}=\alpha' g_s^2$,a new additional dimension appears in the string spectrum and it can bespeculatively interpreted as the compactified eleven dimensional coordinatewhose dynamics is given by an orbifold O(N) sigma model.
