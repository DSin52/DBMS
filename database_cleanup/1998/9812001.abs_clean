We show how to systematically derive the exact form of local symmetries forthe abelian Proca and CS models, which are converted into first classconstrained systems by the BFT formalism, in the Lagrangian formalism. Asresults, without resorting to a Hamiltonian formulation we obtain thewell-known U(1) symmetry for the gauge invariant Proca model, while showingthat for the CS model there exist novel symmetries as well as the usualsymmetry transformations.
