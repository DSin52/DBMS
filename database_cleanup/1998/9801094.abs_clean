We establish the second quantized solution of the nonlinear Schrodingerequation on the half line with a mixed boundary condition. The solution isbased on a new algebraic structure, which we call boundary exchange algebra andwhich substitutes, in the presence of boundaries, the familiarZamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra.
