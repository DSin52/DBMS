We examine wave propagation and the formation of shocks in stronglymagnetized plasmas by applying a variational technique and the method ofcharacteristics to the coupled magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) andquantum-electrodynamic (QED) equations of motion. In sufficiently strongmagnetic fields such as those found near neutron stars, not only is the plasmaextremely relativistic but the effects of QED must be included to understandprocesses in the magnetosphere. As Thompson & Blaes [1] find, the fundamentalmodes in the extreme relativistic limit of MHD coupled with QED are twooppositely directed Alfv\'{e}n modes and the fast mode. QED introducesnonlinear couplings which affect the propagation of the fast mode such thatwaves traveling in the fast mode evolve as vacuum electromagnetic ones do inthe presence of an external magnetic field [2] (Heyl & Hernquist 1998). Thepropagation of a single Alfv\'{e}n mode is unaffected but QED does alter thecoupling between the Alfv\'{e}n modes.
