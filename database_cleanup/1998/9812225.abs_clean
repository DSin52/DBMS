Authors: Eduardo Eyras and Yolanda Lozano

Comments: 11 pages, LaTeX, 1 figure; To be published in the proceedings of the

TMR-meeting "Quantum Aspects of Gauge Theories, Supersymmetry andUnification", Corfu, Greece, September 1998An effective action for the M9-brane is proposed. We study its relation withother branes via dualities. Among these, we find actions for branes which arenot suggested by the central charges of the Type II superalgebras.
