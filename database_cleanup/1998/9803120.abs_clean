Banks, Fischler, Klebanov and Susskind have proposed a model for black holethermodynamics based on the principle that the entropy is of order the numberof particles at the phase transition point in a Boltzmann gas of D0-branes. Weshow that the deviations from Boltzmann scaling found in $d<6$ noncompactspatial dimensions have a simple explanation in the analysis ofself-gravitating random walks due to Horowitz and Polchinski. In the specialcase of $d=4$ we find evidence for the onset of a phase transition in theBoltzmann gas analogous to the well-known Hagedorn transition in a gas of freestrings. Our result relies on an estimate of the asymptotic density of statesin a dilute gas of D0-branes.
