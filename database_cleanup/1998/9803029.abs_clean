Using the first order formalism (BFYM) of the Yang-Mills theory we show thatit displays an embedded topological sector corresponding to the field contentof the Topological Yang-Mills theory (TYM). This picture arises after a properredefinition of the fields of BFYM and gives a clear representation of the nonperturbative part of the theory in terms of the topological sector. In thissetting the calculation of the $vev$ of a YM observable is translated into thecalculation of a corresponding (non topological) quantity in TYM. We thencompare the topological observables of TYM with a similar set of observablesfor BFYM and discuss the possibility of describing topological observables inYM theory.
