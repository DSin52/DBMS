General Axial Gauges within a perturbative approach to QCD are plagued by'spurious' propagator singularities. Their regularisation has to face majorconceptual and technical problems. We show that this obstacle is naturallyabsent within a Wilsonian or 'Exact' Renormalisation Group approach and explainwhy this is so. The axial gauge turns out to be a fixed point under the flow,and the universal 1-loop running of the gauge coupling is computed.
