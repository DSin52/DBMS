Title: On N=2 SUSY gauge theories and integrable systems

Comments: LaTeX, 7 pages; contribution to the 31st Ahrenshoop Symposium,

Buckow, Germany, 2-6 September 1997This note gives a brief review of the integrable structures presented in theSeiberg-Witten approach to the N=2 SUSY gauge theories with emphasize on thecase of the gauge theories with matter hypermultiplets included (described byspin chains). The web of different N=2 SUSY theories is discussed.
