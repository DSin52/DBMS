Recently, the AdS/CFT conjecture of Maldacena has been investigated inLorentzian signature by Balasubramanian et. al. We extend this investigation toLorentzian BTZ black hole spacetimes, and study the bulk and boundary behaviourof massive scalar fields both in the non-extremal and extremal case. Using thebulk-boundary correspondence, we also evaluate the two-point correlator ofoperators coupling to the scalar field at the boundary of the spacetime, andfind that it satisfies thermal periodic boundary conditions relevant to theHawking temperature of the BTZ black hole.
