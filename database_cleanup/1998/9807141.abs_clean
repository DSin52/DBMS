of PASCOS-98 (Sixth International Symposium on Particles, Strings andCosmology; Northeastern University, Boston; March 22-27, 1998)A new cosmological model leads to testable predictions that are differentfrom those of both standard cosmology and models with a cosmological constant.The prediction that q_0=0 is the same as in other ``coasting universe'' models,but arises without the need for any exotic form of matter or other ad hocassumptions.
