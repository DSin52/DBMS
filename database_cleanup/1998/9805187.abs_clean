The invariant integration method for Chern-Simons theory for gauge groupSU(2) and manifold \Gamma\H^3 is verified in the semiclassical approximation.The semiclassical limit for the partition function associated with a connectedsum of hyperbolic 3-manifolds is presented. We discuss briefly L^2 - analyticaland topological torsions of a manifold with boundary.
