It is shown how some field theories in the target-space induce the splittingof the space-time into a continuous of branes, which can be p-branes orD-branes depending on what the field theory it is. The basic symmetryunderlying the construction is used to build an invariant action, which isproved to be off-shell identical to the p-brane (D-brane) action. The couplingwith the abelian ($p+1$)-form in this formulation it is also found. While theclassical brane's embedding couple to the field strenght, the classical fieldscouple with its dual (in the Hodge sense), therefore providing an explicitelectric-magnetic duality. Finally, the generic role of the underlying symmetryin the connection between the target-space theory and the world-volume one, iscompletely elucidated.
