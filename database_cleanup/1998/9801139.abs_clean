Extending previous work on geometric engineering of N=1 Yang-Mills in fourdimensions for simply laced ($A_n,D_n,E_{6,7,8}$) gauge groups, we constructlocal models for all other gauge groups ($B_n,C_n,F_4,G_2$) in terms ofF-theory. We compute the radius dependent superpotential upon furthercompactification on a circle to $d=3$ in the dual M-theory and use it to showthat the number of vacua in four dimensions for each group is given by its dualcoxeter number, in accordance with expectations based on gaugino condensates.
