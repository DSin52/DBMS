The osp(1,2)-covariant Lagrangian quantization of irreducible gauge theories[hep-th/9712204] is generalized to L-stage reducible theories. The dependenceof the generating functional of Green's functions on the choice of gauge in themassive case is dicussed and Ward identities related to osp(1,2) symmetry aregiven. Massive first stage theories with closed gauge algebra are studied indetail. The generalization of the Chapline-Manton model and topologicalYang-Mills theory to the case of massive fields is consedered as examples.
