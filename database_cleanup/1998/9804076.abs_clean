We derive the complete covariant action for the type IIA superstring in asimple D=10 background which represents a 7-brane with a magnetic Ramond-Ramondvector field (and is U-dual to the Kaluza-Klein Melvin solution). This curvedbackground can be obtained by dimensional reduction from a flat (buttopologically non-trivial) D=11 space-time. The action of a supermembranepropagating in this flat D=11 space is straightforward to write down. Theexplicit form of the superstring action is then obtained by double dimensionalreduction of the supermembrane action. In the light-cone gauge the actioncontains only quadratic and quartic terms in fermions.
