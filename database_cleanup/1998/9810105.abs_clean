The wave functions of the Haldane-Rezayi paired Hall state have beenpreviously described by a non-unitary conformal field theory with centralcharge c=-2. Moreover, a relation with the c=1 unitary Weyl fermion has beensuggested. We construct the complete unitary theory and show that itconsistently describes the edge excitations of the Haldane-Rezayi state.Actually, we show that the unitary (c=1) and non-unitary (c=-2) theories arerelated by a local map between the two sets of fields and by a suitable changeof conjugation. The unitary theory of the Haldane-Rezayi state is found to bethe same as that of the 331 paired Hall state. Furthermore, the analysis ofmodular invariant partition functions shows that no alternative unitarydescriptions are possible for the Haldane-Rezayi state within the class ofrational conformal field theories with abelian current algebra. Finally, theknown c=3/2 conformal theory of the Pfaffian state is also obtained from the331 theory by a reduction of degrees of freedom which can be physicallyrealized in the double-layer Hall systems.
