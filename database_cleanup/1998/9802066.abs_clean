A study of the center symmetric phase of SU(2) Yang Mills theory ispresented. Realization of the center symmetry is shown to result fromnon-perturbative gauge fixing. Dictated by the center symmetry, this phaseexhibits already at the perturbative level confinement like properties. Theanalysis is performed by investigating the dynamics of the Polyakov loops. Theultralocality of these degrees of freedom implies significant changes in thevacuum structure of the theory. General properties of the confined phase and ofthe transition to the deconfined phase are discussed. Perturbation theory builtupon the vacuum of ultralocal Polyakov loops is presented and used tocalculate, via the Polyakov loop correlator, the static quark-antiquarkpotential.
