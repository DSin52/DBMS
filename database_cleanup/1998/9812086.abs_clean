Superfivebranes and Physics in 5+1 Dimensions, Trieste, Italy, 1-3 Apr 1998D=11 supergravity possesses D=5 Calabi-Yau compactified solutions that may beidentified with the vacua of the Horava-Witten orbifold construction forM--theory/heterotic duality. The simplest of these solutions naturally involvestwo 3-brane domain walls, which may be identified with the orbifold boundaryplanes; this solution also possesses an unbroken $\Z_2$ symmetry. Considerationof nearby excited solutions, truncated to the zero-mode and $\Z_2$ invariantsector, yields an effective D=4 heterotic theory displaying chirality and N=1,D=4 supersymmetry.
