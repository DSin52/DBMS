We construct a local on-shell invariant in D=11 supergravity from thenonlocal four-point tree scattering amplitude.Its existence, together withearlier arguments, implies non-renormalizability of the theory at lowestpossible, two loop, level. This invariant, whose leading bosonic terms areexhibited, may also express the leading, "zero-slope", M$-$theory correctionsto its D=11 supergravity limit.
