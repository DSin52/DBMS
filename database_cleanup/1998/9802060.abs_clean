We reexamine the solvable model problem of two static, fundamental quarksinteracting with a SU(2) Yang-Mills field on a spatial circle, introduced byEngelhardt and Schreiber. If the quarks are at the same point, the modelexhibits a quantum mechanical supersymmetry. At finite separation, thesupersymmetry is explicitly broken in a way which naturally explains thegeometrical nature of spectrum and state vectors of this system.
