pages), a picture and an appendix which consists of a scanned article relatedto chapter 6.8. Because of its length this last file should only be openendafter having read that chapter. Updated main fileThe main content of this treatise is a new concept in nonperturbativenon-Lagrangian QFT which explains and extends the ad hoc constructions inlow-dimensional models and incorporates them together with the higherdimensional theories into a new construction method. Thermal and entropicalproperties, which were hitherto restricted to situations with classicalhorizons (Killing vectors), are now generic (nonperturbative) aspects of"modular localization". The underlying more algebraic (and less geometric) modeof thinking also gives rise to interesting questions in renormalizabledeformatioms of higher spin fields, in particular gauge theories.
