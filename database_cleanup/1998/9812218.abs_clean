We study the large N limit of matrix models of M5-branes, or (2,0)six-dimensional superconformal field theories, by making use of theBulk/Boundary correspondence. Our emphasis is on the relation between thenear-horizon limit of branes and the light-like limit of M-theory. Inparticular we discuss a conformal symmetry in the D0 + D4 system, and interpretit as a conformal symmetry in the discrete light-cone formulation of M5-branes.We also compute two-point functions of scalars by applying the conjecture forthe AdS/CFT correspondence to the near-horizon geometry of boosted M5-branes.We find an expected result up to a point subtle, but irrelevant to the IRbehavior of the theory. Our analysis matches with the Seiberg and Sen'sargument of a justification for the matrix model of M-theory.
