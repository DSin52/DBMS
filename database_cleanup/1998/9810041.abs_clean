Authors: P.M.Cowdall (Cambridge University)

Comments: 26 pages, LaTeX, no figures. Significant simplifications of final

results have been made. Also an appendix concerning the limit of D=5 N=4SU(2)xU(1) gauged supergravity, in which the U(1) coupling constant is turnedoff, has been added. Minor typos have been corrected. Complete bosonic andfermionic Lagrangians and susy transformation laws have been added asappendicesJournal-ref: JHEP 9906 (1999) 018

The maximal SO(5) gauged D=7 supergravity is dimensionally reduced to sixdimensions yielding a new SO(5) gauged D=6 model. It is shown that, unlike inD=7, the SO(5) gauge coupling constant can be taken to zero to yield themaximally extended supergravity in six dimensions. It is also shown that thelimit of D=5 N=4 SU(2)xU(1) gauged supergravity in which the U(1) couplingconstant is turned off can be obtained.
