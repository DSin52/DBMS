We present a supersymmetric and $\kappa$-symmetric D-string action on $AdS_5\times S^5$ in supercoset construction. As in the previous work of the superD-string action in the flat background, the super D-string action on $AdS_5\times S^5$ can be transformed to a form of the IIB Green-Schwarz superstringaction with the $SL(2,Z)$ covariant tension on $AdS_5 \times S^5$ through aduality transformation. In order to understand a part of the dualitytransformation as SO(2) rotation of N=2 spinor coordinates, it seems to benecessary to fix the $\kappa$-symmetry in a gauge condition which simplifiesthe classical action. This is the article showing for the first time that thereexists S-duality in type IIB superstring theory in a curved background whosevalidity has been conjectured in the past but not shown so far in an explicitway.
