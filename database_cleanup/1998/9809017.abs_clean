In this article an attempt is made to present very recent conceptual andcomputational developments in QFT as new manifestations of old and wellestablihed physical principles. The vehicle for converting thequantum-algebraic aspects of local quantum physics into more classicalgeometric structures is the modular theory of Tomita. As the above namedlaureate to whom I have dedicated has shown together with his collaborator forthe first time in sufficient generality, its use in physics goes throughEinstein causality. This line of research recently gained momentum when it wasrealized that it is not only of structural and conceptual innovative power (seesection 4), but also promises to be a new computational road intononperturbative QFT (section 5) which, picturesquely speaking, enters thesubject on the extreme opposite (noncommutative) side.
