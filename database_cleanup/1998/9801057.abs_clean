The moduli in a 4D N=1 heterotic compactification on an elliptic CY, as wellas in the dual F-theoretic compactification, break into "base" parameters whichare even (under the natural involution of the elliptic curves), and "fiber" ortwisting parameters; the latter include a continuous part which is odd, as wellas a discrete part. We interpret all the heterotic moduli in terms ofcohomology groups of the spectral covers, and identify them with thecorresponding F-theoretic moduli in a certain stable degeneration. The argumentcovers and the ADE del Pezzo fibrations. For the continuous part of thetwisting moduli, this amounts to an isomorphism between certain abelianJacobian) and the F-theoretic intermediate Jacobian. The comparison of thediscrete part generalizes the matching of heterotic 5brane / F-theoretic 3braneimpurities.
