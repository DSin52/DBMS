We determine an intersection rule for extremal p-branes which are localizedin their relative transverse coordinates by solving, in a purely bosoniccontext, the equations of motion of gravity coupled to a dilaton and n-formfield strengths. The unique algebraic rule we obtained does not lead to newsolutions while it manages to collect, in a systematic way, most of thesolutions (all those compatible with our ansatz) that have appeared in theliterature. We then consider bound states of zero binding energy where a thirdbrane is accomodated in the common and overall transverse directions. They aregiven in terms of non-harmonic functions. A different algebraic rule emergesfor these last intersections, being identical to the intersection rule forp-branes which only depend on the overall transverse coordinates. We clarifythe origin of this coincidence. The whole set of solutions in ten and elevendimensional theories is connected by dualities and dimensional reductions. Theyare related to brane configurations recently used to study non-perturbativephenomena in supersymmetric gauge theories.
