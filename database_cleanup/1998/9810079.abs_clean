Convergence of the Schwinger --- DeWitt expansion for the evolution operatorkernel for special class of potentials is studied. It is shown, that thisexpansion, which is in general case asymptotic, converges for the potentialsconsidered (widely used, in particular, in one-dimensional many-body problems),and besides, convergence takes place only for definite discrete values of thecoupling constant. For other values of the charge divergent expansiondetermines the kernels having essential singularity at origin (beyond usual$\delta$-function). If one consider only this class of potentials then one canavoid many problems, connected with asymptotic expansions, and one get thetheory with discrete values of the coupling constant that is in correspondencewith discreteness of the charge in the nature. This approach can be transmittedinto the quantum field theory.
