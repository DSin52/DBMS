Title: Asymptotic Supergraviton States in Matrix Theory

Authors: Jan Plefka and Andrew Waldron (NIKHEF, Amsterdam)

Comments: 7 pages, LaTeX, Talk presented at the ``31st International Symposium

Ahrenshoop on the Theory of Elementary Particles'' Buckow, September 2-6,1997We study the Matrix theory from a purely canonical viewpoint. In particular,we identify free particle asymptotic states of the model corresponding to the11D supergraviton multiplet along with the split of the matrix modelHamiltonian into a free and an interacting part. Elementary quantum mechanicalperturbation theory then yields an effective potential for these particles asan expansion in their inverse separation. We discuss how our scheme can be usedto compute the Matrix theory result for the 11D supergraviton S matrix andbriefly comment on non-eikonal and longitudinal momentum exchange processes.
