We study two dimensional $N=(4,4)$ supersymmetric gauge theories with variousgauge groups and various hypermultiplets in the fundamental as well asbi-fundamental and adjoint representations. They have " mirror theories " whichbecome equivalent to them at the strong coupling. The theory with onefundamental and one adjoint has a Higgs branch which is parametrized by theadjoint matter. We also consider theories which involve an orientifold plane.The brane realization of the Matrix theory formulation of NS 5-branes in TypeII string theories is also considered.
