In a recent paper DeWolfe et al. have shown how to use the self-intersectionnumber of junctions to constrain the BPS spectrum of N=2, D=4 theories with ADEflavor symmetry arising on a single D3-brane probe in a 7-brane background.Motivated by the existence of more general N=2, D=4 theories arising on theworldvolume of multiple D3-brane probes we show how to compute theself-intersection number of junctions in the presence of 7-branes and multipleD3-branes.
