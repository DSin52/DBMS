We study caustics in classical and quantum mechanics for systems withquadratic Lagrangians. We derive a closed form of the transition amplitude oncaustics and discuss their physical implications in the Gaussian slit(gedanken-)experiment. Application to the quantum mechanical rotor casts doubton the validilty of Jevicki's correspondence hypothesis which states that inquantum mechanics, stationary points(instantons) arise as simple poles.
