Recently a non-supersymmetric analog of Veneziano-Yankielowicz (VY) effectiveLagrangian has been proposed and applied for the analysis of the thetadependence in pure Yang-Mills theory. This effective Lagrangian is similar inmany respects to the VY construction and, in particular, exhibits a kind of lowenergy holomorphy which is absent in the full YM theory. Here we incorporate aheavy fermion into this effective theory by using the "integrating in"technique. We find that, in terms of this extended theory, holomorphy of theeffective Lagrangian for pure YM theory naturally implies a holomorphicdependence on the heavy fermion mass.It is shown that this analysis fixes, under certain assumptions, adimensionless parameter which enters the effective Lagrangian and determinesthe number of nondegenerate vacuum sectors in pure YM theory. We also compareour results for the vacuum structure and theta dependence to those obtainedrecently by Witten on the basis of AdS/CFT correspondence.
