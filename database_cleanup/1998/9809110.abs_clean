textWe present a novel procedure for calculating non-equilibrium two-pointGreen's functions in the $O(N) \phi^{4}$ theory at large $N$. Thenon-equilibrium density matrix $\rho$ is constructed via the Jaynes-Gibbsprinciple of maximal entropy and it is directly implemented into theDyson-Schwinger equations through initial value conditions. In the large $N$limit we perform an explicit evaluation of two-point Green's functions for twoillustrative choices of $\rho$.
