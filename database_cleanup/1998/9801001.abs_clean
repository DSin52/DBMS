The motion of a one-dimensional kink and its energy losses are considered asa model of interaction of nontrivial topological field configurations withexternal fields. The approach is based on the calculation of the zero modesexcitation probability in the external field. We study in the same way theinteraction of the t'Hooft-Polyakov monopole with weak external fields. Thebasic idea is to treat the excitation of a monopole zero mode as the monopoledisplacement. The excitation is found perturbatively. As an example we considerthe interaction of the t'Hooft-Polyakov monopole with an external uniformmagnetic field.
