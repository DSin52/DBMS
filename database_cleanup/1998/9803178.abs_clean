Title: On the geometry of the Hawking Turok instanton

Comments: 3 pages, LaTex

We discuss the coordinate complexification necessary to obtain a spatiallyhomogeneous open universe in the singular instantonic solution recentlysuggested by Hawking and Turok (hep-th/9802030), concluding that only thetime coordinate $\sigma$ of the spatially inhomogeneous De Sitter-likeLorentzian solution and its scale factor should be rotated in order tocontinue into a Lorentzian open universe.
