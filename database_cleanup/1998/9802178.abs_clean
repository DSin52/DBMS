We analyse in detail the behaviour of supersymmetric QCD with a number offlavours M smaller than the number of colours N, for quark masses smaller thanthe dynamically generated scale. In this regime, we find it useful to move frommeson superfields to Nambu-Goldstone-like variables. In particular we work outthe mass spectrum and the set of decay constants that specify the interactionsof the low-energy theory. We explicitly check that masses and decay constantshave a consistent behaviour under decoupling and that they satisfy currentalgebra requirements. Finally we speculate about the massless limit. Forvanishing quark masses, and only in this case, the relation between mesons andNambu-Goldstone variables becomes singular. When analysed in terms of theNambu-Goldstone superfields, the massless limit exhibits a spontaneous breakingof the flavour symmetry, with massless Goldstone modes embedded in anM^2-dimensional complex moduli space. The symmetry-breaking order parameter isformally infinite, but this has the only effect of turning off the interactionsbetween the chiral superfields.
