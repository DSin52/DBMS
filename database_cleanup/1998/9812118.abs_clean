We study total and partial supersymmetry breaking by freely acting orbifolds,or equivalently by Scherk-Schwarz compactifications, in type I string theory.In particular, we describe a four-dimensional chiral compactification withspontaneously broken N=1 supersymmetry, some models with partial $N=4\to N=2$and $N=4\to N=1$ supersymmetry breaking and their heterotic and M-theory duals.A generic feature of these models is that in the gravitational sector and inthe spectrum of D-branes parallel to the breaking coordinate, all masssplittings are proportional to the compactification scale, while global(extended) supersymmetry remains unbroken at tree level for the masslessexcitations of D-branes transverse to the breaking direction.
