There are no reasons why the singularity in the growth of the dilatoncoupling should not be regularised, in a string cosmological context, by thepresence of classical inhomogeneities. We discuss a class of inhomogeneousdilaton-driven models whose curvature invariants are all bounded and regular intime and space. We prove that the non-space-like geodesics of these models areall complete in the sense that none of them reaches infinity for a finite valueof the affine parameter. We conclude that our examples represent trulysingularity-free solutions of the low energy beta functions. We discuss somesymmetries of the obtained solutions and we clarify their physicalinterpretation. We also give examples of solutions with spherical symmetry. Inour scenario each physical quantity is everywhere defined in time and space,the big-bang singularity is replaced by a maximal curvature phase where thedilaton kinetic energy reaches its maximum. The maximal curvature is alwayssmaller than one (in string units) and the coupling constant is also smallerthan one and it grows between two regimes of constant dilaton, implying,together with the symmetries of the solutions, that higher genus and highercurvature corrections are negligible. We argue that our examples describe, in astring cosmological context, the occurrence of ``little bangs''(i.e. highcurvature phases which never develop physical singularities). They also suggestthe possibility of an unexplored ``pre-little-bang'' phase.
