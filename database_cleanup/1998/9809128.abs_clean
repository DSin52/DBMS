We present a 3D approximation of the three-fermion Bethe-Salpeter equation.Our 3D equation is covariantly cluster separable and the two-fermion clusterseparated limits are exact equivalents of the corresponding two-fermionBethe-Salpeter equations. The potentials include positive free energyprojectors in order to avoid continuum dissolution.
