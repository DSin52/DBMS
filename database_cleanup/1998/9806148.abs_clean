2+1-dimensional Yang-Mills theory is reinterpreted in terms of metrics on3-manifolds. The dual gluons are related to diffeomorphisms of the 3-manifold.Monopoles are identified with points where the Ricci tensor has triplydegenerate eigenvalues. The dual gluons have the desired interaction with thesemonopoles. This would give a mass for the dual gluons resulting in confinement.
