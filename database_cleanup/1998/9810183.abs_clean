April 1998Nonlinear sigma models arise in supergravity theories with or without mattercouplings in various dimensions and they are important in understanding theduality symmetries of M-theory. With this motivation in mind, we review thesalient features of gauged and ungauged nonlinear sigma models with or withoutWess-Zumino terms for general target spaces in a minimal as well as liftedformulation. Relevant to the question of finding interesting vacua of gaugedsupergravity theories is the highly constrained potential which arisesnaturally in these theories. Motivated by this fact, we derive a general andsimple formula for a gauge invariant potential of this kind.
