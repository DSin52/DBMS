6-th International Conference on "Path-Integrals from peV to TeV" (Florence,Italy, 25-29 August 1998)A path-integral representation for the kernel of the evolution operator ofgeneral Hamiltonian systems is reviewed. We study the models with bosonic andfermionic degrees of freedom. A general scheme for introducing boundaryconditions in the path-integral is given. We calculate the path-integral forthe systems with quadratic first class constraints and present an explicitformula for the heat kernel in this case. These results may be applied to manyquantum systems which can be reduced to the Hamiltonian systems with quadraticconstraints (confined quarks, Calogero type models, string and $p$-braintheories, etc.).
