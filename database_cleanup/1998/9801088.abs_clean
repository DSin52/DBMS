A generalization of the Yang-Mills covariant derivative, that uses bothvector and scalar fields and transforms as a 4-vector contracted with Diracmatrices, is used to simplify and unify the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model. SinceSU(3) assigns the wrong hypercharge to the Higgs boson, it is necessary to usea special representation of U(3) to obtain all the correct quantum numbers. Asurplus gauge scalar boson emerges in the process, but it uncouples from allother particles.
