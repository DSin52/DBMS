We introduce a new family of integrable theories with $N$ bosons and $N$freely adjustable mass parameters. These theories restrict in particular limitsto the ``generalized supersymmetric'' sine-Gordon models, as well as to theflavor anisotropic chiral Gross Neveu models (studied recently by N. Andrei andcollaborators). The scattering theory involves scalar particles that are nobound states, and bears an intriguing resemblance wih the results of a sharpcut-off analysis of the Thirring model carried out by Korepin in (1980).Various physical applications are discussed. In particular, we demonstrate thatour theories are the appropriate continuum limit of integrable quantum spinchains with mixtures of spins.
