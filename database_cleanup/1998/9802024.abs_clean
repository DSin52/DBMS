We propose an integrable extension of nonlinear sigma model on the targetspace of Hermitian symmetric space (HSS). Starting from a discussion of solitonsolutions of O(3) model and an integrally extended version of it, we constructgeneral theory defined on arbitrary HSS by using the coadjoint orbit method. Itis based on the exploitation of a covariantized canonical structure on HSS.This term results in an additional first-order derivative term in the equationof motion, which accommodates the zero curvature representation. Infiniteconservation laws of nonlocal charges in this model are derived.
