and Continuous Advances in QCD 98The field theories on the surface of non-supersymmetric D-brane constructionsare identified. By moving to M-theory a semi-classical, strong couplingexpansion to the IR non-supersymmetric gauge dynamics is obtained. The solutionis consistent with the formation of a quark condensate but there is evidencethat in moving to strong coupling scalar degrees of freedom have not decoupled.
