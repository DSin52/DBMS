The picture of CP-violation in orbifold compactifications in which the$T$-modulus is at a complex fixed point of the modular group is studied.CP-violation in the neutral kaon system and in the neutron electric dipolemoment are both discussed. The situation where the $T$-modulus takes complexvalues on the unit circle which are not at a fixed point is also discussed.
