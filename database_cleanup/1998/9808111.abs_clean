We study three-dimensional gauge dynamics by using type IIB superstring braneconfigurations, which can be obtained from the M-theory configuration ofM2-branes stretched between two M5-branes with relative angles. Ourconstruction of brane configurations includes (p,q)5-brane and gives asystematic classification of possible three-dimensional gauge theories. Theexplicit identification of gauge theories are made and their mirror symmetry isdiscussed. As a new feature, our theories include interestingMaxwell-Chern-Simons system whose vacuum structure is also examined in detail,obtaining results consistent with the brane picture.
