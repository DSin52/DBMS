We study the description of Schwarzschild black holes, of entropy S, withinmatrix theory in the regime $N \ge S \gg 1$. We obtain the most general matrixtheory equation of state by requiring that black holes admit a descriptionwithin this theory. It has a recognisable form in various cases. In some casesa D dimensional black hole can plausibly be thought of as a $\tilde{D} = D + 1$dimensional black hole, described by another auxiliary matrix theory, but inits $\tilde{N} \sim S$ regime. We find what appears to be a matrix theorygeneralisation to higher dynamical branes of the normalisation of dynamicalstring tension, seen in other contexts. We discuss a further possiblegeneralisation of the matrix theory equation of state. In a special case, it isgoverned by $N^3$ dynamical degrees of freedom.
