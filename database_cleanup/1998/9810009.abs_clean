Acrucial consistency check is the proof that the resulting boundary-valueproblem is strongly elliptic. In Euclidean quantum gravity, the appropriateprinciple seems to be the invariance of boundary conditions under infinitesimaldiffeomorphisms on metric perturbations, and hence their BRST invariance.However, if the operator on metric perturbations is then chosen to be ofLaplace type, the boundary-value problem for the quantized gravitational fieldfails to be strongly elliptic. A detailed proof is presented, and thecorresponding open problems are discussed.
