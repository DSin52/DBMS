We study the BPS spectrum of four dimensional N=2 SU(2) theory with massivefundamental matters using the D3-brane probe. Since the BPS states are realizedby string webs subject to the BPS conditions, we determine explicitly theconfigurations of such webs. It is observed that there appear BPS string webswith multiple of junctions corresponding to the fact that the curves ofmarginal stability in massive theory are infinitely nested. In terms of thestring configurations, various properties of the curves of marginal stabilityare explained intuitively.
