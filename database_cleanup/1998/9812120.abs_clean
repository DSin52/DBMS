Title: Interacting Strings in Matrix String Theory

Authors: G. Bonelli

Comments: 11 pages, no figures, two references added

It is here explained how the Green-Schwarz superstring theory arises fromMatrix String Theory. This is obtained as the strong YM-coupling limit of thetheory expanded around its BPS instantonic configurations, via theidentification of the interacting string diagram with the spectral curve of therelevant configuration. Both the GS action and the perturbative weight$g_s^{-\chi}$, where $\chi$ is the Euler characteristic of the world-sheetsurface and $g_s$ the string coupling, are obtained.
