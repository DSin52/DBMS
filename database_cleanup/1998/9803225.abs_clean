A new method of deriving the Higgs Lagrangian from vector-like gauge theoriesis explored. After performing a supersymmetric extension of gauge theories weidentify the auxiliary field associated with the "meson" superfield, in the lowenergy effective theory, as the composite Higgs field. The auxiliary field, attree level, has a "negative squared mass". By computing the one-loop effectiveaction in the low energy effective theory, we show that a kinetic term for theauxiliary field emerges when an explicit non-perturbative mechanism forsupersymmetry breaking is introduced. We find that, due to the naive choice ofthe Kaehler potential, the Higgs potential remains unbounded from the below. Apossible scenario for solving this problem is presented. It is also shown thatonce chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken via a non-zero vacuum expectationvalue of the Higgs field, the low energy composite fermion field acquires amass and decouples, while in the supersymmetric limit it was kept massless bythe 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions.
