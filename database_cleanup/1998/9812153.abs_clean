Using the manifestly spacetime-supersymmetric version of open superstringfield theory, we construct the free action for the first massive states of theopen superstring compactified to four dimensions. This action is in N=1 D=4superspace and describes a massive spin-2 multiplet coupled to two massivescalar multiplets.
