We study, in the framework put forward by Siegel\cite{WS} and by Floreaniniand Jackiw\cite{FJ} (FJ), the relationship between different chiralbosonization schemes (CBS). This is done in the context of the solderingformalism\cite{MS}, that considers the phenomenon of interference in thequantum field theory\cite{ABW}. We propose a field redefinition that disclosesthe presence of a noton, a nonmover field, in Siegel's formulation for chiralbosons. The presence of a noton in the Siegel CBS is a new and surprisingresult, that separates dynamics from symmetry. While the FJ component describesthe dynamics, it is the noton that carries the symmetry contents, acquiringdynamics upon quantization and is fully responsible for the Siegel anomaly. Thediagonal representation proposed here is used to study the effect of quantuminterference between gauged rightons and leftons.
