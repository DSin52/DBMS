We present a topological mechanism of discretization, which gives for thefundamental electric charge a value equal to the square root of the Planckconstant times the velocity of light, which is about 3.3 times the electroncharge. Its basis is the following recently proved property of the standardfrom an underlying topological theory, using two complex scalar fields, thelevel curves of which coincide with the magnetic and the electric lines,respectively.
