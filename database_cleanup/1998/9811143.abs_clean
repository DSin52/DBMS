We present a geometric formulation of $(p,q)$-strings in which the$Sl(2;Z)$-doublet of the two-form gauge potentials is constructed as secondorder in the supersymmetric currents. The currents are constructed using asupergroup manifold corresponding to the $(p,q)$-string superalgebra, whichcontains fermionic generators in addition to the supercharges and transformsunder the $Sl(2;Z)$. The properties of the superalgebra and the generalizationsto higher $p$-branes are discussed.
