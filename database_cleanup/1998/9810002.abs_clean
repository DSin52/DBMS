Title: The Generalisation of the Coulomb Gauge to Yang-Mills Theory

Authors: Christofer Cronstrom

Comments: 8 pages

I consider the problem of generalising the Abelian Coulomb gauge condition tothe non-Abelian Yang-Mills theory, with an arbitrary compact and semi-simplegauge group. It is shown that a straightforward generalisation exists, whichreduces the Gauss law into a form involving the gauge potentials only, but nottheir time derivatives. The existence and uniqueness of the generalised Coulombgauge is shown to depend on an elliptic linear partial differential equationfor a Lie-algebra valued quantity, which defines the gauge transform by meansof which the generalised Coulomb gauge condition is realised. Thus the Gribovproblem is actually non-existent in this case.
