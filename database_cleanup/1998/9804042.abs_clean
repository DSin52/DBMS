Making use of the duality transformation, we construct string representationfor the partition function of the London limit of Abelian Higgs Model with anadditional axionic term. In the lowest order of perturbation theory, this termleads to the appearance in the resulting string effective action of a newthreelocal interaction between the elements of the string world-sheet.Consequently, there emerges a threelocal correlator of the dual field strengthtensors, which does not contain the average over world-sheets, and is thereforenontrivial even in the sector of the theory with a single small vortex. Therelation between the obtained correlator and the bilocal one is established.Finally, it is argued that the vacuum structure of the London limit of theAbelian Higgs Model with an additional axionic interaction is much more similarto that of gluodynamics rather than without this interaction.
