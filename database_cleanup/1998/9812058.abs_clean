An interesting tool for investigating the quantum features of a field theoryis the introduction of compensating fields. For instance, the anomalousdivergence of the chiral current can be calculated in the field-antifieldformalism from an extended form of QCD with compensating fields. Theinterpretation of this procedure from the bosonized point of view, in the twodimensional case, crucially depends on the possibility of defining a bosonizedversion for the extended theory. We show, by using some recent results on thesoldering of bosonized actions corresponding to chiral fermions, how is themapping between bosonic and fermionic representations of this extended $QCD_2$.In the bosonic formulation the anomalous divergence of the chiral current showsup from the equations of motion of the compensating fields.
