The ground state of string theory may lie at a point of ``maximally enhancedsymmetry", at which all of the moduli transform under continuous or discretesymmetries. This hypothesis, along with the hypotheses that the theory at highenergies has N=1 supersymmetry and that the gauge couplings are weak andunified, has definite consequences for low energy physics. We describe these,and offer some suggestions as to how these assumptions might be compatible.
