The correspondence between supergravity (and string theory) on $AdS$ spaceand boundary conformal field theory relates the thermodynamics of ${\cal N}=4$super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions to the thermodynamics ofSchwarzschild black holes in Anti-de Sitter space. In this description, quantumphenomena such as the spontaneous breaking of the center of the gauge group,magnetic confinement, and the mass gap are coded in classical geometry. Thecorrespondence makes it manifest that the entropy of a very large $AdS$Schwarzschild black hole must scale ``holographically'' with the volume of itshorizon. By similar methods, one can also make a speculative proposal for thedescription of large $N$ gauge theories in four dimensions withoutsupersymmetry.
