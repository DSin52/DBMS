The structure of counterterms in higher derivative quantum gravity isreexamined. Nontrivial dependence of charges on the gauge and parametrizationis established. Explicit calculations of two-loop contributions are carried outwith the help of the generalized renormgroup method demonstrating consistencyof the results obtained.
