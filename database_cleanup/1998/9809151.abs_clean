We find the general solution of the equations of motion for the WZNW systemin curved space-time for arbitrary external gauge fields. Using the connectionbetween the WZNW system for $SL(2,R)$ group and 2D induced gravity we obtainthe general solution of the equations of motion for 2D induced gravity incurved space-time from that of the WZNW system. We independently presented thedirect solution of 2D induced gravity equations of motion and obtain the sameresult.
