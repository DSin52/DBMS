We study scattering of $D0$ branes in eleven dimensional supergravity (SUGRA)using the tree level four point amplitude. The range of validity of SUGRAallows us to make reliable calculations of relativistic brane scattering,inaccessible in string theory because of halo effects. We also compare the rateof annihilation of $D0-\bar{D0}$ branes to the rate of elastic $D0-\bar{D0}$scattering and find that the former is always smaller than the latter. We alsofind a pole in $\sigma_{D0-\bar{D0}}$. We exploit the analogy with thepositronium to argue that the brane anti-brane pairs form branium atoms in 3spatial dimensions. We also derive a long range effective potential forinteracting branes which explicitly depends on their polarizations. We compareof the branes are kept constant during the interaction, while in QFT, one sumsover all possible polarizations. We show that the GR and QFT approaches givethe same answer.
