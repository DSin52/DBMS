In the quantum Teichmuller theory, based on Penner coordinates, the mappingclass groups of punctured surfaces are represented projectively. The case of agenus three surface with one puncture is worked out explicitly. The projectivefactor is calculated. It is given by the exponential of the Liouville centralcharge.
