In the framework of N=1 supersymmetric string models given by the heteroticcompute the chiral matter content of the massless spectrum. For this purposethe net generation number, i.e. half the third Chern class, is computed fromdata related to the heterotic vector bundle in the spectral cover description;a non-technical introduction to that method is supplied. This invariant is, inthe class of bundles considered, shown to be related to a discrete moduluswhich is the heterotic analogue of the $F$-theory four-flux. We consider alsothe relevant matter which is supported along certain curves in the base $B$ andderive the net generation number again from the independent matter-relatedcomputation. We then illustrate these considerations with two applications.First we show that the construction leads to numerous 3 generation models ofunbroken gauge group $SU(5), SO(10)$ or $E_6$. Secondly we discuss the closelyrelated issue of the heterotic 5-brane/instanton transition resp. theF-theoretic 3-brane/instanton transition. The extra chiral matter in thesetransitions is related to the Hecke transform of the direct sum of the originalbundle and the dissolved 5-brane along the intersection of their spectralcovers. Finally we point to the corresponding $F$-theory interpretation ofchiral matter from the intersection of 7-branes where the influence offour-flux on the twisting along the intersection curve plays a crucial role.
