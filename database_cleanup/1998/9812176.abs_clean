The O(n) nonlinear sigma model in 1+1 dimensions is examined as quantummechanics on an infinite-dimensional configuration space. Two metrics aredefined in this space. One of these metrics is the same as Feynman's distance,but we show his conclusions concerning potential energy versus distance fromthe classical vacuum are incorrect. The potential-energy functional is found tohave barriers; the configurations on these barriers are solitons of anassociated sigma model with an external source. The tunneling amplitude iscomputed for the O(2) model and soliton condensation is shown to drive thephase transition at a critical coupling. We find the tunneling paths in theconfiguration space of the O(3) model and argue that these are responsible forthe mass gap at $\theta=0$. These tunneling paths have half-integer topologicalcharge, supporting the conjecture due to Affleck and Haldane that there is amassless phase at $\theta=\pi$.
