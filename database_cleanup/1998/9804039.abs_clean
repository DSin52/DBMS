Solutions to the equations of motion of the low energy, effective fieldtheory emerging out of compactified heterotic string theory are constructed bymaking use of the well-known duality symmetries. Beginning withfour-dimensional solutions of the Einstein-massless scalar field theory inthe canonical frame we first rewrite the corresponding solutions in the stringframe. Thereafter, using the T and S duality symmetries of the low energystring effective action we arrive at the corresponding uncharged, electricallycharged and magnetically charged solutions. Brief comments on the constructionof dual versions of the Kerr-Sen type using the dilatonic Kerr solution as theseed are also included. Thereafter, we verify the status of the energyconditions for the solutions in the string frame. Several of the metrics foundhere are shown to possess naked singularities although the energy conditionsare obeyed. Dual solutions exhibit a duality in the conservation/violation ofthe Null and Averaged Null Energy Conditions (NEC/ANEC), a fact demonstratedearlier in the context of black holes (hep-th/9604047) and cosmologies(hep-th/9611122). Additionally, those backgrounds which conserve the NEC/ANECin spite of possesing naked singularities serve as counterexamples to cosmiccensorship in the context of low energy, effective string theory.
