Title: Massive Gauge Field Theory Without Higgs Mechanism II. Ward-Takahashi

Identities, Propagators and VerticesComments: 24 pages, latex, no figures

Based on the BRST-symmetry of the quantum massive gauge field theorydescribed in the former paper, the Ward-Takahashi identities satisfied by thegenerating functionals of full Green's functions, connected Green's functionsand proper vertex functions are successively derived. From such identities, theWard- Takahashi identities obeyed by the gauge boson propagator and verticesare also given and used to discuss the renormalization of the propagator andvertices
