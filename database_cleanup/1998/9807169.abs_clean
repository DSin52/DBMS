We study static spherically symmetric gravitating dyon solutions and dyonicblack holes in Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. The gravitating dyon solutionsshare many features with the gravitating monopole solutions. In particular,gravitating dyon solutions and dyonic black holes exist up to a maximalcoupling constant, and beside the fundamental dyon solutions there are exciteddyon solutions.
