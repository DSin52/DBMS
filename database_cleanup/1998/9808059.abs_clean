The Cremmer-Scherk mechanism is generalised in a non-Abelian context. In thepresence of the Higgs scalars of the standard model it is argued that fieldsarising from the low energy effective string action may contribute to the massgeneration of the observed vector bosons that mediate the electroweakinteractions and that future analyses of experimental data should consider thepossibility of string induced radiative corrections to the Weinberg anglecoming from physics beyond the standard model.
