We study the renormalizable abelian vector-field models in the presence ofthe Wess-Zumino interaction with the pseudoscalar matter. The renormalizabilityis achieved by supplementing the standard kinetic term of vector fields withhigher derivatives. The appearance of fourth power of momentum in thevector-field propagator leads to the super-renormalizable theory in which the$\beta$-function, the vector-field renormalization constant and the anomalousmass dimension are calculated exactly. It is shown that this model has theinfrared stable fixed point and its low-energy limit is non-trivial. Themodified effective potential for the pseudoscalar matter leads to the possibleoccurrence of dynamical breaking of the Lorentz symmetry. This phenomenon isrelated to the modification of Electrodynamics by means of the Chern-Simons(CS) interaction polarized along a constant CS vector. Its presence makes thevacuum optically active that has been recently estimated from astrophysicaldata. We examine two possibilities for the CS vector to be time-like orspace-like, under the assumption that it originates from v.e.v. of somepseudoscalar matter and show that only the latter one is consistent in theframework of the AWZ model, because a time-like CS vector makes the vacuumunstable under pairs creation of tachyonic photon modes with the finite vacuumdecay rate.
