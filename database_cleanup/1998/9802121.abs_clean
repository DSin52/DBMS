The block-orthogonal generalization of the Majumdar-Papapetrou type solutionsfor the sigma-model studied earlier are obtained and corresponding solutionswith p-branes are considered. The existence of solutions and the number ofindependent harmonic functions is defined by the matrix of scalar products ofvectors $U^s$, governing the sigma-model target space metric. For orthogonal$U^s$, when target space is a symmetric homogeneous space, the solutions reduceto the previous ones. Two special classes of solutions with $U^s$ related tofinite dimensional Lie algebras and hyperbolic (Kac-Moody) algebras are singledout and investigated. The affine Cartan matrices do not arise in the schemeunder consideration. Some examples of obtained solutions and intersection rulesfor D=11 supergravity, related D=12 theory and extending them $B_D$-models areconsidered. For special multicenter solutions criterions for the existence ofhorizon and curvature singularity are found.
