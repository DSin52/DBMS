Title: Matrix Theory from Schild Action

Comments: 8 pages, LaTex

Starting from the Schild action for membrane, we present an alternativeformulation of Matrix Theory. First of all, we construct the Schild action forgeneral bosonic p-brane which is classically equivalent to the Nambu-Gotoaction for p-brane. Next, based on the constraint obtained from the variationalequation for the auxiliary field in the case of $p = 2$ (membrane), weconstruct a new matrix model which is closely related to the matrix model ofM-theory as developed by Banks, Fischler, Shenker and Susskind (BFSS). Ourpresent formulation is a natural extension of the construction of type IIBmatrix model by Yoneya to the case of M-theory.
