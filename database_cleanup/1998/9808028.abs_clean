Title: Gauge-Invariant QCD - an Approach to Long-Range Color-Confining Forces

Authors: Kurt Haller

Comments: 8 pages. Talk delivered at the Fourth International Workshop on QCD

and Hadronic Physics, Paris, France, June 1 - 7, 1998. A numerical error iscorrectedWe discuss the transformation of the QCD temporal-gauge Hamiltonian to arepresentation in which it can be expressed as a functional of gauge-invariantquark and gluon fields. We show how this objective can be realized byimplementing the non-Abelian Gauss's law, and by using the mathematicalapparatus developed for that purpose to also construct gauge-invariant quarkand gluon fields. We demonstrate that, in the transformed QCD Hamiltonian, theinteractions of pure-gauge components of the gauge field with color-currentdensities are replaced by nonlocal interactions connecting quark color-chargedensities to each other and to `glue'-color. We discuss the nonperturbativeevaluation of these nonlocal interactions, which are non-Abelian analogs of theCoulomb interaction in QED, and we explore their implications for QCD in thelow-energy regime.
