The lowest representatives of the Form Factors relative to the traceoperators of N=1 Super Sinh-Gordon Model are exactly calculated. The novelty oftheir determination consists in solving a coupled set of unitarity and crossingequations. Analytic continuations of the Form Factors as functions of thecoupling constant allows the study of interesting models in a uniform way,among these the latest model of the Roaming Series and the minimalsupersymmetric models as investigated by Schoutens. A fermionic version of the$c$-theorem is also proved and the corresponding sum-rule derived.
