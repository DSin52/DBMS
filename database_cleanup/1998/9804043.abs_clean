We present a detailed algebraic study of the N=2 cohomological set--updescribing the balanced topological field theory of Dijkgraaf and Moore. Weemphasize the role of N=2 topological supersymmetry and $sl(2,R)$ internalsymmetry by a systematic use of superfield techniques and of an $sl(2,R)$covariant formalism. We provide a definition of N=2 basic and equivariantcohomology, generalizing Dijkgraaf's and Moore's, and of N=2 connection. For acohomology is isomorphic to the tensor product of the ordinary N=1 basicspaces of N=2 and N=1 connections are isomorphic.
