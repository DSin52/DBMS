In this paper we demonstrate that there exists a close relationship betweenquasi-exactly solvable quantum models and two special classes of classicaldynamical systems. One of these systems can be considered a naturalgeneralization of the multi-particle Calogero-Moser model and the second one isa classical matrix model.
