Title: Duality in the BTZ Black Hole and the Statistical Entropy

Comments: 6pp Latex2e. v2

In Strominger's proposal for the computation of the statistical entropy ofblack holes based on the asymptotic symmetry analysis of Brown and Henneaux afundamental role is played by the asymptotic conditions that the consideredmetric must satisfy at infinity. Here it is shown that $T$-duality does notpreserve such conditions. This observation is used to discuss a possiblereformulation of the proposal.
