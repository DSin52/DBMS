This is the first of a series of papers devoted to the group-theoreticalanalysis of the conditions which must be satisfied for a configuration ofintersecting M5-branes to be supersymmetric. In this paper we treat the case ofstatic branes. We start by associating (a maximal torus of) a differentsubgroup of Spin(10) with each of the equivalence classes of supersymmetricconfigurations of two M5-branes at angles found by Ohta & Townsend. We thenconsider configurations of more than two intersecting branes. Such aconfiguration will be supersymmetric if and only if the branes are G-related,where G is a subgroup of Spin(10) contained in the isotropy of a spinor. Foreach such group we determine (a lower bound for) the fraction of thesupersymmetry which is preserved. We give examples of configurations consistingof an arbitrary number of non-coincident intersecting fivebranes withresulting (calibrated) geometry.
