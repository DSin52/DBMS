We continue to explore the possibility that the graviton in two dimensions isrelated to a quadratic differential that appears in the anomalous contributionof the gravitational effective action for chiral fermions. A higher dimensionalanalogue of this field might exist as well. We improve the defining action forthis diffeomorphism tensor field and establish a principle for how it interactswith other fields and with point particles in any dimension. All interactionsare related to the action of the diffeomorphism group. We discuss possibleinterpretations of this field.
