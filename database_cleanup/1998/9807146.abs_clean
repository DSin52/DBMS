The $O(\beta^2)$ quantum correction to the classical reflection factor iscalculated for one of the integrable boundary conditions of $a_2^{(1)}$ affineToda field theory. This is found to agree with the conjectured exact reflectionfactor of the quantum theory. We consider the existence of other exactreflection factors consistent with our perturbative answer and examine thequestion of how duality transformations might relate theories with differentboundary conditions.
