A manifestly N=2 supersymmetric completion of the four-dimensionalNambu-Goto-Born-Infeld action, which is self-dual with respect toelectric-magnetic duality, is constructed in terms of the abelian N=2superfield strength W in the conventional N=2 superspace. A relation to theknown N=1 supersymmetric Born-Infeld action in N=1 superspace is established.The action found can be considered either as the Goldstone action associatedwith partial breaking of N=4 supersymmetry down to N=2, with the N=2 vectorsuperfield being a Goldstone field, or, equivalently, as the gauge-fixedsuperfield action of a D-3-brane in flat six-dimensional ambient spacetime.
