We describe conformal operators living at the boundary of $AdS_{d+1}$ in ageneral setting. Primary conformal operators at the threshold of the unitaritybounds of UIR's of O(d,2) correspond to singletons and massless fields in$AdS_{d+1}$, respectively. For maximal supersymmetric theories in $AdS_{d+1}$we describe ``chiral'' primary short supermultiplets and non-chiral primarylong supermultiplets. Examples are exhibited which correspond to KK and stringstates. We give the general contribution of a primary conformal operator to theOPE and Green's functions of primary fields, which may be relevant to computestring corrections to the four-point supergraviton amplitude in Anti-de-Sitterspace. The material in this paper was presented by one of the authors (S.F) atString 98, Santa Barbara.
