A new synthesis of the principles of relativity and quantum mechanics isdeveloped by replacing the Poincar\'e group for the de Sitter one. The newrelativistic quantum mechanics is an indefinite mass theory which is reduced tothe standard theory on the mass shell. The charge conjugation acquires ageometrical meaning and the Stueckelberg interpretation for antiparticlesnaturally arises in the formalism. So the idea of the Dirac sea in the secondquantized formalism proves to be superfluous. The off-shell theory is free fromultraviolet divergences, which only appear in the process of mass shellreduction.
