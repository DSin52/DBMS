We study BPS saturated domain walls in the supersymmetric SU(2) gauge theory.For a theory with a very light adjoint scalar (mass <~ Lambda/400) we use theperturbed N=2 Seiberg-Witten theory to calculate the actual field configurationof the domain wall. The wall has a sandwich-like five-layer structure of threedistinct phases -- electric confinement, Coulomb and oblique confinement --separated by two separate transition regions. For larger scalar masses, thethree-phase structure disappears and the Seiberg-Witten theory becomesinteractions between the light fields become relevant and second, both themagnetic monopole condensate and the dyon condensate show up in the same regionof space, a phenomenon indescribable in terms of a local field theory.Nevertheless, we argue that the BPS saturated domain wall continues to exist inthis regime and give a qualitative description of the scalar and gauginocondensates. Finally, we discuss the domain walls in MQCD and translate the BPSconditions into coupled non-linear differential equations.
