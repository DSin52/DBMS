In this paper we investigate the relation between the bulk and boundary inAdS/CFT. We first discuss the relation between the Poincare and the globalvacua, and then study various probes of the bulk from the boundary theory pointof view. We derive expressions for retarded propagators and note that objectsin free fall look like expanding bubbles in the boundary theory. We also studyseveral Yang-Mills theory examples where we investigate thermal screening andconfinement using propagators. In the case of confinement we also calculate theprofile of a flux tube and provide an alternative derivation of the tension.
