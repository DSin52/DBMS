We construct and explore BPS states that preserve 1/4 of supersymmetry in N=4Yang-Mills theories. Such states are also realized as three-pronged stringsending on D3-branes. We correct the electric part of the BPS equation andrelate its solutions to the unbroken abelian gauge group generators. Generic1/4-BPS solitons are not spherically symmetric, but consist of two or moredyonic components held apart by a delicate balance between staticelectromagnetic force and scalar Higgs force. The instability previously foundin three-pronged string configurations is due to excessive repulsion by one ofthese static forces. We also present an alternate construction of these 1/4-BPSstates from quantum excitations around a magnetic monopole, and build up thesupermultiplet for arbitrary (quantized) electric charge. The degeneracy andthe highest spin of the supermultiplet increase linearly with a relativeelectric charge. We conclude with comments.
