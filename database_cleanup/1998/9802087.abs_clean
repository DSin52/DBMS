Title: Adiabatic Vacuumstates of the Dirac-field on a Curved Spacetime

Authors: Mark Wellmann

Comments: 21 pages, amsart

In this article we review the quantization of the Dirac-field on a curvedspacetime. For that purpose we describe the construction of the localobservable algebras in the algebraic approach to quantum field theory. Amongthe possible states we single out the so called Hadamard-states, which are theones relevant for physics. Finally, as an example, we give a definition for anadiabatic vacuum state of the Dirac-field on a Robertson-Walker spacetime. Webelieve that these states are physical in the sense that they have thesingularity structure of Hadamard-form, although we cannot give a formal proofof this conjecture.
