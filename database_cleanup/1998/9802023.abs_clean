A geometric derivation of $W_\infty$ Gravity based on Fedosov's deformationquantization of symplectic manifolds is presented. To lowest order in Planck'sconstant it agrees with Hull's geometric formulation of classical nonchiral$W_\infty$ Gravity. The fundamental object is a ${\cal W}$-valued connectionone form belonging to the exterior algebra of the Weyl algebra bundleassociated with the symplectic manifold. The ${\cal W} $-valued analogs of theSelf Dual Yang Mills equations, obtained from a zero curvature condition,naturally lead to the Moyal Plebanski equations, furnishing Moyal deformationsof self dual gravitational backgrounds associated with the complexifiedcotangent space of a two dimensional Riemann surface. Deformation quantizationof $W_\infty$ Gravity is retrieved upon the inclusion of all the $\hbar$ termsappearing in the Moyal bracket. Brief comments on Non Commutative Geometry andM(atrix)theory are made.
