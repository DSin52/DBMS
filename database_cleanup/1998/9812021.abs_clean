Evidence is given that some particles with large charges in gauge theories,including 4d N=4 SU(3) and 5d theories with N=1 supersymmetry, have macroscopicentropy. The ground state entropy is found to be extensive in the charges. Themass gap for excitation is estimated and is of the same order as the bindingenergy. The question of the decay of excited states through Hawking radiationis raised. The analysis is based on the model of (p,q) string webs and onvarious other results. The evidence points to an explanation in terms of astring model.
