case of the large mass behaviour of planar Wilson lines has been includedJournal-ref: J.Phys. A32 (1999) 2469

The large-mass behaviour of loop variables in Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory isanalysed by means of a gauge-field transformation which allows to reset theMaxwell-Chern-Simons action to pure Chern-Simons.
