It has been known that D=5 simple supergravity resembles D=11 supergravity inmany respects. We present their further resemblances in (1) the duality groupsupon dimensional reduction, and (2) the worldsheet structure of the solitonicstring of the D=5 supergravity. We show that the D=3, G_{2(+2)}/SO(4) (bosonic)nonlinear sigma model is obtained by using Freudenthal's construction inparallel to the derivation of the D=3, E_{8(+8)}/SO(16) sigma model from D=11supergravity. The zero modes of the string solution with unbroken (4,0)supersymmetry consist of three (non-chiral) scalars, four Majorana-Weyl spinorsof the same chirality and one chiral scalar, which suggests a duality to acertain six-dimensional chiral string theory. The worldsheet gravitationalanomaly indicates a quantum correction to the Bianchi identity for the dualizedtwo-form gauge field in the bulk just like the M5-brane case.
