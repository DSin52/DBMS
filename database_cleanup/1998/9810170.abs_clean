We examine the matrix theory representation of D0-brane dynamics at finitetemperature. In this case, violation of supersymmetry by temperature leads to anon-trivial static potential between D0-branes at any finite temperature. Wecompute the static potential in the 1-loop approximation and show that it isshort-ranged and attractive. We compare the result with the computations insuperstring theory. We show that thermal states of D0-branes can be reproducedby matrix theory only when certain care is taken in integration over the modulispace of classical solutions in compactified time.
