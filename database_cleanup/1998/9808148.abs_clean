We argue that the self/anti-self charge conjugate states of the (1/2,0)\oplus(0,1/2) representation possess the axial charge. Furthermore, we analyze therecent claims of the \sim \sigma \cdot [A \times A^*] interaction terms for`fermions'. Finally, we briefly discuss the problem in the (1,0)\oplus (0,1)representation.
