Authors: Alexander Burinskii (NSI, Russian Academy of Sciences)

Comments: 6 pages, talk given at the MG8 Meeting (Jerusalem, June 1997), at the

Symposium "Frontiers of Fundamental Physics" (Hyderabad, India, December1997), and at the GR15 Conference (Pune, India December 1997), brief versionof the paper Phys. Rev. D57, 2392 (1998) (hep-th/9704102)A natural combined model of the Kerr spinning particle and superparticle isobtained leading to a non-trivial super black hole solution. By analogue withcomplex structure of the Kerr solution we perform a supershift on the Kerrgeometry, and then select a "body"-submanifold of superspace that yields anon-trivial supergeneralization of the Kerr metric with a nonlinearrealization of (2,0)-supersymmetry. For the known parameters of spinningparticles this "black hole" is to be in a specific state without horizons andvery far from extreme. The naked Kerr singular ring has to be hidden inside arotating superconducting disk, built of a supermultiplet of matter fields.Stringy wave excitations of the Kerr singular ring (traveling waves) yield anextra axial singular line modulated by de Broglie periodicity.
