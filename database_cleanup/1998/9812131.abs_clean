We consider theories characterized by a set of Ward operators which do notform a closed algebra. We impose the Slavnov--Taylor identity built out of theWard operators and we derive the acceptable breaking of the algebra and thegeneral form of the classical action. The 1PI generating functional isexpressed in terms of the known quantities characterizing the theory and of anontrivial integrability condition. As a nontrivial application of ourformalism, we discuss the N=4 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model.
