We analyze the structure of the moduli space of a supersymmetric SU(5) chiralgauge theory with two matter fields in the 10 representation, and two fields inthe \bar{5} representation. Inspection of the exact Kahler potential of theclassical moduli space shows that the symmetry group of the moduli space islarger than the global symmetry group of the underlying gauge theory. As aconsequence, the gauge theory has classical inequivalent vacua which yieldidentical low energy theories.
