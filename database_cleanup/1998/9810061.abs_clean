Authors: Y. Brihaye, T. N. Tomaras

Comments: LaTeX, 14 pages, 3 figures

We study in a systematic way all static solutions of the Goldstone model in1+1 dimension with a periodicity condition on the spatial coordinate. Thesolutions are presented in terms of the standard trigonometric functions and ofJacobi elliptic functions. Their stability analysis is carried out, and thecomplete list of classical stable quasi-topological solitons is given.
