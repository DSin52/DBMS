We study the properties of wrapped membranes in matrix theory on ALE spaces.We show that the only BPS bound states of wrapped membranes that can form areroots of the $A$-$D$-$E$ group. We determine a bound on the energy of a boundstate and find the correct dependence on the blow-up parameters andlongitudinal momentum expected from M-Theory. For the $A_{n-1}$ series, weconstruct explicit classical solutions for the wrapped membrane bound states.These states have a very rich structure and have a natural interpretation interms of noncommutative geometry. In the $A_1$ case, we examine the spectrum ofexcitations around the wrapped membrane solution and provide an explicitcalculation of their energies. The results agree exactly with supergravitycalculations.
