We study the spectrum of the softly broken generalized Veneziano-Yankielowiczeffective action for N=1 SUSY Yang-Mills theory. Two dual formulations of theeffective action are given. The spurion method is used for the soft SUSYbreaking. Masses of the bound states are calculated and mixing patterns arediscussed. Mass splittings of pure gluonic states are consistent withpredictions of conventional Yang-Mills theory. The results can be tested inlattice simulations of the SUSY Yang-Mills model.
