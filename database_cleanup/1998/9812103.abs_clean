The low energy dynamics of the vortices of the Abelian Chern-Simons-Higgssystem is investigated from the adiabatic approach. The difficulties involvedin treating the field evolution as motion on the moduli space in this systemare shown. Another two generalized Abelian Higgs systems are discusssed withrespect to their vortex dynamics at the adiabatic limit. The method works welland we find bound states in the first model and scattering at right angles inthe second system.
