We derive Bogomolny equations for an Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton-$\sigma$model (EYMD-$\sigma$) on a static spacetime, showing that the Einsteinequations are satisfied if and only if the associated (conformally scaled)three-metric is flat. These are precisely the static metrics for whichsuper-covariantly constant spinors exist. We study some general properties ofthese equations and then consider the problem of obtaining axially symmetricsolutions for the gauge group SU(2).
