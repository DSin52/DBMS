The effective classical/quantum dynamics of a particle constrained on aclosed line embedded in a higher dimensional configuration space is analyzed.By considering explicit examples it is shown how different reduction mechanismsproduce unequivalent dynamical behaviors. The relation with a formal treatmentof the constraint is discussed. While classically it is always possible tostrictly enforce the constraint by setting to zero the energy stored in themotion normal to the constraint surface, the quantum description is far moresensitive to the reduction mechanism. Not only quantum dynamics is plagued bythe usual ambiguities inherent to the quantization procedure, but also in somecases the constraint's equations do not contain all the necessary informationto reconstruct the effective motion.
