We expand on an idea of Seiberg that an N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory showsconfinement without breaking of chiral symmetry when the gauge symmetry of itsmagnetic dual is completely broken by the Higgs effect. This has recently beenapplied to some models involving tensor fields and an appropriate tree-levelsuperpotential. We show how the confining spectrum of a supersymmetric gaugetheory can easily be derived when a magnetic dual is known and we determine itexplicitly for many models containing fields in second rank tensorrepresentations. We also give the form of the confining superpotential for mostof these models.
