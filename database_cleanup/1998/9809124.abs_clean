A new framework for solving the hierarchy problem was recently proposed whichdoes not rely on low energy supersymmetry or technicolor. The fundamentalPlanck mass is at a $\tev$ and the observed weakness of gravity at longdistances is due the existence of new sub-millimeter spatial dimensions. Inthis picture the standard model fields are localized to a $(3+1)$-dimensionalwall or ``3-brane''. The hierarchy problem becomes isomorphic to the problem ofthe largeness of the extra dimensions. This is in turn inextricably linked tothe cosmological constant problem, suggesting the possibility of a commonsolution. The radii of the extra dimensions must be prevented from bothexpanding to too great a size, and collapsing to the fundamental Planck length$\tev^{-1}$. In this paper we propose a number of mechanisms addressing thisquestion. We argue that a positive bulk cosmological constant $\bar\Lambda$ canstabilize the internal manifold against expansion, and that the value of$\bar\Lambda$ is not unstable to radiative corrections provided that thesupersymmetries of string theory are broken by dynamics on our 3-brane. Wefurther argue that the extra dimensions can be stabilized against collapse in atopologically conserved quantum numbers associated with higher-form bulk U(1)gauge fields, such as the naturally occurring Ramond-Ramond gauge fields, orthe winding number of bulk scalar fields. 2) The brane-lattice-crystallizationof a large number of 3-branes in the bulk. These mechanisms are consistent withtheoretical, laboratory, and cosmological considerations such as the absence oflarge time variations in Newton's constant during and after primordialnucleosynthesis, and millimeter-scale tests of gravity.
