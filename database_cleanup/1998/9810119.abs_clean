The path integral representation of the transition amplitude for a particlemoving in curved space has presented unexpected challenges since theintroduction of path integrals by Feynman fifty years ago. In this paper wediscuss and review mode regularization of the configuration space pathintegral, and present a three loop computation of the transition amplitude totest with success the consistency of such a regularization. Key features of themethod are the use of the Lee-Yang ghost fields, which guarantee a consistenttreatment of the non-trivial path integral measure at higher loops, and aneffective potential specific to mode regularization which arises at two loops.We also perform the computation of the transition amplitude using theregularization of the path integral by time discretization, which also makesuse of Lee-Yang ghost fields and needs its own specific effective potential.This computation is shown to reproduce the same final result as the oneperformed in mode regularization.
