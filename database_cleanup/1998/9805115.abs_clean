Title: Matrix Theory Black Holes and the Gross Witten Transition

Comments: 8 pages, phyzzx

Large N gauge theories have so called Gross-Witten phase transitions whichtypically can occur in finite volume systems. In this paper we relate thesetransitions in supersymmetric gauge theories to transitions that take placebetween black hole solutions in general relativity. The correspondence betweengauge theory and gravitation is through matrix theory which represents thegravitational system in terms of super Yang Mills theories on finite tori. Wealso discuss a related transition that was found by Banks, Fischler, Klebanovand Susskind.
