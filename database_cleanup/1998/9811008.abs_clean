String cosmology is revisited from cosmological viewpoint of holographicprinciple put forward by `t Hooft, and by Fischler and Susskind. It is shownthat the holography requires existence of a `graceful exit' mechanism, whichrenders the Universe nonsingular by connecting pre- and post-big bang phasessmoothly. It is proven that flat Universe is consistent with the holographyonly if it starts with an absolutely cold and vacuous state. Particle entropyproduced during the `graceful exit' apparently saturates the holography bound.Open Universe can always satisfy the holography no matter what initial state ofthe Universe is.
