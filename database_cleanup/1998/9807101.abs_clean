179.WE-Heraeus-Seminar, Bad Honnef, 1997, Eds. Friedrich W. Hehl, ClausKiefer, and Ralph J.K. Metzler (Springer, 1998)Models of black holes in (1+1)-dimensions provide a theoretical laboratoryfor the study of semi-classical effects of realistic black holes in Einstein'stheory. Important examples of two-dimensional models are given by string theorymotivated dilaton gravity, by ordinary general relativity in the case ofspherical symmetry, and by {\em Poincar\'e gauge gravity} in two spacetimedimensions. In this paper, we present an introductory overview of the exactsolutions of two-dimensional classical Poincar\'e gauge gravity (PGG). Ageneral method is described with the help of which the gravitational fieldequations are solved for an arbitrary Lagrangian. The specific choice of atorsion-related coframe plays a central role in this approach. Completeintegrability of the general PGG model is demonstrated in vacuum, and thestructure of the black hole type solutions of the quadratic models with andwithout matter is analyzed in detail. Finally, the integrability of the generaldilaton gravity model is established by recasting it into an effective PGGmodel.
