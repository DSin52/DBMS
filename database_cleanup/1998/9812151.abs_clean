Title: N=2 supersymmetric pseudodifferential symbols and super W-algebras

Authors: Stephane Gourmelen

Comments: 12 pages

We study the superconformally covariant pseudodifferential symbols defined onN=2 super Riemann surfaces. This allows us to construct a primary basis for N=2super W_KP^(n)-algebras and, by reduction, for N=2 super W_n-algebras.
