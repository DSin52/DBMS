We construct a class of one-dimensional Lie-algebraic problems based on sl(2)where the spectrum in the algebraic sector has a dynamical symmetry E -> - E.All 2j+1 eigenfunctions in the algebraic sector are paired, and inside eachpair are related to each other by simple analytic continuation x -> ix, exceptthe zero mode appearing if j is integer. At j-> infinity the energy of thehighest level in the algebraic sector can be calculated by virtue of thequasiclassical expansion, while the energy of the ground state can becalculated as a weak coupling expansion. The both series coincide identically.
