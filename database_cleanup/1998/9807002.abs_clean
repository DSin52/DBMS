We embed the semilocal Chern-Simons-Higgs theory into an N=2 supersymmetricsystem. We construct the corresponding conserved supercharges and derive theBogomol'nyi equations of the model from supersymmetry considerations. We showthat these equations hold provided certain conditions on the coupling constantsas well as on the Higgs potential of the system, which are a consequence of thehuge symmetry of the theory, are satisfied. They admit string-like solutionswhich break one half of the supersymmetries --BPS Chern-Simons semilocal cosmicstrings-- whose magnetic flux is concentrated at the center of the vortex. Westudy such solutions and show that their stability is provided by supersymmetrythrough the existence of a lower bound for the energy, even though the manifoldof the Higgs vacuum does not contain non-contractible loops.
