We show that all branes admit worldvolume domain wall solutions. We find oneclass of solutions for which the tension of the brane changes discontinuouslyalong the domain wall. These solutions are not supersymmetric. We argue thatthere is another class of domain wall solutions which is supersymmetric. Aparticular case concerns supersymmetric domain wall solutions on IIB D-5- andNS-5-branes.
