We show that the chiral Gross-Neveu model in $2+ \epsilon$ dimensions has fora small number $N$ of fermions two phase transitions corresponding to pairformation and pair condensation.In the first transition, fermions and antifermions acquire spontaneously amass and are bound to pairs which behave like a Bose liquid in a chirallysymmetric state. In the second transition, the Bose liquid condenses into acoherent state which breaks chiral symmetry. This suggests the possibility thatin particle physics, the generation of quark masses may also happen separatelyfrom the breakdown of chiral symmetry.
