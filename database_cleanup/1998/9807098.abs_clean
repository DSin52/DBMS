The order g^2 radiative corrections to all 2- and 3-point correlators of thecomposite primary operators Tr X^k are computed in {\cal N} = 4 supersymmetricYang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(N). Corrections are found to vanish forall N. For k=2 this is a consequence of known superconformal nonrenormalizationtheorems, and for general k the result confirms an N-to-infinity, fixed largeg^2N supergravity calculation and further conjectures in hep-th/9806074. A3-point correlator involving {\cal N} = 4 descendents of Tr X^2 is calculated,and its order g^2 contribution also vanishes, giving evidence for the absenceof radiative corrections in correlators of descendent operators.
