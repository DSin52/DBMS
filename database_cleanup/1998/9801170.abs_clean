In this paper we study the compactification conditions of the M theory onD-dimensional noncommutative tori. The main tool used for this analysis is thealgebra A(Z^D) of the projective representations of the abelian group Z^D. Weexhibit the explicit solutions in the space of the multiplication algebra ofA(Z^D), that is the algebra generated by right and left multiplications.
