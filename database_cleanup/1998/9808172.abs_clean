We present a Liouville-string approach to confinement in four-dimensionalgauge theories, which extends previous approaches to include non-conformaltheories. We consider Liouville field theory on world sheets whose boundariesare the Wilson loops of gauge theory, which exhibit vortex and spike defects.We show that world-sheet vortex condensation occurs when the Wilson loop isembedded in four target space-time dimensions, and show that this correspondsto the condensation of gauge magnetic monopoles in target space. We also showthat vortex condensation generates a effective string tension corresponding tothe confinement of electric degrees of freedom. The tension is independent ofthe string length in a gauge theory whose electric coupling varieslogarithmically with the length scale. The Liouville field is naturallyinterpreted as an extra target dimension, with an anti-de-Sitter (AdS)structure induced by recoil effects on the gauge monopoles, interpreted as Dbranes of the effective string theory. Black holes in the bulk AdS spacecorrespond to world-sheet defects, so that phases of the bulk gravitationalsystem correspond to the different world-sheet phases, and hence to differentphases of the four-dimensional gauge theory. Deconfinement is associated with aBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of vortices on the Wilson-loop worldsheet, corresponding in turn to a phase transition of the black holes in thebulk AdS space.
