String theory and supersymmetry are theoretical ideas that go beyond thestandard model of particle physics and show promise for unifying all forces.After a brief introduction to supersymmetry, we discuss the prospects for itsexperimental discovery in the near future. We then show how the magic ofsupersymmetry allows us to solve certain quantum field theories exactly, thusleading to new insights about field theory dynamics related toelectric-magnetic duality. The discussion of superstring theory starts with itsperturbation expansion, which exhibits new features including ``stringygeometry.'' We then turn to more recent non-perturbative developments. Usingnew dualities, all known superstring theories are unified, and their strongcoupling behavior is clarified. A central ingredient is the existence ofextended objects called branes.
