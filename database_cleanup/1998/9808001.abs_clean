We have developed a variational perturbation theory based on theLiouville-Neumann equation, which enables one to systematically compute theperturbative correction terms to the variationally determined wave functions ofthe time-dependent systems. We then apply the method to the time-independentanharmonic oscillator, and show that the results agree with those of othervariational perturbation theories. We also show that the system has aninteresting algebraic structure at the first order correction level.
