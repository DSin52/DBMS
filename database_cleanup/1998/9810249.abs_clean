A full quantum description of global vortex strings is presented in theframework of a pure Higgs system with a broken global U(1) symmetry in 3+1D. Anexplicit expression for the string creation operator is obtained, both in termsof the Higgs field and in the dual formulation where a Kalb-Ramondantisymmetric tensor gauge field is employed as the basic field. The quantumstring correlation function is evaluated and from this, the string energydensity is obtained. Potential application in cosmology (cosmic strings) andcondensed matter (vortices in superfluids) are discussed.
