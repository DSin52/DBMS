We generalize the dressing symmetry construction in mKdV hierarchy. Thisleads to non-local vector fields (expressed in terms of vertex operators)closing a Virasoro algebra. We argue that this algebra realization should playan important role in the study of 2D integrable field theories and inparticular should be related to the Deformed Virasoro Algebra (DVA) when theconstruction is perturbed out of the critical theory.
