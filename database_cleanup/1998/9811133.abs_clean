We extend the formulation of gauged supergravity in five dimensions, asobtained by compactification of $M$~theory on a deformed Calabi-Yau manifold,to include non-universal matter hypermultiplets. Even in the presence of thisgauging, only the graviton supermultiplets and matter hypermultiplets cancouple to supersymmetry breaking sources on the walls, though these mix withvector supermultiplets in the bulk. Whatever the source of supersymmetrybreaking on the hidden wall, that on the observable wall is in general acombination of dilaton- and moduli-dominated scenarios.
