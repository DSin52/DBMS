We present new rotating black brane solutions which solve Einstein'sequations with cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in arbitrary dimension $d$. Fornegative $\Lambda$, the branes naturally appear in AdS supergravitycompactifications, and should therefore play some role in the AdS/CFTcorrespondence. The spacetimes are warped products of a four-dimensional partand an Einstein space of dimension $d-4$, which is not necessarily of constantcurvature. As a special subcase, the solutions contain the higher dimensionalgeneralization of the Kerr-AdS metric recently found by Hawking et al.
