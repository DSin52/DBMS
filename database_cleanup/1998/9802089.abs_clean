Wilsonian effective actions are interpreted as free energies in ensembleswith prescribed field expectation values and prescribed connected two-pointfunctions. Since such free energies are directly obtained fromtwo-particle-irreducible functionals, it follows that Wilsonian effectiveactions satisfy elementary perturbative consistency conditions, andnon-perturbative convexity conditions. In particular, the exact determinationof a Wilsonian action by other means (e.g. supersymmetry) allows one to extractrestrictions on the particular cutoff scheme and field reparametrization thatwould lead to such a Wilsonian action from an underlying microscopic action.
