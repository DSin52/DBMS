Scientific, 2000) ed A. A. Bytsenko and F. L. Williams, pp 93-97We consider a simple action for a fractional spin particle and a pathintegral representation for the propagator is obtained in a gauge such that theconstraint embodied in the Lagrangian is not an obstacle. We obtain apropagator for the particle in a constant electromagnetic field via the pathintegral representation over velocities, which is characterized by arbitraryboundary conditions and the absence of time derivatives following integrationover bosonic variables.
