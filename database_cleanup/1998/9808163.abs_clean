An outline is given of a recently discovered technique for building a quantumeffective action that is completely independent of gauge-fixing choices andghost determinants. One makes maximum use of the geometry and fibre-bundlestructure of the space of field histories and introduces a set of nonlocalon the space of histories. The closed-time-path formalism of Schwinger, Bakshi,Mahantappa {\it et al} can be adapted for these fields, and a set ofgauge-fixing-independent dynamical equations for their expectation values(starting from given initial conditions) can be computed. An obviousapplication for such equations is to the study of the formation and radiativedecay of black holes, and to other back-reaction problems.
