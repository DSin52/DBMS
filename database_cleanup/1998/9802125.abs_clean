We study supersymmetric SU(5) chiral gauge theories with 2 fields in the 10representation, $2+N_F$ fields in the $\bar{5}$ representation and $N_F$ fieldsin the 5 representation, for $N_F=0,1,2$. With a suitable superpotential,supersymmetry is shown to be broken dynamically for each of these values of$N_F$. We analyze the calculable limit for the model with $N_F=0$ in detail,and determine the low energy effective sigma model in this case. For $N_F=1$ wefind the quantum moduli space, and for $N_F=2$ we construct the s--confiningpotential.
