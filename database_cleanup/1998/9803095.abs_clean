Authors: George Zoupanos

Theory of Elementary Particles'' Buckow, Sept. 2-6, 97N = 1, all-loop Finite Unified Theories (FUTs) are very interesting not onlysince they realize an old theoretical dream, but also due the remarkablepredictive power of particular models as well as for providing candidates thatmight shed light in non-perturbative Physics.Here we discuss (a) the recent developments concerning the soft supersymmetrybreaking (SSB) sector of these theories and the resulting predictions in veryinteresting realistic models, and (b) the results of a recent search for dualsof N=1, all-loop FUTs.
