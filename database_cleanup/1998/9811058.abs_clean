Title: Geometrodynamical Formulation of Two-Dimensional Dilaton Gravity and the

Quantum Birkhoff TheoremAuthors: Marco Cavaglia

Comments: 6 pages, LATEX, invited talk at the 11th International Conference on

Problems of Quantum Field Theory, July 13-17, 1998, Dubna, RussiaGeneral two-dimensional pure dilaton-gravity can be discussed in a unitaryway by introducing suitable field redefinitions. The new fields are directlyrelated to the original spacetime geometry and in the canonical picture theygeneralize the well-known geometrodynamical variables used in the discussion ofthe vacuum dilatonic black hole. So the model can be quantized using thetechniques developed for the latter case. The resulting quantum theorycoincides with the quantum theory obtained imposing the Birkhoff theorem at theclassical level.
