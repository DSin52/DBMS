We use a variant of the classical Segal-Bargmann transform to understand thecanonical quantization of Yang-Mills theory on a space-time cylinder. Thistransform gives a rigorous way to make sense of the Hamiltonian on thegauge-invariant subspace. Our results are a rigorous version of the widelyaccepted notion that on the gauge-invariant subspace the Hamiltonian shouldreduce to the Laplacian on the compact structure group. We show that theinfinite-dimensional classical Segal-Bargmann transform for the space ofconnections, when restricted to the gauge-invariant subspace, becomes thegeneralized Segal-Bargmann transform for the the structure group.
