We study the two-fold dimensional dependence of the electromagnetic dualitygroups. We introduce the dual projection operation that systematicallydiscloses the presence of an internal space of potentials where the groupoperation is defined. A two-fold property of the kernel in the projection isshown to define the dimensional dependence of the duality groups. The dualprojection is then generalized to reveal another hidden two-dimensionalstructure. The new unifying concept of the external duality space remove thedimensional dependence of the kernel, allowing the presence of both $Z_2$ andSO(2) duality groups in all even dimensions. This result, ultimately unifiesthe notion of selfduality to all D=2k+2 dimensions. Finally, we show thepresence of an unexpected duality between the internal and external spacesleading to a duality of the duality groups.
