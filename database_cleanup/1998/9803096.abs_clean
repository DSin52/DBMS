We show how an extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole can be obtained bywrapping a dyonic D3-brane on a Calabi-Yau manifold. In the orbifold limitT^6/Z_3, we explicitly show the correspondence between the solution of thesupergravity equations of motion and the D-brane boundary state description ofsuch a black hole.
