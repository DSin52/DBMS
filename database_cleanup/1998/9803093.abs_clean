Several arguments are given for the summability of the superstringperturbation series. Whereas the Schottky group coordinatization of modulispace may be used to provide refined estimates of large-order bosonic stringamplitudes, the super-Schottky group variables define a measure for thesupermoduli space integral which leads to upper bounds on superstringscattering amplitudes.
