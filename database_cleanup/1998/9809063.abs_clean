We study the system of D6+D0 branes at sub-stringy scale. We show that theproper description of the system, for large background field associated withthe D0-branes, is via spinning chargeless black holes in five dimensions. Therepulsive force between the D6-branes and the D0-branes is understood throughthe centrifugal barrier. We discuss the implication on the stability of theD6+D0 solution.
