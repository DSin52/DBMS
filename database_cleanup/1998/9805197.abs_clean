The exact quantum $S$-matrices and conserved charges are known for affineToda field theories(ATFTs). In this note we report on a new type of bi-linearsum rules of conserved quantities derived from these exact $S$ matrices. Theyexist when there is a multiplicative identity among $S$-matrices of aparticular ATFT. Our results are valid for simply laced as well as non-simplylaced ATFTs. We also present a few explicit examples.
