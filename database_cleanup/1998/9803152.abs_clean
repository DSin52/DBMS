We present string-like soliton solutions of three-dimensional gravity,coupled to a compact scalar field $x^{11}$ and Kaluza-Klein reduced on acircle. These solitons carry fractional magnetic flux with respect to theKaluza-Klein gauge field. Summing over such ``Kaluza-Klein flux tubes'' isshown to imply summing over a subclass of three-dimensional topologies (Seifertmanifolds). It is also shown to imply an area law for the Wilson loop of theKaluza-Klein gauge field; the confined charge is nothing but Kaluza-Kleinmomentum. Applied to the membrane of M-theory, this is interpreted as``dynamical wrapping'' of the M-brane around its eleventh embedding dimension$x^{11}$.
