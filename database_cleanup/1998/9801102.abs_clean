We consider N=2 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma-models in two dimensionsdefined in terms of the nonminimal scalar multiplet. We compute in superspacethe one-loop beta function and show that the classical duality between thesemodels and the standard ones defined in terms of chiral superfields ismaintained at the quantum one-loop level. Our result provides an explicitapplication of the recently proposed quantization of the nonminimal scalarmultiplet via the Batalin-Vilkovisky procedure.
