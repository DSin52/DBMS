We study the 5D black holes in the type IIB superstring theory compactifiedon $S^1 \times T^4$. Far from horizon, we have flat space-time. Near horizon,we have $AdS_3(BTZ black hole) \times S^3 \times T^4$. We calculate thegreybody factor of a minimally coupled scalar by replacing the originalgeometry($M_5 \times S^1 \times T^4$) by $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$. In thelow-energy scattering, it turns out that the result agrees with the greybodyfactor of the 5D black hole (or D1 + D5 branes)in the dilute gas approximation.This confirms that the $AdS$-theory($AdS_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$) contains theessential information about the bulk 5D black holes.
