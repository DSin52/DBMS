We study type IIA configurations of D4 branes and three kinds of NSfivebranes. The D4 brane world-volume has finite extent in three directions,giving rise to a two-dimensional low-energy field theory. The models havegenerically $(0,2)$ supersymmetry. We determine the rules to read off thespectrum and interactions of the field theory from the brane box configurationdata. We discuss the construction of theories with enhanced $(0,4)$, $(0,6)$and $(0,8)$ supersymmetry. Using T-duality along the directions in which the D4branes are finite, the configuration can be mapped to D1 branes at$\IC^4/\Gamma$ singularities, with $\Gamma$ an abelian subgroup of SU(4). Thisprovides a rederivation of the rules in the brane box model. The enhancement ofsupersymmetry has a nice geometrical interpretation in the singularity picturein terms of the holonomy group of the four-fold singularity.
