We report on an attempt to solve the gauge hierarchy problem in the frameworkof higher dimensional gauge theories. Both classical Higgs mass andquadratically divergent quantum correction to the mass are argued to vanish.Hence the hierarchy problem in its original sense is solved. The remainingfinite mass correction is shown to depend crucially on the choice of boundarycondition for matter fields, and a way to fix it dynamically is presented. Wealso point out that on the simply-connected space $S^2$ even the finite masscorrection vanishes.
