A remarkable feature of the models with interactions exhibiting higher-spin(HS) gauge symmetries in $d>2$ is that their most symmetric vacua require(anti)-de Sitter (AdS) geometry rather than the flat one. In strikingparallelism to what might be expected of M theory HS gauge theories describeinfinite towers of fields of all spins and possess naturally space-time SUSYand Chan-Paton type inner symmetries. In this paper, we analyze at the level ofthe equations of motion the simplest non-trivial HS model which describes HSgauge interactions (on the top of the usual supergravitational and(Chern-Simons) Yang-Mills interactions) of massive spin-0 and spin-1/2 matterfields in d=2+1 AdS space-time. The parameter of mass of the matter fields isidentified with the vev of a certain auxiliary field in the model. The matterfields are shown to be arranged into d3 N=2 massive hypermultiplets in certainrepresentations of $U(n)\times U(m)$ Yang-Mills gauge groups. Discretesymmetries of the full system are studied, and the related N=1 supersymmetrictruncations with O(n) and Sp(n) Yang-Mills symmetries are constructed. Thesimplicity of the model allows us to elucidate some general properties of theHS models. In particular, a new result, which can have interesting implicationsto the higher-dimensional models, is that our model is shown to admit an"integrating" flow that proves existence of a non-local B\"acklund-Nicolai-typemapping to the free system.
