We consider generic MQCD configurations with matter described by semi-infinteD4-branes and softly broken supersymmetry. We show that the matter sector doesnot introduce supersymmetry breaking parameters so that the most relevantsupersymmetry breaking operator at low energies is the gaugino mass term. Bystudying the run-away properties of these models in the decoupling limit of theadjoint matter, we argue that these softly broken MQCD configurations fail tocapture the infrared physics of QCD at scales below the gaugino mass scale.
