We consider the Matrix theory proposal describing eleven-dimensionalSchwarzschild black holes. We argue that the Newtonian potential between twoblack holes receives a genuine long range quantum gravity correction, which isfinite and can be computed from the supergravity point of view. The resultagrees with Matrix theory up to a numerical factor which we have not computed.
