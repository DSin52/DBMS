We derive the moduli space for the global symmetry in N=1 supersymmetrictheories. We show, at the generic points, it coincides with the space ofquasi-Nambu-Goldstone (QNG) bosons, which appear besides the ordinaryNambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons when global symmetry G breaks down spontaneously toits subgroup H with preserving N=1 supersymmetry. At the singular points, mostof the NG bosons change to the QNG bosons and the unbroken global symmetry isenhanced. The G-orbits parametrized by the NG bosons are the fibre at themoduli space and the singular points correspond to the point where H-orbit (inG-orbit) shrinks. We also show the low-energy effective Lagrangian is thearbitrary function of the orbit map.
