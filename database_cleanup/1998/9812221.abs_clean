Vestn.Mosk.Univ.Fiz.Astron. 54N2 (1999) 60-61Exact constant solutions of field equations in the classical nonabelian SU(2)field theory with the Chern-Simons topological mass in 2+1-dimensionalspace-time have been obtained. One-loop contributions of boson and fermionfluctuations to the gauge field energy have been calculated.
