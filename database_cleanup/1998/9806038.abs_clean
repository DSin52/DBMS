Utilizing sets of super-vector fields (derivations), explicit expressions areobtained for; (a.) the 1D, N-extended superconformal algebra, (b.) the 1D,N-extended super Virasoro algebra for N = 1, 2 and 4 and (c.) a geometricalrealization (GR) covering algebra that contains the super Virasoro algebra forarbitrary values of N. By use of such vector fileds, the super Virasoro algebrais embedded as a geometrical and model-independent structure in 1D and 2DAleph-null-extended superspace.
