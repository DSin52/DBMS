Conventional non-Abelian SO(4) gauge theory is able to describe gravityprovided the gauge field possesses a specific polarized vacuum state. In thisvacuum the instantons and anti-instantons have a preferred direction oforientation. Their orientation plays the role of the order parameter forthe polarized phase of the gauge field. The interaction of a weak and smoothgauge field with the polarized vacuum is described by an effective long-rangeaction which is identical to the Hilbert action of general relativity. In theclassical limit this action results in the Einstein equations of generalrelativity. Gravitational waves appear as the mode describing propagation ofthe gauge field which strongly interacts with the oriented instantons. TheNewton gravitational constant describes the density of the considered phase ofthe gauge field. The radius of the instantons under consideration is comparablewith the Planck radius.
