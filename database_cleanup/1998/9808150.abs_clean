We study two-dimensional classically integrable field theory with independentboundary condition on each end, and obtain three possible generating functionsfor integrals of motion when this model is an ultralocal one. Classicallyintegrable boundary condition can be found in solving boundary $K_{\pm}$equations. In quantum case, we also find that unitarity condition of quantum$R$- matrix is sufficient to construct commutative quantities with boundary,and its reflection equations are obtained.
