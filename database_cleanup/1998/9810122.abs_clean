Symposium on Nuclear and Particle Physics, Studenica, September 1998In a recently developed approximation technique for quantum field theory thestandard one-loop result is used as a seed for a recursive formula that gives asequence of improved Gaussian approximations for the generating functional. Inthis paper we work with the generic $\phi^3+\phi^4$ model in $d=0$ dimensions.We compare the first, and simplest, approximation in the above sequence withthe one-loop and two-loop approximations, as well as the exact results(calculated numericaly).
