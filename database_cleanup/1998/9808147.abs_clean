Generalized matter couplings to four-dimensional supersymmetric sigma modelson general Kaehler manifolds are presented, preserving all holomorphicsymmetries. Our generalization allows assignment of arbitrary U(1) charges toadditional matter fermions, in all representations of (the holomorphic part of)the isometry group. This can be used to eliminate unwanted gamma_5 anomalies,in particular for the U(1) symmetry arising from the complex structure of thetarget space. A consistent gauging of this isometry group, or any of itssubgroups, then becomes possible. When gauged in the presence of a chiralscalar multiplet, the U(1) symmetry is broken spontaneously, generating a massfor the U(1) vector multiplet via the supersymmetric Higgs effect. As anexample we discuss the case of the homogeneous coset space E6/SO(10) x U(1).
