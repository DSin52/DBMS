We use type IIB brane configurations which were recently suggested by Hananyand Zaffaroni to study four dimensional N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories. Wecalculate the one loop beta function and realize Seiberg's duality using aparticular configuration. We also comment on the anomaly cancelation conditionin the case of chiral theories and the beta function in the case of chiral andSO/Sp theories.
