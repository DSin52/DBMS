An Abelian gauge model, with vector and 2-form potential fields linked by atopological mass term that mixes the two Abelian factors, is shown to exhibitDirac-like magnetic monopoles in the presence of a matter background. Inaddition, considering a "non-minimal coupling" between the fermions and thetensor field, we obtain a generalised quantisation condition that involves,among others, the mass parameter. Also, it is explicitly shown that 1_loop(finite) corrections do not shift the value of such a mass parameter.
