We study Type I string theory compactified on a T^6/Z_3 orientifold. Thelow-energy dynamics is most conveniently analyzed in terms of D3-branes. Weshow that a sector of the theory, which corresponds to placing an odd number ofD3-branes at orientifold fixed points, can give rise to an SU(5) gauge theorywith three generations of chiral matter fields. The resulting model is notfully realistic, but the relative ease with which an adequate gauge group andmatter content can be obtained is promising. The model is also of interest fromthe point of view of supersymmetry breaking. We show that, for fixed values ofthe closed string modes, the model breaks supersymmetry due to a conflictbetween a non-perturbatively generated superpotential and an anomalous U(1)D-term potential.
