We show how a theorem of Sullivan provides a precise mathematical statementof a 3d holographic principle, that is, the hyperbolic structure of a certainclass of 3d manifolds is completely determined in terms of the correspondingTeichmuller space of the boundary. We explore the consequences of this theoremin the context of the Euclidean BTZ black hole in three dimensions.
