Title: Harmonic Superspaces For Three-Dimensional Theories

Authors: B.M. Zupnik

Comments: This work is based on the talk given at the International Seminar

"Supersymmetries and Quantum Symmetries" dedicated to the memory of Prof.V.I. Ogievetsky (Dubna, July 22-26, 1997). Latex file, 8 pagesThree-dimensional field theories with N=3 and N=4 supersymmetries areconsidered in the framework of the harmonic-superspace approach. Analyticsuperspaces of these supersymmetries are similar; however, the geometry ofgauge theories with the manifest N=3 is richer and admits construction of thetopological mass term.
