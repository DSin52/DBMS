based on conference talks. a reference addedWe give a short introduction to and a partial review of the work on thecalculation of Wilson loops and $Q\bar Q$-potentials via the conjecturedAdS/CFT duality. Included is a discussion of the relative weight of the stringycorrection to the target space background versus the correction by the quantumfluctuations of the string world sheet.
