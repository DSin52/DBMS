We study brane configurations in the presence of orientifold six-planes.After deriving the curves for N=2 supersymmetric SU(Nc) gauge theories with oneflavor in the symmetric or antisymmetric representation and Nf fundamentalflavors, we rotate the brane configuration, reducing the supersymmetry to N=1.For the case of an antisymmetric flavor and less than two fundamental flavors,nonperturbative effects lead to a brane configuration that is topologically atorus. Using the description of the orientifold six-planes as Dn singularitieswe discuss the Higgs branches for N=2 brane configurations with Sp/SO gaugegroups and the related N=1 theories with tensor representations.
