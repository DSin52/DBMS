Low-energy, near-horizon scaling limits of black holes which lead to stringtheory on AdS_2 x S^2 are described. Unlike the higher-dimensional cases, inthe simplest approach all finite-energy excitations of AdS_2 x S^2 aresuppressed. Surviving zero-energy configurations are described. These caninclude tree-like structures in which the AdS_2 x S^2 throat branches as thehorizon is approached, as well as disconnected AdS_2 x S^2 universes. Inprinciple, the black hole entropy counts the quantum ground states on themoduli space of such configurations. In a nonsupersymmetric context AdS_D forgeneral D can be unstable against instanton-mediated fragmentation intodisconnected universes. Several examples are given.
