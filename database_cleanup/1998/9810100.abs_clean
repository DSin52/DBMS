We revisit Wigner's question about the admissible commutation relations forcoordinate and velocity operators given their equations of motion (EOM). Inmore general terms we want to consider the question of how to quantizedynamically equivalent Hamiltonian structures. A unique answer can presumablybe given in those cases, where we have a dynamical symmetry. In this casearbitrary deformations of the symmetry algebra should be dynamicallyequivalent. We illustrate this for the linear as well as the singular1d-oscillator. In the case of nonlinear EOM quantum corrections have to betaken into account. We present some examples thereof New phenomena arise incase of more then one degree of freedom, where sometimes the interaction can bedescribed either by the Hamiltonian or by nonstandard commutation relations.This may induce a noncommutative geometry (for example the 2d-oscillator in aconstant magnetic field). Also some related results from nonrelativisticquantum field theory applied to solid state physics are briefly discussedwithin this framework
