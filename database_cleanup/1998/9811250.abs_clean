I study the response of a detector that is coupled non-linearly to aquantized complex scalar field in different types of classical electromagneticbackgrounds. Assuming that the quantum field is in the vacuum state, I showthat, when in {\it inertial} motion, the detector responds {\it only} when theelectromagnetic background produces particles. However, I find that theresponse of the detector is {\it not} proportional to the number of particlesproduced by the background.
