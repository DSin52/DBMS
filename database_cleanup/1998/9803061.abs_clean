Noting that T-duality untwists S^5 to CP^2 x S^1, we construct the dualityIIA superstring on AdS_5 x CP^2 x S^1 --> M-theory on AdS_5 x CP^2 x T^2. ThisCP^2 x S^1, Type IIA supergravity has SU(3) x U(1) x U(1) x U(1) and N=0supersymmetry but Type IIA string theory has SO(6) and N=8. The missingsuperpartners are provided by stringy winding modes. We also discuss IIBcompactifications to AdS_5 with N=4, N=2 and N=0.
