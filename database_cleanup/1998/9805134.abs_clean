Title: On Superpotential and BPS domain wall in SQCD and MQCD

Authors: Tomohiro Matsuda

Comments: 16 pages, Latex, reviews extended

We examine the decoupling properties of the N=2 SQCD vacua when the adjointmass term is turned on and then the N=1 limit is taken. The BPS domain walltension in N=1 MQCD and SQCD is also examined. The correspondence of the MQCDintegrals with the superpotential and the gaugino condensate is shown.
