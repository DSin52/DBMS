Recently, a geometric model for the confinement of magnetic charges in thecontext of type II string compactifications was constructed by Greene, Morrisonand Vafa. This model assumes the existence of stable magnetic vortices withquantized flux in the low energy theory. However, quantization of flux alonedoes not imply that the vortex is stable, since the flux may not be confined toa tube of definite size. We show that in the field theoretical model whichunderlies the geometric model of confinement, static, cylindrically symmetricmagnetic vortices do not exist. While our results do not preclude the existenceof confinement in a different low-energy regime of string theory, they showthat confinement is not a universal outcome of the string picture, and itsorigin in the low energy theory remains to be understood.
