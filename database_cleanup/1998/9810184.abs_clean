The integrability of the Bukhvostov-Lipatov four-fermion model isinvestigated. It is shown that the classical model possesses a current ofLorentz spin 3, conserved both in the bulk and on the half-line for specifictypes of boundary actions. It is then established that the conservation law isspoiled at the quantum level -- a fact that might indicate that the quantumBukhvostov-Lipatov model is not integrable, contrary to what was previouslybelieved.
