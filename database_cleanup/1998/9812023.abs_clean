Considering the simple chiral fermion meson model when the chiral symmetry isexplicitly broken, we show the validity of a trace identity -- to all orders ofperturbation theory -- playing the role of a Callan-Symanzik equation and whichallows us to identify directly the breaking of dilatations with the trace ofthe energy-momentum tensor. More precisely, by coupling the quantum fieldtheory considered to a classical curved space background, represented by thenon-propagating external vielbein field, we can express the conservation of theenergy-momentum tensor through the Ward identity which characterizes theinvariance of the theory under the diffeomorphisms. Our ``Callan-Symanzikequation'' then is the anomalous Ward identity for the trace of theenergy-momentum tensor, the so-called ``trace identity''.
