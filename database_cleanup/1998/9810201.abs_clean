We formulate an extension of Maldacena's AdS/CFT conjectures to the case ofbranes located at singular points in the ambient transverse space. Forsingularities which occur at finite distance in the moduli space of M or Ftheory models with spacetime-filling branes, the conjectures identify theworldvolume theory on the p-branes with a compactification of M or IIB theoryon $AdS_{p+2} \times H^{D-p-2}$. We show how the singularity determines thehorizon H, and demonstrate the relationship between global symmetries on theworldvolume and gauge symmetries in the AdS model. As a first application, westudy some singularities relevant to the D3-branes required in four-dimensionalF-theory. For these we are able to explicitly derive the low-energy fieldtheory on the worldvolume and compare its properties to predictions from thedual AdS model. In particular, we examine the baryon spectra of the models andthe fate of the Abelian factors in the gauge group.
