and Its Applications (TFT98)Quantum field theory is constructed upon the assumption of stabilities of thevacuum and of the one-particle state. For finite temperature, the one-particlestate becomes unstable because of thermal fluctuations, whereas the thermalvacuum is still stable. In non-equilibrium situation, both the vacuum and theone-particle state lose their stability. Proposed is the introduction of the{\it reference vacuum} which takes care of thermal and non-adiabatictime-evolution of a system, and produces a time-dependent Fock's representationspace. This may provide us with an extension of the concept of {\it dynamicalmapping} where a migration among unitary inequivalent representation spaces canbe handled for non-equilibrium and dissipative systems.
