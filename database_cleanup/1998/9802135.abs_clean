Title: Hausdorff dimension, fractional spin particles and Chern-Simons

effective potentialComments: latex, 4 pages

We obtain for any spin, $s$, the Hausdorff dimension, $h_{i}$, for fractionalspin particles and we discuss the connection between this number, $h_{i}$, andthe Chern-Simons potential. We also define the topological invariants, $W_s$,in terms of the statistics of these particles.
