Title: Coset conformal field theories with abelian isotropy groups

Comments: 7 pages, Latex, misprints corrected

Conformal field theories based on $g/u(1)^d$ coset constructions where $g$ isa reductive algebra are studied.It is shown that the theories are equivalent toconstrained WZNW models for $g.$ Generators of extended symmetry algebras andprimary fields are constructed.
