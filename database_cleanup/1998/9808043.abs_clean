Using recently developed methods of character expansions we solve exactly inthe large N limit a new two-matrix model of hermitean matrices A and B with theaction S={1\over 2}(\tr A^2+\tr B^2)-{\alpha\over 4}(\tr A^4+\tr B^4)the 8-vertex model on dynamical planar graphs. The solution is parametrized ina conformal field theory with central charge c=1 coupled to 2D quantum gravity.
