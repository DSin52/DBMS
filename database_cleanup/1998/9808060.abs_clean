We use the anomaly cancellation of the M-theory fivebrane to derive theR-symmetry anomalies of the $A_{N}$ $(0,2)$ tensor-multiplet theories. Thisresult leads to a simple derivation of black hole entropy in $d=4, \CN=2$compactifications of $M$-theory. We also show how the formalism of normalbundle anomaly cancellation clarifies the Kaluza-Klein origin of Chern-Simonsterms in gauged supergravity theories. The results imply the existence ofinteresting 1/N corrections in the AdS/CFT correspondence.
