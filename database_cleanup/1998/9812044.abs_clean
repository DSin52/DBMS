We discuss the NSR formulation of the superstring action on AdS_5 X S^5proposed recently by Kallosh and Tseytlin in the Green-Schwarz formalism.Weshow that the stress-energy tensor corresponding to the NSR action for AdSsuperstring contains the branelike terms, corresponding to exotic masslessvertex operators (refered to as the branelike vertices). The correspondingsigma-model action has the manifest SO(1,3) X SO(6) invariance of superstringtheory on AdS_5 X S^5. We argue that adding the branelike terms is equivalentto curving the space-time to obtain the AdS_5 X S^5 background. We commence thestudy of the proposed NSR sigma-model by analyzing the scattering amplitudesinvolving the branelike vertex operators.The analysis shows quite an unusualmomentum dependence of these scattering amplitudes.
