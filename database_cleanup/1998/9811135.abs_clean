Authors: M. Chaves

Comments: No figures. LaTeX 2.09. 12 pages. Contribution to Nova collection of

papers on the Lorentz group (Ed. V. Dvoeglazov)Generalized Yang-Mills theories are constructed, that can use fields otherthan vector as gauge fields. Their geometric interpretation is studied. Anapplication to the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model is briefly review, and somerelated mathematical and physical considerations are made.
