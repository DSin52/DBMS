Title: On the Effective Potential for Local Composite Operators

Authors: E. V. Gorbar (Instituto de Fisica Teorica, Sao Paulo, Brazil)

Comments: 17 pages, LaTeX, the analysis of the O(N) model with finite cut-off

have been reconsidered and the corresponding important reference have beenaddedWe show that the effective potential for local composite operators is auseful object in studing dynamical symmetry breaking by calculating theeffective potential for the local composite operators $\bar{\psi} \psi$ and$\phi^2$ in the Gross-Neveu (GN) and O(N) models, respectively. Since theeffective potential for local composite operators can be calculated by usingthe Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) effective potential in theory withadditional bare mass terms, we show that divergences in the effective potentialfor local composite operators are the same as in the CJT effective potential.We compare the results obtained with the results give by the auxiliary fieldmethod.
