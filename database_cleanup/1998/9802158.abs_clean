We develop a simple scheme of quantization for the dilaton CGHS model withoutscalar fields, that uses the Gupta-Bleuler approach for the string fields. Thisis possible because the constraints can be linearized classically, due topositivity conditions that are present in the model (and not in the generalstring case). There is no ambiguity nor anomalies in the quantization. Theexpectation values of the metric and dilaton fields obey the classicalrequirements, thus exhibiting at the quantum level the Birkhoff theorem.
