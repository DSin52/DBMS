We derive superalgebras in many types of supersymmetric M-brane backgrounds.The backgrounds examined here include the cases of the M-wave and theM-Kaluza-Klein monopole. On the basis of the obtained algebras, we deduce allthe supersymmetric non-orthogonal intersections of the M-Kaluza-Klein monopoleand the M-5-brane at angles. In addition, we present a 1/4 supersymmetricworldvolume 3-brane soliton on the M-5-brane in the M-5-brane background as anextended solution of the 3-brane solitons of the M-5-brane by Howe, Lambert andWest. This soliton can be interpreted as a certain intersection of threeM-5-branes.
