We study the two-dimensional Eguchi-Kawai model as a toy model of the IIBmatrix model, which has been recently proposed as a nonperturbative definitionof the type IIB superstring theory. While the planar limit of the model isknown to reproduce the two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, we find through MonteCarlo simulation that the model allows a different large N limit, which can beconsidered as the double scaling limit in matrix models.
