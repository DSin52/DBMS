Title: Branes in N=2,D=4 sugra and the conformal field theory limit

Comments: Latex, 8 pages; added comments on corrections for the black hole

entropy coming from the near-horizon CFT; (talk given at ``31st Internat.Symp. Ahrenshoop on the Theory of Elementary Particles'' Buckow, Sept. 2-6,97)In this article we summarise the brane solutions (instantons, black holes andstrings) in 4 dimensions when embedded in N=2 supergravity. Like in 10dimensions these solutions are related by duality transformations (T-duality,c-map). For the case that the graviphoton has no magnetic charge, we discussthe conformal field theory description of the near-horizon geometry. Thedecoupling of the massless modes in the matrix limit of the M-theorycompactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold is discussed.
