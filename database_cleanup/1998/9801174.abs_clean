We show that for a string moving in a background consisting of maximallysymmetric gravity, dilaton field and second rank antisymmetric tensor field,the $O(d) \otimes O(d)$ transformation on the vacuum solutions givesinequivalent solutions that are not maximally symmetric. We then show that theusual physical meaning of maximal symmetry can be made to remain unaltered evenif torsion is present and illustrate this through two toy models by determiningthe torsion fields, the metric and Killing vectors. Finally we show that underthe $O(d) \otimes O(d)$ transformation this generalised maximal symmetry can bepreserved under certain conditions. This is interesting in the context ofstring related cosmological backgrounds.
