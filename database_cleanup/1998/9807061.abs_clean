Russia, May 17-24, 1998, 12 pages in LaTeX, 1 postscript figureThe Hamiltonian approach to the quantum field theory is considered. Sincethere are additional difficulties such as the Haag theorem and Stueckelbergdivergences, renormalization of the time-dependent dynamical quantum fieldtheory is much more complicated than renormalization of the S-matrix. It isnecessary to consider the regularized theory with ultraviolet and infraredcutoffs and impose the conditions not only on the dependence of the Hamiltonianon the cutoffs (as usual) but also on the dependence of the initial states. Ithappens that one should consider the initial states to be singulary dependenton the cutoffs in order to avoid the Stueckelberg divergences. Different typesof semiclassical approximations to quantum theory are discussed. It happensthat the method of quantizing classical solutions to field equationscorresponds not to the WKB-approach but to the complex-WKB theory. The problemof imposing conditions on the semiclassical initial states is discussed.Different prescriptions for choice of initial conditions are analysed.
