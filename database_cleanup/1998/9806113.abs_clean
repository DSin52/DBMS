We construct an action, which governs the dynamics of theBa\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole and perform the canonicalquantization. The quantum action is given by a $SL(2,R)$ Wess-Zumino-Wittenmodel on the boundary coupled to the classical anti-de Sitter background,representing a massless BTZ black hole. The coupling, determined by aone-cocyle condition, is found to give dominant contribution to the centralcharge of Virasoro algebra. The entropy of the BTZ black hole is discussed fromthe point view of the AdS/CFT correspondence and an explanation is given to thepuzzle of black hole entropy in the BTZ case. The BTZ black hole is a quantumobject and the BTZ black hole with finite mass should be considered as aquantum excitation of the massless one.
