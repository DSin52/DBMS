"Problems of Quantum Field Theory", in memory of D. I. Blokhintsev, Dubna,July 13-17, 1998We introduce a consistent gauge extension of the SL(2,R) WZNW system, definedby a difference of two simple WZNW actions. By integrating out some dynamicalvariables in the functional integral, we show that the resulting effectivetheory coincides with the induced gravity in 2D. General solutions of boththeories are found and related to each other.
