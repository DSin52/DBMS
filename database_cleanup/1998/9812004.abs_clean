We propose explicit recipes to construct the euclidean Green functions ofgauge-invariant charged, monopole and dyon fields in four-dimensional gaugetheories whose phase diagram contains phases with deconfined electric and/ormagnetic charges. In theories with only either abelian electric or magneticcharges, our construction is an euclidean version of Dirac's original proposal,the magnetic dual of his proposal, respectively. Rigorous mathematical controlis achieved for a class of abelian lattice theories. In theories where electricand magnetic charges coexist, our construction of Green functions ofelectrically or magnetically charged fields involves taking an average overMandelstam strings or the dual magnetic flux tubes, in accordance with Dirac'sflux quantization condition. We apply our construction to 't Hooft-Polyakovmonopoles and Julia-Zee dyons. Connections between our construction and thesemiclassical approach are discussed.
