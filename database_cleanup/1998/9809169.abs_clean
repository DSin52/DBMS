In this paper, the dependence of the Einstein gravity with the cosmologicalconstant as well as of this theory in the first-order formalism on the gaugeand parametrization is been analyzed. The one-loop counterterms off the massshell have been plainly calculated in arbitrary gauge and parametrization. Thetensor package of analytic calculations, written in REDUCE, allowed all thecalculations to be carried out. A method of renormalization group functionscalculations off shell is discussed.
