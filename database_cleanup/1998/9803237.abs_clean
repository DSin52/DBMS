Renormalization group transformations for Schr\"odinger equation areperformed in $\phi^4$ and in Yang-Mills theories. The dependence of the groundstate wave functional on rapidly oscillating fields is found. For Yang-Millstheory, this dependence restricts a possible form of variational ansatzcompatible with asymptotic freedom.
