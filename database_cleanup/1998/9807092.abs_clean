We propose a new systematic approach that allows one to derive the spin foam(state sum) model of a theory starting from the corresponding classical actionfunctional. It can be applied to any theory whose action can be written as thatof the BF theory plus a functional of the B field. Examples of such theoriesinclude BF theories with or without cosmological term, Yang-Mills theories andgravity in various spacetime dimensions. Our main idea is two-fold. First, wepropose to take into account in the path integral certain distributionalconfigurations of the B field in which it is concentrated along lowerdimensional hypersurfaces in spacetime. Second, using the notion of generatingfunctional we develop perturbation expansion techniques, with the role of thefree theory played by the BF theory. We test our approach on various theoriesfor which the corresponding spin foam (state sum) models are known. We findthat it exactly reproduces the known models for BF and 2D Yang-Mills theories.For the BF theory with cosmological term in 3 and 4 dimensions we calculate theterms of the transition amplitude that are of the first order in thecosmological constant, and find an agreement with the corresponding first orderterms of the known state sum models. We discuss implications of our results forexisting quantum gravity models.
