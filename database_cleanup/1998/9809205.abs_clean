Title: On the $\Theta$-term in electrodynamics

Authors: Pawel O. Mazur and Andrzej Staruszkiewicz

Comments: 6 pages

The term $\Theta\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma}$, whenadded to the electromagnetic Lagrangian $-{1\over 16\pi}F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}$,does not change the signature of the Lagrangian. Actually, it increases thepart with negative kinetic energy term at the spatial infinity. For this reasonit does not change the conclusion, that at the spatial infinity the magneticpart of the electromagnetic field should be absent.
