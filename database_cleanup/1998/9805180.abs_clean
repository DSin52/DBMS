U-duality p-branes in toroidally compactified type II superstring theories inspace-time dimensions $10 > D \ge 4$ can be constructed explicitly based on theconjectured U-duality symmetries and the corresponding known single-chargesuper p-brane configurations. As concrete examples, we first constructexplicitly the $SL(3, Z)$ superstrings and $SL(3, Z) \times SL(2, Z)$ 0-branesas well as their corresponding magnetic duals in $D = 8$. For the $SL(3, Z)$superstrings (3-branes), each of them is characterized by a triplet of integerscorresponding to the electric-like (magnetic-like) charges associated with thethree 2-form gauge potentials present in the theory. For the $SL(3, Z)\timesSL(2,Z)$ 0-branes (4-branes), each of them is labelled by a pair of triplets ofintegers corresponding to the electric-like (magnetic-like) charges associatedwith the two sets of three 1-form gauge potentials. The string (3-brane)tension and central charge are shown to be given by $SL(3, Z)$ invariantexpressions. It is argued that when any two of the three integers in theintegral triplet are relatively prime to each other, the corresponding string(3-brane) is stable and does not decay into multiple strings (3-branes) by a`tension gap' or `charge gap' equation. Similar results hold also for the0-branes (4-branes). Alongwith the $SL(2, Z)$ dyonic membranes of Izquierdo et.al., these examples provide a further support for the conjectured $SL(3, Z)\times SL(2, Z)$ U-duality symmetry in this theory. Moreover, the study ofthese examples along with the previous ones provides us a recipe forconstructing the U-duality p-branes of various supergravity theories in diversedimensions. Constructions for these U-duality p-branes are also given.
