The generalized Weierstrass representation for surfaces in $\Bbb{R}^{3}$ isused to study quantum effects for strings governed by Polyakov-Nambu-Gotoaction. Correlators of primary fields are calculated exactly in one-loopapproximation for the pure extrinsic Polyakov action. Geometrical meaning ofinfrared singularity is discussed. The Nambu-Goto and spontaneous curvatureactions are treated perturbatively.
