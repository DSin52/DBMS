A set of non-supersymmetric minimal area embeddings of an M-theory 5-braneare considered. The field theories on the surface of the 5-brane have the fieldcontent of N=2 SQCD with fundamental representation matter fields. By suitablechoice of curve parameters the N=2 and N=1 superpartners may be decoupledleaving a semi-classical approximation to QCD with massive quarks. Assupersymmetry breaking is introduced a quark condensate grows breaking the lowenergy $Z_{F}$ flavour symmetry. At $\theta =$ (odd) $\pi$ spontaneous CPviolation is observed consistent with that of the QCD chiral lagrangian.
