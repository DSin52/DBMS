We study the duality relationship between M-theory and heterotic stringtheory at the classical level, emphasising the transformations between theKaluza-Klein reductions of these two theories on the K3 and T^3 manifolds.Particular attention is devoted to the corresponding structures of sigma-modelcosets and the correspondence between the p-brane charge lattices. We alsopresent simple and detailed derivations of the global symmetries and cosetstructures of the toroidally-compactified heterotic theory in all dimensions D\ge 3, making use of the formalism of solvable Lie algebras.
