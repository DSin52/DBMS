Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B444 (1998) 474

We derive the spherical field formalism for fermions. We find that thespherical field method is free from certain difficulties which complicatelattice calculations, such as fermion doubling, missing axial anomalies, andcomputational problems regarding internal fermion loops.
