Title: Taniguchi Lecture on Principal Bundles on Elliptic Fibrations

Authors: Ron Y. Donagi

Comments: 17 pages, Latex

In this talk we discuss the description of the moduli space of principalG-bundles on an elliptic fibration X-->S in terms of cameral covers and theirdistinguished Prym varieties. We emphasize the close relationship between thisproblem and the integrability of Hitchin's system and its generalizations. Thediscussion roughly parallels that of [D2], but additional examples are includedand some important steps of the argument are illustrated. Some of theapplications to heterotic/F-theory duality were described in the accompanyingICMP talk (hep-th/9802093).
