In asymptotically flat space a rotating black hole cannot be in thermodynamicequilibrium because the thermal radiation would have to be co-rotating fasterthan light far from the black hole. However in asymptotically anti-de Sitterspace such equilibrium is possible for certain ranges of the parameters. Weexamine the relationship between conformal field theory in rotating Einsteinuniverses of dimensions two to four and Kerr anti-de Sitter black holes indimensions three to five. The five dimensional solution is new. We find similardivergences in the partition function of the conformal field theory and theaction of the black hole at the critical angular velocity at which the Einsteinrotates at the speed of light. This should be an interesting limit in which tostudy large $N$ Yang-Mills.
