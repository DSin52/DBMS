U(1) gauge theory with the Villain action on a cubic lattice approximation ofthree- and four-dimensional torus is considered. The naturally chosencorrelation functions converge to the correlation functions of the R-gaugeelectrodynamics on three- and four-dimensional torus as the lattice spacingapproaches zero only for the special scaling. This special scaling depends on achoice of a correlation function system. Another scalings give the degeneratecontinuum limits. The Wilson criterion for the confinement is ambiguous. Theasymptotics of the smeared Wilson loop integral for the large loop perimetersis defined by the density of the loop smearing over a torus which istransversal to the loop plane. When the initial torus radius tends to infinitythe correlation functions converge to the correlation functions of theR-gauge Euclidean electrodynamics.
