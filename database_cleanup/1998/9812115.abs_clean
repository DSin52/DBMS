We demonstrate that certain Virasoro characters (and their linearcombinations) in minimal and non-minimal conformal models which admitfactorized forms are manifestly related to the ADE series. This permits toextract quasi-particle spectra of a Lie algebraic nature which resembles thefeatures of Toda field theory. These spectra possibly admit a construction interms of the $W_n$-generators. In the course of our analysis we establishinterrelations between the factorized characters related to the parafermionicmodels, the compactified boson and the minimal models.
