We study M theory on $AdS_7 \times \RP^4$ corresponding to 6 dimensionalSO(2N) $(0, 2)$ superconformal field theory on a circle which becomes 5dimensional super Yang-Mills theory at low energies. For SU(N) (0,2) theory, awrapped D4 brane on $\S^4$ which is connected to a D4 brane on the boundary of$AdS_7$ by N fundamental strings can be interpreted as baryon vertex. ForSO(2N) (0,2) theory, by using the property of homology of $\RP^4$, we classifyvarious wrapping branes. Then we consider particles, strings, twobranes, domainwalls and the baryon vertex in Type IIA string theory.
