Title: Radiation of RR states from NS Fivebranes

Authors: S. P. de Alwis

Comments: Some comments on the use of the self-consistent versus the flat

metric on the brane added. Typos corrected. 9 pages, LatexWe show that the recent observation that near extremal NS fivebranes decaydue to Hawking radiation, can be understood in terms of their coupling to RRstates which does not vanish even as the string coupling goes to zero.
