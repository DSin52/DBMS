Phase transition of decay rate from quantum tunneling to thermal activityregimes is investigated in (3+1)-dimensional field theories with symmetrybreaking term $f\phi$. By applying the two independent criteria for the sharpfirst-order transition to the same model, the upper and lower bounds ofcritical value of the symmetry breaking parameter are obtained. Unlike twodimensional case continuum states of the fluctuation operator near sphaleronsolution play an important role to determine the type of transition.
