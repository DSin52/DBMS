Recently it has been shown that antibrackets may be expressed in terms ofPoisson brackets and vice versa for commuting functions in the originalbracket. Here we also introduce generalized brackets involving higherantibrackets or higher Poisson brackets where the latter are of a new type. Wegive generating functions for these brackets for functions in arbitraryinvolutions in the original bracket. We also give master equations forgeneralized Maurer-Cartan equations. The presentation is completely symmetricwith respect to Poisson brackets and antibrackets.
