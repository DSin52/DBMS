We consider dynamics of massless particle in 2d spacetimes with constantcurvature. We analyze different examples of spacetime. Dynamical integrals areconstructed from spacetime symmetry related to $sl(2.{\bf R})$ algebra.Mass-shell condition restricts dynamical integrals to a cone (without vertex)which defines physical-phase space. We parametrize the cone by canonicalcoordinates. Canonical quantization with definite choice of operator orderingleads to unitary irreducible representations of $SO_\uparrow (2.1)$ group.
