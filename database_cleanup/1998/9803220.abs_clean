Title: Near Anti-de Sitter Geometry and Corrections to the Large N Wilson Loop

Comments: 7 pages, Latex

Within recent Maldacena's proposal to relate gauge theories in the large Nlimit to the supergravity in the AdS background and recipe for calculation theWilson loop, we compute corrections to the energy of quark/anti-quark pair inthe large N limit.
