We show that $p$-forms on $AdS_{2p+1}$ describe both singletons and masslessparticles. On the $2p$-dimensional boundary the singleton $p$-form Lagrangianreduces to the conformally invariant functional $\int F^2$. All therepresentations, singletons as well as massless, are zero center modules andinvolve a vacuum mode. Two- and three-form singleton fields are required bysupersymmetry in AdS$_5$ and AdS$_7$ supergravity respectively.
