The four six-dimensional ``little string'' theories are all described in theinfinite momentum frame (IMF) as matrix theories by non-trivial 1+1 dimensionalinfra-red fixed points. We characterize these fixed points using supergravity.Starting from the matrix theory definition of M5-branes, we derive anassociated dual supergravity description of the fixed point theories, arisingas the near horizon geometry of certain brane configurations. Thesesupergravity solutions are all smooth, and involve three dimensional Anti-deSitter space AdS_3. They therefore provide a complete description of the fixedpoint theories, and hence the IMF little string theories, if the AdS/CFTcorrespondence holds.
