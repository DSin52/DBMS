The Lagrangian relativistic direct interaction theory in the various forms ofdynamics is formulated and its connections with the Fokker-type action theoryand with the constrained Hamiltonian mechanics are established. The motion ofclassical two-particle system with relativistic direct interaction is analysedwithin the framework of isotropic forms of dynamics in the two- andfour-dimensional space-time. Some relativistic exactly solvablequantum-mechanical models are also discussed.
