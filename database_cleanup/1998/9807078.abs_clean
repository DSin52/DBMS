Interacting fields can be constructed as formal power series in the frameworkof causal perturbation theory. The local field algebra $\tilde {\cal F}({\calO})$ is obtained without performing the adiabatic limit; the (usually bad)infrared behavior plays no role. To construct the observables in gauge theorieswe use the Kugo-Ojima formalism; we define the BRST-transformation $\tilde s$as a graded derivation on the algebra of interacting fields and use theimplementation of $\tilde s$ by the Kugo-Ojima operator $Q_{\rm int}$. Sinceour treatment is local, the operator $Q_{\rm int}$ differs from thecorresponding operator $Q$ of the free theory. We prove that the Hilbert spacestructure present in the free case is stable under perturbations. Allassumptions are shown to be satisfied in QED.
