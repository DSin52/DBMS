In order to construct examples for interacting quantum field theory models,the methods of euclidean field theory turned out to be powerful tools sincethey make use of the techniques of classical statistical mechanics.Starting from an appropriate set of euclidean n-point functions (Schwingerdistributions), a Wightman theory can be reconstructed by an application of thefamous Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction theorem. This procedure (Wickrotation), which relates classical statistical mechanics and quantum fieldtheory, is, however, somewhat subtle. It relies on the analytic properties ofthe euclidean n-point functions.We shall present here a C*-algebraic version of the Osterwalder-Scharaderreconstruction theorem. We shall see that, via our reconstruction scheme, aHaag-Kastler net of bounded operators can directly be reconstructed.Our considerations also include objects, like Wilson loop variables, whichare not point-like localized objects like distributions. This point of view mayalso be helpful for constructing gauge theories.
