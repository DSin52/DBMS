Title: Trapped States and bound states of a soliton in a well

Station, Texas, USA)Comments: Latex source

SystemsThe nature of the interaction of a soliton with an attractive well iselucidated using a model of two interacting point particles. The model explainsthe existence of trapped states at positive kinetic energy, as well asreflection by an attractive impurity. The transition from a trapped solitonstate to a bound state is studied. Bound states of the soliton in a well arealso found.
