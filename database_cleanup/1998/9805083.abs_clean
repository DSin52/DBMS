branes and dualities" May 1997 ed. P. WindeyDuality symmetries of supergravity theories are powerful tools to restrictthe number of possible actions, to link different dimensions and number ofsupersymmetries and might help to control quantisation.(Hodge-Dirac-)Dualisation of gauge potentials exchanges Noether and topologicalcharges, equations of motion and Bianchi identities, internal rigid symmetriesand gauge symmetries, local transformations with nonlocal ones and mostexciting particles and waves. We compare the actions of maximally dualisedsupergravities (ie with gauge potential forms of lowest possible degree) to thenon-dualised actions coming from 11 (or 10) dimensions by plain dimensionalreduction as well as to other theories with partial dualisations. The effect onthe rigid duality group is a kind of contraction resulting from the eliminationof the unfaithful generators associated to the (inversely) dualised scalarfields. New gauge symmetries are introduced by these (un)dualisations and it isclear that a complete picture of duality (F(ull)-duality) should include allgauge symmetries at the same time as the rigid symmetries and the spacetimesymmetries. We may read off some properties of F-duality on the internal rigidaccording to the decrease of space dimension... Some recent results areincluded to suggest the way towards unification via a universal twistedself-duality (TS) structure. The analysis of this structure had revealedseveral profound differences according to the parity mod 4 of the dimension ofspacetime (to be contrasted with the (Bott) period 8 of spinor properties).
