Title: Higgs Mechanism in Nontrivial Background

Comments: RevTeX, 6 pages, no figures, revised version

The modification of classical dynamics of abelian confining theory by virtueof quantum Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen strings is discussed taking D=4 abelianHiggs model as an example. The form of string corrections to the Wilson loopcorrelators, gauge boson propagator, effective potential is presented andpossible relations to abelian projected QCD are outlined.
