RevTeXWe present a ``toy'' model for breaking supersymmetric gauge theories at theeffective Lagrangian level. We show that it is possible to achieve thedecoupling of gluinos and squarks, below a given supersymmetry breaking scalem, in the fundamental theory for super QCD once a suitable choice ofsupersymmetry breaking terms is made. A key feature of the model is thedescription of the ordinary QCD degrees of freedom via the auxiliary fields ofthe supersymmetric effective Lagrangian. Once the anomaly induced effective QCDmeson potential is deduced we also suggest a decoupling procedure, when aflavored quark becomes massive, which mimics the one employed by Seiberg forsupersymmetric theories. It is seen that, after quark decoupling, the QCDpotential naturally converts to the one with one less flavor. Finally weinvestigate the N_c and N_f dependence of the \eta^{\prime} mass.
