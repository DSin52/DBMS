Title: Some Functional Solutions of the Yang-Baxter Equation

Authors: D.Ts. Stoyanov

Comments: 15 pages, LaTeX

A general functional definition of the infinite dimensional quantum R-matrixsatisfying the Yang-Baxter equation is given. A procedure for extracting afinite dimensional R-matrix from the general definition is demonstrated for theparticular cases of the group O(2) and of the group of translations.
