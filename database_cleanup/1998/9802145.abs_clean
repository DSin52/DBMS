Title: Continuous Constructive Fermionic Renormalization

Ecole Polytechnique, France)Comments: 63 pages, 23 figures, LateX file. version 2

IV.3.4 and IV.3.5, 2 figures added and some typos correctedWe build the two dimensional Gross-Neveu model by a new method which requiresneither cluster expansion nor discretization of phase-space. It simplyreorganizes the perturbative series in terms of trees. With this method we canfor the first time define non perturbatively the renormalization groupdifferential equations of the model and at the same time construct explicitlytheir solution.
