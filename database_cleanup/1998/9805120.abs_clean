El NaschieWe discuss the treatment of quantum-gravitational fluctuations in thespace-time background as an `environment', using the formalism for openquantum-mechanical systems, which leads to a microscopic arrow of time. Afterreviewing briefly the open-system formalism, and the motivations for treatingquantum gravity as an `environment', we present an example from generalrelativity and a general framework based on non-critical strings, with aLiouville field that we identify with time. We illustrate this approach withcalculations in the contexts of two-dimensional models and $D$ branes. Finally,some prospects for observational tests of these ideas are mentioned.
