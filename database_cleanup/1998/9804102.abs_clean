The target space M for the sigma-model appearing in theories with p-branes isconsidered. It is proved that M is a homogeneous space G/H. It is symmetric ifand only if the U-vectors governing the sigma-model metric are eithercoinciding or mutually orthogonal. For nonzero noncoinciding U-vectors theKilling equations are solved. Using a block-orthogonal decomposition of the setof the U-vectors it is shown that under rather general assumptions the algebraof Killing vectors is a direct sum of several copies of sl(2,R) algebras(corresponding to 1-vector blocks), several solvable Lie algebras(corresponding to multivector blocks) and the Killing algebra of a flat space.The target space manifold is decomposed in a product of a flat space, several2-dimensional spaces of constant curvature (e.g. Lobachevsky space, part ofanti-de Sitter space) and several solvable Lie group manifolds.
