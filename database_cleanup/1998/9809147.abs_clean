In string theory, the brane world scenario, where the Standard Model gaugeand matter fields live inside some branes while gravitons live in the bulk, canbe a viable description of our universe. In this note we argue that the braneworld actually is a likely description of nature. Our discussion includes arevisit of certain issues, namely, coupling unification, dilaton stabilizationand supersymmetry breaking, in the context of the brane world scenario. Inparticular, we discuss various possible string scenarios and theirphenomenological implications in the brane world framework.
