We study the compactification of the $(2,0)$ and type-II little-stringtheories on $S^1$, $T^2$ and $T^3$ with an R-symmetry twist that preserves halfthe supersymmetry. We argue that it produces the same moduli spaces of vacua ascompactification of the $(1,0)$ theory with $E_8$ Wilson lines given by amaximal embedding of SU(2). In certain limits, this reproduces the moduli spaceof SU(2) with a massive adjoint hyper-multiplet. In the type-II little-stringtheory case, we observe a peculiar phase transition where the strings condense.We conjecture a generalization to more than two 5-branes which involvesinstantons on non-commutative $T^4$. We conclude with open questions.
