Spinning black three-branes in type IIB supergravity are thermodynamicallystable up to a critical value of the angular momentum density. Inside theregion of thermodynamic stability, the free energy from supergravity is roughlyreproduced by a naive model based on free N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory on theworld-volume. The field theory model correctly predicts a limit on angularmomentum density, but near this limit it does not reproduce the criticalexponents one can compute from supergravity. Analogies with Bose condensationand modified matrix models are discussed, and a mean field theory improvementof the naive model is suggested which corrects the critical exponents.
