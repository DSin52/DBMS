Noncommutative torus compactification of Matrix model is shown to be a directconsequence of quantization of the open strings attached to a D-membrane with anon-vanishing background $B$ field. We calculate the BPS spectrum of such abrane system using both string theory results and DBI action. The DBI actionleads to a new transformation property of the compactification radii under the$SL(2,Z)_N$ transformations.
