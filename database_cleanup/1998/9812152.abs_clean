"Quantum Aspects of Gauge Theories, Supersymmetry and Unification", Corfu(Greece), 20-26 September 1998. Eq. (12) and numerical factors in eqs. (13)and (16) corrected; some minor changes and references addedWe give, in the framework of the bosonic string theory, simple prescriptionsfor computing, at tree and one-loop levels, off-shell string amplitudes foropen and closed string massless states. In particular we obtain a treeamplitude for three open strings that in the field theory limit coincides withthe three-gluon vertex in the usual covariant gauge and two-string one-loopamplitudes satisfying the property of transversality.
