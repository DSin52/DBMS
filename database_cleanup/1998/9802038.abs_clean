The Barut--Zanghi (BZ) theory can be regarded as the most satisfactorypicture of a classical spinning electron and constitutes a natural "classicallimit" of the Dirac equation. The BZ model has been analytically studied insome previous papers of ours in the case of free particles. By contrast, inthis letter we consider the case of external fields, and a previously foundequation of the motion is generalized for a non-free spin-1/2 particle. In theimportant case of a spinning charge in a uniform magnetic field, we find thatits angular velocity (along its circular orbit around the magnetic fielddirection) is slightly different from the classical "cyclotron frequency" eH/mwhich is expected to hold for spinless charges. As a matter of fact, theangular velocity results to depend on the spin orientation. As a consequence,the electrons with magnetic moment mu parallel to the magnetic field do rotatewith a frequency greater than that of electrons endowed with mu antiparallel to
