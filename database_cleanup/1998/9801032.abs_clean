We study the holomorphic properties of the MQCD by comparing thesuper-potentials in MQCD and the gauge theory. First we show that thesuper-potential defined as an integral of three form is NOT appropriate forgeneric situation with quarks. We report a resolution of the problem whichworks for the brane configurations of 90 degree rotation, including the trueSQCD. The new definition does not need auxiliary surface and can be reduced toa contour integral for some cases. We find relation beetween the new and olddefinitions, which is verified by explicit calculation for SU(N), SO(N), Sp(N)simple groups with $F$ of massive quarks.
