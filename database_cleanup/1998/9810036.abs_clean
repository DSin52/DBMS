Title: Regge-Liouville action from group theory

Comments: 4 pages LaTeX, to appear in the proceedings of ``Path Integrals from

peV to TeV'', Florence-Italy, August 25-29, 1998We work out the constraints imposed by SL(2C) invariance for sphere topologyand modular invariance for torus topology, on the discretized form of Liouvilleaction in Polyakov's non local covariant form. These are sufficient tocompletely fix the discretized action except for the overall normalizationconstant and a term which in the continuum limit goes over to a topologicalinvariant. The treatment can be extended to the supersymmetric case.
