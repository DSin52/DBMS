We prove that certain nonequilibrium expectation values in the boundarysine-Gordon model coincide with associated equilibrium-state expectation valuesin the systems which differ from the boundary sine-Gordon in that certain extraboundary degrees of freedom (q-oscillators) are added. Applications of thisresult to actual calculation of nonequilibrium characteristics of the boundarysine-Gordon model are also discussed.
