Ogievetski, Dubna, July, 1997. To be published in the ProceedingsWe consider the nilpotent additions to classical trajectories insupersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric theories. The condition of anilpotence ofaction on some generalized solutions leads to the Witten supersymmetricLagrangian. The condition of anilpotence of topological charge is the same asone of superpotential with spontaneous broken supersymmetry. We should vanishhalf of Grassmann constants of integration, because in this case only we obtainthe same number of normalized bosonic and fermionic zero modes.
