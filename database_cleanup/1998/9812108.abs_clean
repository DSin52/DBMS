In this letter we implement a recently proposed {\it spacetime duality}approach to dualize a two dimensional, Abelian, gauge field theory, which hasno dual version under $p$--duality. Our result suggests that spacetime dualityspans a new, wider, class of dual theories, which cannot be related one toanother by $p$--duality transformations.
