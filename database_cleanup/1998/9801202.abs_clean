The covariant field equations of ten-dimensional super D-branes are obtainedby considering fundamental strings whose ends lie in the superworldsurface ofthe D-brane. By considering in a similar fashion Dp-branes ending onD(p+2)-branes we derive equations describing D-branes with dual potentials, aswell as the vector potentials.
