We study the Born-Infeld D-brane action in the limit when the string couplinggoes to infinity. The resulting actions is presented in an arbitrary backgroundand shown to describe a foliation of the world-volume by strings. Using arecently developed ``degenerate'' supergravity the parton picture is shown tobe applicable also to supersymmetric D-branes.
