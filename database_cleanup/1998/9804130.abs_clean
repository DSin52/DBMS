We study the quantum mechanics of a system of topologically interactingparticles in 2+1 dimensions, which is described by coupling the particles to aChern-Simons gauge field of an inhomogeneous group. Analysis of the phase spaceshows that for the particular case of ISO(3) Chern-Simons theory the underlyingsymmetry is that of the quantum double D(SU(2)), based on the homogeneous partof the gauge group. This in contrast to the usual q-deformed gauge groupitself, which occurs in the case of a homogeneous gauge group. Subsequently, wedescribe the structure of the quantum double of a continuous group and theclassification of its unitary irreducible representations. The comultiplicationand the R-element of the quantum double allow for a natural description of thefusion properties and the nonabelian braid statistics of the particles. Thesetypically manifest themselves in generalised Aharonov-Bohm scatteringprocesses, for which we compute the differential cross sections. Finally, webriefly describe the structure of D(SO(2,1)), the underlying quantum doublesymmetry of (2+1)-dimensional quantum gravity.
