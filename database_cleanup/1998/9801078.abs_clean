We consider N=1 supersymmetric QCD based on the G_2 gauge group and including3 chiral matter 7-plets. In that case, the gauge symmetry is broken completelyand the instanton-generated superpotential on the classical moduli space ispresent. If the theory involves the Yukawa term, there are six chirallyasymmetric vacua. In the limit when the Yukawa coupling vanishes, two of thevacua run away to infinity and only 4 asymmetric vacuum states are left.Besides, a chirally symmetric state is always present. We consider also an O(7)model with 4 chiral multiplets in spinor representation. In that case, thereare 4 extra "virtual vacua" dwelling at infinity of the moduli space. In anon-renormalizable theory involving a quartic term in the superpotential, theyshow up at finite moduli values.
