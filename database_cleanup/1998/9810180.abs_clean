We study aspects of the new phases of M-theory recently conjectured usinggeneralised dualities such as timelike T-duality. Our focus is on branesolutions. We derive the intersection rules in a general framework and thenspecialise to the new phases of M-theory. We discuss under which conditions aconfiguration with several branes leads to a regular extremal black hole undercompactification. We point out that the entropy seems not to be constant whenthe radius of the physical timelike direction is varied. This could beinterpreted as a non-conservation of the entropy (and the mass) under at leastsome of the new dualities.
