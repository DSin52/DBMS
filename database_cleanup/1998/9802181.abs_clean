The usual proof of renormalizability using the Callan-Symanzik equation makesexplicit use of normalization conditions. It is shown that demanding that therenormalization group functions take the form required for minimal subtractionallows one to prove renormalizability using the Callan-Symanzik equation,without imposing normalization conditions. Scalar field theory and quantumelectrodynamics are treated.
