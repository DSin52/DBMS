We point out that the recent conjecture relating large N gauge theories tostring theory in anti-de Sitter spaces offers a resolution in principle of manyproblems in black hole physics. This is because the gauge theory also describesspacetimes which are not anti-de Sitter, and include black hole horizons andcurvature singularities.
