We show that only by performing generalized dimensional reductions allpossible brane configurations are taken into account and one gets the completelower-dimensional theory. We apply this idea to the reduction of type IIBsupergravity in an SL(2,R)-covariant way and establish T duality for the typeII superstring effective action in the context of generalized dimensionalreduction giving the corresponding generalized Buscher's T duality rules. Thefull (generalized) dimensional reduction involves all the S duals ofconstitute an SL(2,Z) triplet. Their presence induces the appearance of thetriplet of masses of the 9-dimensional theory. The T duals, including a``KK-8A-brane'', which must have a compact transverse dimension have to beconsidered in the type IIA side. Compactification of 11-dimensionalKK-9M-branes (a.k.a. M-9-branes) on the compact transverse dimension giveD-8-branes while compactification on a worldvolume dimension givesKK-8A-branes. The presence of these KK-monopole-type objects breaks translationinvariance and two of them given rise to an SL(2,R)-covariant ``massive11-dimensional supergravity'' whose reduction gives the massive 9-dimensionaltype II theories.
