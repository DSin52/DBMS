The effective potential in the model introduced byBuchbinder-Inagaki-Odintsov (BIO) which represents SUSY NJL model non-minimallycoupled with the external gravitational field is found. The topology of thespace is considered to be non-trivial. Chiral symmetry breaking under theaction of external curvature and non-trivial topology is investigated.
