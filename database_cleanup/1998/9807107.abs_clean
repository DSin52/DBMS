Title: Matroid Theory and Supergravity

Comments: 8 pages, Revtex, to appear in Rev. Mex. Fis. 1998

In this work, we consider matroid theory. After presenting three different(but equivalent) definitions of matroids, we mention some of the most importanttheorems of such theory. In particular, we note that every matroid has a dualmatroid and that a matroid is regular if and only if it is binary and includesno Fano matroid or its dual. We show a connection between this last theorem andoctonions which at the same time, as it is known, are related to the Englert'ssolution of D = 11 supergravity. Specifically, we find a relation between thedual of Fano matroid and D = 11 supergravity. Possible applications to M-theoryare speculated upon.
