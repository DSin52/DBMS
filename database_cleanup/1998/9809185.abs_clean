The inhomogeneities associated with massless Kalb-Ramond axions can beamplified not only in isotropic (four-dimensional) string cosmological modelsbut also in the fully anisotropic case. If the background geometry isisotropic, the axions (which are not part of the homogeneous background)develop, outside the horizon, growing modes leading, ultimately, to logarithmicenergy spectra which are "red" in frequency and increase at large distancescales. We show that this conclusion can be evaded not only in the case ofhigher dimensional backgrounds with contracting internal dimensions but also inthe case of string cosmological scenarios which are completely anisotropic infour dimensions. In this case the logarithmic energy spectra turn out to be"blue" in frequency and, consequently, decreasing at large distance scales. Weelaborate on anisotropic dilaton-driven models and we argue that, incidentally,the background models leading to (or flat) logarithmic energy spectra foraxionic fluctuations are likely to be isotropized by the effect of stringtension corrections.
