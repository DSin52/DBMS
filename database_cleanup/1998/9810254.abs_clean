In this paper we discuss the strong coupling limit of chiral N=1supersymmetric gauge theory via their embedding into M-theory. In particular wefocus on the brane box models of Hanany and Zaffaroni and show that after aT-duality transformation their M-theory embedding is described bysupersymmetric 3-cycles; its geometry will encode the holomorphicnon-perturbative information about the gauge theory.
