New forms of Born-Infeld, D-brane and M theory five-brane actions are foundwhich are quadratic in the abelian field strength. The gauge fields couple bothto a background or induced metric and a new auxiliary metric, whose eliminationreproduces the non-polynomial Born-Infeld action. This is similar to theintroduction of an auxiliary metric to simplify the Nambu-Goto string action.This simplifies the quantisation and dualisation of the gauge fields.
