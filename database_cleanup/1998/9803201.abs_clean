We show for any oriented surface, possibly with a boundary, how to generalizeKramers-Wannier duality to the world of quantum groups. The generalization ismotivated by quantization of Poisson-Lie T-duality from the string theory.Cohomologies with quantum coefficients are defined for surfaces and theirmeaning is revealed. They are functorial with respect to some glueingoperations and connected with q-invariants of 3-folds.
