We employ the LSZ reduction formula for Matrix Theory introduced in ourearlier work to compute the t-pole S-matrix for three form-three formscattering. The result agrees completely with tree level D=11 SUGRA. Takentogether with previous results on graviton-graviton scattering this shows thatMatrix Theory indeed reproduces the bosonic sector of the D=11 SUGRA actionincluding the Chern-Simons term. Furthermore we provide a detailed account ofour framework along with the technology to compute any Matrix Theory one-loopt-pole scattering amplitude at vanishing p^- exchange.
