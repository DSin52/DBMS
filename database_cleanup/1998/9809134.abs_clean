The quantization of charged matter system coupled to Chern-Simons gaugefields is analyzed in a covariant gauge fixing, and gauge invariant physicalanyon operators satisfying fractional statistics are constructed in a symmetricphase, based on Dirac's recipe performed on QED. This method provides us adefinite way of identifying physical spectrums free from gauge ambiguity andconstructing physical anyon operators under a covariant gauge fixing. We thenanalyze the statistical spin phase transition in a symmetry-broken phase andshow that the Higgs mechanism transmutes an anyon satisfying fractionalstatistics into a canonical boson, a spin 0 Higgs boson or a topologicallymassive photon.
