We work out the relation between automorphic forms on SO(s+2,2) and gaugeone-loop corrections of heterotic K3 x T^2 string compactifications for thecases s=0,1. We find that one-loop gauge corrections of any orbifold limit ofK3 can always be expressed by their instanton numbers and generic automorphicforms.These functions classify also one-loop gauge thresholds of N=1 (0,2)heterotic compactifications based on toroidal orbifolds T^6/Z_N. We comparethese results with the gauge couplings of M-theory compactified on S^1/Z_2 xT^6/Z_N using Witten's Calabi-Yau strong coupling expansion.
