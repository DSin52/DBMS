It is shown that in general the energy ${\cal E}$ and the Hamiltonian ${\calH}$ of matter fields on the black hole exterior play different roles. ${\calH}$ is a generator of the time evolution along the Killing time while ${\calE}$ enters the first law of black hole thermodynamics. For non-minimallycoupled fields the difference ${\cal H}-{\cal E}$ is not zero and is a Noethercharge $Q$ analogous to that introduced by Wald to define the black holeentropy. If fields vanish at the spatial boundary, $Q$ is reduced to anintegral over the horizon. The analysis is carried out and an explicitexpression for $Q$ is found for general diffeomorphism invariant theories. Asan extension of the results by Wald et al, the first law of black holethermodynamics is derived for arbitrary weak matter fields.
