Variational calculations using Gaussian wave functionals combined with anapproximate projection on gauge invariant states are presented. We find thatthe energy exhibits a minimum for a wave functional centered around a nonvanishing background magnetic field. We show that divergences can be removed bya renormalization of the coupling constant. The resulting expectation value ofthe gluon condensate is found to be in qualitative agreement withphenomenological estimates.
