We identify the two dimensional AdS subsupergroup $OSp(16/2,R)$ of theM-theory supergroup $OSp(1/32,R)$ which captures the dynamics of $n$$D0$-branes in the large $n$ limit of Matrix theory. The $Sp(2,R)$ factor inthe even subgroup $SO(16) \times Sp(2,R)$ of $OSp(16/2,R)$ corresponds to theAdS extension of the Poincare symmetry of the longitudinal directions. Theinfinite number of $D0$-branes with ever increasing and quantized values oflongitudinal momenta are identified with the Fourier modes of the singletonsupermultiplets of $OSp(16/2,R)$,which consist of 128 bosons and 128 fermions.The large $n$ limit of N=16 U(n) Yang-Mills quantum mechanics which describesMatrix theory is a conformally invariant N=16 singleton quantum mechanicsliving on the boundary of $AdS_{2}$. We also review some of the earlier resultson the spectra of Kaluza-Klein supergravity theories in relation to the recentconjecture of Maldacena relating the dynamics of $n$ $Dp$-branes to certain AdSsupergravity theories. We point out the remarkable parallel between theconjecture of Maldacena and the construction of the spectra of $11-d$ and type$IIB$ supergravity theories compactified over various spheres in terms ofsingleton or doubleton supermultiplets of corresponding AdS supergroups.
