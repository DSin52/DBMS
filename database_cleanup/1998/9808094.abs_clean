3d Chern-Simons gauge theory has a strong connection with 2d CFT and linkinvariants in knot theory. We impose some constraints on the $D(2|1;\alpha)$ CStheory in the similar context of the hamiltonian reduction of 2d superconformalalgebras. There Hilbert states in $D(2|1;\alpha)$ CS theory are partlyidentified with characters of the large N=4 SCFT by their transformationproperties.
