Title: On Harmonic Superspace

Authors: P.S. Howe

Comments: 8 pages. Contribution to the seminar "Supersymmetries and Quantum

Symmetries" in honour of Prof. V.I. Ogievetsky, Dubna 1997A short survey of some aspects of harmonic superspace is given. Inparticular, the $d=3, N=8$ scalar supermultiplet and the $d=6, N=(2,0)$ tensormultiplet are described as analytic superfields in appropriately definedharmonic superspaces.
