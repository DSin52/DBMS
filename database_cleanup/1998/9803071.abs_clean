We study the logarithmic superconformal field theories. Explicitly, thetwo-point functions of N=1 logarithmic superconformal field theories (LSCFT)when the Jordan blocks are two (or more) dimensional, and when there are one(or more) Jordan block(s) have been obtained. Using the well known three-pointfuctions of N=1 superconformal field theory (SCFT), three-point functions ofN=1 LSCFT are obtained. The general form of N=1 SCFT's four-point functions isalso obtained, from which one can easily calculate four-point functions in N=1LSCFT.
