Title: Auxiliary fields rescaling in higher-derivative supergravity

Comments: 17 pages LateX file, no figures

We study higher--derivative supergravity with curvature squared terms indifferent bases. Performing a Weyl rescaling only on the metric or on all thesuperfield components does not allow to obtain a normalized kinetic Einsteinterm from a $\cR+\cR^2$ theory. It is necessary to combine a Legendretransformation and a Weyl rescaling on a $\cR+\cR^2$ theory to arrive at atheory of supergravity coupled to matter. This mechanism is applied tosupergravity coupled to a general function $k(R,\BR,\Phi,\bar\Phi)$, where $R$is one of the supergravity chiral superfields and $\Phi$ a chiral mattersuperfield.
