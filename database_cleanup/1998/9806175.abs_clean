on Particles, Strings and Cosmology (PASCOS 98), Boston, March 22-29, 1998Coupling of a membrane and a five-brane to the bosonic sector of D=11supergravity is considered. The five--brane is a dyonic object which carriesboth an electric and a magnetic charge of the D=11 three-form gauge field$A^3$, and it couples not only to $A^3$ but also minimally couples to asix-form field $A^6$ dual to $A^3$. This implies that the 5-brane should morenaturally couple to a version of D=11 supergravity where both gauge fields arepresent in a duality-symmetric fashion. We demonstrate how an action ofduality-symmetric D=11 supergravity looks like, couple it to the five-brane andthen reduce the resulting system to an action, which describes an interactionof the 5-brane with the standard D=11 supergavity.
