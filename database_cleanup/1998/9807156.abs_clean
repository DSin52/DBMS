We show that the D-instanton in the $AdS_5 \times S^5$ background is awormhole connecting the background $AdS_5 \times S^5$ to the flat space $\bfR^{10}$ located at the position of the D-instanton. By a $SL(2,{\bf R})$rotation of type IIB theory, we can make the {\it global} geometry flat instring frame. We also find that, due to the tight relation between the dilatonand the axion, there is no $SL(2,{\bf R})$ element that takes strong stringcoupling to weak one without making the axion ill defined. We also discuss thecase of $AdS_3$ as well as the instanton gases. A subtlety on the D-instantonat the boundary or at the horizon is discussed.
