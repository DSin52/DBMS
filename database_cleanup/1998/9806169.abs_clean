We construct the explicit worldvolume effective actions of the type IIBNS-5-brane and KK-monopole. These objects are obtained through a T-dualitytransformation from the IIA KK-monopole and the IIA NS-5-brane respectively. Weshow that the worldvolume field content of these actions is precisely thatnecessary to describe their worldvolume solitons. The IIB NS-5-brane effectiveaction is shown to be related to the D-5-brane's by an S-dualitytransformation, suggesting the way to construct (p,q) 5-brane multiplets. TheIIB KK-monopole is described by a gauged sigma model, in agreement with thegeneral picture for KK-monopoles, and behaves as a singlet under S-duality. Wederive the explicit T-duality rules NS-5-brane -- KK, which we use for theconstruction of the previous actions, as well as NS-5 -- NS-5, and KK -- KK.
