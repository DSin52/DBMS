Title: On Universality in Black Hole Thermodynamics

The low energy decay rates of four- and five dimensional dyonic black holesin string theory are equivalently described in terms of an effective nearhorizon AdS_3 (BTZ) black hole. It is then argued that AdS_3 gravity providesan universal microscopic description of the low energy dynamics these blackholes.
