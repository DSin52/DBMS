The standard formulation of the AdS/CFT correspondence is incomplete since itrequires adding to a supergravity action some a priori unknown boundary terms.We suggest a modification of the correspondence principle based on theHamiltonian formulation of the supergravity action, which does not require anyboundary terms. Then all the boundary terms of the standard formulationnaturally appear by passing from the Hamiltonian version to the Lagrangian one.As examples the graviton part of the supergravity action on the product of$AdS_{d+1}$ with a compact Einstein manifold $\cal E$ and fermions on$AdS_{d+1}$ are considered. We also discuss conformal transformations ofgravity fields on the boundary of $AdS$ and show that they are induced by theisometries of $AdS$.
