The canonical front form Hamiltonian for non-Abelian SU(N) gauge theory in3+1 dimensions and in the light-cone gauge is mapped non-perturbatively on aneffective Hamiltonian which acts only in the Fock space of a quark and anantiquark. Emphasis is put on the many-body aspects of gauge field theory, andit is shown explicitly how the higher Fock-space amplitudes can be retrievedself-consistently from solutions in the $q\bar q$-space. The approach is basedon the novel method of iterated resolvents and on discretized light-conequantization driven to the continuum limit. It is free of the usualperturbative Tamm-Dancoff truncations in particle number and coupling constantand respects all symmetries of the Lagrangian including covariance and gaugeinvariance. Approximations are done to the non-truncated formalism. Togetherwith vertex as opposed to Fock-space regularization, the method allows to applythe renormalization programme non-perturbatively to a Hamiltonian. Theconventional QCD scale is found arising from regulating the transversalmomenta. It conspires with additional mass scales to produce possiblyconfinement.
