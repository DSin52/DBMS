A relation between confinement and Maldacena conjecture is briefly discussed.The gauge symmetry enhancement for two coincident D-6-branes is analyzed fromthe viewpoint of the hypermultiplet low-energy effective action given by theN=2 supersymmetric non-linear sigma-model with the Eguchi-Hanson (ALE) targetspace.
