We argue that the large N strong/weak phase transition is a genericphenomenon in a finite temperature supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory of maximalsupersymmetry. ${\cal N}=4$, D=4 SYM is the canonical example, where we alsoargue that the large N Hawking-Page phase transition disappears for asufficiently small coupling. The Hawking-Page transition temperature is loweredby the first $\ap$ correction. Physically, the strong/weak phase transition isidentified with the correspondence point of Horowitz and Polchinski. We alsotry to construct toy models to demonstrate the large N phase transitions, withlimited success.
