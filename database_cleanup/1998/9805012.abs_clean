We show that the instability of the singular Vilenkin instanton describingthe creation of an open universe can be avoided using, instead of a minimallycoupled scalar field, an axionic massless scalar field which gives rise to theGiddings-Strominger instanton. However, if we replace the singularity of theHawking Turok instanton for an axionic wormhole some interpretational andtechnical difficulties would appear which can be overcome by introducing apositive cosmological constant in the action. This would make the instantonfinite and free constant in the action. This would make the instanton finiteand free from any instabilities.
