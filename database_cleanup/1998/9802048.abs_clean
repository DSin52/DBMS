to the Proceedings of the XIIth Workshop on High Energy Physics and QuantumField Theory (Samara, Russia, September 4-10, 1997). (in the revised versiontypographical errors are corrected and references are updated)The derivation of the explicit formula for the vacuum expectation value ofthe Wilson loop functional for an arbitrary gauge group on an arbitraryorientable two-dimensional manifold is considered both in the continuum caseand on the lattice. A contribution to this quantity, coming from the space ofinvariant connections, is also analyzed and is shown to be similar to thecontribution of monopoles.
