A two dimensional anomaly cancellation argument is used to construct theSO(32) heterotic and type IIB membranes. By imposing different boundaryconditions at the two boundaries of a membrane, we shift all of the twodimensional anomaly to one of the boundaries. The topology of these membranesis that of a 2-dimensional cone propagating in the 11-dimensional target space.Dimensional reduction of these membranes yields the SO(32) heterotic and typeIIB strings.
