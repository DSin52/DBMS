Title: D-branes and Discrete Torsion

Authors: Michael R. Douglas

Comments: 10 pp., harvmac

We show that discrete torsion is implemented in a D-brane world-volume theoryby using a projective representation of the orbifold point group. We study theexample of C^3/Z_2 x Z_2 and show that the resolution of singularities agreeswith that proposed by Vafa and Witten. A new type of fractional brane appears.
