An example is given of a plane topological defect solution of linearizedEinstein-Cartan (EC) field equation representing a cosmic wall boundary ofspinning matter. The source of Cartan torsion is composed of two orthogonallines of static polarized spins bounded by the cosmic plane wall. TheKopczy\'{n}ski- Obukhov - Tresguerres (KOT) spin fluid stress-energy currentcoincides with thin planar matter current in the static case. Our solution issimilar to Letelier solution of Einstein equation for multiple cosmic strings.Due to this fact we suggest that the lines of spinning matter could beanalogous to multiple cosmic spinning string solution in EC theory of gravity.When torsion is turned off a pure Riemannian cosmic wall is obtained.
