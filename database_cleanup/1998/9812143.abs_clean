Generalizing previous results for orbifolds, in this paper we describe thecompactification of Matrix model on an orientifold which is a quotient space asa Yang-Mills theory living on a quantum space. The information of thecompactification is encoded in the action of the discrete symmetry group G onEuclidean space and a projective representation U of G. The choice of Hilbertspace on which the algebra of U is realized as an operator algebra correspondsto the choice of a physical background for the compactification. All these dataare summarized in the spectral triple of the quantum space.
