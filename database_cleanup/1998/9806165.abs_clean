We examine in non-Abelian gauge theory the heavy quark limit in the presenceof the (anti-)self-dual homogeneous background field and see that a confiningpotential emerges, consistent with the Wilson criterion, although the potentialis quadratic and not linear in the quark separation. This builds upon thewell-known feature that propagators in such a background field are entirefunctions. The way in which deconfinement can occur at finite temperature isthen studied in the static temporal gauge by calculation of the effectivepotential at high temperature. Finally we discuss the problems to be surmountedin setting up the calculation of the effective potential nonperturbatively onthe lattice.
