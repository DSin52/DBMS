The collective coordinates expansion of the Skyrme soliton particle modelgives rise to the second class constraints. We use the non-abelian BFFTformalism to convert this system into the one with only first classconstraints. Choosing two different structure functions of the non-abelianalgebra, we obtain simplified algebraic expressions for the first classnon-abelian Hamiltonians. This result shows that the non-abelian BFFT methodis, in many aspects, richer than the abelian BFFT formalism. For both of thefirst class Hamiltonians, we derive the Lagrangians which lead to the newtheory. When one puts the extended phase space variables equal to zero, theoriginal Skyrmion Lagrangian is reproduced. The method of the Dirac first classconstraints is employed to quantize these two systems. We achieve the samespectrum, a result which confirms the consistency of the non-abelian BFFTformalism.
