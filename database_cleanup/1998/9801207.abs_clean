We present brane constructions in Type IIA string theory for N=1supersymmetric SO and Sp gauge theories with tensor representations using anorientifold 6-plane. One limit of these set-ups corresponds to N=2 theoriespreviously constructed by Landsteiner and Lopez, while a different limit yieldsN=1 SO or Sp theories with a massless tensor and no superpotential. For theSp-type orientifold projection comparison with the field theory moduli spaceleads us to postulate two new rules governing the stability of configurationsof D-branes intersecting the orientifold. Lifting one of our configurations toM-theory by finding the corresponding curves, we re-derive the N=1 dualitiesfor SO and Sp groups using semi-infinite D4 branes.
