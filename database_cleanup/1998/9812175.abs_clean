In the context of field theory two elements seem to be necessary to searchfor strong-weak coupling duality. First, a gauge theory formulation and second,supersymmetry. For gravitation these two elements are present inMacDowell-Mansouri supergravity. The search for an "effective duality" in thistheory presents technical and conceptual problems that we discuss.Nevertheless, by means of a field theoretical approach, which in the abeliancase coincides with $S$-duality, we exhibit a dual theory, with invertedcouplings. This results in a supersymmetric non-linear sigma model of theFreedman-Townsend type.
