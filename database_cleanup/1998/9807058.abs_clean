Title: General scalar interaction in the supersymmetric FRW model

Comments: 10 pages, Latex, no figures, submitted to MPLA

In this work we have constructed the most general action for a set of complexhomogeneous scalar supermultiplets interacting with the scale factor in thesupersymmetric FRW model. It is shown, that local conformal time supersymmetryK\"ahler potential and superpotential as in supergravity (or effectivesuperstring) theories. This scalar fields potential depends on arbitraryparameter $\alpha$, which is not fixed by conformal time supersymmetry.
