We discuss the propagation of scalars in a large class of non-extremal blackhole and black p-brane geometries in generic dimensions. We show that theradial wave equation near the horizon possesses the SL(2,R) structure in everycase; approximately it takes the form of the wave equation in the SL(2,R)(AdS_3) background and has a symmetry related to the T-duality of the stringmodel in that geometry. We see a close connection to two and three dimensionalblack holes. We also find that, in some parameter region, the absorptioncross-sections by the black objects take the form expected from a conformalfield theory. Our results indicate that some of the properties known about acertain class of four and five dimensional black holes hold more generally.
