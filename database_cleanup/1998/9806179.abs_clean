This thesis discusses the topological aspects of quantum gravity, focusing onthe connection between 2D quantum gravity and 2D topological gravity. Themathematical background for the discussion is presented in the first twochapters. The possible gauge formulations of 2D topological gravity as a BF ora Super BF theory are presented and compared against 2D quantum gravity in thedynamical triangulation scheme. A new identification between topologicalgravity in the Super BF formulation and the reduced hermitian matrix model atgenus zero is explained in depth.
