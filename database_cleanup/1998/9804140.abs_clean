Chamorro and Virbhadra studied, using the energy-momentum complex ofEinstein, the energy distribution associated with static spherically symmetriccharged dilaton black holes for an arbitrary value of the coupling parameter$\gamma$ which controls the strength of the dilaton to the Maxwell field. Westudy the same in Tolman's prescription and get the same result as obtained byChamorro and Virbhadra. The energy distribution of charged dilaton black holesdepends on the value of $\gamma$ and the total energy is independent of thisparameter.
