Title: The M five brane on a torus

Authors: D. S. Berman

Comments: 7 pages. To appear in proceedings of "Quantum aspects of gauge

theories, supergravity and unification", Corfu, September 1998, typoscorrectedThe D-3 brane is examined from the point of view of the wrapped M-theory fivebrane on a torus. In particular, the S-dual versions of the 3-brane areidentified as coming from different gauge choices of the auxiliary field thatis introduced in the PST description of the five brane world volume theory.
