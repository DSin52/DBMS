Universal low-energy behaviour ${2 m c}\over{\ln |s-4m^2|}$ of the scatteringfunction of particles of positive mass m near the threshold $s=4m^2$, and${\pi} \over {\ln |s-4m^2|}$ for the corresponding S-wave phase-shift, isestablished for weakly coupled field theory models with a positive mass m inspace-time dimension 3; c is a numerical constant independent of the model andcouplings. This result is a non-perturbative property based on an exactanalysis of the scattering function in terms of a two-particle irreducible (orBethe-Salpeter) structure function. It also appears as generic by the sameanalysis in the framework of general relativistic quantum field theory.
