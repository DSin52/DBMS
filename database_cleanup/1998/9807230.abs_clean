We suggest a model of the large N limit ${\cal N}=4$ D=4 SU(N) SYM as a gasof 3-branes in a 10 dimensional space. Field theory analysis suggests that this10 dimensional space does not carry the usual gravity dynamics but rather acontraction of it. Using a non-local transformation some aspects of thedynamics of this system are mapped to the dynamics of standard gravitons on$AdS_5\times S^5$. In particular some of the correspondence between operator inthe CFT and states on $AdS$ is more transparent.
