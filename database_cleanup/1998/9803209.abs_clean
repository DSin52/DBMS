We construct part of the superspace vielbein and tensor gauge field in termsof the component fields of 11-dimensional on-shell supergravity. The result canbe utilized to describe supermembranes and corresponding matrix models forDirichlet particles in nontrivial supergravity backgrounds to second order inanticommuting coordinates. We exhibit the kappa-invariance of the correspondingsupermembrane action, which at this order holds for unrestricted supergravitybackgrounds, the supersymmetry covariance and the resulting surface terms inthe action.
