Asymptotic freedom arises from the dominance of anti-screening over screeningin non-abelian gauge theories. In this paper we will present a simple andphysically appealing derivation of the anti-screening contribution to theinterquark potential. Our method allows us to identify the dominant gluonicdistribution around static quarks. Extensions are discussed.
