Title: Magnetic Catalysis of Dynamical Symmetry Breaking and Aharonov-Bohm

EffectComments: 8 pages, RevTex. Based on the talk given at the Workshop

``Nonperturbative Methods in Quantum Field Theory'' (February 1998,Adelaide). A reference is addedThe phenomenon of the magnetic catalysis of dynamical symmetry breaking isbased on the dimensional reduction $D\to D-2$ in the dynamics of fermionpairing in a magnetic field. We discuss similarities between this phenomenonand the Aharonov-Bohm effect. This leads to the interpretation of the dynamicsof the (1+1)-dimensional Gross-Neveu model with a non-integer number of fermioncolors as a quantum field theoretical analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm dynamics.
