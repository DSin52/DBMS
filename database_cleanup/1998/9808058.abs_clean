Bosonisation of the massive Thirring model, with a non-minimal andnon-abelian gauging is studied in 2+1-dimensions. The static abelian model issolved completely in the large fermion mass limit and the spectrum is obtained.The non-abelian model is solved for a restricted class of gauge fields. In bothcases explicit expressions for bosonic currents corresponding to the fermioncurrents are given.
