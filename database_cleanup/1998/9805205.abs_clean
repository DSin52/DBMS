Title: D=11 Supergravity Revisited

Comments: 12 pages. Lecture delivered at Arnowitt Fest, to appear in

Relativity, Particle Physics and Cosmology (World Scientific)I discuss two novel results in D=11 Supergravity. The first establishes, intwo complementary ways, a no-go theorem that, in contrast to all D<11, acosmological extension of the theory does not exist. The second deals with thestructure of (on-shell) four-point invariants. These are important both forestablishing existence of the lowest (2-loop) order candidate counter-terms inthe theory proper, as well as for comparison with the form of eventual"zero-slope" QFT limit of M-theory.
