Title: String Cosmology

Authors: Ram Brustein

Comments: 11 pages, 1 eps figure, Latex, based on talk at COSMO97

A string cosmology scenario ("pre-big-bang") postulates that the evolution ofthe Universe starts from a state of very small curvature and coupling,undergoes a long phase of dilaton-driven kinetic inflation and at some latertime joins smoothly standard radiation dominated cosmological evolution, thusgiving rise to a singularity free inflationary cosmology. I report on recentprogress in understanding some outstanding issues such as initial conditions,graceful exit transition and generation of inhomogeneity perturbations.
