We show that a subgroup of the modular group of M-theory compactified on aten torus, implies the Lorentzian structure of the moduli space, that isusually associated with naive discussions of quantum cosmology based on the lowenergy Einstein action. This structure implies a natural division of theasymptotic domains of the moduli space into regions which can/cannot be mappedto Type II string theory or 11D Supergravity (SUGRA) with large radii. We callthese the safe and unsafe domains. The safe domain is the interior of thefuture light cone in the moduli space while the unsafe domain contains thespacelike region and the past light cone. Within the safe domain, apparentcosmological singularities can be resolved by duality transformations and webriefly provide a physical picture of how this occurs. The unsafe domainsrepresent true singularities where all field theoretic description of thephysics breaks down. They violate the holographic principle. We argue that thisstructure provides a natural arrow of time for cosmology. All of the Kasnersolutions, of the compactified SUGRA theory interpolate between the past andfuture light cones of the moduli space. We describe tentative generalizationsof this analysis to moduli spaces with less SUSY.
