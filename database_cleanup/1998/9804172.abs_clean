Comments: 7 pages, 4d puzzle resolved by a comment of O. Aharony. The paper

deals with the puzzle in the 2d caseWe consider the AdS/CFT correspondence in the context of 2d CFT and find thatessentially all ``single particle'' primary fields with higher spin, predictedfrom the CFT side are missing from the Kaluza-Klein excitations of the AdSsupergravity. The high mass extension of these missing states gives rise to themacroscopic entropy of extremal 5d black holes.
