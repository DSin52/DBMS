The structure of the state-vector space for the two-mode parabose system isinvestigated and a complete set of state-vectors is constructed. The basisvectors are orthonormal in order $p=2$. In order $p=2$, conserved-chargeparabose coherent states are constructed and an explicit completeness relationis obtained.
