We complete the classification of supersymmetric configurations of twoM5-branes, started by Ohta and Townsend. The novel configurations notconsidered before are those in which the two branes are moving relative to oneanother. These configurations are obtained by starting with two coincidentbranes and Lorentz-transforming one of them while preserving somesupersymmetry. We completely classify the supersymmetric configurationsinvolving two M5-branes, and interpret them group-theoretically. We alsopresent some partial results on supersymmetric configurations involving anarbitrary number of M5-branes. We show that these configurations correspond toCayley planes in eight-dimensions which are null-rotated relative to each otherin the remaining (2+1) dimensions. The generic configuration preserves 1/32 ofthe supersymmetry, but other fractions (up to 1/4) are possible by restrictingthe planes to certain subsets of the Cayley grassmannian. We discuss someexamples with fractions 1/32, 1/16, 3/32, 1/8, 1/4 involving an arbitrarynumber of branes, as well as their associated geometries.
