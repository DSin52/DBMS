We consider the gravitational scattering of point particles in fourdimensions, at Planckian centre of mass energy and low momentum transfer, orthe eikonal approximation. The scattering amplitude can be exactly computed bymodelling point particles by very generic metrics. A class of such metrics areblack hole solutions obtained from dimensional reduction of p-brane solutionswith one or more Ramond-Ramond charges in string theory. At weak stringcoupling, such black holes are replaced by a collection of wrapped D-branes.Thus, we investigate eikonal scattering at weak coupling by modelling the pointparticles by wrapped D-branes and show that the amplitudes exactly match thecorresponding amplitude found at strong coupling. We extend the calculation forscattering of charged particles.
