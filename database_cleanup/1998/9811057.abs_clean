The greybody factors for spin 1/2 particles in the BTZ black holes arediscussed from 2D CFT in bulk-boundary correspondence. It is found that theinitial state of spin 1/2 particle in the BTZ black holes can be described bythe Poincar\'{e} vacuum state in boundary 2D CFT, and the nonlinear coordinatetransformation causes the thermalization of the Poincar\'{e} vacuum state. Forspecial case, our results for the greybody factors agree with the semiclassicalcalculation.
