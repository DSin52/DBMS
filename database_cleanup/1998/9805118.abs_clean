The master differential equations in the external square momentum p^2 for themaster integrals of the two-loop sunrise graph, in n-continuous dimensions andfor arbitrary values of the internal masses, are derived. The equations arethen used for working out the values at p^2 = 0 and the expansions in p^2 atp^2 =0, in (n-4) at n to 4 limit and in 1/p^2 for large values of p^2 .
