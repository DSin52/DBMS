Title: Topological Symmetry, Background Independence, and Matrix Models

Comments: 19 pages, LaTex, Invited paper to appear in the special issue of the

Journal of Chaos, Solitons and Fractals on "Superstrings, M, F, S, .......Theory", edited by M.S. El Naschie and C. CastroWe illustrate a physical situation in which topological symmetry, itsbreakdown, space-time uncertainty principle, and background independence mayplay an important role in constructing and understanding matrix models. First,we show that the space-time uncertainty principle of string may be understoodas a manifestation of the breakdown of the topological symmetry in the large$N$ matrix model. Next, we construct a new type of matrix models which is amatrix model analog of the topological Chern-Simons and BF theories. It is ofinterest that these topological matrix models are not only completelyindependent of the background metric but also have nontrivial "p-brane"solutions as well as commuting classical space-time as the classical solutions.In this paper, we would like to point out some elementary and unsolved problemsassociated to the matrix models, whose resolution would lead to the moresatisfying matrix model in future.
