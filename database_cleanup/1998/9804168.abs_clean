We analyse the one-loop effective action of N=4 SYM theory in the frameworkof the background field formalism in N=2 harmonic superspace. For the case ofon-shell background N=2 vector multiplet we prove that the effective action isfree of harmonic singularities. When the lowest N=1 superspace component of theN=2 vector multiplet is switched off, the effective action of N=4 SYM theory isshown to coincide with that obtained by Grisaru et al on the base of the N=1background field method. We compute the leading non-holomorphic corrections tothe N=4 SU(2) SYM effective action.
