The supersymmetric Born-Infeld actions describing gauge-fixed D-5- andD-3-branes in ambient six-dimensional (6d) spacetime are constructed insuperspace. A new 6d action is the (1,0) supersymmetric extension of the 6dBorn-Infeld action. It is related via dimensional reduction to anotherremarkable 4d action describing the N=2 supersymmetric extension of theBorn-Infeld-Nambu-Goto action with two real scalars. Both actions are theGoldstone actions associated with partial (1/2) spontaneous breaking ofextended supersymmetry having 16 supercharges down to 8 supercharges. Bothactions can be put into the `non-linear sigma-model' form by using certainnon-linear superfield constraints. The unbroken supersymmetry is alwayslinearly realised in our construction.
