We study the dynamical behavior of the BTZ (Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli) blackhole with the low-energy string effective action. The perturbation analysisaround the BTZ black hole reveals a mixing between the dilaton and otherfields. Introducing the new gauge (dilaton gauge), we disentangle this mixingcompletely and obtain one decoupled dilaton equation. We obtain the decay rate$\Gamma$ of BTZ black hole.
