In this paper we study the relation between six-dimensional supergravitycompactified on S^3 X AdS_3 and certain two-dimensional conformal fieldtheories. We compute the Kaluza-Klein spectrum of supergravity usingrepresentation theory; these methods are quite general and can also be appliedto other compactifications involving anti-de Sitter spaces. A detailedcomparison between the spectrum of the two-dimensional conformal field theoryand supergravity is made, and we find complete agreement. This applies even atthe level of certain non-chiral primaries, and we propose a resolution to thepuzzle of the missing states recently raised by Vafa. As a further illustrationof the method the Kaluza-Klein spectra of F-theory on M^6 X S^3 X AdS_3 and ofM-theory on M^6 X S^2 X AdS_3 are computed, with M^6 some Calabi-Yau manifold.
