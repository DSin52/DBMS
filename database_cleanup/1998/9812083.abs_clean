Title: Monopole-Instanton Type Solutions In 3D Gravity

Authors: Bayram Tekin

Comments: 7 pages, major conceptual changes were made, title has changed

Three dimensional Euclidean gravity in the dreibein-spin connection formalismis investigated. We use the monopole-instanton ansatz for the dreibein and thespin connection. The equations of motion are solved. We point out a twodimensional solution with a vanishing action.
