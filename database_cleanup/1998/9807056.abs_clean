We consider attractor varieties arising in the construction of dyonic blackholes in Calabi-Yau compactifications of IIB string theory. We show that theattractor varieties are constructed from products of elliptic curves withcomplex multiplication for $\CN=4,8$ compactifications. The heterotic dualtheories are related to rational conformal field theories. The emergence ofcurves with complex multiplication suggests many interesting connectionsbetween arithmetic and string theory. This paper is a brief overview of alonger companion paper entitled ``Arithmetic and Attractors.''
