Title: Membrane's Discrete Spectrum and BRST Residual Symmetry in the Conformal

Light Cone GaugeComments: 12 pages, latex

In this work we present a proof of the discreteness of the spectrum forbosonic membrane, in a flat minkowski space. This may be useful to show thequantum mechanical consistence of others bosonics extended models. This proofincludes the BRST residual symmetry and was directly performed over thediscretized membrane model. The BRST residual invariant effective action isexplicity constructed.
