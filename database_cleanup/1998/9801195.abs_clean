The differential algebra on the fuzzy sphere is constructed by applyingConnes' scheme. The U(1) gauge theory on the fuzzy sphere based on thisdifferential algebra is defined. The local U(1) gauge transformation on thefuzzy sphere is identified with the left $U(N+1)$ transformation of the field,where a field is a bimodule over the quantized algebra $\CA_N$. The interactionwith a complex scalar field is also given.
