The ground, one- and two-particle states of the (1+1)-dimensional massivesine-Gordon field theory are investigated within the framework of the Gaussianwave-functional approach. We demonstrate that for a certain region of themodel-parameter space, the vacuum of the field system is asymmetrical.Furthermore, it is shown that two-particle bound state can exist upon theasymmetric vacuum for a part of the aforementioned region. Besides, for thebosonic equivalent to the massive Schwinger model, the masses of the one bosonand two-boson bound states agree with the recent second-order results of afermion-mass perturbation calculation when the fermion mass is small.
