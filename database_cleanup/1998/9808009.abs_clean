We propose a method for the approximate computation of the Green function ofa scalar massless field Phi subjected to potential barriers of given size andshape in spacetime. This technique is applied to the case of a 3D gaussianellipsoid-like barrier, placed on the axis between two pointlike sources of thefield. Instead of the Green function we compute its temporal integral, thatgives the static potential energy of the interaction of the two sources. Suchinteraction takes place in part by tunneling of the quanta of Phi across thebarrier. We evaluate numerically the correction to the potential in dependenceon the size of the barrier and on the barrier-sources distance.
