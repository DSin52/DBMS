The free energy of the maximally supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory attemperature T is expected to scale, in the large N limit, as N^2 T^4 times afunction of the 't Hooft coupling, f(g_{YM}^2 N). In the strong coupling limitthe free energy has been deduced from the near-extremal 3-brane geometry, andits normalization has turned out to be 3/4 times that found in the weakcoupling limit. In this paper we calculate the leading correction to thisresult in inverse powers of the coupling, which originates from the R^4 termsin the tree level effective action of type IIB string theory. The correction to3/4 is positive and of order (g_{YM}^2 N)^{-3/2}. Thus, f(g_{YM}^2 N) increasesas the 't Hooft coupling is decreased, in accordance with the expectation thatit should be approaching 1 in the weak coupling limit. We also discuss similarcorrections for other conformal theories describing coincident branes. Inparticular, we suggest that the coupling-independence of the near extremalentropy for D1-branes bound to D5-branes is related to the vanishing of theWeyl tensor of AdS_3\times S^3.
