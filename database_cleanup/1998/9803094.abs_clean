We consider smeared zeta functions and heat-kernel coefficients on thebounded, generalized cone in arbitrary dimensions. The specific case of a ballis analysed in detail and used to restrict the form of the heat-kernelcoefficients $A_n$ on smooth manifolds with boundary. Supplemented by conformaltransformation techniques, it is used to provide an effective scheme for thecalculation of the $A_n$. As an application, the complete $A_{5/2}$ coefficientis given.
