There is a chance that singleton fields, that in the context of strings andmembranes have been regarded as topological gauge fields that can interact onlyat the boundary of anti-De Sitter space, at spatial infinity, may have a morephysical manifestation as costituents of massless fields in space time. Thecomposite character of massless fields is expressed by field - currentidentities that relate ordinary massless field operators to singleton currentsand stress-energy tensors. Naive versions of such identities do not make sense,but when the singletons are described in terms of dipole structures, then suchconstructions are at least formally possible. The new proposal includes andgeneralizes an early composite version of QED, and includes quantum gravity,super gravity and models of QCD. Unitarity of such theories is conjectural.
