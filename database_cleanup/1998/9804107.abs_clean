Title: The top Yukawa coupling from 10D supergravity with E_8 x E_8 matter

Comments: 11 pages, latex with amsfonts

We consider the compactification of N=1, D=10 supergravity with E_8 x E_8Yang-Mills matter to N=1, D=4 model with 3 generations. With help of embeddingSU(5)->SO(10)->E_6->E_8 we find the value of the top Yukawa coupling$\lambda_t=\sqrt{16\pi\alpha_{GUT}/3}$ at the GUT scale.
