Title: Non commutative geometry for outsiders; an elementary introduction to

motivations and toolsAuthors: Daniela Bigatti

Comments: 18 pages, LaTeX, four .eps figures; some misprints corrected and some

references addedOverviewSince the subject of noncommutative geometry is now entering maturity, wefelt there is need for presentation of the material at an undergraduate courselevel. Our review is a zero order approximation to this project. Thus, thepresent paper attempts to offer some motivations and mathematical prerequisitesfor a deeper study or at least to serve as support in glancing at recentresults in theoretical physics.
