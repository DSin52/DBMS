Title: Hausdorff dimension and anyonic distribution functions

Authors: Wellington da Cruz

Comments: latex, 5 pages, added references, minor gammatical changes

We obtain the distribution functions for anyonic excitations classified intoequivalence classes labeled by Hausdorff dimension, $h$ and as an example ofsuch anyonic systems, we consider the collective excitations of the FractionalQuantum Hall Effect (FQHE).
