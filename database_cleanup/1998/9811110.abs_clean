We analyze $S^1$ equivariant cohomology from the supergeometrical point ofview. For this purpose we equip the external algebra of given manifold withequivariant even super(pre)symplectic structure, and show, that itsPoincare-Cartan invariant defines equivariant Euler classes of surfaces. Thisallows to derive localization formulae by use of superanalog of Stockestheorem.
