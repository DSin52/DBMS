The problem of gauging a closed form is considered. When the target manifoldis a simple Lie group G, it is seen that there is no obstruction to the gaugingof a subgroup H\subset G if we may construct from the form a cocycle for therelative Lie algebra cohomology (or for the equivariant cohomology), and anexplicit general expression for these cocycles is given. The common geometricalstructure of the gauged closed forms and the D'Hoker and Weinberg effectiveactions of WZW type, as well as the obstructions for their existence, is alsoexhibited and explained.
