We consider a class of black hole solutions to Einstein's equations in ddimensions with a negative cosmological constant. These solutions have theproperty that the horizon is a (d-2)-dimensional Einstein manifold of positive,zero, or negative curvature. The mass, temperature, and entropy are calculated.Using the correspondence with conformal field theory, the phase structure ofthe solutions is examined, and used to determine the correct mass dependence ofthe Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
