Title: Projective Statistics and Spinors in Hilbert Space

Comments: LaTeX, 3 pages

In quantum mechanics, symmetry groups can be realized by projective, as wellas by ordinary unitary, representations. For the permutation symmetry relevantto quantum statistics of N indistinguishable particles, the simplest properlyprojective representation is highly non-trivial, of dimension $2^{(N-1)/2}$,and is most easily realized starting with spinor geometry. Quasiparticles inthe Pfaffian quantum Hall state realize this representation. Projectivestatistics is a consistent theoretical possibility in any dimension.
