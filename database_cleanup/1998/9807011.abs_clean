We study supersymmetry breaking by Scherk-Schwarz compactifications in type Istring theory. While in the gravitational sector all mass splittings areproportional to a (large) compactification radius, supersymmetry remainsunbroken for the massless excitations of D-branes orthogonal to the largedimension. In this sector, supersymmetry breaking can then be mediated bygravitational interactions alone, that are expected to be suppressed by powersof the Planck mass. The mechanism is non perturbative from the heteroticviewpoint and requires a compactification radius at intermediate energies oforder 10^{12}-10^{14} GeV. This can also explain the value of Newton's constantif the string scale is close to the unification scale, of order 10^{16} GeV.
