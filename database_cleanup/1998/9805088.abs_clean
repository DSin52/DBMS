Title: Dynamical vertex mass generation and chiral symmetry breaking on the

light-frontJournal-ref: Phys.Rev. D58 (1998) 096015

Naively, helicity flip amplitudes for fermions seem to vanish in the chirallimit of light-front QCD, which would make it nearly impossible to generate asmall pion mass in this framework. Using a simple model, it is illustrated howa large helicity flip amplitude is generated dynamically by summing over aninfinite number of Fock space components. While the kinetic mass is basicallygenerated by a zero-mode induced counter-term, the vertex mass is generateddynamically by infinitesimally small, but nonzero, momenta. Implications forthe renormalization of light-front Hamiltonians for fermions are discussed.
