We compute the quark--antiquark potential in three dimensional massiveQuantum Electrodynamics for arbitrary fermion mass. The result indicates thatscreening prevails for any quark masses, contrary to the classicalexpectations, generalizing our previous result obtained for large masses. Wealso test the validity of several approximation schemes using a detailednumerical analysis. The classical result is still reproduced for smallseparation of the quarks.
