We classify possible `self-duality' equations for p-form gauge fields inspace-time dimension up to D=16, generalizing the pioneering work of Corriganet al. (1982) on Yang-Mills fields (p=1) for D from 5 to 8. We impose twocrucial requirements. First, there should exist a 2(p+1)-form T invariant undera sub-group H of SO(D). Second, the representation for the SO(D) curvature ofthe gauge field must decompose under H in a relevant way. When these criteriaare fulfilled, the `self-duality' equations can be candidates as gaugefunctions for SO(D)-covariant and H-invariant topological quantum fieldtheories. Intriguing possibilities occur for dimensions greater than 9, forvarious p-form gauge fields.
