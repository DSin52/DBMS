We consider certain orbifoldization of the ${\cal N}=4$ field theories thatleads to ${\cal N}=2,1,0$ field theories in 4 dimensions. These theories wererecently analyzed using the string theory perturbation technique. It was foundthat in the large $N$ limit all correlation functions of the orbifold theoriescoincide with those of ${\cal N}=4$, modulo the rescaling of the gauge couplingconstant. In this paper we repeat the same analysis using the field theoreticallanguage.
