We reexamine the issue of the soliton mass in two-dimensional models with N=1 supersymmetry. The superalgebra has a central extension, and at theclassical level the soliton solution preserves 1/2 of supersymmetry which isequivalent to BPS saturation. We prove that the property of BPS saturation,i.e. the equality of the soliton mass to the central charge, remains intact atthe quantum level in all orders of the weak coupling expansion. Our key findingis an anomaly in the expression for the central charge. The classical centralcharge, equal to the jump of the superpotential, is amended by an anomalousterm proportional to the second derivative of the superpotential. The anomalyis established by various methods in explicit one-loop calculations. We arguethat this one-loop result is not affected by higher orders. We discuss indetail how the impact of the boundary conditions can be untangled from thesoliton mass calculation. In particular, the soliton profile and the energydistribution are found at one loop. A "supersymmetry" in the soliton masscalculations in the non-supersymmetric models is observed.
