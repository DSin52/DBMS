Title: General Abelian Orientifold Models and One Loop Amplitudes

Authors: Donal O'Driscoll

Comments: 29 pages, latex, no figures

We construct a one loop amplitude for any Abelian orientifold point group forarbitary complex dimensions. From this we show several results for orientifoldsin this general class of models as well as for low dimensionalcompactifications. We also discuss the importance and structure of thecontribution of orientifold planes to the dynamics of D-branes, and give aphysical explaination for the inconsistency of certain Z_4 models as discoveredby Zwart.
