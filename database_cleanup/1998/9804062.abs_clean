We compute the entropy of extremal black strings in three dimensions, usingStrominger's approach to relate the Anti-de-Sitter near-horizon geometry andthe conformal field theory at the asymptotic infinity of this geometry. Theresult is identical to the geometric Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We furtherdiscuss an embedding of three-dimensional black strings in $N=1 D=10$supergravity and demonstrate that the extremal strings preserve 1/4 ofsupersymmetries.
