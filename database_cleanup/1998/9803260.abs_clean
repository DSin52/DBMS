In a recent paper, Ohta and Townsend studied the conditions which must besatisfied for a configuration of two intersecting M5-branes at angles to besupersymmetric. In this paper we extend this result to any number of M5-branesor any number of M2-branes. This is accomplished by interpreting their resultsin terms of calibrated geometry, which is of independent interest.
