The bound system composed of the Yang monopole coupled to a particle of theisospin by the SU(2) and Coulomb interaction is considered. The generalizedRunge--Lenz vector and the SO(6) group of hidden symmetry are established. Itis also shown that the group of hidden symmetry make it possible to calculatethe spectrum of the system by a pure algebraic method.
