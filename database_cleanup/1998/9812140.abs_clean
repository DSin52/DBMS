The general solution of the antifield-independent Wess-Zumino consistencycondition is worked out for models involving exterior form gauge fields ofarbitrary degree. We consider both the free theory and theories withChapline-Manton couplings. Our approach relies on solving the full set ofdescent equations by starting from the last element down ("bottom").
