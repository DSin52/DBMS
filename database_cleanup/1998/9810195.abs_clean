Recently, Douglas and Taylor proposed to identify the Higgs vev of theCoulomb branch of the 4 dimensional N=4 super Yang-Mills theory with thepositions of D3 branes in the AdS_5 x S^5 string theory. We extend thisidentification to more general configurations that preserve less supersymmetry.We show that a single D3 brane in AdS_5 x S^5 string theory can break thespacetime supersymmetry to 1/4 or even 1/8. Such configurations, interpretatedas backgrounds of the SYM, also break the N=4 superconformal symmetry of SYM to1/4 or 1/8, giving N=2 or N=1. We discuss the implications of thiscorrespondence. We also present other BPS D3-brane configurations that preserve1/8 supersymmetry corresponding to N=1 on the SYM side.
