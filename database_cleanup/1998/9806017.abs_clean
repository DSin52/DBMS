In Einstein-Maxwell theory, magnetic flux lines are `expelled' from a blackhole as extremality is approached, in the sense that the component of the fieldstrength normal to the horizon goes to zero. Thus, extremal black holes arefound to exhibit the sort of `Meissner effect' which is characteristic ofsuperconducting media. We review some of the evidence for this effect, and dopresent new evidence for it using recently found black hole solutions in stringtheory and Kaluza-Klein theory. We also present some new solutions, which arisenaturally in string theory, which are non-superconducting extremal black holes.We present a nice geometrical interpretation of these effects derived bylooking carefully at the higher dimensional configurations from which the lowerdimensional black hole solutions are obtained. We show that other extremalsolitonic objects in string theory (such as p-branes) can also displaysuperconducting properties. In particular, we argue that the relativisticLondon equation will hold on the worldvolume of `light' superconductingp-branes (which are embedded in flat space), and that minimally coupled zeromodes will propagate in the adS factor of the near-horizon geometries of`heavy', or gravitating, superconducting p-branes.
