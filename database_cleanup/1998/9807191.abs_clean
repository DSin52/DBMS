We propose an algorithm, based on Algebraic Renormalization, that allows therestoration of Slavnov-Taylor invariance at every order of perturbationexpansion for an anomaly-free BRS invariant gauge theory. The counterterms areexplicitly constructed in terms of a set of one-particle-irreducible Feynmanamplitudes evaluated at zero momentum (and derivatives of them). The approachis here discussed in the case of the abelian Higgs-Kibble model, where the zeromomentum limit can be safely performed. The normalization conditions areimposed by means of the Slavnov-Taylor invariants and are chosen in order tosimplify the calculation of the counterterms. In particular within this modelall counterterms involving BRS external sources (anti-fields) can be put tozero with the exception of the fermion sector.
