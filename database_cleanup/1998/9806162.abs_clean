We calculate the baryon mass in N=4 large $N$ gauge theory by means ofAdS/CFT correspondence and show that it is a truly bound state, at least insome situations. We find that a phase transition occurs at a criticaltemperature. Furthermore, we find there are bound states of W-bosons in theHiggs phase, where the gauge group is broken to SU(N_1)xSU(N_2).
