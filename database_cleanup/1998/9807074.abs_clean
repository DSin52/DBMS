We construct new trigonometric solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation, usingthe Fuss-Catalan algebras, a set of multi-colored versions of theTemperley-Lieb algebra, recently introduced by Bisch and Jones. These lead tonew two-dimensional integrable lattice models, describing dense gases ofcolored loops.
