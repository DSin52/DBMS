Title: Principal Realization for the extended affine Lie algebra of type $sl_2$

with coordinates in a simple quantum torus with two generatorsAuthors: Stephen Berman and Jacek Szmigielski

We construct an irreducible representation for the extended affine algebra oftype $sl_2$ with coordinates in a quantum torus. We explicitly give formulasusing vertex operators similar to those found in the theory of the infiniterank affine algebra $A_{\infty}$.
