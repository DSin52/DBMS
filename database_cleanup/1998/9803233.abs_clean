We study the cluster properties of thermal equilibrium states in theorieswith a maximal propagation velocity (such as relativistic QFT). Our analysis,carried out in the setting of algebraic quantum field theory, shows that thereis a tight relation between spectral properties of the generator of timetranslations and the decay of spatial correlations in thermal equilibriumstates, in complete analogy to the well understood case of the vacuum state.
