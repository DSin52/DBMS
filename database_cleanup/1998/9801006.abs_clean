The interconnection between quantum mechanics and probabilistic classicalmechanics for a free relativistic particle is derived in terms of Wignerfunctions (WF) for both Dirac and Klein-Gordon (K-G) equations. Construction ofWF is achieved by first defining a bilocal 4-current and then taking itsFourier transform w.r.t. the relative 4-coordinate. The K-G and Proca casesalso lend themselves to a closely parallel treatment provided the Kemmer-Duffin beta-matrix formalism is employed for the former. Calculation of WF iscarried out in a Lorentz-covariant fashion by standard `trace' techniques. Theresults are compared with a recent derivation due to Bosanac.
