The LN approach unifies the functional Schr\"{o}dinger equationand the LN equation for time-independent or time-dependent quantum systems andfor equilibrium or nonequilibrium quantum systems. The LN approach isnonperturbative in that at the lowest order of coupling constant it gives thesame results as those of the Gaussian effective potential at the zero andfinite temperature in a Minkowski spacetime. We study a self-interactingquantum field in an expanding Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe. By studyinga toy model of anharmonic oscillator and finding the underlying algebraicstructure we propose a scheme to go beyond the Gaussian approximation.
