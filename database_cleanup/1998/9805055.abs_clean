Authors: P. C. West

Comments: 47 pages, plain tex

In these lectures we discuss the supersymmetry algebra and its irreduciblerepresentations. We construct the theories of rigid supersymmetry and gavetheir superspace formulations. The perturbative quantum properties of theextended supersymmetric theories are derived, including the superconformalinvariance of a large class of these theories. We also discuss flat directions,non-holomorphicity and the perturbative chiral effective action for N=2Yang-Mills theory. The superconformal transformations in four dimensionalsuperspace are derived and encoded into one superconformal Killing superfield.It is shown that the anomalous dimensions of chiral operators in asuperconformal quantum field are related to their $R$ weight.
