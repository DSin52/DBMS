We find the superisometry of the near-horizon superspace, forming thesuperconformal algebra. We present here the explicit form of the transformationof the bosonic and fermionic coordinates (as well as the compensatingLorentz-type transformation) which keeps the geometry invariant. We comment oni) the BPS condition of the branes in adS background andii) significant simplification of superisometries of the gauge-fixedGreen-Schwarz action in adS(5)*S(5) background.
