To construct actions for describing superbranes propagating in AdS x Ssuperbackgrounds we propose a coset space realization of these superbackgroundswhich results in a short polynomial fermionic dependence (up to the sixth powerin Grassmann coordinates) of target superspace supervielbeins andsuperconnections. Gauge fixing kappa-symmetry in a way compatible with a staticbrane solution further reduces the fermionic dependence down to the fourthpower. Subtleties of consistent gauge fixing worldvolume diffeomorphisms andkappa-symmetry of the superbrane actions are discussed.
