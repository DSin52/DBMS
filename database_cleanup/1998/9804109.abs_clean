We use a gauge-invariant regularization procedure, called ``split dimensionalregularization'', to evaluate the quark self-energy $\Sigma (p)$ andquark-quark-gluon vertex function $\Lambda_\mu (p^\prime,p)$ in the Coulombgauge, $\vec{\bigtriangledown}\cdot\vec{A}^a = 0$. The technique of splitdimensional regularization was designed to regulate Coulomb-gauge Feynmanintegrals in non-Abelian theories. The technique which is based on two complexregulating parameters, $\omega$ and $\sigma$, is shown to generate awell-defined set of Coulomb-gauge integrals. A major component of this projectdeals with the evaluation of four-propagator and five-propagator Coulombintegrals, some of which are nonlocal. It is further argued that the standardone-loop BRST identity relating $\Sigma$ and $\Lambda_\mu$, should by rights bereplaced by a more general BRST identity which contains two additionalcontributions from ghost vertex diagrams. Despite the appearance of nonlocalCoulomb integrals, both $\Sigma$ and $\Lambda_\mu$ are local functions whichsatisfy the appropriate BRST identity. Application of split dimensionalregularization to two-loop energy integrals is briefly discussed.
