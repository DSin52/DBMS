Title: Field Theory Dynamics from Branes in String Theory

Authors: Andreas Karch

Comments: 104 pages, LaTeX2e; based on PhD Thesis, Humboldt University, Berlin

I review certain aspects of Hanany-Witten setups and other approaches used toembed (and solve) gauge theories in string theory. Applications covered includedualities in 4 and 3 dimensions, fixed points in 6 dimensions, phasetransitions between different geometric backgrounds and dualities betweenbranes and geometry.
