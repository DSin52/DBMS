We derive the dynamics of M-brane intersections from the worldvolume actionof one brane in the background supergravity solution of another one. In thisway we obtain an effective action for the self-dual string boundary of anM2-brane in an M5-brane, and show that the dynamics of the 3-brane intersectionof two M5-branes is described by a Dirac-Born-Infeld action.
