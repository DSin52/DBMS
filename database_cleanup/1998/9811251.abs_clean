In the context of N=8 supergravity we consider BPS black-holes that preserve1/8 supersymmetry. It was shown in a previous paper that, modulo U-dualitytransformations of E_{7(7)} the most general solution of this type can bereduced to a black-hole of the STU model. In this paper we analize thissolution in detail, considering in particular its embedding in one of thepossible Special K\"ahler manifold compatible with the consistent truncationsto N=2 supergravity, this manifold being the moduli space of the T^6/Z^3of the Solvable Lie Algebra formalism. Once the group-theoretical analisys isdone, starting from a static, spherically symmetric ans\"atz, we find an exactsolution for all the scalars (both dilaton and axion-like) and for gaugefields, together with their already known charge-dependent fixed values, whichyield a U-duality invariant entropy. We give also a complete translationdictionary between the Solvable Lie Algebra and the Special K\"ahler formalismsin order to let comparison with other papers on similar issues being moreimmediate. Although the explicit solution is given in a simplified case wherethe equations turn out to be more manageable, it encodes all the features ofthe more general one, namely it has non-vanishing entropy and the scalar fieldshave a non-trivial radial dependence.
