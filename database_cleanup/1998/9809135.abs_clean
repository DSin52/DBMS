A canonical action describing the interaction of chiral gauge fields in D=6Minkowski space-time is constructed. In a particular partial gauge fixing itreduces to the action found by Perry and Schwarz. The additional gaugesymmetries are used to show the off-shell equivalence of the dimensionalreduction to D=5 Minkowski space-time of the chiral gauge field canonicalaction and the Born-Infeld canonical action describing an interacting D=5Abelian vector field. Its extension to improve the on-shell equivalencearguments of dual D-brane actions to off-shell ones is discussed.
