"Contemporary Fundamental Physics", Ed. Valeri Dvoeglazov (Nova SciencePublishers)We discuss the theoretical basis for the search of the possible experimentalmanifestations of the torsion field at low energies. First, the quantum fieldtheory in an external gravitational field with torsion is reviewed. Therenormalizability requires the nonminimal interaction of torsion with spinorand scalar (Higgs) fields. The Pauli-like equation contains newtorsion-dependent terms which have a different structure as compared with thestandard electromagnetic ones. The same concerns the nonrelativistic equationsfor spin-${1}/{2}$ particle in an external torsion and electromagnetic fields.Second, we discuss the propagating torsion. For the Dirac spinor coupled to theelectromagnetic and torsion field there is some additional softly broken localsymmetry associated with torsion. As a consequence of this symmetry, in theframework of effective field theory, the torsion action is fixed with accuracyto the values of the coupling constant of the torsion-spinor interaction, massof the torsion and higher derivative terms. The introduction of the Higgs fieldspoils the consistency of this scheme, and the effective quantum field theoryfor torsion embedded into the Standard Model is not possible. Thephenomenological consequences of the torsion-fermion interaction are drown andthe case of the torsion mass of the Planck order is discussed.
