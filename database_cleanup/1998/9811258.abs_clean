We study D-branes on a three complex dimensional nonabelian orbifold ${\bfC}^3/\Gamma$ with $\Gamma$ a finite subgroup of SU(3). We present generalformulae necessary to obtain quiver diagrams which represent the gauge groupand the spectrum of the D-brane worldvolume theory for dihedral-like subgroups$\Delta(3n^2)$ and $\Delta(6n^2)$. It is found that the quiver diagrams have asimilar structure to webs of branes.
