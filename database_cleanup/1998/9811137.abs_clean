We formulate a complete path integral bosonization procedure for anyfermionic theory in two dimensions. The method works equally well for massiveand massless fermions, and is a generalization of an approach suggested earlierby Andrianov. The classical action of the bosons in the bosonized theory isidentified with -i times the logarithm of the Jacobian of a local chiraltransformation, with the boson fields as transformation parameters. Threeexamples, the Schwinger model, the massive Thirring model and massivenon-Abelian bosonization, are worked out.
