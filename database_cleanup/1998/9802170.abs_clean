In the class of (0,2) heterotic compactifications which has been constructedin the framework of gauged linear sigma models the Calabi-Yau varieties X arerealized as complete intersections of hypersurfaces in toric varieties IP andthe corresponding gauge bundles (or more generally gauge sheaves) E are definedby some short exact sequences. We show that there is yet another degree offreedom in resolving singularities in such models which is related to thepossible choices of nef partitions of the anticanonical divisors in GorensteinFano toric varieties IP.
