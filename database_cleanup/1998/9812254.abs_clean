Is is shown that a nonhomogeneous diffusion in flat space with a tensor ofdiffusion can be described as a homogeneous diffusion in a Riemannian manyfoldwith this tensor of diffusion as a metric tensor. The curvature and thegravitation are represented as manifestations of structure of stochasticspace-time, i.e. as consequences of quantum fluctuations. Einstein's equationsfor metric tensor represented as equations for tensor of diffusion. The energydensity of such diffusional gravitation is negative defined and leads torenormalizable quantum gravity with vanishing cosmological constant.
