A rule of thumb derivation of the Dirac-Born-Infeld action for D-branes isstudied \`a la Fradkin and Tseytlin, by simply integrating out of thesuperstring coordinates in a narrow strip attached to the D-branes. In case ofsuperstrings, the coupling of Ramond-Ramond fields as well as theDirac-Born-Infeld type coupling of the Neveu Schwarz-Neveu Schwarz fields comeout in this way.
