Comments: 6 pages, no figure; minor changes, reference added

By using the D0-brane cluster picture, we consider the Hawking radiation ofSchwarszchild black hole (SBH) in large N Matrix model. We get the correctformula for the the Hawing evaporation rate. Our results give some evidence onthe Lorentz invariance of the physics of Matrix model.
