Title and part of the original content of my notes hep-th/9810080 was used inthe present essayThe present state of QFT is analysed from a new viewpoint whose mathematicalbasis is the modular theory of von Neumann algebras. Its physical consequencessuggest new ways of dealing with interactions, symmetries, Hawking-Unruhthermal properties and possibly also extensions of the scheme of renormalizedperturbation theory. Interactions are incorporated by using the fact that theS-matrix is a relative modular invariant of the interacting- relative to theincoming- net of wedge algebras. This new point of view allows many interestingcomparisions with the standard quantization approach to QFT and is shown to befirmly rooted in the history of QFT.
