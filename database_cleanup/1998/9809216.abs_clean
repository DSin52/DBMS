We compute the influence of boundary conditions on the Euler-Heisenbergeffective Lagrangian scalar QED scalar for the case of a pure magnetic field.The boundary conditions constrain the quantum scalar field to vanish on twoparallel planes separeted by a distance $a$ and the magnetic field is assumedto be constant, uniform and perpendicular to the planes. The effectiveLagrangian is obtained using Schwinger's proper-time representation andexhibits new contributions generated by the boundary condition much in the sameway as a material pressed between two plates exhibits new magnetic properties.The confined bosonic vacuum presents the expected diamagnetic properties andbesides the new non-linear $a$-dependent contributions to the susceptibility weshow that there exists also a new $a$-dependent contribution for the vacuumpermeability in the linear approximation.
