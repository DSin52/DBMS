We study three-dimensional N=4 gauge theories with product gauge groupsconstructed from ADE Dynkin diagrams. One-loop corrections to the metric on theCoulomb branch are shown to coincide with the metric on the moduli space ofwell-seperated ADE monopoles. We propose that this correspondence is exact.
