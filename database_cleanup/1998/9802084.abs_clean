We derive the string representation of the Abelian Higgs theory in whichdyons are condensed. It occurs that in such representation the topologicalinteraction exists in the expectation value of the Wilson loop. Due to thisinteraction the dynamics of the string spanned on the Wilson loop isnon-trivial.
