We construct an explicit supergravity solution for a configuration oflocalized D4-brane ending on a D6-brane, restricted to the near horizon regionof the latter. We generate this solution by dimensionally reducing thesupergravity solution for a flat M5-brane in $R^{1,7} \times C^2/Z_N$ with theM5-brane partially embedded in $C^2/Z_N$. We describe the general class oflocalized intersections and overlaps whose supergravity solutions areconstructible in this way.
