The finite-temperature renormalization group is formulated via theWilson-Kadanoff blocking transformation. Momentum modes and the Matsubarafrequencies are coupled by constraints from a smearing function which plays therole of an infrared cutoff regulator. Using the scalar lambda phi^4 theory asan example, we consider four general types of smearing functions and show that,to zeroth-order in the derivative expansion, they yield qualitatively the sametemperature dependence of the running constants and the same critical exponentswithin numerical accuracy.
