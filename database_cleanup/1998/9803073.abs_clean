We derive model independent, non-perturbative supersymmetric sum rules forthe magnetic and electric multipole moments of any theory with N=1supersymmetry. We find that in any irreducible N=1 supermultiplet the diagonalmatrix elements of the l-multipole moments are completely fixed in terms oftheir off-diagonal matrix elements and the diagonal (l-1)-multipole moments.
