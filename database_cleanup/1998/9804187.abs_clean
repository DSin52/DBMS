Title: Numerical Field Theory on the Continuum

Authors: Stephen C. Hahn and G. S. Guralnik

Comments: 13 pages, 8 figures, LaTeX 2e

An approach to calculating approximate solutions to the continuumSchwinger-Dyson equations is outlined, with examples for \phi^4 in D=1. Thisapproach is based on the source Galerkin methods developed by Garcia, Guralnikand Lawson. Numerical issues and opportunities for future calculations are alsodiscussed briefly.
