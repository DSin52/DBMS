We apply the holographic principle during the inflationary stage of ouruniverse. Where necessary, we illustrate the analysis in the case of new andextended inflation which, together, typify generic models of inflation. We findthat in the models of extended inflation type, and perhaps of new inflationtype also, the holographic principle leads to a lower bound on the densityfluctuations.
