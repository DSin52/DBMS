SU(2) Yang-Mills field theory is considered in the framework of thegeneralized Hamiltonian approach and the equivalent unconstrained system isobtained using the method of Hamiltonian reduction. A canonical transformationto a set of adapted coordinates is performed in terms of which theAbelianization of the Gauss law constraints reduces to an algebraic operationand the pure gauge degrees of freedom drop out from the Hamiltonian afterprojection onto the constraint shell. For the remaining gauge invariant fieldstwo representations are introduced where the three fields which transform asscalars under spatial rotations are separated from the three rotational fields.An effective low energy nonlinear sigma model type Lagrangian is derived whichout of the six physical fields involves only one of the three scalar fields andtwo rotational fields summarized in a unit vector. Its possible relation to theeffective Lagrangian proposed recently by Faddeev and Niemi is discussed.Finally the unconstrained analog of the well-known nonnormalizable groundstatewave functional which solves the Schr\"odinger equation with zero energy isgiven and analysed in the strong coupling limit.
