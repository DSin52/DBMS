The Discrete Light-Cone Quantization (DLCQ) of a supersymmetric gauge theoryin 1+1 dimensions is discussed, with particular attention given to theinclusion of the gauge zero mode. Interestingly, the notorious `zero-mode'problem is now tractable because of special supersymmetric cancellations. Inparticular, we show that anomalous zero-mode contributions to the currents areabsent, in contrast to what is observed in the non-supersymmetric case. Ananalysis of the vacuum structure is provided by deriving the effective quantummechanical Hamiltonian of the gauge zero mode. It is shown that the inclusionof the zero modes of the adjoint scalars and fermions is crucial for probingthe phase properties of the vacua. We find that the ground state energy is zeroand thus consistent with unbroken supersymmetry, and conclude that thelight-cone Fock vacuum is unchanged with or without the presence of matterfields.
