We give a superfield formulation of the path integral on an arbitrary curvedphase space, with or without first class constraints. Canonical tranformationsand BRST transformations enter in a unified manner. The superpartners of theoriginal phase space variables precisely conspire to produce the correct pathintegral measure, as Pfaffian ghosts. When extended to the case of second-classconstraints, the correct path integral measure is again reproduced afterintegrating over the superpartners. These results suggest that the superfieldformulation is of first-principle nature.
