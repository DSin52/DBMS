We will establish the connection between the Lorentz covariant and so-calledsingle-time formulation for the quark Wigner operator. To this end we willdiscuss the initial value problem for the Wigner operator of a field theory andgive a discussion of the gauge-covariant formulation for the Wigner operatorincluding some new results concerning the chiral limit. We discuss the gradientor semi-classical expansion and the color and spinor decomposition of theequations of motion for the Wigner operator. The single-time formulation willbe derived from the covariant formulation by taking energy moments of theequations for the Wigner operator. For external fields we prove that only thelowest energy moments of the quark Wigner operator contain dynamicalinformation.
