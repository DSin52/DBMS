We interpret the general rotating black holes in five dimensions as rotatingblack strings in six dimensions. In the near horizon limit the geometry islocally AdS_3 x S_3, as in the nonrotating case. However, the global structurecouples the AdS_3 and the S_3, giving angular velocity to the S_3. Theasymptotic geometry is exploited to count the microstates and recover theprecise value of the Bekenstein- Hawking entropy, with rotation taken properlyinto account. We discuss the perturbation spectrum of the rotating black hole,and its relation to the underlying conformal field theory.
