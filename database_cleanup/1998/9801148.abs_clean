A classical model of N=2, D=3 fractional spin superparticle (superanyon) ispresented, whose first-quantization procedure combines the Berezin quantizationfor the superspin degrees of freedom and the canonical quantization for thespace-time ones. To provide the supersymmetry for the quantised theory, certainquantum corrections are required to the N=2 supersymmetry generators ascompared to the Berezin procedure. The renormalized generators are found andthe first quantised theory of N=2 superanyon is constructed.
