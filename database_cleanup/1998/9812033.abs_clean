We derive the supersymmetric structure present in W-gravities which has beenalready observed in various contexts as Yang-Mills theory, topological fieldtheories, bosonic string and chiral W_{3}-gravity. This derivation which ismade in the geometrical framework of Zucchini, necessitates the introduction ofan appropriate new basis of variables which replace the canonical fields andtheir derivatives. This construction is used, in the W_{2}-case, to deduce fromthe Chern-Simons action the Wess-Zumino-Polyakov action.
