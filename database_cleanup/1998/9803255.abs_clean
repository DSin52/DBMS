Title: Hypothetic time -- temperature duality as a hint for modifications in

quantum dynamics?Authors: W. Krolikowski (IFT, Warsaw University)

Comments: 15 pages, LaTeX, no figures

The well-known formal analogy between time and absolute temperature, existingon the quantum level, is considered as a profound duality relationshiprequiring some modifications in the conventional quantum dynamics. They consistof tiny deviations from uniform time run in the physical spacetime, as well asof tiny deviations from unitary time evolution characteristic for theconventional quantum theory. The first deviations are conjectured to beproduced by local changes of total average particle number. Then, they implythe second deviations exerting in turn influence upon this particle number. Twooptical theorem for particle scattering, and hypothetic slow variation of theaverage number of probe particles contained in a sample situated in proximityof a big accelerator (producing abundantly particles on a target).
