The W-infinity minimal models are conformal field theories which can describethe edge excitations of the hierarchical plateaus in the quantum Hall effect.In this paper, these models are described in very explicit terms by using abosonic Fock space with constraints, or, equivalently, with a non-trivialHamiltonian. The Fock space is that of the multi-component Abelian conformaltheories, which provide another possible description of the hierarchicalplateaus; in this space, the minimal models are shown to correspond to thesub-set of states which satisfy the constraints. This reduction of degrees offreedom can also be implemented by adding a relevant interaction to theHamiltonian, leading to a renormalization-group flow between the two theories.Next, a physical interpretation of the constraints is obtained by representingthe quantum incompressible Hall fluids as generalized Fermi seas. Finally, thenon-Abelian statistics of the quasi-particles in the W-infinity minimal modelsis described by computing their correlation functions in the Coulomb Gasapproach.
