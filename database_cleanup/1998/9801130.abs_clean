Using the observation that configurations of N polymers with hard coreinteractions on a closed random surface correspond to random surfaces with Nboundary components we calculate the free energy of a gas of polymersinteracting with fully quantized two-dimensional gravity. We derive theequation of state for the polymer gas and find that all the virial coefficientsbeyond the second one vanish identically.
