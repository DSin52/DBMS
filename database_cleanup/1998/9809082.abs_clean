We describe in superspace a classical theory of two dimensional $(1,1)$dilaton supergravity with a cosmological constant, both with and withoutcoupling to a massive superparticle. We give general exact non-trivialsuperspace solutions for the compensator superfield that describes thesupergravity in both cases. We then use these compensator solutions toconstruct models of two-dimensional supersymmetric cosmological black holes.
