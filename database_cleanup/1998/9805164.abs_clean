The open inflation model recently proposed by Hawking and Turok isinvestigated in scalar-tensor gravity context. If the dilaton-like field has nopotential, the instanton of our model is singular but has a finite action. TheGibbons-Hawking surface term vanishes and hence, can not be used to make$\Omega_0$ nonzero. To obtain a successful open inflation one should introduceother matter fields or a potential for the dilaton-like fields.
