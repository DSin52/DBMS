We study F-theory duals of six dimensional heterotic vacua in extreme regionsof moduli space where the heterotic string is very strongly coupled. Wedemonstrate how to use orientifold limits of these F-theory duals to regain aperturbative string description. As an example, we reproduce the spectrum of a$T^4/\ZZ_{4}$ orientifold as an F-theory vacuum with a singular $K3$ fibration.We relate this vacuum to previously studied heterotic $E_8\times E_8$compactifications on $K3$.
