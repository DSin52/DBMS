Title: Instanton symmetries and the entropy of compact manifolds

Comments: 28 pages, RevTeX

Many Euclidean Einstein manifolds possess continuous symmetry groups of atleast one parameter and we consider here a classification scheme of $d$dimensional compact manifolds based on the existence of such a one parametergroup in terms of the fixed point sets of the isometries. We discussapplications of such a classification scheme, including the geometricinterpretation of the entropy; there are intrinsic contributions to the entropyfrom the volumes of $(d-2)$ dimensional fixed point sets and contributionsrelated to the cohomology structure of the orbit space of the isometry. Weconsider the relevance of such a decomposition of the entropy in the context ofthe no boundary proposal and cosmological processes, and generalise thediscussion to compact solutions of gravity coupled to scalar and gauge fields.
