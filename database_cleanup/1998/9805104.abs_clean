We compute, in the large N limit, the quark potential for ${\cal N}=4$supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory broken to $SU(N_1) \times SU(N_2)$. Atshort distances the quarks see only the unbroken gauge symmetry and have anattractive potential that falls off as 1/L. At longer distances the interquarkinteraction is sensitive to the symmetry breaking, and other QCD states appear.These states correspond to combinations of the quark-antiquark pair with somenumber of W-particles. If there is one or more W-particles then this state isunstable because of the coulomb interaction between the W-particles and betweenthe W's and the quarks. As L is decreased the W-particles delocalize and thesecoulomb branches merge onto a branch with a linear potential. The quarks onthis branch see the unbroken gauge group, but the flux tube is unstable to theproduction of W-particles.
