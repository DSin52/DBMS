We derive fully covariant expressions for disk scattering amplitudes of anytwo massless closed strings in which mixed Neumann and Dirichlet world-sheetboundary conditions are included. From the two-point amplitudes, we derive thelong range background fields and verify that they correspond to D$p$-branebound state. Also, from the scattering amplitudes, we calculate the linearcoupling of closed string fields to D-brane world-volume and show that they areconsistent with Born-Infeld and Chern-Simons actions in the presence of abackground field.
