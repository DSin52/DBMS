We study N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on a Kaehler manifold with$b_2^+ \geq 3$. Adding suitable perturbations we show that the partitioninstantons, (ii) a special class of Seiberg-Witten monopoles. We determine thepartition function for the theories with gauge group SU(2) and SO(3), usingS-duality. This leads us to a formula for the Euler characteristic of themoduli space of instantons.
