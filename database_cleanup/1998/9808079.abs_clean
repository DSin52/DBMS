We examine the AdS/CFT correspondence when the gauge theory is considered ona compactified space with supersymmetry breaking boundary conditions. We findthat the corresponding supergravity solution has a negative energy, inagreement with the expected negative Casimir energy in the field theory.Stability of the gauge theory would imply that this supergravity solution hasminimum energy among all solutions with the same boundary conditions. Hence weare lead to conjecture a new positive energy theorem for asymptotically locallyAnti-de Sitter spacetimes. We show that the candidate minimum energy solutionis stable against all quadratic fluctuations of the metric.
