The implications of N=1 superconformal symmetry for four dimensional quantumfield theories are studied. Superconformal covariant expressions for two andthree point functions of quasi-primary superfields of arbitrary spin are foundand connected with the operator product expansion. The general formulae arespecialised to cases involving a scalar superfield L, which contains globalsymmetry currents, and the supercurrent, which contains the energy momentumtensor, and the consequences of superconformal Ward identities analysed. Thethree point function of L is shown to have unique completely antisymmetric orsymmetric forms. In the latter case the superspace version of the axial anomalyequation is obtained. The three point function for the supercurrent is shown tohave two linearly independent forms. A linear combination of the associatedcoefficients for the general expression is shown to be related to the scale ofthe supercurrent two point function through Ward identities. The coefficientsare given for the two free field superconformal theories and are also connectedwith the parameters present in the supercurrent anomaly for supergravitybackgrounds. Superconformal invariants, which are possible even in three pointfunctions, are discussed.
