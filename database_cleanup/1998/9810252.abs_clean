Title: On a different BRST constructions for a given Lie algebra

Authors: A.Pashnev and M.Tsulaia

Comments: 10 Pages, LaTeX

The method of the BRST quantization is considered for the system ofconstraints, which form a Lie algebra. When some of the Cartan generators donot imply any conditions on the physical states, the system contains the firstand the second class constraints. After the introduction auxiliary bosonicdegrees of freedom for these cases, the corresponding BRST charges with thenontrivial structure of nonlinear terms in ghosts are constructed.
