Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B434 (1998) 28-35

A multidimensional gravitational model with several scalar fields, fields offorms and cosmological constant is considered. When scalar fields are constantand composite p-brane monopole-like ansatz for the fields of forms is adopted,a wide class of solutions on product of n+1 Einstein spaces is obtained. Thesesolutions are the composite p-brane generalizations of the Freund-Rubinsolution. Some examples including the AdS_m x S^k x... solutions areconsidered.
