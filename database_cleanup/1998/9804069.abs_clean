A number of N=2 gauge theories can be realized by brane configurations inType IIA string theory. One way of solving them involves lifting the braneconfiguration to M-theory. In this paper we present an alternative way ofanalyzing a subclass of these theories (elliptic models). We observe that uponcompactification on a circle one can use a version of mirror symmetry to mapthe original brane configuration into one containing only D-branes.Simultaneously the Coulomb branch of the four-dimensional theory is mapped tothe Higgs branch of a five-dimensional theory with three-dimensionalimpurities. The latter does not receive quantum corrections and can be analyzedexactly. The solution is naturally formulated in terms of an integrable system,which is a version of a Hitchin system on a punctured torus.
