We look at the vertical dimensional reduction of the supermembrane ofM-theory to the D2-brane of Type IIA string theory. Our approach considers thesoliton solutions of the two low energy field limits, D=11 and D=10 Type IIAsupergravities, rather than the worldvolume actions. It is thus necessary tocreate a periodic array. The standard Kaluza-Klein procedure requires that thebrane is smeared over a transverse direction, but we will keep the dependenceon the compactification coordinate, seeing how the eleventh dimension comesinto play when we close up on the D2-brane.
