Authors: Oded Kenneth and Shmuel Nussinov

Comments: 10 pages, latex, one figure

A new version of the Casimir effect where the two plates conduct in specific,different, directions is considered. By direct functional integration theevaluation of the Casimir energy as a function of the angle between theconduction directions is reduced to quadratures. Other applications of themethod and a magnetic Casimir variant are mentioned.
