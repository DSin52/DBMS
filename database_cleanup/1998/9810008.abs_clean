Trace anomaly for dilaton coupled conformal theories on curved backgroundwith non-zero dilaton is found from supergravity side as an IR effect usingAdS/CFT correspondence. For $d=2$ it coincides with the conformal anomaly fordilaton coupled scalar (up to total derivative term which is known to beambiguous). In four-dimensional case we get conformal anomaly for ${\cal N}=4$super YM theory interacting with conformal supergravity. In the same way thecalculation of dilaton dependent conformal anomaly in higher dimensions seemsto be much easier than using standard QFT methods.
