Small InstantonsAuthors: Eugene Perevalov

We explore a relation between four-dimensional N=2 heterotic vacua induced byMirror Symmetry via Heterotic/Type II duality. It allows us to compute the\alpha' corrections to the hypermultiplet moduli space of heteroticcompactifications on K3xT^2 in the limit of large base of the elliptic K3. Weconcentrate on the case of point-like instantons on orbifold singularitiesleading to low-dimensional hypermultiplet moduli spaces.
