We study softly broken N=1 supersymmetric QCD with the gauge group $SU(N_c)$and $N_f$ flavours of quarks for $N_f > N_c+1$. We investigate the phasestructure of its dual theory adding generic soft supersymmetry breking terms,i.e. soft scalar masses, trilinear coupling terms of scalar fields and gauginomasses. It is found that the trilinear coupling terms play an improtant role indetermining the potential minima. Also we compare softly broken original anddual theories in the broken phase.
