The dependence of the energies of axially symmetric monopoles of magneticcharges 2 and 3, on the Higgs self-interaction coupling constant, is studiednumerically. Comparing the energy per unit topological charge of the charge-2monopole with the energy of the spherically symmetric charge-1 monopole, weconfirm that there is only a repulsive phase in the interaction energy betweenlike monopoles
