We investigate whether DLCQ of M-theory can be defined as a limit of M-theorycompactified on an almost light-like circle. This is of particular interestsince the proofs of the matrix description of M-theory by Seiberg and Sen relyon this assumption. By the standard relation between M-theory on $S^1$ and IIAstring theory, we translate this question into the corresponding one about theexistence of the light-like limit of IIA superstring theory for any stringcoupling $g_s$. We argue that perturbative string loop amplitudes should have afinite and well-defined light-like limit provided the external momenta arechosen to correspond to a well-defined DLCQ set-up. On the non-perturbativeside we consider states and amplitudes. We show that an appropriate class ofnon-perturbative states (wrapped D-branes) precisely have the right light-likelimit. We give some indications that non-perturbative corrections to stringamplitudes, too, may behave as required in the light-like limit. Havingperturbative and non-perturbative evidence, this suggests that type IIAsuperstring theory as a whole has a well-defined light-like limit (for anystring coupling $g_s$) and hence that the same is true for M-theory.
