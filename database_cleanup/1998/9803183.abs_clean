Geometry of the solution space of the self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) equationsin Euclidean four-dimensional space is studied. Combining the twistor andgroup-theoretic approaches, we describe the full infinite-dimensional symmetrygroup of the SDYM equations and its action on the space of local solutions tothe field equations. It is argued that owing to the relation to a holomorphicanalogue of the Chern-Simons theory, the SDYM theory may be as solvable as 2Drational conformal field theories, and successful nonperturbative quantizationmay be developed. An algebra acting on the space of self-dual conformalstructures on a 4-space (an analogue of the Virasoro algebra) and an algebraacting on the space of self-dual connections (an analogue of affine Liealgebras) are described. Relations to problems of topological and N=2 stringsare briefly discussed.
