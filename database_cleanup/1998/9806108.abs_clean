We present detailed analyses of the 3-body interactions of D-particles fromboth sides of 11 dimensional supergravity and Matrix theory. In supergravity,we derive a complete expression for the classical bosonic effective action forD-particles including 2-and 3-body interaction terms. In Matrix theory, wecompute 1-particle irreducible contributions to the eikonal phase shift in thetwo-loop approximation. The results precisely agree with the predictions fromsupergravity and thus provide a strong support to the discrete light-coneinterpretation of the Matrix-theory conjecture as a possible nonperturbativedefinition of M-theory.
