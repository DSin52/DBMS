We have studied the underlying algebraic structure of the anharmonicoscillator by using the variational perturbation theory. To the first order ofthe variational perturbation, the Hamiltonian is found to be factorized into asupersymmetric form in terms of the annihilation and creation operators, whichsatisfy a q-deformed algebra. This algebraic structure is used to construct allthe eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.
