The presence of chiral fermions in the physical Hilbert space impliesconsistency conditions on the spectral action. These conditions are equivalentto the absence of gauge and gravitational anomalies. Suggestions for thefermionic part of the spectral action are made based on the supersymmetrisationof the bosonic part.
