We consider quantum-mechanical path integrals for non-linear sigma models ona circle defined by the string-inspired method of Strassler, where oneconsiders periodic quantum fluctuations about a center-of-mass coordinate. Inthis approach one finds incorrect answers for the local trace anomalies of thecorresponding $n$-dimensional field theories in curved space. The quantum fieldtheory approach to the quantum-mechanical path-integral, where quantumfluctuations are not periodic but vanish at the endpoints, yields the correctanswers. We explain these results by a detailed analysis of general coordinateinvariance in both methods. Both approaches can be derived from the sameoperator expression and the integrated trace anomalies in both schemes agree.In the string-inspired method the integrands are not invariant under generalcoordinate transformations and one is therefore not permitted to use Riemannnormal coordinates.
