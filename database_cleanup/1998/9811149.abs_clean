We investigate the quantum conformal algebras of N=2 and N=1 supersymmetricgauge theories. Phenomena occurring at strong coupling are analysed using theNachtmann theorem and very general, model-independent, arguments. The resultslead us to introduce a novel class of conformal field theories, identified by aclosed quantum conformal algebra. We conjecture that they are the exactsolution to the strongly coupled large-N_c limit of the open conformal fieldtheories. We study the basic properties of closed conformal field theory andwork out the operator product expansion of the conserved current multiplet T.The OPE structure is uniquely determined by two central charges, c and a. Themultiplet T does not contain just the stress-tensor, but also R-currents andfinite mass operators. For this reason, the ratio c/a is different from 1. Onthe other hand, an open algebra contains an infinite tower of non-conservedcurrents, organized in pairs and singlets with respect to renormalizationmixing. T mixes with a second multiplet T* and the main consequence is that cand a have different subleading corrections. The closed algebra simplifiesconsiderably at c=a, where it coincides with the N=4 one.
