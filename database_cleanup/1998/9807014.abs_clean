We present fivedimensional extreme black hole solutions of M-theorycompactified on Calabi-Yau threefolds and study these solutions in the contextof flop transitions in the extended Kahler cone. In particular we consider aspecific model and present black hole solutions, breaking half of N=2supersymmetry, in two regions of the extended Kahler cone, which are connectedby a flop transition. The conditions necessary to match both solutions at theflop transition are analysed. Finally we also discuss the conditions to obtainmassless black holes at the flop transition.
