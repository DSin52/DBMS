In the strong coupling limit type IIA superstring theory develops an eleventhdimension that is not apparent in perturbation theory. This suggests theexistence of a consistent 11d quantum theory, called M theory, which isapproximated by 11d supergravity at low energies. In this review we describesome of the evidence for this picture and some of its implications.
