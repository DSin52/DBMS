We determine the spectrum of currents generated by the operator productexpansion of the energy-momentum tensor in N=4 super-symmetric Yang-Millstheory. Up to the regular terms and in addition to the multiplet of the stresstensor, three current multiplets appear, Sigma, Xi and Upsilon, starting withspin 0, 2 and 4, respectively. The OPE's of these new currents generate aninfinite tower of current multiplets, one for each even spin, which exhibit auniversal structure, of length 4 in spin units, identified by a two-parameterrational family. Using higher spin techniques developed recently for conformalfield theories, we compute the critical exponents of Sigma, Xi and Upsilon inthe TT OPE and prove that the essential structure of the algebra holds atarbitrary coupling. We argue that the algebra closes in the strongly coupledlarge-$N_c$ limit. Our results determine the quantum conformal algebra of thetheory and answer several questions that previously remained open.
