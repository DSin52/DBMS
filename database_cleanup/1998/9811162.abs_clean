We consider embeddings of the Virasoro algebra into other Virasoro algebraswith different central charges. A Virasoro algebra with central charge c(assumed to be a positive integer) and zero mode operator L_0 can be embeddedinto another Virasoro algebra with central charge one and zero mode operator cL_0. We point out that this provides a new route to investigate the black holeentropy problem in 2+1 dimensions.
