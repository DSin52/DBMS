Making use of non-perturbative U-duality symmetries of type II strings weconstruct new `superstring' vacua in three dimensions with N=1 supersymmetry.This has an interpretation as compactifying formally from 13 dimensions(S-theory) on Calabi-Yau 5-folds possessing a $T^3 \x T^2$ fibration. Wedescribe some part of the massless multiplets, given by the Hodge spectrum, andpoint to a corresponding 5-brane configuration.
