We introduce two massive versions of the anisotropic spin 1/2 Kondo model anddiscuss their integrability. The two models have the same bulk sine-Gordoninteractions, but differ in their boundary interactions. At the Toulouse freefermion point each of the models can be understood as two decoupled Isingmodels in boundary magnetic fields. Reflection S-matrices away from the freefermion point are conjectured.
