We analyse the Hilbert space structure of the isomorphic gauge non-invariantand gauge invariant bosonized formulations of chiral $QCD_2$ for the particularcase of the Jackiw-Rajaraman parameter $ a = 2$. The BRST subsidiary conditionsare found not to provide a sufficient criterium for defining physical states inthe Hilbert space and additional superselection rules must to be taken intoaccount. We examine the effect of the use of a redundant field algebra inderiving basic properties of the model. We also discuss the constraintstructure of the gauge invariant formulation and show that the only primaryconstraints are of first class.
