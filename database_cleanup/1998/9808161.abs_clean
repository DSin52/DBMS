We construct the T duals of certain type IIA brane configurations with onecompact dimension (elliptic models) which contain orientifold planes. Theseconfigurations realize four-dimensional $\NN=2$ finite field theories. Forelliptic models with two negatively charged orientifold six-planes, the T dualsare given by D3 branes at singularities in the presence of O7-planes andD7-branes. For elliptic models with two oppositely charged orientifold planes,the T duals are D3 branes at a different kind of orientifold singularities,which do not require D7 branes. We construct the adequate orientifold groups,and show that the cancellation of twisted tadpoles is equivalent to thefiniteness of the corresponding field theory. One family of models containsorthogonal and symplectic gauge factors at the same time. These neworientifolds can also be used to define some six-dimensional RG fixed pointswhich have been discussed from the type IIA brane configuration perspective.
