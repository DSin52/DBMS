From the Dirac action on the world sheet, an effective action is obtained byintegrating over the 4-dimensional fermion fields pulled back to the worldsheet. This action consists of the Nambu-Goto area term with right dimensionfulconstant in front, extrinsic curvature action and the topological Eulercharacteristic term.
