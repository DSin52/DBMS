BPS states of N=2, D=4 Super Yang-Mills theories with ADE flavor symmetryarise as junctions joining a D3-brane to a set of 7-branes defining theenhanced flavor algebra. We show that the familiar BPS spectrum of SU(2)theories with N_f <= 4 is simply given by the set of junctions whoseself-intersection is bounded below as required by supersymmetry. Thisconstraint, together with the relations between junction and weight lattices,is used to establish the appearance of arbitrarily large flavor representationsfor the case of D_{n>=5} and E_n symmetries. Such representations are requiredby consistency with decoupling down to smaller flavor symmetries.
