In this note we address the problem of solving for the positronium massspectrum. We use front-form dynamics together with the method of flowequations. For a special choice of the similarity function, the calculationscan be simplified by analytically integrating over the azimuthal angle. Oneobtains an effective Hamiltonian and we solve numerically for its spectrum.Comparing our results with different approaches we find encouraging propertiesconcerning the cutoff dependence of the results.
