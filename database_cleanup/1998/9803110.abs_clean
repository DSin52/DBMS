We have studied a problem of the tachyon mediated D-brane - D-braneannihilation from the underlying world-volume gauge field theory point of view.The initial state was chosen in the form of two D-branes crossing at a non-zeroangle, which is non-supersymmetric configuration generically. This state wasnot a groundstate of the theory and the problem at hand was a model, where wehad rather precise control over the behavior of the theory.Some applications ofthis model to the D-brane physics and conclusions about stability of severalconfigurations were made. By taking a T-dual picture of this process on a T^2torus, we derived known conclusion about the instability of a system consistingof D-0 and D-2 branes, and found its decay modes.
