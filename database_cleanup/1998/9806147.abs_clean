We analyse the relationship between the N=2 harmonic and projectivesuperspaces which are the only approaches developed to describe general N=2super Yang-Mills theories in terms of off-shell supermultiplets withconventional supersymmetry. The structure of low-energy hypermultipleteffective action is briefly discussed.
