Previous work involving Born-regulated gravity theories in two dimensions isextended to four dimensions. The action we consider has two dimensionfulparameters. Black hole solutions are studied for typical values of theseparameters. For masses above a critical value determined in terms of theseparameters, the event horizon persists. For masses below this critical value,the event horizon disappears, leaving a ``bare mass'', though of course nosingularity.
