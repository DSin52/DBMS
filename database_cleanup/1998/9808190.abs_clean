The light-cone little group, SO(9), classifies the massless degrees offreedom of eleven-dimensional supergravity, with a triplet of representations.We observe that this triplet generalizes to four-fold infinite families withthe quantum numbers of massless higher spin states. Their mathematicalstructure stems from the three equivalent ways of embedding SO(9) into theexceptional group $F_4$.
