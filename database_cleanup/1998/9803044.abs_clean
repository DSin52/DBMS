We consider the compactification of Matrix theory on tori with backgroundantisymmetric tensor field. Douglas and Hull have recently discussed hownoncommutative geometry appears on the tori. In this paper, we demonstrate theconcrete construction of this compactification of Matrix theory in a similarway to that previously given by Taylor.
