We study the supersymmetric extension of the gauged $ O(3) $ sigma model in $2+1 $ dimensions and find the supersymmetry algebra. We also discuss solitonsolutions in case the Maxwell term is replaced by the Born-Infeld term. We showthat by appropriate choice of the potential, the self-dual equations in theBorn-Infeld case coincide with those of the Maxwell's case.
