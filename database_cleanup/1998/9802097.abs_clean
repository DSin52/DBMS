Arbitrary spin free massless fermionic fields corresponding to mixed symmetryrepresentations of the \hbox{$SO(d-1)$} compact group and propagating in even$d$-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime are investigated. Free wave equationsof motion, subsidiary conditions and the corresponding gauge transformationsfor such fields are proposed. The lowest eigenvalues of the energy operator forthe massless fields and the gauge parameter fields are derived. The results areformulated in $SO(d-1,2)$ covariant form as well as in terms of intrinsiccoordinates.
