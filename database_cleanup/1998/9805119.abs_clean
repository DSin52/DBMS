The generalized gluing and resmoothing theorem originally proved by LeClair,Peskin and Preitschopf, gives a powerful formula for the fused vertex obtainedby contracting any two vertices in string field theories. Although the theoremis naturally expected to hold for the vertices at any loop level, the originalproof was restricted to the vertices at tree level. Here we present asimplified proof for the tree level theorem and then prove explicitly theextended version at one-loop level. We also find that a non-trivial signfactor, which depends on the string states to be contracted, appears in thetheorem. This sign factor turns out to be essential for reproducing correctlythe conformal field theory correlation function on the torus.
