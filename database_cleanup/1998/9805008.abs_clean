In this paper we fill some gaps in the arguments of our previous papers[hep-th/9412229,hep-th/9604044]. In particular, we give a proof that the Loperators of Conformal Field Theory indeed satisfy the defining relations ofthe Yang-Baxter algebra. Among other results we present a derivation of thefunctional relations satisfied by ${\bf T}$ and ${\bf Q}$ operators and a proofof the basic analyticity assumptions for these operators used in[hep-th/9412229,hep-th/9604044].
