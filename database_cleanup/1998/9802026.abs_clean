By following Seiberg's prescriptions on DLCQ of $M$ theory, we give thebackground geometries of DLCQ supergravity associated with $N$ sector of DLCQof $M$ theory on $T^p$ with vanishingly small radii. Most of these are theproduct of anti-de Sitter spacetimes and spheres, which have been found as thespontaneous compactifications of eleven dimensional supergravity long time agoand also are revisited recently by Maldacena by considering the near horizongeometry of various D-branes in appropriate limit. Those geometries aremaximally symmetric and have full 32 supersymmetries of eleven dimensionalsupergravity, which agrees with the number of supersymmetries of DLCQ of $M$theory. This suggests that DLCQ of $M$ theory is the $M$/string theory on thesenontrivial background.
