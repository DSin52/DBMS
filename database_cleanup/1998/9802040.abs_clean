We analyze the finite temperature chiral restoration transition of the$(D=d+1)$-dimensional Gross-Neveu model for the case of a large number offlavors and fixed total fermion number. This leads to the study of the modelwith a nonzero imaginary chemical potential. In this formulation of the theory,we have obtained that, in the transition region, the model is described by achiral conformal field theory where the concepts of dimensional reduction anduniversality do apply due to a transmutation of statistics which makes fermionsact as if they were bosons, having zero energy. This result should be genericfor theories with dynamical symmetry breaking, such as Quantum Chromodynamics.
