We discuss some of the experimental motivation for the need for semigroupdecay laws, and the quantum Lax-Phillips theory of scattering and unstablesystems. In this framework, the decay of an unstable system is described by asemigroup.The spectrum of the generator of the semigroup corresponds to thesingularities of the Lax-Phillips $S$-matrix. In the case of discrete (complex)spectrum of the generator of the semigroup, associated with resonances, thedecay law is exactly exponential. The states corresponding to these resonances(eigenfunctions of the generator of the semigroup) lie in the Lax-PhillipsHilbert space, and therefore all physical properties of the resonant states canbe computed. We show that the parametrized relativistic quantum theory is anatural setting for the realization of the Lax-Phillips theory.
