I consider the classical Kac-Moody algebra and Virasoro algebra inChern-Simons theory with boundary within the Dirac's canonical method andNoether procedure. It is shown that the usual (bulk) Gauss law constraintbecomes a second-class constraint because of the boundary effect. From thisfact, the Dirac bracket can be constructed explicitly without introducingadditional gauge conditions and the classical Kac-Moody and Virasoro algebrasare obtained within the usual Dirac method. The equivalence to the symplecticreduction method is presented and the connection to the Ba\~nados's work isclarified. It is also considered the generalization to theYang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory where the diffeomorphism symmetry is broken bythe (three-dimensional) Yang-Mills term. In this case, the same Kac-Moodyalgebras are obtained although the two theories are sharply different in thecanonical structures. The both models realize the holography principleexplicitly and the pure CS theory reveals the correspondence of theChern-Simons theory with boundary/conformal field theory, which is morefundamental and generalizes the conjectured anti-de Sitter/conformal fieldtheory correspondence.
