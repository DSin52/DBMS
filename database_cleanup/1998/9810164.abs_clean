Exact characteristic trajectories are specified for the time-propagatingWigner phase-space distribution function. They are especially simple---indeed,classical---for the quantized simple harmonic oscillator, which serves as theunderpinning of the field theoretic Wigner functional formulation introduced.Scalar field theory is thus reformulated in terms of distributions in fieldphase space. Applications to duality transformations in field theory arediscussed.
