We derive the five-dimensional effective action of strongly coupled heteroticstring theory for the complete (1,1) sector of the theory by performing areduction, on a Calabi-Yau three-fold, of M-theory on S^1/Z_2. A crucialingredient for a consistent truncation is a non-zero mode of the antisymmetrictensor field strength which arises due to magnetic sources on the orbifoldplanes. The correct effective theory is a gauged version of five-dimensionalN=1 supergravity coupled to Abelian vector multiplets, the universalhypermultiplet and four-dimensional boundary theories with gauge and gaugematter fields. The gauging is such that the dual of the four-form fieldstrength in the universal multiplet is charged under a particular linearcombination of the Abelian vector fields. In addition, the theory has potentialterms for the moduli in the bulk as well as on the boundary. Because of thesepotential terms, the supersymmetric ground state of the theory is amulti-charged BPS three-brane domain wall, which we construct in general. Weshow that the five-dimensional theory together with this solution provides thecorrect starting point for particle phenomenology as well as early universecosmology. As an application, we compute the four-dimensional N=1 supergravitytheory for the complete (1,1) sector to leading nontrivial order by a reductionon the domain wall background. We find a correction to the matter field Kahlerpotential and threshold corrections to the gauge kinetic functions.
