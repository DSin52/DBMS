We consider a free massive spinor field in Euclidean Anti-de Sitter space.The usual Dirac action in bulk is supplemented by a certain boundary term. Theboundary conditions of the field are parametrized by a spinor on the boundary,subject to a projection. We calculate the dependence of the partition functionon this boundary spinor. The result agrees with the generating functional ofthe correlation functions of a quasi-primary spinor operator, of a certainscaling dimension, in a free conformal field theory on the boundary.
