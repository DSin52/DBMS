It is shown that the effective five-dimensional theory of the stronglycoupled heterotic string is a gauged version of N=1 five-dimensionalsupergravity with four-dimensional boundaries. For the universalsupermultiplets, this theory is explicitly constructed by a generalizeddimensional reduction procedure on a Calabi-Yau manifold. A crucial ingredientin the reduction is the retention of a "non-zero mode" of the four-form fieldstrength, leading to the gauging of the universal hypermultiplet by thegraviphoton. We show that this theory has an exact three-brane domain wallsolution which reduces to Witten's "deformed" Calabi-Yau background uponlinearization. This solution consists of two parallel three-branes with sourcesprovided by the four-dimensional boundary theories and constitutes theappropriate background for a reduction to four dimensions. Four-dimensionalspace-time is then identified with the three-brane worldvolume.
