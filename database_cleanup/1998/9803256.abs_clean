Title: On the value of coupling constant

Authors: P.Pronin and K.Stepanyantz

Comments: 5 pages, LATEX, 1 eps figure

Using an analogy between Bogomol'nyi bound and the harmonic oscillator inquantum mechanics we propose a possible explanation of the coupling constantnumerical value at the grand unification scale. It is found to be $1/8\pi$.
