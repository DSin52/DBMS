Utilizing coset superspace approach, dual actions of super D1-and D3-braneson $AdS_5 \times S^5$ are constructed by carrying out duality transformation ofworld-volume U(1) gauge field. Resulting world-volume actions are shown topossess expected SL(2,{\bf Z}) properties. Crucial ingredient for derivingSL(2, {\bf Z}) transformation property of the D-brane actions is covariance ofSU(2,2|4) coset superspace algebra under SO(2) rotation between twoten-dimensional Type IIB Majorana-Weyl spinors.
