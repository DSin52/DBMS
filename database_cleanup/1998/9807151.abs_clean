We recall the special features of quantum dynamics on a light-front (in aninfinite momentum frame) in string and field theory. The reason this approachdynamics for string is that of a true Newtonian many particle system, since astring bit has a fixed Newtonian mass. In contrast, each particle of a fieldtheory has a variable Newtonian mass P^+, so the Newtonian analogy actuallyrequires an infinite number of species of elementary Newtonian particles. Thiscomplication substantially weakens the value of the Newtonian analogy inapplying light-front dynamics to nonperturbative problems. Motivated by thefact that conventional field theories can be obtained as infinite tensionlimits of string theories, we propose a way to recast field theory as astandard Newtonian system. We devise and analyze some simple quantum mechanicalsystems that display the essence of the proposal, and we discuss prospects forapplying these ideas to large N_c QCD.
