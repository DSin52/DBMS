We use the Matrix formalism to investigate what happens to strings above theHagedorn temperaure. We show that it is not a limiting temperature but atemperature at which the continuum string picture breaks down. We study acollection of $N$ D-0-branes arranged to form a string having $N$ units oflight cone momentum. We find that at high temperatures the favoured phase isone where the string world sheet has disappeared and the low energy degrees offreedom consists of $N^2$ massless particles (``gluons''). The nature of thetransition is very similar to the deconfinement transition in large-N YangMills theories.
