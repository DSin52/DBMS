We present and analyze solutions of D=11 supergravity describing the``near-horizon'' (i.e., asymptotically AdS_4 x S^7) geometry of M2-braneswrapped on surfaces of arbitrary genus. We study the forces experienced by testM2-branes in such backgrounds, and find evidence that extremal branes onsurfaces of genera higher than the torus are unstable. Using the holographicconnection between AdS spaces and superconformal field theories in the large Nlimit, we discuss the phases of the associated 2+1 dimensional theories.Finally, we also study the extension of these solutions to other branes, inparticular to D2-branes.
