We review our recent work, hep-th/9803030, on the constraints imposed byglobal or local symmetries on perturbative quantum field theories. The analysisis performed in the Bogoliubov-Shirkov-Epstein-Glaser formulation ofperturbative quantum field theory. In this formalism the S-matrix isconstructed directly in the asymptotic Fock space with only input causality andPoincare invariance. We reformulate the symmetry condition proposed in ourearlier work in terms of interacting Noether currents.
