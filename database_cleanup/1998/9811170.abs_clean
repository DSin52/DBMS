In this work we use the Matrix Model of Strings in order to extract somenon-perturbative information on how the Hagedorn critical temperature arisesfrom eleven-dimensional physics. We study the thermal behavior of M and Matrixtheories on the compactification backgrounds that correspond to string models.We obtain some information that allows us to state that the Hagedorntemperature is not unique for all Matrix String models and we are also able tosketch how the $S$-duality transformation works in this framework.
