clarifications concerning Seiberg dualityJournal-ref: JHEP 9901 (1999) 022

We study the T duality between a set of type IIB D3 branes atnon-orbifoldthreefold singularities, and type IIA configurations of D4 branes stretchedbetween relatively rotated NS fivebranes. The four-dimensional N=1 fieldtheories on the D3 brane world-volume can be easily described using the IIAbrane configuration. These models include families of chiral theoriescontinuously connected to the theories appearing in brane box models (or D3branes at orbifold singularities). We propose that phase transitions in theK\"ahler moduli space of the singularity are related to the crossing of rotatedNS fivebranes in the T dual picture, and thus to Seiberg's duality in one ofthe gauge factors. We also comment on the inclusion of orientifold planes inthe IIA brane picture.
