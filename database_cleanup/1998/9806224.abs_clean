We study the M-theory five-brane wrapped around the Seiberg-Witten curves forpure classical and exceptional groups given by an integrable system.Generically, the D4-branes arise as cuts that collapse to points aftercompactifying the eleventh dimension and going to the semiclassical limit,producing brane configurations of NS5- and D4-branes with N=2 gauge theories onthe world volume of the four-branes. We study the symmetries of the differentcurves to see how orientifold planes are related to the involutions needed toobtain the distinguished Prym variety of the curve. This explains thesubtleties encountered for the Sp(2n) and SO(2n +1). Using this approach weinvestigate the curves for exceptional groups, especially G_2 and E_6, and showthat unlike for classical groups taking the semiclassical ten dimensional limitdoes not reduce the cuts to D4-branes. For G_2 we find a genus two quotientcurve that contains the Prym and has the right properties to describe the G_2field theory, but the involutions are far more complicated than the ones forclassical groups. To realize them in M-theory instead of an orientifold planewe would need another object, a kind of curved orientifold surface.
