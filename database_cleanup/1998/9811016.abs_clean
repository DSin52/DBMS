Polymomentum canonical theories, which are manifestly covariantmulti-parameter generalizations of the Hamiltonian formalism to field theory,are considered as a possible basis of quantization. We arrive at amulti-parameter hypercomplex generalization of quantum mechanics to fieldtheory in which the algebra of complex numbers and a time parameter arereplaced by the space-time Clifford algebra and space-time variables treated ina manifestly covariant fashion. The corresponding covariant generalization ofthe Schroedinger equation is shown to be consistent with several aspects of thecorrespondence principle such as a relation to the De Donder-WeylHamilton-Jacobi theory in the classical limit and the Ehrenfest theorem. Arelation of the corresponding wave function (over a finite dimensionalconfiguration space of field and space-time variables) to the Schroedinger wavefunctional in quantum field theory is examined in the ultra-localapproximation.
