We derive a long distance effective action for space-time coordinates from aIIB matrix model. It provides us an effective tool to study the structures ofspace-time. We prove the finiteness of the theory for finite $N$ to all ordersof the perturbation theory. Space-time is shown to be inseparable and itsdimensionality is dynamically determined. The IIB matrix model contains amechanism to ensure the vanishing cosmological constant which does not rely onthe manifest supersymmetry. We discuss possible mechanisms to obtain realisticdimensionality and gauge groups from the IIB matrix model.
