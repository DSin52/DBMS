We study the effect of the gravitational Chern-Simons term (GCST) in the(2+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS$_{2+1}$) geometry. In the context of thegauge gravity, we obtain black hole solution and its boundary WZW theory. TheBTZ black hole solution can still be retrieved but its gravitational mass andangular momentum become different from their inherent values. The deformationon these quantities due to the GCST can be summarized as $SO(1,1)$ timesrescaling. The boundary WZW theory is found to be chiral, i.e., composed of theright moving part and the left moving part with different Kac-Moody levels. Thestatistical entropy is proportional to the area only for the large levels andvanishing GCST limit, but its coefficient is not the correct order in theNewton constant $G$. Some related physics are discussed.
