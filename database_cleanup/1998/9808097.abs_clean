We examine supersymmetry of four-dimensional asymptotically anti-de Sitter(AdS) dyonic black holes in the context of gauged N=2 supergravity. Ourcalculations concentrate on black holes with unusual topology and theirrotating generalizations, but we also reconsider the spherical rotating dyonicKerr-Newman-AdS black hole, whose supersymmetry properties have previously beeninvestigated by Kosteleck\'{y} and Perry within another approach. We find thatin the case of spherical, toroidal or cylindrical event horizon topology, theblack holes must rotate in order to preserve some supersymmetry; thenon-rotating supersymmetric configurations representing naked singularities.However, we show that this is no more true for black holes whose event horizonsare Riemann surfaces of genus $g>1$, where we find a nonrotating extremalsolitonic black hole carrying magnetic charge and permitting one Killingspinor. For the nonrotating supersymmetric configurations of varioustopologies, all Killing spinors are explicitly constructed.
