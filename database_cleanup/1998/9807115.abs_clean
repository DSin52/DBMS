Our goal is to study the supermembrane on an $AdS_4 \times \cal M_7$background, where $\cal M_7$ is a 7--dimensional Einstein manifold with $N$Killing spinors. This is a direct way to derive the $Osp(N|4)$ singleton fieldtheory with all the additional properties inherited from the geometry of theinternal manifold. As a first example we consider the maximally supersymmetric$Osp(8|4)$ singleton corresponding to the choice $\cal M_7 = S^7$. We find theexplicit form of the action of the membrane coupled to this background geometryand show its invariance under non--linearly realised superconformaltransformations. To do this we introduce a supergroup generalisation of thesolvable Lie algebra parametrisation of non--compact coset spaces. We alsoderive the action of quantum fluctuations around the classical configuration,showing that this is precisely the singleton action. We find that the singletonis simply realised as a free field theory living on flat Minkowski space.
