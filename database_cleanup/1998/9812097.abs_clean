We show that a system of parallel D3 branes near a conifold singularity canbe mapped onto an intersecting configuration of orthogonal branes in type IIAstring theory. Using this brane configuration, we analyze the Higgs modulispace of the associated field theory. The dimension of the Higgs moduli spaceis computed from a geometrical analysis of the conifold singularity. Ourresults provide evidence for an extended s-rule. In addition, a discrepancybetween the prediction of the brane configuration and the result obtained froma geometrical anaysis is noted. This discrepancy is traced back to worldsheetinstanton effects.
