Calogero-Moser SystemsAuthors: E. D'Hoker and D.H. Phong

Comments: 14 pages, Plain TeX, no figures

The classical order parameters for the $\N=2$ supersymmetric SU(N) gaugetheory with matter in the adjoint representation are exhibited explicitly asconservation laws for the elliptic Calogero-Moser system. Central to theconstruction are certain elliptic function identities, which arise fromconsidering Feynman diagrams in a theory of free fermions with twisted boundaryconditions.
