The vacuum structure of N=2 (and N=4) SUSY Yang-Mills theory is analyzed indetail by considering the effective potential for constant background scalar-magnetic fields within different approximations. We compare the one-loopapproximation with- or without instanton improved effective coupling with theone-loop result in the dual desription. For N=2 we find that non-perturbativemonopole degrees of freedom remove the non-trivial minima present in the(improved) one-loop potential in the strong-coupling regime. The combination ofYang-Mills and dual desription leads to a self-consistent effective potentialover the full range of background fields.
