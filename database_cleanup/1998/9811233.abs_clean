In this article a non--technical survey is given of the present status ofAxiomatic Quantum Field Theory and interesting future directions of thisapproach are outlined. The topics covered are the universal structure of thelocal algebras of observables, their relation to the underlying fields and thesignificance of their relative positions. Moreover, the physical interpretationof the theory is discussed with emphasis on problems appearing in gaugetheories, such as the revision of the particle concept, the determination ofsymmetries and statistics from the superselection structure, the analysis ofthe short distance properties and the specific features of relativistic thermalstates. Some problems appearing in quantum field theory on curved spacetimesare also briefly mentioned.(Talk given at Ringberg Symposium on Quantum Field Theory, Ringberg Castle,June 1998)
