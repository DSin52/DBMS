We consider models in which nonrelativistic matter fields interact with gaugefields whose dynamics are governed by the Chern-Simons term. The relevantequations of motion are derived and reduced dimensionally in time or in space.Interesting solitonic equations emerge and their solutions are described.Finally, we consider a Chern-Simons term in three-dimensional Euclidean space,reduced by spherical symmetry, and we discuss its effect on monopole andinstanton solutions.
