We generalize the Maldacena correspondence to the logarithmic conformal fieldtheories. We study the correspondence between field theories in(d+1)-dimensional AdS space and the d-dimensional logarithmic conformal fieldtheories in the boundary of $AdS_{d+1}$. Using this correspondence, we get then-point functions of the corresponding logarithmic conformal field theory ind-dimensions.
