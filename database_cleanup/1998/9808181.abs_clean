In this note we extend our work in a previous paper hep-th/9801038. We showhere that various intersecting brane-like configurations can be found in thevacuum of $D=4, N=4$ supergravity with gauged R-symmetry group $SU(2)\timesSU(2)$. These include intersections of domain-walls, strings and point-likeobjects. Some of these intersecting configurations preserve 1/2 and 1/4 ofsupersymmetry. We observe that the previously obtained $AdS_3\times R^1$ pureaxionic vacuum or `axio-vac' is an intersection of domain-wall with extendedstring with 1/2 supersymmetries. Also the solutions known as `electro-vac' withgeometry $AdS_2\times R^2$ can be simply interpreted as the intersection ofdomain-wall with point-like object.
