Starting from the working hypothesis that both physics and the correspondingmathematics have to be described by means of discrete concepts on thePlanck-scale, one of the many problems one has to face is to find the discreteprotoforms of the building blocks of continuum physics and mathematics. In thefollowing we embark on developing such concepts for irregular structures like(large) graphs or networks which are intended to emulate (some of) the genericproperties of the presumed combinatorial substratum from which continuumphysics is assumed to emerge as a coarse grained and secondary model theory. Webriefly indicate how various concepts of discrete (functional) analysis andgeometry can be naturally constructed within this framework, leaving a largerportion of the paper to the systematic developement of dimensional concepts andtheir properties, which may have a possible bearing on various branches ofmodern physics beyond quantum gravity.
