We investigate the three dimensional Georgi-Glashow model with a Chern-Simonsterm. We find that there exist complex monopole solutions of finite action.They dominate the path integral and disorder the Higgs vacuum, but electriccharges are not confined. Subtleties in the gauge fixing procedure in the pathintegral and issues related to Gribov copies are noted.
