I show that de Sitter space disintegrates into an infinite number of copiesof itself. This occurs iteratively through a quantum process involving twotypes of topology change. First a handle is created semiclassically, on whichmultiple black hole horizons form. Then the black holes evaporate anddisappear, splitting the spatial hypersurfaces into large parts. Applied tocosmology, this process leads to the production of a large or infinite numberof universes in most models of inflation and yields a new picture of globalstructure.
