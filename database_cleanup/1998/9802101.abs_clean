We study dynamical symmetry breaking in three-dimensional QED with aChern-Simons (CS) term, considering the screening effect of $N$ flavorfermions. We find a new phase of the vacuum, in which both the fermion mass anda magnetic field are dynamically generated, when the coefficient of the CS term$\kappa$ equals $N e^2/4 \pi$. The resultant vacuum becomes the finite-densitystate half-filled by fermions. For $\kappa=N e^2/2 \pi$, we find the fermionremains massless and only the magnetic field is induced. For $\kappa=0$,spontaneous magnetization does not occur and should be regarded as an externalfield.
