We aim to connect the non commutative geometry ``quotient space'' viewpointwith the standard super Yang Mills theory approach in the spirit ofConnes-Douglas-Schwartz and Douglas-Hull description of application ofnoncommutative geometry to matrix theory. This will result in a relationbetween the parameters of a rational foliation of the torus and the dimensionof the group U(N). Namely, we will be provided with a prescription which allowsto study a noncommutative geometry with rational parameter p/N by means of aU(N) gauge theory on a torus of size \Sigma / N with the boundary conditionsgiven by a system with p units of magnetic flux. The transition to irrationalparameter can be obtained by letting N and p tend to infinity with fixed ratio.The precise meaning of the limiting process will presumably allow betterclarification.
