spaceComments: 9 pages, lamuphys.sty. Talk given at Dubna International Seminar

`Supersymmetries and Quantum Summetries' dedicated to the memory of Victor I.Ogievetsky, Dubna, 22-26 June, 1997Arbitrary spin free massless bosonic fields propagating in even $d$ -dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime are investigated. Free wave equations ofmotion, subsidiary conditions and the corresponding gauge transformations forsuch fields are proposed. The lowest eigenvalues of the energy operator for themassless fields and the gauge parameter fields are derived. The results areformulated in $SO(d-1,2)$ covariant form as well as in terms of intrinsiccoordinates. An inter-relation of two definitions of masslessness based ongauge invariance and conformal invariance is discussed.
