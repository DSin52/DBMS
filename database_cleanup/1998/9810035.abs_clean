We study the regularized correlation functions of the light-like coordinateoperators in the reduction to zero dimensions of the matrix model describing$D$-particles in four dimensions. We investigate in great detail the relatedmatrix model originally proposed and solved in the planar limit by J. Hoppe. Italso gives the solution of the problem of 3-coloring of planar graphs. We findinteresting strong/weak 't Hooft coupling dependence. The partition function ofthe grand canonical ensemble turns out to be a tau-function of KP hierarchy. Asan illustration of the method we present a new derivation of the large-N anddouble-scaling limits of the one-matrix model with cubic potential.
