Order Anisotropic Superspaces (Hadronic Press, Palm Harbor, USA, 1998)260-283We propose an approach to the theory of higher order anisotropic fieldinteractions and curved spaces (in brief, ha-field, ha-interactions andha-spaces). The concept of ha-space generalises various types of Lagrange andFinsler spaces and higher dimension (Kaluza-Klein) spaces. This work consistsfrom two parts. In the first we outline the theory of Yang-Mills ha-fields andtwo gauge models of higher order anisotropic gravity are analyzed. The secondis devoted to the theory of nearly autoparallel maps (na-maps) of locallyanisotropic spaces (la-spaces) and to the problem of formulation ofconservation laws for la-field interactions.By defining invariants of na-map transforms we present a systematicclassification of la-spaces.
