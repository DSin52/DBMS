Non-extremal overlapping p-brane supergravity solutions localised in theirrelative transverse coordinates are constructed. The construction uses analgebraic method of solving the bosonic equations of motion. It is shown thatthese non-extremal solutions can be obtained from the extremal solutions bymeans of the superposition of two deformation functions defined by vacuumsolutions of M-theory. Vacuum solutions of M-theory including irrational powersof harmonic functions are discussed.
