Title: The Search for the Origins of M Theory

Loops/Strings and Bulk/Boundary DualitiesComments: 42 pages, revised latex file. Minor corrections are made and some

additions are includedThe construction of a $covariant$ Loop Wave functional equation in a 4Dspacetime is attained by introducing a generalized $eleven$ dimensionalcategorical {\bf C}-space comprised of $8\times 8$ antisymmetric matrices. Thelatter matrices encode the generalized coordinates of the histories of points,loops and surfaces $combined$. Spacetime Topology change and the Holographicprinciple are natural consequences of imposing the principle of $covariance$ in{\bf C}-space. The Planck length is introduced as a necessary rescalingparameter to establish the correspondence limit with the physics ofpoint-histories in ordinary Minkowski space, in the limit $l_P\to 0$. Spacetimequantization should appear in discrete units of Planck length, area, volume,....All this seems to suggest that the generalized principle of covariance,representing invariance of proper $area$ intervals in {\bf C}-space, undermatrix-coordinate transformations, could be relevant in discovering theunderlying principle behind the origins of $M$ theory. We construct an ansatzfor the $SU(\infty)$ Yang-Mills vacuum wavefunctional as a solution of theSchroedinger Loop Wave equation associated with the Loop Quantum Mechanicalformulation of the Eguchi-Schild String . The Strings/Loops ($SU(\infty)$ gaugefield) correspondence implements one form of the Bulk/Boundary dualityconjecture in this case.
