Recently proposed 2D anomaly induced effective actions for the matter-gravitysystem are critically reviewed. Their failure to correctly reproduce Hawking'sblack hole radiation or the stability of Minkowski space-time led us to amodification of the relevant ``quantum'' matter stress energy tensor thatallows physically meaningful results to be extracted.
