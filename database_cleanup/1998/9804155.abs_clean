Title: Second Quantization of the Stueckelberg Relativistic Quantum Theory and

Associated Gauge FieldsComments: Plain TeX, 9 pages

The gauge compensation fields induced by the differential operators of theStueckelberg-Schr\"odinger equation are discussed, as well as the relationbetween these fields and the standard Maxwell fields. An action is constructedand the second quantization of the fields carried out using a constraintprocedure. Some remarks are made on the properties of the second quantizedmatter fields.
