The problem of the classification of the extensions of the Virasoro algebrais discussed. It is shown that all $H$-reduced $\hat{\cal G}_{r}$-currentquadratic $W$-algebras, rational $U$-algebras, nonlocal $V$-algebras, nonlocalquadratic $WV$-algebras and rational nonlocal $UV$-algebras. The main newfeatures of the quantum $V$-algebras and their heighest weight representationsare demonstrated on the example of the quantum $V_{3}^{(1,1)}$-algebra.
