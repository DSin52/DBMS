The local logarithmic conformal field theory corresponding to the tripletalgebra at c=-2 is constructed. The constraints of locality and crossingsymmetry are explored in detail, and a consistent set of amplitudes is found.The spectrum of the corresponding theory is determined, and it is found to bemodular invariant. This provides the first construction of a non-chiralrational logarithmic conformal field theory, establishing that such models canindeed define bona fide conformal field theories.
