The first quantized theory of N=2, D=3 massive superparticles with arbitraryfixed central charge and (half)integer or fractional superspin is constructed.The quantum states are realized on the fields carrying a finite dimensional, ora unitary infinite dimensional representation of the supergroups OSp(2|2) orSU(1,1|2). The construction originates from quantization of a classical modelof the superparticle we suggest. The physical phase space of the classicalsuperparticle is embedded in a symplectic superspace$T^\ast({R}^{1,2})\times{L}^{1|2}$, where the inner K\"ahler supermanifold${L}^{1|2}=OSp(2|2)/[U(1)\times U(1)]=SU(1,1|2)/[U(2|2)\times U(1)]$ providesthe particle with superspin degrees of freedom. We find the relationshipbetween Hamiltonian generators of the global Poincar\'e supersymmetry and the``internal'' SU(1,1|2) one. Quantization of the superparticle combines theBerezin quantization on ${L}^{1|2}$ and the conventional Dirac quantizationwith respect to space-time degrees of freedom. Surprisingly, to retain thesupersymmetry, quantum corrections are required for the classical N=2supercharges as compared to the conventional Berezin method. These correctionsare derived and the Berezin correspondence principle for ${L}^{1|2}$ underlyingtheir origin is verified. The model admits a smooth contraction to the N=1supersymmetry in the BPS limit.
