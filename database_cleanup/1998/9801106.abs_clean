Authors: G. W. Gibbons

Comments: 11 pages Latex, no figures. This is the written version of a lecture

given at "Quantum Mechanics of Fundamental Systems VI ", Santiago, Chile,August 1997 to appear in the Proceedings edited by C. Teitelboim and J.ZanelliI describe some recent work in which classical solutions of Dirac-Born-Infeldtheory may be used to throw light on some properties of M-theory. The sourcesof Born-Infeld theory are the ends of strings ending on the world volume.Equivalently the fundamental string may be regarded as merely a thin andextended piece of the world volume.
