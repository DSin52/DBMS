analysis of hep-th/9810129 and elimination of one of the two heuristicarguments for higher loop cancellationJournal-ref: Phys.Rev. D59 (1999) 106004

We present a nonsupersymmetric orbifold of type II string theory and showthat it has vanishing cosmological constant at the one and two loop level. Weargue heuristically that the cancellation persists at higher loops.
