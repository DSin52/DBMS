Recently Faddeev and Niemi proposed a low energy effective action for pureSU(2) Yang Mills theory in 4 dimension to describe its long distance physics.The effective action is O(3) $\sigma$ model with a mass parameter, adimensionless coupling constant e and a topological term. In this work,choosing a new set of variables, we relate this $\sigma$ model to a U(1) gaugetheory with electric and magnetic charges of charge e and $4 \pi e^{-1}$respectively. In the new formulation the connection of the mass parameter withthe monopole condensate is discussed. This theory after lattice regularisationis the compact U(1) gauge theory coupled to electric charges.
