The issue discussed is a thermodynamic version of the Bern-Kosower masteramplitude formula, which contains all necessary one-loop Feynman diagrams. Itis demonstrated how the master amplitude at finite values of temperature andchemical potential can be formulated within the framework of the world-lineformalism. In particular we present an elegant method how to introduce achemical potential for a loop in the master formula. Various useful integralformulae for the master amplitude are then obtained. The non-analytic propertyof the master formula is also derived in the zero temperature limit with thevalue of chemical potential kept finite.
