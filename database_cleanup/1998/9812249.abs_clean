324-331We consider D-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories with 8 supercharges(D<6,$~\cN=8$) in the framework of harmonic superspaces. The effective Abelianlow-energy action for D=5 contains the free and Chern-Simons terms. Effective$\cN=8$ superfield actions for D<4 can be written in terms of thesuperpotentials satisfying the superfield constraints and (6-D)-dimensionalLaplace equations. The role of alternative harmonic structures is discussed.
