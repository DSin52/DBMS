Title: p-Brane Quantum Mechanical Wave Equations

Comments: 8 pages, revised Tex file

Several quantum mechanical wave equations for $p$-branes are proposed basedon the role that the volume-preserving diffeomorphisms group has on the physicsof extended objects. The $p$-brane quantum mechanical wave equations determinethe quantum dynamics involving the creation/destruction of $p$-branes in a $D$dimensional spacetime background with a given world-volume measureconfiguration in a given quantum state $\Psi$.
