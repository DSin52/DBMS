We show that the string tension in N=1 two-dimensional super Yang-Millstheory vanishes independently of the representation of the quark anti-quarkexternal source. We argue that this result persists in SQCD_2 and intwo-dimensional gauge theories with extended supersymmetry or in chiralinvariant models with at least one massless dynamical fermion. We also computethe string tension for the massive Schwinger model, as a demonstration of themethod of the calculation.
