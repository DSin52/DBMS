In this paper we discuss some aspects of the behavior of superconformal N=1models under Seiberg's duality. Our claim is that if an electric gauge theoryis superconformal on some marginal subspace of all coupling constants then itsmagnetic dual must be also superconformal on a corresponding moduli space ofdual couplings. However this does not imply that the magnetic dual of acompletely finite N=1 gauge theory is again finite. Moreover we generalize thisstatement conjecturing that also for non-superconformal N=1 models thedeterminant of the beta-function equations is invariant under Seiberg duality.During the course of this investigation we construct some superconformal N=1gauge theories which were not yet discussed before.
