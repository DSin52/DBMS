We study anomalous Wess-Zumino couplings of D-branes and O-planes in ageneral background and derive them from a direct string computation byfactorizing in the RR channel various one-loop amplitudes. In particular, wefind that Op-planes present gravitational anomalous couplings involving theHirzebruch polynomial L, similarly to the roof genus A encoding Dp-braneanomalous couplings. We determine, in each case, the precise dependence ofthese couplings on the curvature of the tangent and normal bundles.
