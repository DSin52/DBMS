We develop a Lagrangian approach for constructing a symplectic structure forsingular systems. It gives a simple and unified framework for understanding theorigin of the pathologies that appear in the Dirac-Bergmann formalism, andoffers a more general approach for a symplectic formalism, even when there isno Hamiltonian in a canonical sense. We can thus overcome the usual limitationsof the canonical quantization, and perform an algebraically consistentquantization for a more general set of Lagrangian systems.
