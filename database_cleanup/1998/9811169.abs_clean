Monopoles and solitons have important topological aspects like quantizedfluxes, winding numbers and curved target spaces. Naive discretizations whichsubstitute a lattice of points for the underlying manifolds are incapable ofretaining these features in a precise way. We study these problems of discretephysics and matrix models and discuss mathematically coherent discretizationsof monopoles and solitons using fuzzy physics and noncommutative geometry. Afuzzy sigma-model action for the two-sphere fulfilling a fuzzy Belavin-Polyakovbound is also put forth.
