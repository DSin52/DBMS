Recently, a relation between N=4 Super Yang Mills in 3+1 dimensions andsupergravity in an $AdS_5$ background has been proposed. In this paper weexplore the idea that the correspondence between operators in the Yang Millstheory and modes of the supergravity theory can be obtained by using the D3brane action. Specifically, we consider two form gauge fields for this purpose.The supergravity analysis predicts that the operator which corresponds to thismode has dimension six. We show that this is indeed the leading operator in thethree brane Dirac-Born-Infeld and Wess-Zumino action which couples to thismode. It is important in the analysis that the brane action is expanded aroundthe anti de-Sitter background. Also, the Wess-Zumino term plays a crucial rolein cancelling a lower dimension operator which appears in the theDirac-Born-Infeld action.
