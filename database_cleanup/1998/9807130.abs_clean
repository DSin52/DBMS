The hyperplane and proper time formalisms are discussed mainly for thespin-half particles in the quantum case. A connection between these covariantHamiltonian formalisms is established. It is showed that choosing thespace-like hyperplanes instantaneously orthogonal to the direction of motion ofthe particle the proper time formalism is retrieved on the mass shell. As aconsequence, the relation between the St\"uckelberg-Feynman picture and thestandard canonical picture of quantum field theory is clarified.
