A simple WKB approximation gives explicit information about D0braneboundstate wavefunctions, suggesting that at large $N$ each individual D0branehas a wavefunction $\exp(- c r^{9/2}N^{-1/2}).$ Thus the velocity dependentinteraction energy $v^{4}r^{-7}$ leads to an effective confining potential thatgrows as $r^{7}.$
