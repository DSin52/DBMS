We consider N=1 two-dimensional (2d) dilatonic supergravity (SG), 2ddilatonic SG obtained by dimensional reduction from N=1 four-dimensional (4d)SG, N=2 2d dilatonic SG and string-inspired 4d dilatonic SG. For all thetheories, the corresponding action on a bosonic background is constructed andthe interaction with $N$ (dilatonic) Wess-Zumino (WZ) multiplets is presented.Working in the large-N approximation, it is enough to consider the traceanomaly induced effective action due to dilaton-coupled conformal matter as aquantum correction (for 2d models s-waves approximation is additionally used).The equations of motion for all such models with quantum corrections arewritten in a form convenient for numerical analysis. Their solutions arenumerically investigated for 2d and 4d Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) or 4dKantowski-Sacks Universes with a time-dependent dilaton via exponential dilatoncoupling. The evolution of the corresponding quantum cosmological models isgiven for different choices of initial conditions and theory parameters. Inmost cases we find quantum singular Universes. Nevertheless, there are examplesof Universe non-singular at early times. Hence, it looks unlikely that quantummatter back reaction on dilatonic background (at least in large $N$approximation) may really help to solve the singularity problem.
