Title: Alternative bi-Hamiltonian structures for WDVV equations of

associativityAuthors: J. Kalayci and Y. Nutku

Journal-ref: J.Phys. A31 (1998) 723

The WDVV equations of associativity in 2-d topological field theory arecompletely integrable third order Monge-Amp\`ere equations which admitbi-Hamiltonian structure. The time variable plays a distinguished role in thediscussion of Hamiltonian structure whereas in the theory of WDVV equationsnone of the independent variables merits such a distinction. WDVV equationsadmit very different alternative Hamiltonian structures under differentpossible choices of the time variable but all these various Hamiltonianformulations can be brought together in the framework of the covariant theoryof symplectic structure. They can be identified as different components of thecovariant Witten-Zuckerman symplectic 2-form current density where avariational formulation of the WDVV equation that leads to the Hamiltonianoperator through the Dirac bracket is available.
