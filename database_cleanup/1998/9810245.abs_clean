Starting with the 2+1 Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton system with a cosmologicalconstant and assuming two commuting Killing symmetries we derive thecorresponding $1+0 \sigma$--model. It is shown that, for general values of thecoupling parameters, the $T$--duality group is $SL(2,R)$, which coincides withthe group of linear coordinate transformations along the Killing orbits. Thisduality, along with a suitable parameter choice, is applied to obtain some newBrans--Dicke and Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton.
