The problem of Wu-Yang ambiguities in 3 dimensions is related to the problemof existence of torsion free driebeins for an arbitrary potential. Theambiguity is only at the level of boundary conditions. We also find that in 3dimensions any smooth Yang-Mills field tensor can be uniquely written as thenon-Abelian magnetic field of a smooth Yang-Mills potential.
