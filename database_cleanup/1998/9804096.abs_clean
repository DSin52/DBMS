We provide the first example of a cosmological solution of the Horava-Wittensupergravity. This solution is obtained by exchanging the role of time with theradial coordinate of the transverse space to the five-brane soliton. On theboundary this corresponds to rotating an instanton solution into a tunnelingprocess in a space with Lorentzian signature, leading to an expanding universe.Due to the freedom to choose different non-trivial Yang-Mills backgrounds onthe boundaries, the two walls of the universe ( visible and hidden worlds)expand differently. However at late times the anisotropy is washed away bygravitational interactions.
