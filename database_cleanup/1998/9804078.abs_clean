We demonstrate how some problems arising in simplicial quantum gravity can besuccessfully addressed within the framework of combinatorial group theory. Inparticular, we argue that the number of simplicial 3-manifolds having a fixedhomology type grows exponentially with the number of tetrahedra they are madeof. We propose a model of 3D gravity interacting with scalar fermions, somerestriction of which gives the 2-dimensional self-avoiding-loop-gas matrixmodel. We propose a qualitative picture of the phase structure of 3D simplicialgravity compatible with the numerical experiments and available analyticalresults.
