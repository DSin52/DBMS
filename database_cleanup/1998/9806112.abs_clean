We present an efficient method to understand the p-brane dynamics in aunified framework. For this purpose, we reformulate the action for superp-branes in the form appropriate to incorporate the pointlike (parton)structure of higher dimensional p-branes and intend to interpret the p-branedynamics as the collective dynamics of superparticles. In order to examine sucha parton picture of super p-branes, we consider various superparticleconfigurations that can be reduced from super p-branes, especially, asupermembrane, and study the partonic structure of classical p-brane solutions.
