The large N limit of the Gross-Neveu model is here studied on manifolds withconstant curvature, at zero and finite temperature. Using the zeta-functionregularization, the phase structure is investigated for arbitrary values of thecoupling constant. The critical surface where the second order phase transitiontakes place is analytically found for both the positive and negative curvaturecases. For negative curvature, where the symmetry is always broken at zerotemperature, the mass gap is calculated. The free energy density is evaluatedat criticality and the zero curvature and zero temperature limits arediscussed.
