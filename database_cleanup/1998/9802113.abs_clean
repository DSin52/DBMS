For N=1 Super-Yang-Mills theory we generalize the effective average actionGamma_k in a manifest supersymmetric way using the superspace formalism. Theexact evolution equation for Gamma_k is derived and, introducing as anapplication a simple truncation, the standard one-loop beta-function of N=1 SYMtheory is obtained.
