We apply an improved version of Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin (BFT) Hamiltonianmethod to the a=1 chiral Schwinger Model, which is much more nontrivial thanthe a>1.$ one. Furthermore, through the path integral quantization, we newlyresolve the problem of the non-trivial $\delta$ function as well as that of theunwanted Fourier parameter $\xi$ in the measure. As a result, we explicitlyobtain the fully gauge invariant partition function, which includes a new typeof Wess-Zumino (WZ) term irrelevant to the gauge symmetry as well as usual WZaction.
