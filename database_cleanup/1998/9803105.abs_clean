The Casimir energy of a solid ball (or cavity in an infinite medium) iscalculated by a direct frequency summation using the contour integration. Thedispersion is taken into account, and the divergences are removed by making useof the zeta function technique. The Casimir energy of a dielectric ball (orcavity) turns out to be positive, it being increased when the radius of theball decreases. The latter eliminates completely the possibility of explaining,via the Casimir effect, the sonoluminescence for bubbles in a liquid. Besides,the Casimir energy of the air bubbles in water proves to be immensely smallerthan the amount of the energy emitted in a sonoluminescent flash. Thedispersive effect is shown to be inessential for the final result.
