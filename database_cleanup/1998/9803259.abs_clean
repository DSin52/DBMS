We study the Euclidean-signature supergravities that arise by compactifyingD=11 supergravity or type IIB supergravity on a torus that includes the timedirection. We show that the usual T-duality relation between type IIA and typeIIB supergravities compactified on a spatial circle no longer holds if thereduction is performed on the time direction. Thus there are two inequivalentEuclidean-signature nine-dimensional maximal supergravities. They becomeequivalent upon further spatial compactification to D=8. We also show thatduality symmetries of Euclidean-signature supergravities allow the harmonicfunctions of any single-charge or multi-charge instanton to be rescaled andshifted by constant factors. Combined with the usual diagonal dimensionalreduction and oxidation procedures, this allows us to use the dualitysymmetries to map any single-charge or multi-charge p-brane soliton, or anyintersection, into its near-horizon regime. Similar transformations can also bemade on non-extremal p-branes. We also study the structures of dualitymultiplets of instanton and (D-3)-brane solutions.
