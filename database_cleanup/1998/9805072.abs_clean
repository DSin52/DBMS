Starting from certain 3D non-abelian dual systems, we discuss a number ofrelated dual systems in 2D, some of which are obtained by dimensionalreduction. The dualities relate massive scalar and vector fields, and may berelevant for string theory in the context of massive type IIA supergravity.Supersymmetric extensions of the models are also presented.
