We derive the Ward-Takahashi identity obeyed by the fermion-antifermion-gaugeboson vertex in ladder QED in the presence of a constant magnetic field. Thegeneral structure in momentum space of the fermion mass operator with externalelectromagnetic field is discussed. Using it we find the solutions of theladder WT identity with magnetic field. The consistency of our results with thesolutions of the corresponding Schwinger-Dyson equation ensures the gaugeinvariance of the magnetic field induced chiral symmetry breaking recentlyfound in ladder QED.
