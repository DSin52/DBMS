We study the type IIB brane box configurations recently introduced by Hananyand Zaffaroni. We show that even at finite string coupling, one can constructsmooth configurations of branes with fairly arbitrary gauge and flavorstructure. Limiting our attention to the better understood case where NS-branesdo not intersect over a four dimensional surface gives some restrictions on thetheories, but still permits many examples, both anomalous and non-anomalous. Wegive several explicit examples of such configurations and discuss whatconstraints can be imposed on brane-box theories from bending considerations.We also discuss the relation between brane bending and beta-functions forbrane-box configurations.
