We consider the conformally-invariant coupling of topologically massivegravity to a dynamical massless scalar field theory on a three-manifold withboundary. We show that, in the phase of spontaneously broken Lorentz and Weylsymmetries, this theory induces the target space zero mode of the vertexoperator for the string dilaton field on the boundary of the three-dimensionalmanifold. By a further coupling to topologically massive gauge fields in thebulk, we demonstrate directly from the three-dimensional theory that thisdilaton field transforms in the expected way under duality transformations soas to preserve the mass gaps in the spectra of the gauge and gravitationalsectors of the quantum field theory. We show that this implies an intimatedynamical relationship between T-duality and S-duality transformations of thequantum string theory. The dilaton in this model couples bulk and worldsheetdegrees of freedom to each other and generates a dynamical string coupling.
