We review some aspects of the construction of self-dual gravity and theassociated field theory of ${\cal N}=2$ strings in terms of two-dimensionalsigma models at large $N$. The theory is defined through a large $N$Wess-Zumino-Witten model in a nontrivial background and in a particular doublescaling limit. We examine the canonical structure of the theory and describe aninfinite-dimensional Poisson algebra of currents.
