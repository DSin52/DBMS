The Casimir effect for Dirac as well as for scalar charged particles isinfluenced by external magnetic fields. It is also influenced by finitetemperature. Here we consider the Casimir effect for a charged scalar fieldunder the combined influence of an external magnetic field and finitetemperature. The free energy for such a system is computed using Schwinger'smethod for the calculation of the effective action in the imaginary timeformalism. We consider both the limits of strong and weak magnetic field inwhich we compute the Casimir free energy and pressure.
