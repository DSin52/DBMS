We use different techniques to analyze the system formed by a D0 brane and aD6 brane (with background gauge fields) in relative motion. In particular,using the closed string formalism of boosted boundary states, we show thepresence of a term linear in the velocity, corresponding to the Lorentz forceexperienced by the D0 brane moving in the magnetic background produced by theD6 brane. This term, that was missed in previous analyses of this system, comesentirely from the R-R odd spin structure and is also reproduced by a M(atrix)theory calculation.
