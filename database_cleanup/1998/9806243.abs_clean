Lorentz covariant generalisations of the notions of supersymmetry, superspaceand self-duality are discussed. The essential idea is to extend standardconstructions by allowing tangent vectors and coordinates which transformaccording to more general Lorentz representations than solely the spinorial andvectorial ones of standard lore. Such superspaces provide model configurationspaces for theories of arbitrary spin fields. Our framework is an elegant onefor handling higher-dimensional theories in a manifestly SO(3,1) covariantfashion. A further application is the construction of a hierarchy of solvableLorentz covariant systems generalising four-dimensional self-duality.
