A foundational investigation of the basic structural properties oftwo-dimensional anomalous gauge theories is performed. The Hilbert space isconstructed as the representation of the intrinsic local field algebragenerated by the fundamental set of field operators whose Wightman functionsdefine the model. We examine the effect of the use of a redundant field algebrain deriving basic properties of the models and show that different results mayarise, as regards the physical properties of the generalized chiral model, inrestricting or not the Hilbert space as representation of the intrinsic localfield algebra. The question referring to considering the vector Schwinger modelas a limit of the generalized anomalous model is also discussed. We show thatthis limit can only be consistently defined for a field subalgebra of thegeneralized model.
