A worldvolume action for membrane is considered to study the target spacelocal symmetries. We introduce a set of generators of canonical transformationsto exhibit the target space symmetries such as the general coordinatetransformation and the gauge transformation of antisymmetric tensor field.Similar results are derived for type IIB string with manifestlyS-duality-invariant worldsheet action.
