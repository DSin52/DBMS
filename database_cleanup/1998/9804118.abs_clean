In the framework leading to the multiplicative anomaly formula ---which ishere proven to be valid even in cases of known spectrum but non-compactmanifold (very important in Physics)--- zeta-function regularisation techniquesare shown to be extremely efficient. Dirac like operators and harmonicoscillators are investigated in detail, in any number of space dimensions. Theyyield a non-zero anomaly which, on the other hand, can always be expressed bymeans of a simple analytical formula. These results are used in severalphysical examples, where the determinant of a product of differential operatorsis not equal to the product of the corresponding functional determinants. Thesimplicity of the Hamiltonian operators chosen is aimed at showing that suchsituation may be quite widespread in mathematical physics. However, theconsequences of the existence of the determinant anomaly have often beenoverlooked.
