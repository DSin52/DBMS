The properties of a nonrelativistic charged particle in two dimensions in thepresence of an arbitrary number of nonquantized magnetic fluxes areinvestigated in free space as well as in a uniform magnetic field. The fluxesare represented mathematically as branch points in one of the complexcoordinates. It is found that in order to construct solutions, the fluxes haveto be treated in general as dynamical objects dual to the charges. A mediummade up of fluxes acts like an anti-magnetic field and tends to expel thecharges.
