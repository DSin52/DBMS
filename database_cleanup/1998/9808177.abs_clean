Recent results in the literature concerning holography indicate that thethermodynamics of quantum gravity (at least with a negative cosmologicalconstant) can be modeled by the large N thermodynamics of quantum field theory.We emphasize that this suggests a completely unitary evolution of processes inquantum gravity, including black hole formation and decay; and even moreextreme examples involving topology change. As concrete examples which showthat this correspondence holds even when the space-time is only locallyasymptotically AdS, we compute the thermodynamical phase structure of theAdS-Taub-NUT and AdS-Taub-Bolt spacetimes, and compare them to a 2+1dimensional conformal field theory (at large N) compactified on a squashedthree sphere, and on the twisted plane.
