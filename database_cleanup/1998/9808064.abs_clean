In order to get the general framework describing a nonlocalizable objectbeyond the bilocal field theory early proposed by Markov and Yukawa, thequantization of space-time is reconsidered and further developed. Space-timequantities are there not only noncommutative with U-field describing thenonlocalizable object, as in the bilocal field theory, but also becomenoncommutative among themselves. Under the U-field representation, where thebasis vectors of representation are chosen to be eigenvectors of operator U,space-time quantities get a matrix representation of infinite dimension ingeneral. Field equation is considered, which determines the relation betweenspace-time quantities and U-field. The possible inner relation between therecent topics of matrix model in superstring theory and the present approach isdiscussed.
