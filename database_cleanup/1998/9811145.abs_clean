In the context of brane solutions of supergravity, we discuss a generalmethod to introduce collective modes of any spin by exploiting a particular wayof breaking symmetries. The method is applied to the D3, M2 and M5 branes andwe derive explicit expressions for how the zero-modes enter the target spacefields, verify normalisability in the transverse directions and derive thecorresponding field equations on the brane. In particular, the method providesa clear understanding of scalar, spinor, and rank r tensorial Goldstone modes,chiral as well as non-chiral, and how they arise from the gravity,Rarita-Schwinger, and rank r+1 Kalb-Ramond tensor gauge fields, respectively.Some additional observations concerning the chiral tensor modes on the M5 braneare discussed.
