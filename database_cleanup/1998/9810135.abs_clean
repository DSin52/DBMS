We investigate the connection between the BTZ black holes and thenear-horizon geometry of higher-dimensional black holes. Under mild conditions,we show that (i) if a black hole has a global structure of the type of thenon-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes, its near-horizon geometry is$AdS_2$ times a sphere, and further (ii) if such a black hole is obtained froma boosted black string by dimensional reduction, the near-horizon geometry ofthe latter contains a BTZ black hole. Because of these facts, the calculationof the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and the absorption cross-sections of scalarfields is essentially reduced to the corresponding calculation in the BTZgeometry under appropriate conditions. This holds even if the geometry is notsupersymmetric in the extremal limit. Several examples are discussed. We alsodiscuss some generalizations to geometries which do not have $AdS$ near thehorizon.
