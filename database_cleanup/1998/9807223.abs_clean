We propose a world-sheet realization of the zigzag-invariant bosonic andfermionic strings as a perturbed Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model at largenegative level $k$ on a group manifold $G$ coupled to 2D gravity. In the large$k$ limit the zigzag symmetry can be obtained as a result of a self-consistentsolution of the gravitationally dressed RG equation. The only solution foundfor simple group is $G=SL(2)$. More general target-space geometries can beobtained via tensoring of various cosets based on SL(2). In the supersymmetriccase the zigzag symmetry fixes the maximal target-space dimension of theconfining fermionic string to be seven.
