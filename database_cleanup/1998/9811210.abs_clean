The energy eigenvalues of the quantum particle constrained in a surface ofthe sphere of D dimensions embedded in a $R^{D+1}$ space are obtained by usingsquaring the expression of the momentum, written in cartesian components, whichsatisfies the Dirac brackets between the canonical operators of this secondclass system. We use the Weyl ordering prescription to construct the Hermitianoperators. When D=2 we verify that there is no constant parameter in theexpression of the eigenvalues energy, a result that is in agreement with thefact that an extra term would change the level spacings in the hydrogen atom;in the second procedure it is adopted the non-abelian BFFT formalism to convertthe second class constraints into first class ones. The non-abelian first classHamiltonian operator is symmetrized by also using the Weyl ordering rule. Weobserve that their energy eigenvalues differ from a constant parameter when wecompare with the second class system. Thus, a conversion of the D-dimensionalsphere second class system for a first class one does not reproduce the samevalues.
