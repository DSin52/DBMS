A non-linear sigma model mimicking the Skyrme model on S_3 is proposed and afamily of classical solutions to the equations are constructed numerically. Thesolutions terminate into catastrophe-like spikes at critical values of theSkyrme coupling constant and, when this constant is zero, they coincide withthe series of Harmonic maps on S_3 constructed some years ago by P. Bizon.
