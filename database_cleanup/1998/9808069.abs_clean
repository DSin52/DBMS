Dualities link M-theory, the 10+1 dimensional strong coupling limit of theIIA string, to other 11-dimensional theories in signatures 9+2 and 6+5, and totype II string theories in all 10-dimensional signatures. We study theFreund-Rubin-type compactifications and brane-type solutions of these theories,and find that branes with various world-volume signatures are possible. Forexample, the 9+2 dimensional M* theory has membrane-type solutions withworld-volumes of signature (3,0) and (1,2), and a solitonic solution withworld-volume signature (5,1).
