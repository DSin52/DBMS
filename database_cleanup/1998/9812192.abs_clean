The principal admissible representations of affine Kac-Moody algebras arestudied, with a view to their use in conformal field theory. We discuss thegeneration of the set of principal admissible highest weights, concentratingmainly on $A_r^{(1)}$ at rational level $k$. A related algorithm is describedthat produces the Malikov-Feigen-Fuchs null vectors of these representations.With the principal admissible description of the highest weights, we are ableto prove that field identifications (including maverick ones) lead to thecanonical description of the primary fields of the nonunitary diagonal cosettheories.
