Recently, it has been proposed by Maldacena that large $N$ limits of certainconformal field theories in $d$ dimensions can be described in terms ofsupergravity (and string theory) on the product of $d+1$-dimensional $AdS$space with a compact manifold. Here we elaborate on this idea and propose aprecise correspondence between conformal field theory observables and those ofdependence of the supergravity action on the asymptotic behavior at infinity.In particular, dimensions of operators in conformal field theory are given bymasses of particles in supergravity. As quantitative confirmation of thiscorrespondence, we note that the Kaluza-Klein modes of Type IIB supergravity on$AdS_5\times {\bf S}^5$ match with the chiral operators of $\N=4$ superYang-Mills theory in four dimensions. With some further assumptions, one candeduce a Hamiltonian version of the correspondence and show that the $\N=4$theory has a large $N$ phase transition related to the thermodynamics of $AdS$black holes.
