The light-cone Hamiltonian approach is applied to the super D2-brane, and theequivalent area--preserving and U(1) gauge-invariant effective Lagrangian,which is quadratic in the U(1) gauge field, is derived. The latter isrecognised to be that of the three-dimensional U(1) gauge theory, interactingwith matter supermultiplets, in a special external induced supergravity metricand the gravitino field, depending on matter fields. The duality between thistheory and 11d supermembrane theory is demonstrated in the light-cone gauge.
