The statistical entropy of a five-dimensional black hole in Type II stringtheory was recently derived by showing that it is U-dual to thethree-dimensional Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole, and using Carlip'smethod to count the microstates of the latter. This is valid even for thenon-extremal case, unlike the derivation which relies on D-brane techniques. Inthis letter, I shall exploit the U-duality that exists between thefive-dimensional black hole and the two-dimensional charged black hole ofMcGuigan, Nappi and Yost, to microscopically compute the entropy of the latter.It is shown that this result agrees with previous calculations usingthermodynamic arguments.
