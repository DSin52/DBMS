We study supersymmetric QCD with N_f<N_c in the limit of smallsupersymmetry-breaking masses and smaller quark masses using the weak-couplingKahler potential. We calculate the full spectrum of this theory, whichmanifests a chiral symmetry breaking pattern similar to that caused by thestrong interactions of the standard model. We derive the chiral effectivelagrangian for the pion degrees of freedom, and discuss the behavior in theformal limit of large squark and gluino masses and for large N_c. We show thatthe resulting scalings of the pion decay constant and pion masses in theselimits differ from those expected in ordinary nonsupersymmetric QCD. Althoughthere is no weak coupling expansion with N_f=N_c, we extend our results to thiscase by constructing a superfield quantum modified constraint in the presenceof supersymmetry breaking.
