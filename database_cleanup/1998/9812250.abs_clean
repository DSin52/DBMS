Title: Integrability of the RG flows and the bulk/boundary correspondence

Comments: Latex, 16 pages

We suggest that RG flows in the N=2 SUSY YM theories are governed by the pairof the integrable systems. The main dynamical ingredient amounts from theinteraction of the small size instantons with the regulator degrees of freedom.The relation with the bulk/boundary correspondence is discussed.
