GravityWe discuss the application of the method of the gaugeless Hamiltonianreduction to general relativity. This method is based on explicit resolving theglobal part of the energy constraint and on identification of one of the metriccomponents with the evolution parameter of the equivalent unconstrained(reduced) system. The Hamiltonian reduction reveals a possibility to unifyGeneral Relativity and Standard Model of strong and electro-weak interactionswith the modulus of the Higgs field identified with the product of thedeterminant of 3D metric and the Planck constant. We give the geometricalfoundation of the scalar field, derive and discuss experimental consequences of$\sigma$-model version of Standard Model without Higgs particle excitations andinflation.
