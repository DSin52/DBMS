With the recent discovery that many aspects of black hole thermodynamics canbe effectively reduced to problems in three spacetime dimensions, it has becomeincreasingly important to understand the ``statistical mechanics'' of the(2+1)-dimensional black hole of Banados, Teitelboim, and Zanelli (BTZ). Severalconformal field theoretic derivations of the BTZ entropy exist, but none isas to what fields provide the relevant degrees of freedom or where theseexcitations live. In this paper, I review some of the unresolved problems andsuggest avenues for their solution.
