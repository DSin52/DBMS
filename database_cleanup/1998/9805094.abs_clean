Following a recent proposal for integrable theories in higher dimensionsbased on zero curvature, new Lorentz invariant submodels of the principalchiral model in 2+1 dimensions are found. They have infinite local conservedcurrents, which are explicitly given for the su(2) case. The construction worksfor any Lie algebra and in any dimension, and it is given explicitly also forsu(3). We comment on the application to supersymmetric chiral models.
