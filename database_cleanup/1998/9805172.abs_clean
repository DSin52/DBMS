We study N=2 super Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(N) from the point ofview of the Whitham hierarchy. We develop a new recursive method to compute thewhole instanton expansion of the prepotential using the theta functionassociated to the root lattice of the group. Explicit results for the one andtwo-instanton corrections in SU(N) are presented. Interpreting the slow timesof the hierarchy as additional couplings, we show how they can be promoted tospurion superfields that softly break N=2 supersymmetry down to N=0. Thisprovides a family of nonsupersymmetric deformations of the theory, associatedto higher Casimir operators of the gauge group. The SU(3) theory is analyzed insome detail.
