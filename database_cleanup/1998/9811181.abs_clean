Title: Nonrenormalizability and Nontriviality

Comments: 6 pages, latex, no figures

A redesigned starting point for covariant \phi^4_n, n\ge 4, models issuggested that takes the form of an alternative lattice action and which mayhave the virtue of leading to a nontrivial quantum field theory in thecontinuum limit. The lack of conventional scattering for such theories isunderstood through an interchange of limits.
