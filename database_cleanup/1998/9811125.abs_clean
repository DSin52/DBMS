Conf. "Problems of Quantum Field Theory"(July 13-17, Dubna, Russia, 1998), toappear in the Conference Proceedings 1999; the reference list extendedA new approach to summation of divergent field-theoretical series issuggested. It is based on the Borel transformation combined with a conformalmapping and does not imply the knowledge of the exact asymptotic parameters.The method is tested on functions expanded in their asymptotic power series andapplied to estimating the ground state energy of simple quantum mechanicalproblems including anisotropic oscillators and caclulating the criticalexponents for certain comformal field models. It can be expected that the newapproach to summation may be used to obtaining numerical estimates forimportant physical quantities represented by divergent series in two- andthree-dimensional field models.
