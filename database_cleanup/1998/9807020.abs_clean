At Bradlow's limit, the moduli space of Bogomol'nyi vortices on a compactRiemann surface of genus $g$ is determined. The K\"{a}hler form, and the volumeof the moduli space is then computed. These results are compared with thecorresponding results previously obtained for a general vortex moduli space.
