Two closely related topological phenomena are studied at finite density andtemperature. These are chiral anomaly and Chern--Simons term. It occurs thatthe chiral anomaly doesn't depend on density and temperature. Chern-Simons termand usual charges conservation. In odd dimensions, by using different methodsit is shown that $\mu^2 = m^2$ is the crucial point for Chern--Simons at zerotemperature. So when $\mu^2 < m^2$ $\mu$--influence disappears and we get theusual Chern-Simons term. On the other hand, when $\mu^2 > m^2$ the Chern-Simonsterm vanishes because of non--zero density of background fermions. Theconnection between parity anomalous Chern-Simons in odd dimension and chiralanomaly in even dimension is established at arbitrary density and temperature.These results hold in any dimension as in abelian, so as in nonabelian cases.
