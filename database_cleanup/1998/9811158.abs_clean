We introduce a novel method for the renormalization of the Hamiltonianoperator in Quantum Field Theory in the spirit of the Wilson renormalizationgroup. By a series of unitary transformations that successively decouples thehigh-frequency degrees of freedom and partially diagonalizes the high-energypart, we obtain the effective Hamiltonian for the low energy degrees offreedom. We successfully apply this technique to compute the 2-looprenormalized Hamiltonian in scalar $\lambda \phi^4$ theory.
