Title: On M-Theory

Comments: 16 pages (Latex), contribution to the 31st Ahrenshoop International

Symposium on the Theory of Elementary Particles, Buckow, Germany, 2-6September 1997, and the Discussion Meeting on Black Holes, Bangalore, India,8-10 December 1997. Changes in section 4, minor corrections in previoussectionsThis contribution gives a personal view on recent attempts to find a unifiedframework for non-perturbative string theories, with special emphasis on thehidden symmetries of supergravity and their possible role in this endeavor. Areformulation of $d=11$ supergravity with enlarged tangent space symmetrySO(1,2) $\times$ SO(16) is discussed from this perspective, as well as anansatz to construct yet further versions with SO(1,1) $\times$ SO(16)$^\infty$and possibly even SO(1,1)$_+$ $\times$ ISO(16)$^\infty$ tangent space symmetry.It is suggested that upon ``third quantization'', dimensionally reduced maximalsupergravity may have an equally important role to play in this unification asthe dimensionally reduced maximally supersymmetric $SU(\infty)$ Yang Millstheory.
