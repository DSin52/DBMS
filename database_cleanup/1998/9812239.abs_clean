The leading terms in the long-range interaction potential between anarbitrary pair of matrix theory objects are calculated at one-loop order. Thisresult generalizes previous calculations by including arbitrary fermionicbackground field configurations. The interaction potential at orders 1/r^7 and1/r^8 is shown to correspond precisely with the leading terms expected fromlinearized supergravity interactions between arbitrary objects in M-theory.General expressions for the stress tensor, membrane current and 5-brane currentof an arbitrary matrix configuration are derived, including fermioniccontributions. Supergravity effects which are correctly reproduced includemembrane/5-brane interactions, 0-brane/6-brane interactions,supercurrent/supercurrent interactions and the spin contributions to moments ofthe supergravity currents. The matrix theory description of the supergravitystress tensor, membrane current and 5-brane current are used to propose anexplicit formulation of matrix theory in an arbitrary background metric and3-form field.
