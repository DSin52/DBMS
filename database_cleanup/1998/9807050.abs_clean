Authors: Dmitri Sorokin

Comments: LaTeX file, 14 pages. Invited talk given at the Trieste Conference on

Superfivebranes and Physics in 5+1 Dimensions (April 1-3, 1998), and at the2nd INTAS Meeting ``Fundamental Problems in Classical, Quantum and StringGravity" (Paris, 1--3 May, 1998)We review the structure and symmetry properties of the worldvolume action forthe M-theory 5-brane and of its equations of motion.
