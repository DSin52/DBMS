An investigation of singular fields emerging in the process of transformingQCD to the axial gauge is presented. The structure of the singularities isanalyzed. It is shown that apart from well known neutral magnetic monopolesingularities, the field configurations also exhibit singularities in theircharged and transverse components. This complex singularity structureguarantees finite non-Abelian field strength and thus finite action ifexpressed in terms of gauge fixed fields. A relation between the monopolecharges of singular field configurations and their topological charge isderived. Qualitative dynamical aspects of the role of the monopoles arediscussed. It is argued that the entropy associated with monopoles increaseswith decreasing temperature and that the coupling to quantum fluctuationsfavors monopole-antimonopole binding.
