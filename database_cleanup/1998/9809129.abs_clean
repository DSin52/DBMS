The evaluation of the 4-point Green functions in the 1+1 Schwinger model ispresented both in momentum and coordinate space representations. The crucialthe chiral one. We demonstrate how the infinite set of Dyson-Schwingerequations is simplified, and is so reduced, that a given n-point Green functionis expressed only through itself and lower ones. For the 4-point Greenfunction, with two bosonic and two fermionic external `legs', a compactsolution is given both in momentum and coordinate space representations. Forthe 4-fermion Green function a selfconsistent equation is written down in themomentum representation and a concrete solution is given in the coordinatespace. This exact solution is further analyzed and we show that it contains apole corresponding to the Schwinger boson. All detailed considerations givenfor various 4-point Green functions are easily generizable to higher functions.
