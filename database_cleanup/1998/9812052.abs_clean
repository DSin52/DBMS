Cosmology and Particle Physics, Peniscola, Spain, June 1998In these lectures, we present cosmological vacuum solutions of Horava-Wittentheory and discuss their physical properties. We begin by deriving thefive-dimensional effective action of strongly coupled heterotic string theoryby performing a reduction, on a Calabi-Yau three-fold, of M-theory on S1/Z2.The effective theory is shown to be a gauged version of five-dimensional N=1supergravity coupled, for simplicity, to the universal hypermultiplet andfour-dimensional boundary theories with gauge and universal gauge matterfields. The static vacuum of the theory is a pair of BPS three-brane domainwalls. We show that this five-dimensional theory, together with the domain wallvacuum solution, provides the correct starting point for early universecosmology in Horava-Witten theory. Relevant cosmological solutions are thoseassociated with the BPS domain wall vacuum. Such solutions must beinhomogeneous, depending on the orbifold coordinate as well as on time. Wepresent two examples of this new type of cosmological solution, obtained byseparation of variables. The first example represents the analog of a rollingradii solution with the radii specifying the geometry of the domain wall pair.This is generalized in the second example to include a nontrivial Ramond-Ramondscalar.
