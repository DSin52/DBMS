We analyse the world-sheet perturbations of string theory formulated around$AdS_3$ background. We identify a set of operators that, while added to theworld-sheet action, generate the boundary fluctuations of $AdS_3$. The effectof these operators can be collectively defined in terms of Liouville fieldliving on the $AdS_3$ boundary. We then study various deformations of $AdS_3$generated by boundary fluctuations by turning on suitable world-sheetcouplings. We also discuss certain small fluctuations around the BTZ blackhole.
