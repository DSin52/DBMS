Efremov (Dubna, 1999, E2-99-35), p.167.Solutions to the Thirring model are constructed in the framework of algebraicQFT. It is shown that for all positive temperatures there are fermionicsolutions only if the coupling constant is $\lambda = \sqrt{2(2n+1)\pi}, n\in\bf N$, otherwise solutions are anyons. Different anyons (which are uncountablymany) live in orthogonal spaces, so the whole Hilbert space becomesnon-separable and in each of its sectors a different Urgleichung holds. Thisfeature certainly cannot be seen by any power expansion in $\lambda$. Moreover,if the statistic parameter is tied to the coupling constant it is clear thatsuch an expansion is doomed to failure and will never reveal the true structureof the theory.On the basis of the model in question, it is not possible to decide whetherfermions or bosons are more fundamental since dressed fermions can beconstructed either from bare fermions or directly from the current algebra.
