We point out that if spatial information is encoded through linear operators$X_i$, or `infinite-dimensional matrices' with an involution $X_i^*=X_i$ thenthese $X_i$ can only describe either continuous, discrete or certain "fuzzy"space-time structures. We argue that the fuzzy space structure may be relevantat the Planck scale. The possibility of this fuzzy space-time structure isrelated to subtle features of infinite dimensional matrices which do not havean analogue in finite dimensions. For example, there is a slightly weakerhorizons may lead to merely isometric rather than unitary time evolution.
