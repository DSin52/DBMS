663-670The quantisation of the two-dimensional Liouville field theory isinvestigated using the path integral, on the sphere, in the large radius limit.The general form of the $N$-point functions of vertex operators is found andthe three-point function is derived explicitly. In previous work it wasinferred that the three-point function should possess a two-dimensional latticeof poles in the parameter space (as opposed to a one-dimensional lattice onewould expect from the standard Liouville potential). Here we argue that thetwo-dimensionality of the lattice has its origin in the duality of the quantummechanical Liouville states and we incorporate this duality into the pathintegral by using a two-exponential potential. Contrary to what one mightexpect, this does not violate conformal invariance; and has the great advantageof producing the two-dimensional lattice in a natural way.
