workshop on Quantum Chromodynamics (June 1998)If constituent quarks are to emerge from QCD they must have well definedcolour and be energetically favoured. After reviewing the general properties ofcharges in gauge theories, a method for constructing charges is presented andapplied to the infra-red structure of the theory and to the interquarkpotential. Both of these applications supply a physical interpretation of thestructures found in the construction of charges. We will see that constituentstructures arise in QCD.
