We study string propagation on $AdS_3$ times a compact space from an ``oldfashioned'' worldsheet point of view of perturbative string theory. We derivethe spacetime CFT and its Virasoro and current algebras, thus establishing theconjectured $AdS$/CFT correspondence for this case in the full string theory.Our results have implications for the extreme IR limit of the $D1-D5$ system,as well as to 2+1 dimensional BTZ black holes and their Bekenstein-Hawkingentropy.
