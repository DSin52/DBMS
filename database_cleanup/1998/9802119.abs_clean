We study the appearance of induced parity-violating magnetic moment, in thepresence of external magnetic fields, for even-number of fermion speciescoupled to dynamical fields in three dimensions. Specifically, we use aSU(2)xU(1) gauge model for dynamical gauge symmetry breaking, which is alsoproposed recently as a field theoretical model for high-temperaturesuperconductors. By decomposing the fermionic degrees of freedom in terms ofLandau levels, we show that, in the effective theory with the lowest Landaulevels, a parity-violating magnetic moment interaction is induced by the higherLandau levels when the fermions are massive. The possible relevance of thisresult for a recently observed phenomenon in high-temperature superconductorsis also discussed.
