We continue our study of the unitary supermultiplets of the N=8, d=5 anti-deSitter (AdS_5) superalgebra SU(2,2|4), which is also the N=4 extended conformalsuperalgebra in d=4. We show explicitly how to go from the compactSU(2)XSU(2)XU(1) basis to the non-compact SL(2,C)XD basis of the positiveenergy unitary representations of the conformal group SU(2,2) in d=4. Thedoubleton representations of the AdS_5 group SU(2,2), which do not have asmooth Poincare limit in d=5, are shown to represent fields with vanishingmasses in four dimensional Minkowski space. The unique CPT self-conjugateirreducible doubleton supermultiplet of SU(2,2|4)is simply the N=4 Yang-Millssupermultiplet in d=4. We study some novel short non-doubleton supermultipletsof SU(2,2|4) that have spin range 2 and that do not appear in the Kaluza-Kleinspectrum of type IIB supergravity or in tensor products of the N=4 Yang-Millssupermultiplet with itself. These novel supermultiplets can be obtained fromtensoring chiral doubleton supermultiplets, some of which we expect to berelated to the massless limits of 1/4 BPS states. Hence, these novelsupermultiplets may be relevant to the solitonic sector of IIB superstringand/or (p,q) superstrings over AdS_5 X S^5.
