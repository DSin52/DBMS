Utilizing the idea of extra large dimensions, it has been suggested that thegauge and gravity couplings unification can happen at a scale as low as 1 TeV.In this paper, we explore this phenomenological possibility within stringtheory. In particular, we discuss how the proton decay bound can be satisfiedin Type I string theory. The string picture also suggests different scenariosof gauge and gravitational couplings unification. The various scenarios areexplicitly illustrated with a specific 4-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric chiralType I string model with Pati-Salam-like gauge symmetry. We point out certainfeatures that should be generic in other Type I strings.
