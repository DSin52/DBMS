(hep-th/9807069) correctedFaddeev and Niemi have proposed a reformulation of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory interms of new variables, appropriate for describing the theory in its infraredlimit based on the intuitive picture of colour confinement due to monopolecondensation. I generalize their proposal (with some differences) to SU(N)Yang-Mills theory. The natural variables are $N-1$ mutually commuting traceless$N\times N$ Hermitian matrices, an element of the maximal torus defined bythese commuting matrices, $N-1$ Abelian gauge fields for the maximal torusgauge group, and an invariant symmetric two-index tensor on the tangent spaceof the maximal torus, adding up to the requisite 2$(N^{2}-1)$ physical degreesof freedom.
