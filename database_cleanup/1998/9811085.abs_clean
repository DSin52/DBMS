Vortex solutions to the classical field equations in a massive,renormalizable U(1) gauge model are considered in (2+1) dimensions. A vectorfield whose kinetic term consists of a Chern-Simons term plus a Stuekelbergmass term is coupled to a scalar field. If the classical scalar field is setequal to zero, then there are classical configurations of the vector field inwhich the magnetic flux is non-vanishing and finite. In contrast to theNielsen-Olesen vortex, the magnetic field vanishes exponentially at largedistances and diverges logarithmicly at short distances. This divergence,although not so severe as to cause the flux to diverge, results in theHamiltonian becoming infinite. If the classical scalar field is no longer equalto zero, then the magnetic flux is not only finite, but quantized and theasymptotic behaviour of the field is altered so that the Hamiltonian no longersuffers from a divergence due to the field configuration at the origin.Furthermore, the asymptotic behaviour at infinity is dependent on the magnitudeof the Stuekelberg mass term.
