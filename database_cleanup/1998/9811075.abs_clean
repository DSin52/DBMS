We extend a recent analysis of gravitational perturbations onDirac-Nambu-Goto strings, membranes and higher dimensional branes. In anarbitrary gauge, it is shown that the relevant first order equations governingthe displacement vector of the worldsheet and metric perturbation areobtainable from a variational principle whose Lagrangian is constructed as asecond order perturbation of the standard Dirac-Goto-Nambu action density. Asymplectic current functional is obtained as a by-product that is potentiallyuseful for the derivation of conservation laws in particular circumstances.
