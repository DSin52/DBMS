A theory recently proposed by the author aims to explain decoherence and thethermodynamical behaviour of closed systems within a conservative, unitary,framework for quantum gravity by assuming that the operators tied to thegravitational degrees of freedom are unobservable and equating physical entropywith matter-gravity entanglement entropy. Here we obtain preliminary results onthe extent of decoherence this theory predicts. We treat first a static statewhich, if one were to ignore quantum gravitational effects, would be a quantumsuperposition of two spatially displaced states of a single classically welldescribable ball of uniform mass density in empty space. Estimating the quantumgravitational effects on this system within a simple Newtonian approximation,we obtain formulae which predict e.g. that as long as the mass of the ball isconsiderably larger than the Planck mass, such a would-be-coherent staticsuperposition will actually be decohered whenever the separation of the centresof mass of the two ball-states excedes a small fraction (which decreases as themass of the ball increases) of the ball radius. We then obtain a formula forthe quantum gravitational correction to the would-be-pure density matrix of anon-relativistic many-body Schroedinger wave function and argue that thisformula predicts decoherence between configurations which differ (at least) inthe "relocation" of a cluster of particles of Planck mass. We estimate theentropy of some simple model closed systems, finding a tendency for it toincrease with "matter-clumping" suggestive of a link with existingphenomenological discussions of cosmological entropy increase.
