In quasi-realistic string models that contain an anomalous U(1) the non-zeroFayet-Iliopoulos term triggers the shifting of the original vacuum to a new onealong some flat direction, so that SUSY is preserved but the gauge group ispartially broken. The phenomenological study of these models thus requires as afirst step the mapping of the space of flat directions. We investigate F- andD-flat directions in several three-generation SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Yfree-fermionic string models and discuss the typical scenarios that genericallyarise. When they exist, we systematically construct the flat directions thatpreserve hypercharge, only break Abelian group factors, and can be proven toremain F-flat to all orders in the non-renormalizable superpotential.
