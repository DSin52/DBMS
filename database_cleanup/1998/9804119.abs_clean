We consider the GUT-like model with two scalar fields which has infinitesimaldeviation from the conformal invariant fixed point at high energy region. Inthis case the dominating quantum effect is the conformal trace anomaly and theinteraction between the anomaly-generated propagating conformal factor of themetric and the usual dimensional scalar field. This interaction leads to therenormalization group flow from the conformal point. In the supersymmetricconformal invariant model such an effect produces a very weak violation ofsypersymmetry at lower energies.
