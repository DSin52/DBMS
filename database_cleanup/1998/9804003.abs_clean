dimensions and zeta regularizations in string theories"We propose a new general BRST approach to string and string-like theorieswhich have a wider range of applicability than e g the conventional conformalfield theory method. The method involves a simple general regularization of allbasic commutators which makes all divergent sums to be expressible in terms ofzeta functions from which finite values then may be extracted in a rigorousmanner. The method is particular useful in order to investigate possible statespace representations to a given model. The method is applied to three stringtensionless string. We also investigate different state spaces for thesemodels. The tensionless string models are treated in details. Although wemostly rederive known results they appear in a new fashion which deepens ourunderstanding of these models. Furthermore, we believe that our treatment ismore rigorous than most of the previous ones. In the case of the conformaltensionless string we find a new solution for d=4.
