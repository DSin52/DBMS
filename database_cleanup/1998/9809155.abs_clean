Contribution to the 5th International Wigner Symposium, Viena (Austria)August 1997. World Scientific, Singapore, Eds. P. Kasperkovitz and D. GrauAlthough the whole conformal group $SO(4,2)$ can be considered as a symmetryin a classical massless field theory, the subgroup of special conformaltransformations (SCT), usually related to transitions to uniformly acceleratedframes, causes vacuum radiation in the corresponding quantum field theory, inanalogy to the Fulling-Unruh effect. The spectrum of the outgoing particles canbe calculated exactly and proves to be a generalization of the Planckian one.
