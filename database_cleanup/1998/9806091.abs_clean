We construct anomaly free non-supersymmetric large N gauge theories fromorientifolds of Type IIB on C^3/G orbifolds. In particular, massless as well astachyonic one-loop tadpoles are cancelled in these models. This is achieved bystarting with ${\cal N}=1,2$ supersymmetric orientifolds with well definedworld-sheet description and including discrete torsion (which breakssupersymmetry) in the orbifold action. In this way we obtain non-trivialnon-chiral as well as anomaly free chiral large N gauge theories. We point outcertain subtleties arising in the chiral cases. Subject to certain assumptions,these theories are shown to have the property that computation of any M-pointcorrelation function in these theories reduces to the corresponding computationin the parent ${\cal N}=4$ oriented theory. This generalizes the analogousresults recently obtained in supersymmetric large N gauge theories fromorientifolds, as well as in (non)supersymmetric large N gauge theories withoutorientifold planes.
