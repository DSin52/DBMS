We consider a possibility to describe spin one-half and higher spins ofmassive relativistic particles by means of commuting spinors. We present twoclassical gauge models with the variables $x^\mu,\xi_\alpha,\chi_\alpha$, where$\xi,\chi$ are commuting Majorana spinors. In course of quantization bothmodels reproduce Dirac equation. We analyze the possibility to introduce aninteraction with an external electromagnetic background into the models and togeneralize them to higher spin description. The first model admits a minimalinteraction with the external electromagnetic field, but leads to reduciblerepresentations of the Poincare group being generalized for higher spins. Thesecond model turns out to be appropriate for description of the massive higherspins. However, it seams to be difficult to introduce a minimal interactionwith an external electromagnetic field into this model. We compare our approachwith one, which uses Grassman variables, and establish a relation between them.
