Title: Quasi-Exactly Solvable Models with Spin-Orbital Interaction

Comments: 6 pages, LaTeX

First examples of quasi-exactly solvable models describing spin-orbitalinteraction are constructed. In contrast with other examples of matrixquasi-exactly solvable models discussed in the literature up to now, our modelsadmit (but still incomplete) sets of exact (algebraic) solutions.
