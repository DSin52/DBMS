It is shown how the topological string amplitudes encode the BPS structure ofwrapped M2 branes in M-theory compactification on Calabi-Yau threefolds. Thisin turn is related to a twisted supersymmetric index in 5 dimensions whichreceives contribution only from BPS states. The spin dependence of BPS statesin 5 dimensions is captured by the string coupling constant dependence oftopological string amplitudes.
