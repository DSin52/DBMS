We recover a general representation for the quantum state of a relativisticclosed line (loop) in terms of string degrees of freedom.The general form ofthe loop functional splits into the product of the Eguchi functional, encodingthe holographic quantum dynamics, times the Polyakov path integral, taking intoaccount the full Bulk dynamics, times a loop effective action, which is neededto renormalize boundary ultraviolet divergences. The Polyakov string action isderived as an effective actionfrom a phase space,covariant,Schild action, byfunctionally integrating out the world-sheet coordinates.The area coordinatesdescription of the boundary quantum dynamics, is shown to be induced by the``zero mode'' of the bulk quantum fluctuations. Finally, we briefly commentabout a ``unified, fully covariant'' description of points, loops and stringsin terms of Matrix Coordinates.
