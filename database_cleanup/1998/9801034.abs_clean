We consider Heterotic string theories in the DLCQ. We derive that the matrixmodel of the Spin(32)/$Z_2$ Heterotic theory is the theory living on ND-strings in type I wound on a circle with no Spin(32)/$Z_2$ Wilson line on thecircle. This is an O(N) gauge theory. We rederive the matrix model for the$\e8$ Heterotic string theory, explicitly taking care of the Wilson line aroundthe lightlike circle. The result is the same theory as for Spin(32)/$Z_2$except that now there is a Wilson line on the circle. We also see that theinteger N labeling the sector of the O(N) matrix model is not just the momentumaround the lightlike circle, but a shifted momentum depending on the Wilsonline. We discuss the aspect of level matching, GSO projections and why, fromthe point of view of matrix theory the $\e8$ theory, and not theSpin(32)/$Z_2$, develops an 11'th dimension for strong coupling. Furthermore amatrix theory for type I is derived. This is again the O(N) theory living onthe D-strings of type I. For small type I coupling the system is 0+1dimensional quantum mechanics.
