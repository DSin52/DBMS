In this work we investigate the role of the symmetry of the Lagrangian on theexistence of defects in systems of coupled scalar fields. We focus attentionmainly on solutions where defects may nest defects. When space is non-compactwe find topological BPS and non-BPS solutions that present internal structure.When space is compact the solutions are nontopological sphalerons, which may benested inside the topological defects. We address the question of classicalstability of these topological and nontopological solutions and investigate howthe thermal corrections may modify the classical scenario.
