We consider some aspects of inflation in models with large internaldimensions. If inflation occurs on a 3D wall after the stabilization ofinternal dimensions in the models with low unification scale (M ~ 1 TeV), theinflaton field must be extremely light. This problem may disappear In modelswith intermediate (M ~10^{11} GeV) to high (M ~ 10^{16} GeV) unification scale.However, in all of these cases the wall inflation does not provide a completesolution to the horizon and flatness problems. To solve them, there must be astage of inflation in the bulk before the compactification of internaldimensions.
