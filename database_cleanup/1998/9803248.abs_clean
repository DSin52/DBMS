New single soliton solutions to the affine Toda field theories areconstructed, exhibiting previously unobserved topological charges. This goessome of the way in filling the weights of the fundamental representations, butnevertheless holes in the representations remain. We use the group doublecrossproduct form of the inverse scattering method, and restrict ourselves to therank one solutions.
