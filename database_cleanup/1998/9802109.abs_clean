We suggest a means of obtaining certain Green's functions in 3+1-dimensional${\cal N} = 4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with a large number of colorsvia non-critical string theory. The non-critical string theory is related tocritical string theory in anti-deSitter background. We introduce a boundary ofthe anti-deSitter space analogous to a cut-off on the Liouville coordinate ofthe two-dimensional string theory. Correlation functions of operators in thegauge theory are related to the dependence of the supergravity action on theboundary conditions. From the quadratic terms in supergravity we read off theanomalous dimensions. For operators that couple to massless string states ithas been established through absorption calculations that the anomalousdimensions vanish, and we rederive this result. The operators that couple tomassive string states at level $n$ acquire anomalous dimensions that grow as$2\left (n g_{YM} \sqrt {2 N} )^{1/2}$ for large `t Hooft coupling. This is anew prediction about the strong coupling behavior of large $N$ SYM theory.
