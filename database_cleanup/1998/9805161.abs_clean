The most general vortex solution of the Liouville equation (which arises innon-relativistic Chern-Simons theory) is associated with rational functions,$f(z)=P(z)/Q(z)$ where $P(z)$ and $Q(z)$ are both polynomials, $\deg P<\degQ\equiv N$. This allows us to prove that the solution depends on $4N$parameters without the use of an index theorem, as well as the flux
