The potential during inflation must be very flat in, at least, the directionof the inflaton. In renormalizable global supersymmetry, flat directions areubiquitous, but they are not preserved in a generic supergravity theory. It isknown that at least some of them are preserved in no-scale supergravity, andsimple generalizations of it. We here study a more realistic generalization,based on string-derived supergravity, using the linear supermultiplet formalismfor the dilaton. We consider a general class of hybrid inflation models, wherea Fayet-Illiopoulos $D$ term drives some fields to large values. The potentialis dominated by the $F$ term, but flatness is preserved in some directions.This allows inflation, with the dilaton stabilized in its domain of attraction,and some moduli stabilized at their vacuum values. Another modulus may be theinflaton.
