Title: Geometry of Fermionic Constraints in Superstring Theories

Authors: Dmitrij Sorokin

Comments: 7 pages, preprint KCL-TH-94-9

Considered are superparticle and superstring models invariant undersupersymmetry in a target superspace and local extended worldsheetsupersymmetry the latter replacing the fermionic $\kappa$--symmetry of theconventional Green--Schwarz formulations. (Talk given at the Conference onGeometry of Constrained Dynamical Systems,Cambridge, June 15-18, 1994).
