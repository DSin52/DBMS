A first order form of Regge calculus is defined in the spirit of Palatini'saction for general relativity. The extra independent variables are the interiordihedral angles of a simplex, with conjugate variables the areas of thetriangles. There is a discussion of the extent to which these areas can be usedto parameterise the space of edge lengths of a simplex.
