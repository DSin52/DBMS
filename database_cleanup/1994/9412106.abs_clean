We calculate the effective tachyonic potential in closed string field theoryup to the quartic term in the tree approximation. This involves an elementaryfour-tachyon vertex and a sum over the infinite number of Feynman graphs withan intermediate massive state. We show that both the elementary term and thesum can be evaluated as integrals of some measure over different regions in themoduli space of four-punctured spheres. We show that both elementary andeffective coupling give negative contributions to the quartic term in thetachyon potential. Numerical calculations show that the fourth order term isbig enough to destroy a local minimum which exists in the third orderapproximation.
