Limits for the applicability of the equivalence principle are considered inthe context of low-energy effective field theories. In particular, we find aclass of higher-derivative interactions for the gravitational andelectromagnetic fields which produce dispersive photon propagation. The latteris illustrated by calculating the energy-dependent contribution to thedeflection of light rays.
