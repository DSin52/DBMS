Title: Separation of variables and the XXZ Gaudin magnet

Comments: 11 pages, AMS-TeX

(January 1995)In this work we generalise previous results connecting (rational) Gaudinmagnet models and classical separation of variables. It is shown that theconnection persists for the case of linear r-matrix algebra which correspondsto the trigonometric 4x4 r-matrix (of the XXZ type). We comment also on thecorresponding problem for the elliptic (XYZ) r-matrix. A prescription forobtaining integrable systems associated with multiple poles of an L-operator isgiven.
