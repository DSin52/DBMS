We present a unified description of gravity and electromagnetism in theframework of a $Z_2$ noncommutative differential calculus. It can be consideredas a ``discrete version" of Kaluza-Klein theory, where the fifth continuousdimension is replaced by two discrete points. We derive an action whichcoincides with the dimensionally reduced one of the ordinary Kaluza-Kleintheory.
