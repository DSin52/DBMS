We discuss the phase structure of a higher derivative four-fermion model infour dimensions in curved spacetime in frames of the $\frac{1}{N_c}$-expansion.First, we evaluate in our model the effective potential of two compositescalars in the linear curvature approximation using a local momentumrepresentation in curved spacetime for the higher-derivative propagator whichnaturally appears. The symmetry breaking phenomenon and phase transitioninduced by curvature are numerically investigated. A numerical study of thedynamically generated fermionic mass, which depends on the coupling constantsand on the curvature, is also presented.
