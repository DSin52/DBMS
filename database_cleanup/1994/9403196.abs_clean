A new model of relativistic massive particle with arbitrary spin(($m,s$)-particle) is suggested. Configuration space of the model is a productof Minkowski space and two-dimensional sphere, ${\cal M}^6 = {\Bbb R}^{3,1}\times S^2$. The system describes Zitterbevegung at the classical level.Together with explicitly realized Poincar\'e symmetry, the action functionalturns out to be invariant under two types of gauge transformations having theirorigin in the presence of two Abelian first-class constraints in the Hamiltonformalism. These constraints correspond to strong conservation for thephase-space counterparts of the Casimir operators of the Poincar\'e group.Canonical quantization of the model leads to equations on the wave functionswhich prove to be equivalent to the relativistic wave equations for the massivespin-$s$ field.
