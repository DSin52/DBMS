We derive the asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel for a Laplace operatoracting on deformed spheres. We calculate the coefficients of the heat kernelexpansion on two- and three-dimensional deformed spheres as functions ofdeformation parameters. We find that under some deformation the conformalanomaly for free scalar fields on $R^4\times \tilde S^2$ and $R^6\times \tildeS^2$ is canceled.
