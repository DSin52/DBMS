Title: Black holes, the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and the semi-classical

approximationAuthors: Miguel E. Ortiz

Comments: 4 pages, plain text

The definition of matter states on spacelike hypersurfaces of a 1+1dimensional black hole spacetime is considered. Because of small quantumfluctuations in the mass of the black hole, the usual approximation of treatingthe gravitational field as a classical background on which matter is quantized,breaks down near the black hole horizon. On any hypersurface that captures bothinfalling matter near the horizon and Hawking radiation, a semiclassicalcalculation is inconsistent. An estimate of the size of correlations betweenthe matter and gravity states shows that they are so strong that a fluctuationin the black hole mass of order exp[-M/M_{Planck}] produces a macroscopicchange in the matter state.
