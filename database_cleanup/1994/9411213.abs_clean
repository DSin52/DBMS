Title: $W_\infty$ Algebra and Geometric Formulation of QCD$_2$

Comments: 3 pages, latex, conference talk

We review the gauge invariant formulation of 2-dim. QCD. We show that thenon-linear gauge invariant phase space is the coset $W_\infty/W_{+\infty}\timesW_{-\infty}$ ,which is specified by the $N=\infty$ master-field of this model.The meson fields correspond to the local coordinates of the coset. We commenton the stringy collective coordinates of the solitons (baryons) in this model.
