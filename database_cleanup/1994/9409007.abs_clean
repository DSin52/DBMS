The quantum BRST charges for the Bershadsky-Knizhnik orthogonalquasi-superconformal algebras are constructed. These two-dimensionalsuperalgebras have the $N$-extended non-linearly realised supersymmetry and the$SO(N)$ internal symmetry. The BRST charge nilpotency conditions are shown tohave a unique solution at $N>2$, namely, $N=4$ and $k=-2$, where $k$ is centralextension parameter of the Ka\v{c}-Moody subalgebra. We argue about theexistence of a new string theory with the non-linearly realised $N=4$world-sheet supersymmetry and negative `critical dimension'.
