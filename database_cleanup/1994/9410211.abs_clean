In comparison with the $WT$ chiral identity which is indispensable forrenormalization theory, relations deduced from the non-linear chiraltransformation have a totally different physical significance. We wish to showthat non-linear chiral transformations are powerful tools to deduce usefulintegral equations for propagators. In contrast to the case of linear chiraltransformations, identities derived from non-linear ones contain more involvedradiative effects and are rich in physical content. To demonstrate this fact weapply the simplest non-linear chiral transformation to the Nambu-Jona-Lasiniomodel, and show how our identity is related to the Dyson-Schwinger equation andBethe-Salpeter amplitudes of the Higgs and $\pi$. Unlike equations obtainedfrom the effective potential, our resultant equation is exact and can be usedfor events beyond the LEP energy.
