By providing a general correspondence between Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds andnon-linear sigma models, we find that the elusive mirror of a rigid manifold isactually a supermanifold. We also discuss when sigma models with super-targetspaces are conformally invariant and describe their chiral rings. Bothsupermanifolds with and without Kahler moduli are considered. This work leadsus to conclude that mirror symmetry should be viewed as a relation amongsuper-varieties rather than bosonic varieties.
