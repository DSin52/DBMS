The one--loop effective action for a slowly varying electromagnetic field iscomputed at finite temperature and density using a real-time formalism. Wediscuss the gauge invariance of the result. Corrections to the Debye mass froman electric field are computed at high temperature and high density. Theeffective coupling constant, defined from a purely electric weak--fieldexpansion, behaves at high temperature very differently from the case of amagnetic field, and does not satisfy the renormalization group equation. Theissue of pair production in the real--time formalism is discussed and also itsrelevance for heavy--ion collisions.
