A complete geometric unification of gravity and electromagnetism is proposedEinstein--Cartan theory and the possible interpretation of the torsion trace asthe electromagnetic potential. Starting with a Lagrangian built of Diracspinors, orthonormal tetrads, and a complex rather than a real linearconnection we define an extended spinor derivative by which we obtain not onlya very natural unification, but can also fully clarify the nontrivialunderlying fibre bundle structure. Thereby a new type of contact interactionbetween spinors emerges, which differs from the usual one in Einstein--Cartantheory. The splitting of the linear connection into a metric and anelectromagnetic part together with a characteristic length scale in the theorystrongly suggest that gravity and electromagnetism have the same geometricalorigin.
