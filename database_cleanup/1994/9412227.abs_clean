Comments: 25 pages, 1 postscript figure, uses latex and epsf.sty

We study one (or two) matrix models modified by terms of the form$g(\rho(P))^2 + g'(\rho'({\cal{O}}))^2$, where the matrix representation of thepuncture operator $P$ and the one of a scaling operator ${\cal{O}}$ are denotedby $\rho(P)$ and $\rho'({\cal{O}})$ respectively. We rewrite the modifiedmodels as effective theories of baby universes. We find an upper bound for thegravitational dimension of ${\cal{O}}$ under which we can fine tune thecoupling constants to obtain new critical behaviors in the continuum limit. Thesimultaneous tuning of $g$ and $g'$ is possible if the representations$\rho(P)$ and $\rho'({\cal{O}})$ are chosen so that the non-diagonal elementsof the mass matrix of the effective theory vanish.
