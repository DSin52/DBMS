We describe how an approximation to the minimal energy Skyrme crystal can beobtained from the holonomy of a Yang-Mills instanton. The appropriate instantonis twisted on a four-torus and has instanton number equal to one half. Itgenerates a Skyrme field with the correct topological and symmetry propertiesof the crystal. An explicit solution for the instanton is not known, but ananalytical fit to numerical data is available and using this we obtain a Skyrmecrystal whose energy is only 2 percent above that of the (numerically) knownsolution.
