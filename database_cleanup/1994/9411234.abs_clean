We study some arithmetic properties of the mirror maps and the quantum Yukawacoupling for some 1-parameter deformations of Calabi-Yau manifolds. First weuse the Schwarzian differential equation, which we derived previously, tocharacterize the mirror map in each case. For algebraic K3 surfaces, we solvethe equation in terms of the $J$-function. By deriving explicit modularrelations we prove that some K3 mirror maps are algebraic over the genus zerofunction field ${\bf Q}(J)$. This leads to a uniform proof that those mirrormaps have integral Fourier coefficients. Regarding the maps as Riemannmappings, we prove that they are genus zero functions. By virtue of theConway-Norton conjecture (proved by Borcherds using Frenkel-Lepowsky-Meurman'sMoonshine module), we find that these maps are actually the reciprocals of theThompson series for certain conjugacy classes in the Griess-Fischer group. Thisalso gives, as an immediate consequence, a second proof that those mirror mapsare integral. We thus conjecture a surprising connection between K3 mirror mapsand the Thompson series. For threefolds, we construct a formal nonlinear ODEfor the quantum coupling reduced $mod\ p$. Under the mirror hypothesis and anintegrality assumption, we derive $mod~p$ congruences for the Fouriercoefficients. For the quintics, we deduce (at least for $5\not{|}d$) that thedegree $d$ instanton numbers $n_d$ are divisible by $5^3$ -- a fact firstconjectured by Clemens.
