The two-dimensional non-linear sigma model approach to Self-dual Yang-Millstheory and to Self-dual gravity given by Q-Han Park is an example of the deepinterplay between two and four dimensional physics. In particular, Husain'stwo-dimensional chiral model approach to Self-dual gravity is studied. We showthat the infinite hierarchy of conservation laws associated to the Husain modelcarries implicitly a hidden infinite Hopf algebra structure.
