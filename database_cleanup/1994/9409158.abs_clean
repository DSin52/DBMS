The one-loop contribution to the entropy of a black hole from field modesnear the horizon is computed in string theory. It is modular invariant andultraviolet finite. There is an infrared divergence that signifies aninstability near the event horizon of the black hole. It is due to theexponential growth of the density of states and the associated Hagedorntransition characteristic of string theory. It is argued that this divergenceis indicative of a tree level contribution, and the Bekenstein-Hawking-Gibbonsformula for the entropy should be understood in terms of string states stucknear the horizon.
