We reinterpret U(N) Chern-Simons-Witten theory quantized on a torus as a freefermion system. Its Hilbert space and some observables are simply related tothose of group quantum mechanics, even at finite N and k. Its large N limit canbe described using techniques developed for matrix quantum mechanics andtwo-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. We discuss the bosonization of this theory,which for YM_2 gave a precise interpretation of Wilson loop operators in termsof string creation and annihilation operators, and examine its consequences fora string interpretation here. The formalism seems entirely adequate for theleading large N results and in a sense can be thought of as a `classical stringfield theory'. In considering subleading orders in 1/N, we identify some majordifferences between CSW and YM_2, which must be dealt with to find a CSW gaugestring interpretation. Although these particular differences are probably notrelevant for `QCD string,' they do illustrate some of the issues there, and wecomment on this. We also propose an approach to dealing with large Ntransitions.
