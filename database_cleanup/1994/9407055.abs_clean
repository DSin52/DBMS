We relate in a novel way the modular matrices of GKO diagonal cosets withoutfixed points to those of WZNW tensor products. Using this we classify allmodular invariant partition functions of $su(3)_k\oplus su(3)_1/su(3)_{k+1}$for all positive integer level $k$, and $su(2)_k\oplussu(2)_\ell/su(2)_{k+\ell}$ for all $k$ and infinitely many $\ell$ (in fact, foreach $k$ a positive density of $\ell$). Of all these classifications, only thatfor $su(2)_k\oplus su(2)_1/su(2)_{k+1}$ had been known. Our lists include manynew invariants.
