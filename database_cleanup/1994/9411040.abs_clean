The one-dimensional harmonic oscillator wave functions are solutions to aSturm-Liouville problem posed on the whole real line. This problem generatesthe Hermite polynomials. However, no other set of orthogonal polynomials can beobtained from a Sturm-Liouville problem on the whole real line. In this paperwe show how to characterize an arbitrary set of polynomials orthogonal on$(-\infty,\infty)$ in terms of a system of integro-differential equations ofHartree-Fock type. This system replaces and generalizes the linear differentialequation associated with a Sturm-Liouville problem. We demonstrate our resultsfor the special case of Hahn-Meixner polynomials.
