We discuss O(N) invariant scalar field theories in 0+1 and 1+1 space-timedimensions. Combining ordinary ``Large N" saddle point techniques and simpleproperties of the diagonal resolvent of one dimensional Schr\"odinger operatorswe find {\it exact} non-trivial (space dependent) solutions to the saddle pointequations of these models in addition to the saddle point describing the groundstate of the theory. We interpret these novel saddle points as collective O(N)singlet excitations of the field theory, each embracing a host of finer quantumstates arranged in O(N) multiplets, in an analogous manner to the bandstructure of molecular spectra. We comment on the relation of our results tothe classical work of Dashen, Hasslacher and Neveu and to a previous analysisof bound states in the O(N) model by Abbott.}
