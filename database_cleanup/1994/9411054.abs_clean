We examine a collection of particles interacting with inverse-square two-bodypotentials in the thermodynamic limit. We find explicit large-amplitude densitywaves and soliton solutions for the motion of the system. Waves can beconstructed as coherent states of either solitons or phonons. Therefore, eithersolitons or phonons can be considered as the fundamental excitations. Thegeneric wave is shown to correspond to a two-band state in the quantumdescription of the system, while the limiting cases of solitons and phononscorrespond to particle and hole excitations.
