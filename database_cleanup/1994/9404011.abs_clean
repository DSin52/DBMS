We present a new class of topological conformal field theories (TCFT)characterized by a rational $W$ potential, which includes the minimal models ofA and D types as its subclasses. An explicit form of the $W$ potential is foundby solving the underlying dispersionless KP hierarchy in a particular smallphase space. We discuss also the dispersionless KP hierarchy in large phasespaces by reformulating the hierarchy, and show that the $W$ potential takes auniversal form, which does not depend on a specific form of the solution in alarge space.
