Exact string solutions are presented, where moduli fields are varying withtime. They provide examples where a dynamical change of the topology of spaceis occurring. Some other solutions give cosmological examples where somedimensions are compactified dynamically or simulate pre-big bang typescenarios. Some lessons are drawn concerning the region of validity ofeffective theories and how they can be glued together, using stringyinformation in the region where the geometry and topology are not well definedfrom the low energy point of view. Other time dependent solutions are presentedwhere a hierarchy of scales is absent. Such solutions have dynamics which isqualitatively different and resemble plane gravitational waves.
