$gX\rightarrow \gamma X$, $gX\rightarrow gX$, and $gg\rightarrow gg$ with $X$as an elementary particle of spin less than two in the context of linearizedgravity except the spin-3/2 case. We show explicitly that gravitational gaugeinvariance and Lorentz invariance cause every four-body graviton scatteringamplitude to be factorized. We explore the implications of this factorizationproperty by investigating polarization effects through the covariant densitymatrix formalism in each four-body graviton scattering process.
