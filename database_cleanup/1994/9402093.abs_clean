Polynomial invariants corresponding to the fundamental representation of thegauge group $SU(N)$ are computed for arbitrary torus knots and links in theframework of Chern-Simons gauge theory making use of knot operators. As aresult, a formula for the HOMFLY polynomial for arbitrary torus links ispresented.
