We consider the forced harmonic oscillator quantized according to infinitestatistics ( a special case of the `quon' algebra proposed by Greenberg ). Weshow that in order for the statistics to be consistently evolved the forcingterm must be identically zero for all time. Hence only the free harmonicoscillator may be quantized according to infinite statistics.
