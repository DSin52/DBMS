It is shown that the one-loop ultraviolet divergences in renormalizablesupersymmetric theories can be regulated by the introduction of heavyPauli-Villars chiral supermultiplets, provided the generators of the gaugegroup are traceless in the matter representation. The procedure is extended toinclude supersymmetric gauged nonlinear sigma models.
