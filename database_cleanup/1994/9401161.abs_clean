Quantization of anomalous gauge theories with closed, irreducible gaugealgebra within the extended Field-Antifield formalism is further pursued. Usinga Pauli-Villars (PV) regularization of the generating functional at one looplevel, an alternative form for the anomaly is found which involves only theregulator. The analysis of this expression allows to conclude that recentlyfound ghost number one cocycles with nontrivial antifield dependence can notappear in PV regularization. Afterwards, the extended Field-Antifield formalismis further completed by incorporating quantum effects of the extra variables,i.e., by explicitly taking into account the regularization of the extra sector.In this context, invariant PV regulators are constructed from non-invariantones, leading to an alternative interpretation of the Wess-Zumino action as thelocal counterterm relating invariant and non-invariant regularizations.Finally, application of the above ideas to the bosonic string reproduces thewell-known Liouville action and the shift $(26-D)\rightarrow(25-D)$ at oneloop.
