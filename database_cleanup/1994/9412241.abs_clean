In this report we discuss some results of non--commutative (quantum)probability theory relating the various notions of statistical independence andthe associated quantum central limit theorems to different aspects oftheorems; the description of the master (i.e. central limit) field in matrixmodels along the recent Singer suggestion to relate it to Voiculescu's resultson the freeness of the large $N$ limit of random matrices; quantum stochasticdifferential equations for the gauge master field in QCD; the theory ofstochastic limits of quantum fields and its applications to stochasticbosonization of Fermi fields in any dimensions; new structures in QED such as anonlinear modification of the Wigner semicircle law and the interacting Fockexhibits the non crossing diagrams of the Wigner semicircle law.
