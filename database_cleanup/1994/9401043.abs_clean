This talk presents the review of forgotten but attractive formalism proposedby Joos and Weinberg in the sixties for description of high-spin particles.Problems raised in the recent works [Ahluwalia {\it et al.}] are discussed. Newresults obtained by the author in his preceding papers ["Hadronic J.", 1993, v.16, No. 5, pp. 423-428; No. 6, pp. 459-467; Preprints IFUNAM FT-93-19, 24, 35]are reported. In {\it Appendix}, bibliography of publications related withmentioned $2(2S+1)$- component formalism is presented.
