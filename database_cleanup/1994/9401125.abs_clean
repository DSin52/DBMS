For an arbitrary quantum field in flat space with a planar boundary, anentropy of entanglement, associated with correlations across the boundary, ispresent when the field is in its vacuum state. The vacuum state of the samequantum field appears thermal in Rindler space, with an associated thermalentropy. We show that the density matrices describing the two situations areidentical, and therefore that the two entropies are equal. We comment on thegenerality and significance of this result, and make use of it in analyzing thearea and cutoff dependence of the entropy. The equivalence of the densitymatrices leads us to speculate that a planar boundary in Minkowski space has aclassical entropy given by the Bekenstein--Hawking formula.
