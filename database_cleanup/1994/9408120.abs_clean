We investigate static space dependent $\sigx=\lag\bar\psi\psi\rag$ saddlepoint configurations in the two dimensional Gross-Neveu model in the large Nlimit. We solve the saddle point condition for $\sigx$ explicitly by employingsupersymmetric quantum mechanics and using simple properties of the diagonalresolvent of one dimensional Schr\"odinger operators rather than inversescattering techniques. The resulting solutions in the sector of unbrokensupersymmetry are the Callan-Coleman-Gross-Zee kink configurations. We thusprovide a direct and clean construction of these kinks. In the sector of brokensupersymmetry we derive the DHN saddle point configurations. Our method offinding such non-trivial static configurations may be applied also in other twodimensional field theories.
