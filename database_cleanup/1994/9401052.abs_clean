The colour dipole cross section is the principal quantity in the lightcone$s$-channel description of the diffractive scattering. Recently we have shownthat the dipole cross section satisfies the generalized BFKL equation. In thispaper we discuss properties and solutions of our generalized BFKL equation withallowance for the finite gluon correlation radius $R_{c}$. The latter isintroduced in a gauge invariant manner. We present estimates of the interceptof the pomeron and find the asymptotic form of the dipole cross section.
