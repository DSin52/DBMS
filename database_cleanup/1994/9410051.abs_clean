Title: Search for Duality Symmetries in p-Brane Theories

Comments: 7 pages, plain tex, contribution to the Proc. of the Gursey Memorial

Conf. I on Strings and Symmetries, Istanbul, Turkey, June 6-10, 1994The requirement of an $SL(2)$ duality symmetry, mixing the worldvolume fieldequations with Bianchi identities, leads to a highly nonlinear equationinvolving the transformation parameters and certain worldvolume currents. Ingeneral, this equation seems to admit a solution only for a two parametersubgroup of the seeked $SL(2)$. These transformations also leave invariant thefirst class constraints generating the worldvolume reparametrizations. In thespecial case of $p$--branes in $p+1$ dimensions, the full $SL(2)$ is realized.
