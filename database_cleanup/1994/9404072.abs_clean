We investigate the possible form of local translation invariant conservationlaws associated with the relativistic field equations$\partial\bar\partial\phi_i=-v_i(\bphi)$ for a multicomponent field $\bphi$.Under the assumptions that (i)~the $v_i$'s can be expressed as linearcombinations of partial derivatives $\partial w_j/\partial\phi_k$ of a set offunctions $w_j(\bphi)$, (ii)~the space of functions spanned by the $w_j$'s isclosed under partial derivations, and (iii)~the fields $\bphi$ take values in asimply connected space, the local conservation laws can either be transformedto the form $\partial{\bar{\cal P}}=\bar\partial\sum_j w_j {\cal Q}_j$ (where$\bar{\cal P}$ and ${\cal Q}_j$ are homogeneous polynomials in the variables$\bar\partial\phi_i$, $\bar\partial^2\phi_i$,\ldots), or to the paritytransformed version of this expression $\partial\equiv(\partial_t+\partial_x)/\sqrt{2}\rightleftharpoons\bar\partial \equiv(\partial_t-\partial_x)/\sqrt{2}$.
