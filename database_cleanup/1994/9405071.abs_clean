The special geometry ($(t,{\bar t})$-equations) for twisted $N=2$ strings arederived as consistency conditions of a new contact term algebra. The dilatonappears in the contact terms of topological and antitopological operators. Theholomorphic anomaly, which can be interpreted as measuring the backgrounddependence, is obtained from the contact algebra relations.
