Given a simple Lie algebra $\gggg$, we consider the orbits in $\gggg^*$ whichare of R-matrix type, i.e., which possess a Poisson pencil generated by theKirillov-Kostant-Souriau bracket and the so-called R-matrix bracket. We call analgebra quantizing the latter bracket a quantum orbit of R-matrix type. Wedescribe some orbits of this type explicitly and we construct a quantization ofthe whole Poisson pencil on these orbits in a similar way. The notions ofq-deformed Lie brackets, braided coadjoint vector fields and tangent vectorfields are discussed as well.
