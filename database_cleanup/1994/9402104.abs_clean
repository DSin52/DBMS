Title: Possible Implications of the Quantum Theory of Gravity

Comments: 5 pages, latex document

We consider the implications of some simple assumptions about the nature ofthe quantum theory of gravity which are plausible for a class of possibletheories I have been attempting to construct. The simple assumptions turn outto have surprizingly wide implications of a type one might call philosophical.The paper is short and nontechnical. ( This builds on recent unpublished workof Lee Smolin, but comes to opposite conclusions).
