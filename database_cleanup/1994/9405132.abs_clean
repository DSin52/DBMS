The 2D gravity described by the action which is an arbitrary function of thescalar curvature $f(R)$ is considered. The classical vacuum solutions areanalyzed. The one-loop renormalizability is studied. For the function $f=R \lnR$ the model coupled with scalar (conformal) matter is exactly integrated andis shown to describe a black hole of the 2D dilaton gravity type. The influenceof one-loop quantum corrections on a classical black hole configuration isstudied by including the Liouville-Polyakov term. The resulting model turns outto be exactly solvable. The general solution is analyzed and shown to be freefrom the space-time singularities for a certain number of scalar fields.
