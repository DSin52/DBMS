(The relationship between divergences in the string expansion andphase transitions is more clearly explicated and references are expanded.)Several string theories related to QCD in two dimensions are studied. Foreach of these theories the large $N$ free energy on a (target) sphere of area$A$ is calculated. By considering theories with different subsets of thegeometrical structures involved in the full QCD${}_2$ string theory, thedifferent contributions of these structures to the string free energy arecalculated using both analytic and numerical methods. The equivalence betweenthe leading terms in the $SU(N)$ and $U(N)$ free energies is simplydemonstrated from the string formulation. It is shown that when $\Omega$-pointsare removed from the theory, the free energy is convergent for small and largevalues of $A$ but divergent in an intermediate range. Numerical resultsindicate that the free energy for the full QCD${}_2$ string fails to convergeat the Douglas-Kazakov phase transition point. Similar results for a singlechiral sector of the theory, such as has recently been studied by Cordes,Moore, and Ramgoolam, indicate that there are three distinct phases in thattheory. These results indicate that from the point of view of the strongcoupling phase, the phase transition in the full QCD${}_2$ string arises fromthe entropy of branch-point singularities.
