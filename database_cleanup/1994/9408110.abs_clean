Greene, Morrison and Plesser \cite{GMP} have recently suggested a generalmethod for constructing a mirror map between a $d$-dimensional Calabi-Yauhypersurface and its mirror partner for $d > 3$. We apply their method tosmooth hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces and compute the Chernnumbers of holomorphic curves on these hypersurfaces. As anticipated, theresults satisfy nontrivial integrality constraints. These examples differ fromthose studied previously in that standard methods of algebraic geometry whichwork in the ordinary projective space case for low degree curves are notgenerally applicable. In the limited special cases in which they do work we canget independent predictions, and we find agreement with our results.
