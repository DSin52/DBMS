Title: Kink Chains from Instantons on a Torus

Authors: Paul Sutcliffe

Comments: latex 17 pages, DAMTP 94-77

We describe how the procedure of calculating approximate solitons frominstanton holonomies may be extended to the case of soliton crystals. It isshown how sine-Gordon kink chains may be obtained from CP1 instantons on atorus. These kink chains turn out to be remarkably accurate approximations tothe true solutions. Some remarks on the relevance of this work to Skyrmecrystals are also made.
