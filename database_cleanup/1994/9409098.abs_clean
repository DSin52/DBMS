We use solvable two-dimensional gauge theories to illustrate the issues inrelating large N gauge theory to string theory. We also give an introduction torecent mathematical work which allows constructing master fields for higherdimensional large N theories. We illustrate this with a new derivation of theHopf equation governing the evolution of the spectral density in matrix quantummechanics. Based on lectures given at the 1994 Trieste Spring School on StringTheory, Gauge Theory and Quantum Gravity.
