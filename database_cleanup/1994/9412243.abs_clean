Title: Spacetime Structures and Physical Theories

Comments: Since the electrogravitics reference list prepared by Robert

Stirniman (robert@wwa.com) mentioned my work hep-th/9412243, I would like toreplace it by this revised version with corrections and a more detaileddiscussion. 8 pages, LatexGeneral relativity is applied to the strong interaction; the nexus betweenthe two being arrived at by constructing a line element having the Yukawa form,which is used to describe geometrically the classical dynamics of a particlemoving under the influence of the short-range strong interaction. It is shownthat, with reasonable assumptions, the theory of general relativity can be madecompatible with quantum mechanics by using the general relativistic fieldequations to construct a Robertson-Walker metric for a quantum particle. Theresulting line element of the particle can be transformed entirely to that of aMinkowski spacetime, and the spacetime dynamics of the particle described by aMinkowski observer takes the form of quantum mechanics. It is also discussedthe physical aspects of the affine connection in general relativity and itsrelationship with the field strength of the electromagnetic field and stronginteraction. A heuristic geometric formulation of the electromagnetic field asan independent spacetime structure is presented.
