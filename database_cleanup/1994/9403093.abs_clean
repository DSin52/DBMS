Journal-ref: Lett.Math.Phys. 33 (1995) 33-38

We show that the algebra of the bicovariant differential calculus on aquantum group can be understood as a projection of the cross product between abraided Hopf algebra and the quantum double of the quantum group. The resultingsuper-Hopf algebra can be reproduced by extending the exterior derivative totensor products.
