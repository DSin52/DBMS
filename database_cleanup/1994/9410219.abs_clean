We compute the {\it exact} equation of state of circular strings in the (2+1)dimensional de Sitter (dS) and anti de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes, and analyze itsproperties for the different (oscillating, contracting and expanding) strings.The string equation of state has the perfect fluid form $P=(\gamma-1)E,$ withthe pressure and energy expressed closely and completely in terms of ellipticfunctions, the instantaneous coefficient $\gamma$ depending on the ellipticmodulus. We semi-classically quantize the oscillating circular strings. Thestring mass is $m=\sqrt{C}/(\pi H\alpha'),\;C$ being the Casimir operator,$C=-L_{\mu\nu}L^{\mu\nu},$ of the $O(3,1)$-dS [$O(2,2)$-AdS] group, and $H$ isthe Hubble constant. We find $\alpha'm^2_{\mbox{dS}}\approx 5.9n,\;(n\in N_0),$and a {\it finite} number of states $N_{\mbox{dS}}\approx 0.17/(H^2\alpha')$ inde Sitter spacetime; $m^2_{\mbox{AdS}}\approx 4H^2n^2$ (large $n\in N_0$) and$N_{\mbox{AdS}}=\infty$ in anti de Sitter spacetime. The level spacing growswith $n$ in AdS spacetime, while is approximately constant (although largerthan in Minkowski spacetime) in dS spacetime. The massive states in dSspacetime decay through tunnel effect and the semi-classical decay probabilityis computed. The semi-classical quantization of {\it exact} (circular) stringsand the canonical quantization of generic string perturbations around thestring center of mass strongly agree.
