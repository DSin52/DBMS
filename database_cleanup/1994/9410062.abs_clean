CKM matrix and reconsideration of top quark mass problemTGD suggests the existence of two new branches of physics, namely M_{89}hadron physics and M_{127} leptohadron physics. Leptons and U type quarks arepredicted to have light colored excitations. The anomalous production of e^+e^-pairs in heavy ion collisions sup- ports the existence of light leptomeson butthere are objections against light exotics. a) Asymptotic freedom in thehowever save the situation. b) Z^0 decay width seems to exclude light exotics.The solution of the problem relies on p-adic probability concept. The realcounterpart (\sum_jP(ito j))_R for the sum of p-adic probabi- lities differsfrom the sum \sum_j P(i toj)_R for the real counter- parts of p-adicsignature for final states is used. \sum_j(P(i to j)_R is used, when each finalstate is monitored separately. The total decay rate of $Z^0$ to unmonitoredexotic leptons is sensitive to the value of \theta_W(eff) and vanishes forsin^2(\theta_W(eff))=0.2324 and sensible value of \alpha_s(L)! In TGD theobserved top quark candidate most probably corresponds to u and d quarks ofM_{89} hadron physics. The details of the identification and signatures of thenew Physics are discussed.
