Phenomenologically viable string vacua may require incorporating Kac-Moodyalgebras at level $\geq 2$. We exploit the free fermionic formulation toconstruct N=(0,2) world-sheet supersymmetric string models with specificchiral fermions in gauge groups $SO(10)$ or $SU(5)$, adjoint Higgses, and asingle Yukawa coupling of a fundamental Higgs to the third generation. In thistalk, we will show models of gauge group $SO(10)$ and of $SU(5)$ without anygauge singlet moduli, and show some novel features appearing in the connectionof these two models. The accompanying, and rather non-trivial, discrete chiralsub-algebras can determine hierarchies in the fermion mass matrix. Our approachto string phenomenology opens up the possibility of {\it concrete} explorationsof a wide range of proposals both for dynamical supersymmetry breaking and forthe dynamics of the dilaton and other stringy moduli.
