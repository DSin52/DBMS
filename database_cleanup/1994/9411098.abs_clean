The construction approach proposed in the previous paper Ref. 1 allows usthere and in the present paper to construct at generic deformation parameter$q$ all finite--dimensional representations of the quantum Lie superalgebra$U_{q}[gl(2/2)]$. The finite--dimensional $U_{q}[gl(2/2)]$-modules $W^{q}$constructed in Ref. 1 are either irreducible or indecomposible. If a module$W^{q}$ is indecomposible, i.e. when the condition (4.41) in Ref. 1 does nothold, there exists an invariant maximal submodule of $W^{q}$, to say$I_{k}^{q}$, such that the factor-representation in the factor-module$W^{q}/I_{k}^{q}$ is irreducible and called nontypical. Here, in this paper,indecomposible representations and nontypical finite--dimensionalrepresentations of the quantum Lie superalgebra $U_{q}[gl(2/2)]$ are consideredand classified as their module structures are analized and the matrix elementsof all nontypical representations are written down explicitly.
