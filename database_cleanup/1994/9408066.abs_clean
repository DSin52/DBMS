Ultraviolet regime in quantum theory with horizons, contrary to ordinarytheory, depends on the temperature of the system due to additional surfacedivergences in the effective action. We evaluate their general one-loopstructure paying attention to effects of the curvature of the space-time nearthe horizon. In particular, apart from the area term, the entropy of a blackhole is shown to acquire a topological correction in the form of the integralcurvature of the horizon. To get the entropy, heat capacity and otherthermodynamical quantities finite, such a kind of singularities should beremoved by renormalization of a number of constants in a surface functionalintroduced in the effective action at arbitrary temperature. We also discuss adiscrepancy in the different regularization techniques.
