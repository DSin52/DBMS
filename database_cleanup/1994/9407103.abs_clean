corrected$M$-dimensional extended objects $\Sigma$ can be described by projecting aDiff $\Sigma$ invariant Hamiltonian of time-independent Hamiltonian density{\cal H} onto the Diff $\Sigma$- singlet sector, which after Hamiltonianreduction, using {\cal H} itself for one of the gauge-fixing conditions,results in a non-local description that may enable one to extend the non-localsymmetries for strings to higher dimensions and make contact with gravity at anearly stage.
