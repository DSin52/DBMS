Starting from linear equations for the complex scalar field, the two- andthree-point Green's functions are obtained in the infrared approximation. Weshow that the infrared singularity factorizes in the vertex function as inspinorial QED, reproducing in a straightforward way the result of lenghtyperturbative calculations.
