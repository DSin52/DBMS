The field equations of the Chern-Simons theory quantized in the axial gaugeare shown to be completely determined by supersymmetry Ward identities whichexpress the invariance of the theory under the topological supersymmetry ofDelduc, Gieres and Sorella together with the usual Slavnov identity withoutrequiring any action principle.
