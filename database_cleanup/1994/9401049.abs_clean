A generalisation of the classical Calogero-Moser model obtained by couplingit to the Gaudin model is considered. The recently found classical dynamicalr-matrix [E. Billey, J. Avan and O. Babelon, PAR LPTHE 93-55] for theEuler-Calogero-Moser model is used to separate variables for this generalisedCalogero-Moser model in the case in which there are two Calogero-Moserparticles. The model is then canonically quantised and the same classicalr-matrix is employed to separate variables in the Schr\"odinger equations.
