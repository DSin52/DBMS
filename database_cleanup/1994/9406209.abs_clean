We discuss the semiclassical approximation to the level density of (super)strings propagating in non-compact coset manifolds $G/H$. We show that the WKBansatz agrees with heuristic red-shift arguments with respect to the ``exact"sigma model metric, up to some deviations from minimal coupling, parametrizedby the dilaton. This approximation is used to study thermal ensembles of freestrings in black holes, with the ``brick wall" regularization of `t Hooft. Intwo dimensions the entropy diverges logarithmically with the horizon thickness,and a local Hagedorn transition occurs in higher dimensional models. We alsoobserve that supersymmetry improves the regularity of strings at the horizon.
