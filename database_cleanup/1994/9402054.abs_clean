Comments: 13 pages, translation of the author's article published in Zapiski

Lauchn. Semin. POMI, v.200, 1993, St.PetersburgWe compute the Poisson bracket relations for the monodromy matrix of theauxiliary linear problem. If the basic Poisson bracket relations of the modelcontain derivatives, this computation leads to a peculiar type of symmetrybreaking which accounts for a 'spontaneous quantization of the underlyingglobal gauge group. A classification of possible patterns of symmetry breakingis outlined.
