Using (2+$\epsilon$)-dimensional quantum gravity recently formulated byKawai, Kitazawa and Ninomiya, we calculate the scaling dimensions of manifestlygenerally covariant operators in two-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to$(p,q)$ minimal conformal matter. Although the spectrum includes all thescaling dimensions of the scaling operators in the matrix model except theboundary operators, there are also many others which do not appear in thematrix model. We argue that the partial agreement of the scaling dimensionsshould be considered as accidental and that the operators considered give a newseries of operators in two-dimensional quantum gravity.
