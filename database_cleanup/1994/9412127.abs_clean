We consider the Hamiltonian reduction of the two-loopWess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model (WZNW) based on an untwisted affine Kac-Moodyalgebra $\cgh$. The resulting reduced models, called {\em GeneralizedNon-Abelian Conformal Affine Toda (G-CAT)}, are conformally invariant and awide class of them possesses soliton solutions; these models constitutenon-abelian generalizations of the Conformal Affine Toda models. Their generalsolution is constructed by the Leznov-Saveliev method. Moreover, the dressingtransformations leading to the solutions in the orbit of the vacuum areconsidered in detail, as well as the $\tau$-functions, which are defined forany integrable highest weight representation of $\cgh$, irrespectively of itsparticular realization. When the conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken,the G-CAT model becomes a generalized Affine Toda model, whose solitonsolutions are constructed. Their masses are obtained exploring the spontaneousbreakdown of the conformal symmetry, and their relation to the fundamentalparticle masses is discussed.
