We show that the most general two--matrix model with bilinear couplingunderlies $c=1$ string theory. More precisely we prove that $W_{1+\infty}$constraints, a subset of the correlation functions and the integrable hierarchycharacterizing such two--matrix model, correspond exactly to the $W_{1+\infty}$constraints, to the discrete tachyon correlation functions and to theintegrable hierarchy of the $c=1$ string.
