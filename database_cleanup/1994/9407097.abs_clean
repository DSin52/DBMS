We discuss the relations between (topological) quantum field theories in 4dimensions and the theory of 2-knots (embedded 2-spheres in a 4-manifold). Theso-called BF theories allow the construction of quantum operators whose tracecan be considered as the higher-dimensional generalization of Wilson lines forknots in 3-dimensions. First-order perturbative calculations lead to higherdimensional linking numbers, and it is possible to establish a heuristicrelation between BF theories and Alexander invariants. Functionalintegration-by-parts techniques allow the recovery of an infinitesimal versionof the Zamolodchikov tetrahedron equation, in the form considered by Carter andSaito.
