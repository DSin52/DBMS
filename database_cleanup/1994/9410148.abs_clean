Authors: Mans Henningson

Comments: 12 pages, YCTP-P13-94

(Talk given at the Oskar Klein centenary symposium 19-21 September 1994 inStockholm, Sweden, to appear in the proceedings.) The first half of this talkis a non-technical discussion of some general aspects of string theory, inparticular the problem of compactification. We also give an introduction tomirror symmetry. The second half is a brief account of two recent papers onthis subject; one by the author on mirror symmetry for Kazama-Suzuki models andone by P. Berglund and the author on a search for possible mirror pairs ofLandau-Ginzburg orbifolds.
