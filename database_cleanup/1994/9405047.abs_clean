We describe a canonical covariant formulation of the Green-SchwarzSuperstring which allows the construction of a new covariant action canonicallyequivalent to the Green-Schwarz action but subjected only to first classconstraints. From this action the correct BRST operator for the quantization ofthe Green-Schwarz Superstring may be constructed. Also the gauge fixed actionin the Light-Cone gauge may be reobtained. The action presented in this lettergeneralizes in a non-trivial form the action introduced by Kallosh for theBrink-Schwarz-Casalbuoni Superparticle.
