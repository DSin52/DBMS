Using the associativity relations of the topological Sigma Models with targetspaces, $CP^3, CP^4$ and $Gr(2,4)$ , we derive recursion relations of theircorrelation and evaluate them up to certain order in the expansion over theinstantons. The expansion coeffieients are regarded as the number of rationalcurves in $CP^3, CP^4$ and $Gr(2,4)$ which intersect various types ofsubmanifolds corresponding to the choice of BRST invariant operators in thecorrelation functions.
