The symmetries associated with the closed bosonic string partition functionare examined so that the integration region in Teichmuller space can bedetermined. The conditions on the period matrix defining the fundamental regioncan be translated to relations on the parameters of the uniformizing Schottkygroup. The growth of the lower bound for the regularized partition function isderived through integration over a subset of the fundamental region.
