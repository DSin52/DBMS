Title: Quasiclassical asymptotics of solutions to the KZ equations

Comments: The list of references which was previously incomplete has been

completedThe quasiclassical asymptotics of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov system isstudied. Solutions to this system in this limit are related naturally to Bethevectors in the Gaudin model of spin chains.
