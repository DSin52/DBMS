SystemsWe introduce an integrable time-discretized version of the classicalCalogero-Moser model, which goes to the original model in a continuum limit.This discrete model is obtained from pole solutions of a discretized version ofthe Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, leading to a finite-dimensional symplecticmapping. Lax pair, symplectic structure and sufficient set of invariants of thediscrete Calogero-Moser model are constructed. The classical $r$-matrix is thesame as for the continuum model.
