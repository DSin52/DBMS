Authors: K.Sveshnikov

Comments: 13 pages

It is shown, that extended particle-like objects should infinitely longcollapse into some discontinuous configurations of the same topology, butvanishing mass. Analytic results concerning the general properties andasymptotic rates of such a process are given for 1+1-dimensional solitonmodels.
