The procedure for obtaining integrable vertex models via reflection matriceson the square lattice with open boundaries is reviewed and explicitly carriedout for a number of two- and three-state vertex models. These models includethe six-vertex model, the 15-vertex $A_2^{(1)}$ model and the 19-vertex modelsof Izergin-Korepin and Zamolodchikov-Fateev. In each case the eigenspectra isdetermined by application of either the algebraic or the analytic Bethe ansatzwith inhomeogeneities. With suitable choices of reflection matrices, thesevertex models can be associated with integrable loop models on the samelattice. In general, the required choices {\em do not} coincide with thosewhich lead to quantum group-invariant spin chains. The exact solution of theintegrable loop models -- including an $O(n)$ model on the square lattice withopen boundaries -- is of relevance to the surface critical behaviour oftwo-dimensional polymers.
