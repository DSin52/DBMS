We present a new formulation of the tensionless string ($T= 0$) where thespace-time conformal symmetry is manifest. Using a Hamiltonian BRST scheme wequantize this {\em Conformal String} and find that it has critical dimension$D=2$. This is in keeping with our classical result that the model describesmassless particles in this dimension. It is also consistent with our previousresults which indicate that quantized conformally symmetric tensionless stringsdescribe a topological phase away {}from $D=2$. We reach our result bydemanding nilpotency of the BRST charge and consistency with the Jacobilanguage and using mode expansions. Careful attention is payed toregularization, a crucial ingredient in our calculations.
