The BRST transformations for gravity with torsion including Weyl symmetry arediscussed by using the so-called Maurer-Cartan horizontality conditions. Alsothe coupling of scalar matter fields to gravity is incorporated in thisanalysis. With the help of an operator $\d$ which allows to decompose theexterior space-time derivative as a BRST commutator we solve the Wess-Zuminoconsistency condition corresponding to invariant Lagrangians and anomalies forthe cases with and without Weyl symmetry.
