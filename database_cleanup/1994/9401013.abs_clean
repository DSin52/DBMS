For $2D$ string theory, the perturbative $S$-matrices are not well-defineddue to a zero mode divergence. Although there exist formal procedures to makethe integral convergent, their physical meanings are unclear. We describe amethod to obtain finite $S$-matrices physically to justify the formal schemes.The scheme uses asymptotic states by wave packets which fall faster thanexponentials. It is shown that the scheme gives well-defined $S$-matrices andjustifies the formal shifted Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude for simple processes.The tree-level unitarity for these processes is also shown. We point out aproblem in this scheme.
