The S--duality transformations of the lowest order string effective theoryadmit a space time interpretation for 4-dim backgrounds with one Killingsymmetry. Starting from pure gravity and performing a sequence of intertwinedT-S-T duality transformations we obtain new solutions which are always puregravitational. In this fashion, S-duality induces an $SL(2,R)$ transformationin the space of target space metrics which coincides with the action of theEhlers-Geroch group and interchanges the electric with the magnetic aspects ofgravity. Specializing to gravitational instanton backgrounds we show that ALEinstantons are mapped to (multi) Taub-NUT backgrounds and vice-versa. We find,however, that the self-duality of the metric is not generically preserved,unless the corresponding Killing vector field has self-dual covariantderivatives. Thus, the T-S-T transformations are not always compatible with theworld-sheet supersymmetry of $N=4$ superconformal string vacua. We also providean algebraic characterization of the corresponding obstruction and associate itwith a breakdown of space time supersymmetry under rotational T-dualitytransformations.
