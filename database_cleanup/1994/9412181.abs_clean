We consider a scalar-metric gauge theory of gravity with independent metric,connection and dilaton. The role of the dilaton is to provide the scale of allmasses, via its vacuum expectation value. In this theory, we study therenormalization group flow of the dilaton potential, taking into accountthreshold effects at the Planck scale. Due to the running of the VEV of thedilaton all particles that would naively seem to have masses larger thanPlanck's mass, may actually not propagate. This could solve the problem ofunitarity in these theories.
