We describe several different regimes which are possible in inflationarycosmology. The simplest one is inflation without self-reproduction of theuniverse. In this scenario the universe is not stationary. The second regime,which exists in a broad class of inflationary models, is eternal inflation withthe self-reproduction of inflationary domains. In this regime local propertiesof domains with a given density and given values of fields do not depend on thetime when these domains were produced. The probability distribution to find adomain with given properties in a self-reproducing universe may or may not bestationary, depending on the choice of an inflationary model. We give examplesof models where each of these possibilities can be realized, and discuss someimplications of our results for quantum cosmology. In particular, we propose anew mechanism which may help solving the cosmological constant problem.
