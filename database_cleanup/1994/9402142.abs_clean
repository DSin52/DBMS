Title: Realisations of $GL_{p,q}(2)$ quantum group and its coloured extension

through a novel Hopf algebra with five generatorsComments: 24 pages

A novel Hopf algebra $ ( {\tilde G}_{r,s} )$, depending on two deformationparameters and five generators, has been constructed. This $ {\tilde G}_{r,s}$Hopf algebra might be considered as some quantisation of classical $GL(2)\otimes GL(1) $ group, which contains the standard $GL_q(2)$ quantum group(with $ q=r^{-1} $) as a Hopf subalgebra. However, we interestingly observethat the two parameter deformed $GL_{p,q}(2)$ quantum group can also berealised through the generators of this $ {\tilde G}_{r,s}$ algebra, providedthe sets of deformation parameters $p,~q$ and $r,~s$ are related to each otherin a particular fashion. Subsequently we construct the invariant noncommutativeplanes associated with $ {\tilde G}_{r,s}$ algebra and show how the two wellknown Manin planes corresponding to $GL_{p,q}(2)$ quantum group can easily bereproduced through such construction. Finally we consider the `coloured'extension of $GL_{p,q}(2)$ quantum group as well as corresponding Manin planesand explore their intimate connection with the `coloured' extension of${\tilde G}_{r,s}$ Hopf structure.
