We introduce a new family of gauge invariant regularizations of Chern-Simonstheories which generate one-loop renormalizations of the coupling constant ofthe form $k\to k+2 s c_v$ where $s$ can take any arbitrary integer value. Inthe particular case $s=0$ we get an explicit example of a gauge invariantregularization which does not generate radiative corrections to the barecoupling constant. This ambiguity in the radiative corrections to $k$ isreminiscent of the Coste-L\"uscher results for the parity anomaly in (2+1)fermionic effective actions.
