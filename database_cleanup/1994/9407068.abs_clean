We investigate the representation theory of some recently constructed N=2super W-algebras with two generators. Except for the central charges in theunitary minimal series of the N=2 super Virasoro algebra we find no newrational models. However, from our results it is possible to arrange all knownN=2 super W-algebras with two generators and vanishing self-coupling constantinto four classes. For the algebras existing for c >= 3 which can be understoodby the spectral flow of the N=2 super Virasoro algebra we find that therepresentations have quantized U(1) charge.
