A set of integral relations for rotational and translational zero modes inthe vicinity of the soliton solution are derived from the particle-likeproperties of the latter and verified for a number of models (solitons in1+1-dimensions, skyrmeons in 2+1- and 3+1-dimensions, non-abelian monopoles).It is shown, that by consistent quantization within the framework of collectivecoordinates these relations ensure the correct diagonal expressions for thekinetic and centrifugal terms in the Hamiltonian in the lowest orders of theperturbation expansion. The connection between these properties and virialrelations is also determined.
