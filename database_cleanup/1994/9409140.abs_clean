Title: Killing-Yano tensors and generalized supersymmetries in black-hole and

monopole geometriesAuthors: J.W. van Holten

Comments: 12 pages, NIKHEF-H/94-29

New kinds of supersymmetry arise in supersymmetric $\sg$-models describingthe motion of spinning point-particles in classical backgrounds, for exampleblack-holes, or the dynamics of monopoles. Their geometric origin is theexistence of Killing-Yano tensors. The relation between these concepts isexplained and examples are given. --- Contribution to Proceedings Quarks-94;Vladimir, Russia (1994).
