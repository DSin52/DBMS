We investigate the consistency of the background-field formalism whenapplying various regularizations and renormalization schemes. By an example ofa two-dimensional $\sigma$ model it is demonstrated that the background-fieldmethod gives incorrect results when the regularization (and/or renormalization)is noninvariant. In particular, it is found that the cut-off regularization andthe differential renormalization belong to this class and are incompatible withthe background-field method in theories with nonlinear symmetries.
