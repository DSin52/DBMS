of neutrino massesThis paper belongs to a series devoted to the calculation of particle massesin p-adic conformal field theory limit of TGD. In paper III elementary particlemasses were calculated. In this paper the results are analyzed. One canreproduce lepton and gauge boson masses exactly by taking into account Coulombself energy associated with the interior of 3-surface and a small mixing ofboundary topologies of charged leptons. Hadronic mass formula in- volvesboundary contributions of quarks calculated previously plus interior termconsisting isospin-isopin, color magnetic spin-spin and color Coulombic terms.One must take also into account mixing of boundary topologies, the mixing forprimary condensate levels (quark spends part of time at lower condensate level)and mixing of I=0,J=0 mesons. Topological mixing implies the nontriviality ofCKM matrix. An open question is how uniquely rationality require- ment fixesCKM matrix. It is possible to reproduce CKM matrix sa- tisfying the empiricalconstraints. CP breaking is a number theo- retical necessity. The large mixingof u and c quarks solves the spin crisis of proton. The parameters associatedwith other O(p) contributions can be fixed by no Planck mass condition plussome empirical inputs. O(p^2) contributions are also discu- ssed and observedisospin splittings can be reproduced.
