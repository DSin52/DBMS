Title: Some Simple (Integrable) Models of Fractional Statistics

Comments: 18 pages, Latex. Two lectures presented at 1994 Les Houches Summer

School ``Fluctuating Geometries in Statistical Mechanics and Field Theory''In the first part, we introduce the notion of fractional statistics in thesense of Haldane. We illustrate it on simple models related to anyon physicsand to integrable models solvable by the Bethe ansatz. In the second part, wedescribe the properties of the long-range interacting spin chains. We describeits infinite dimensional symmetry, and we explain how the fractional statisticsof its elementary excitations is an echo of this symmetry. In the third part,we review recent results on the Yangian representation theory which emergedfrom the study of the integrable long-range interacting models.
