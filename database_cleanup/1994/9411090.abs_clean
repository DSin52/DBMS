Gravity can arise in a conventional non-Abelian gauge theory in which aspecific phenomenon takes place. Suppose there is a condensation of polarizedinstantons and antiinstantons in the vacuum state. Then the excitations of thegauge field in the classical approximation are described through the variablesof Riemann geometry satisfying the Einstein equations of general relativity.There are no dimensional coupling constants in the theory.
