The pseudoclassical hamiltonian and action of the $D=2n$ dimensional Diracparticle with anomalous magnetic moment interacting with the externalYang-Mills field are found. The Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation of motion forthe Pauli-Lubanski vector is deduced. The canonical quantization of $D=2n$dimensional Dirac spinning particle with anomalous magnetic moment in theexternal Yang-Mills field is carried out in the gauge which allows to describesimultaneously particles and antiparticles (massive and massless) already atthe classical level. Pseudoclassical Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation is used toobtain canonical (Newton-Wigner) coordinates and in terms of these variablesthe theory is quantized.
