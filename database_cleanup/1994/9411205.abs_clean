The monopole equations in the dual abelian theory of the N=2 gauge-theory,recently proposed by Witten as a new tool to study topological invariants, areshown to be the simplest elements in a class of instanton equations that followfrom the improved topological twist mechanism introduced by the authors inprevious papers. When applied to the N=2 sigma-model, this twisting proceduresuggested the introduction of the so-called hyperinstantons, or triholomorphicmaps. When gauging the sigma-model by coupling it to the vector multiplet of agauge group G, one gets gauged hyperinstantons that reduce to theSeiberg-Witten equations in the flat case and G=U(1). The deformation of theself-duality condition on the gauge-field strength due to themonopole-hyperinstanton is very similar to the deformation of the self-dualitycondition on the Riemann curvature previously observed by the authors when thehyperinstantons are coupled to topological gravity. In this paper the generalform of the hyperinstantonic equations coupled to both gravity and gaugemultiplets is presented.
