We prove that $\W_3$ is the gauge symmetry of the scale-invariant rigidparticle, whose action is given by the integrated extrinsic curvature of itsworld line. This is achieved by showing that its equations of motion can bewritten in terms of the Boussinesq operator. The $\W_3$ generators $T$ and $W$then appear respectively as functions of the induced world line metric and theextrinsic curvature. We also show how the equations of motion for the standardrelativistic particle arise from those of the rigid particle whenever it isconsistent to impose the ``zero-curvature gauge'', and how to rewrite them interms of the $\KdV$ operator. The relation between particle models andintegrable systems is further pursued in the case of the spinning particle,whose equations of motion are closely related to the $\SKdV$ operator. We alsopartially extend our analysis in the supersymmetric domain to the scaleinvariant rigid particle by explicitly constructing a supercovariant version ofpublished in the Proceedings of the Workshop on the Geometry of ConstrainedDynamical Systems, held at the Isaac Newton Institute for MathematicalSciences, Cambridge, June 14-18, 1994.).
