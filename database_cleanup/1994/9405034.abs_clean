In a space-time of two dimensions the overall effect of the collision of twosolitons is a time delay (or advance) of their final trajectories relative totheir initial trajectories. For the solitons of affine Toda field theories, thespace-time displacement of the trajectories is proportional to the logarithm ofa number $X$ depending only on the species of the colliding solitons and theirrapidity difference. $X$ is the factor arising in the normal ordering of theproduct of the two vertex operators associated with the solitons. $X$ is shownto take real values between $0$ and $1$. This means that, whenever the solitonsare distinguishable, so that transmission rather than reflection is the onlypossible interpretation of the classical scattering process, the time delay isnegative and so an indication of attractive forces between the solitons.
