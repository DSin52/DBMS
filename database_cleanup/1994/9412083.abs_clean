Lie bialgebra contractions are introduced and classified. A non-degeneratecoboundary bialgebra structure is implemented into all pseudo-orthogonalalgebras $so(p,q)$ starting from the one corresponding to $so(N+1)$. It allowsto introduce a set of Lie bialgebra contractions which leads to Lie bialgebrasof quasi-orthogonal algebras. This construction is explicitly given for thecases $N=2,3,4$. All Lie bialgebra contractions studied in this paper defineHopf algebra contractions for the Drinfel'd-Jimbo deformations $U_z so(p,q)$.They are explicitly used to generate new non-semisimple quantum algebras as itis the case for the Euclidean, Poincar\'e and Galilean algebras.
