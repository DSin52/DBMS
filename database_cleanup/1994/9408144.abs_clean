We have examined effective theory induced by gauged WZW models, in which thetachyon field is added as a marginal operator. Due to this operator added, wemust further add the higher order corrections, which modifies the originalconfiguration, to make the theory full-conformally invariant. It has been foundthat 2d is a critical dimension in the sense that the metric obtained fromgauged WZW is modified by the tachyon condensation for $d>2$, but not for $d\le2$.
