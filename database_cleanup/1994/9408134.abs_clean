Above the Hagedorn energy density closed fundamental strings form a longstring phase. The dynamics of weakly interacting long strings is described by asimple Boltzmann equation which can be solved explicitly for equilibriumdistributions. The average total number of long strings grows logarithmicallywith total energy in the microcanonical ensemble. This is consistent withcalculations of the free single string density of states provided thethermodynamic limit is carefully defined. If the theory contains open stringsthe long string phase is suppressed.
