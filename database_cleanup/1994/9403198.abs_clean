Supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions can display interestingnon-perturbative phenomena. Although the superpotential dynamically generatedby these phenomena can be highly nontrivial, it can often be exactlydetermined. We discuss some general techniques for analyzing the Wilsoniansuperpotential and demonstrate them with simple but non-trivial examples.
