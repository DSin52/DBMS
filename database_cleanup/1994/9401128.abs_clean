We consider the generalized momentum-depending quon algebra in a dynamicallyevolving curved spacetime and perform a type of analysis similar to that ofJ.W.Goodison and D.J.Toms. We find that, at least in principle, all kinds ofstatistics may occur in some regions, i.e. phases in momentum space, dependingon Bogoliubov coefficients determined by a specific dynamical model.
