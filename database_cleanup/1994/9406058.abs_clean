Title: Maintaining coherence in Quantum Computers

Comments: 13 pages

The effect of the inevitable coupling to external degrees of freedom of aquantum computer are examined. It is found that for quantum calculations (inwhich the maintenance of coherence over a large number of states is important),not only must the coupling be small but the time taken in the quantumcalculation must be less than the thermal time scale, $\hbar/k_B T$. For longertimes the condition on the strength of the coupling to the external worldbecomes much more stringent.
