We explore the application of approximation schemes from many body physics,including the Hartree-Fock method and random phase approximation (RPA), to theproblem of analyzing the low energy excitations of a polymer chain made up ofbosonic string bits. We accordingly obtain an expression for the rest tension$T_0$ of the bosonic relativistic string in terms of the parameterscharacterizing the microscopic string bit dynamics. We first derive an exactconnection between the string tension and a certain correlation function of themany-body string bit system. This connection is made for an arbitraryinteraction potential between string bits and relies on an exact dipole sumrule. We then review an earlier calculation by Goldstone of the low energyexcitations of a polymer chain using RPA. We assess the accuracy of the RPA bycalculating the first order corrections. For this purpose we specialize to theunique scale invariant potential, namely an attractive delta function potentialin two (transverse) dimensions. We find that the corrections are large, anddiscuss a method for summing the large terms. The corrections to this improvedRPA are roughly 15\%.
