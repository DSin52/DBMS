We investigate in detail the critical $N{=}2$ fermionic string with andwithout a global ${\bf Z}_2$ twist. An analysis of BRST cohomology shows thattwisted sectors contain massless `spacetime' fermions which are {\itnon-local\/} with respect to the standard massless boson. However, two distinctGSO projections exist, one (untwisted) retaining merely the usual boson and itsspectral-flow partner, the other (twisted) yielding two fermions and one boson,on the massless level. The corresponding chiral BRST-invariant vertex operatorsare constructed in certain pictures, and their fusion and picture-changing areinvestigated, including the construction of inverse picture-changing operators.The $N{=}2$ `spacetime supersymmetry' generators are {\it null\/} operators,since the twisted massless states fail to interact. The untwisted three- andfour-point functions are recalculated at tree-level.
