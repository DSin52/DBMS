Title: Explicit thermostatics of certain classical one-dimensional lattice

models by harmonic analysisAuthors: Georg Junker

Comments: 6 pages

A certain class of one-dimensional classical lattice models is considered.Using the method of abstract harmonic analysis explicit thermostatic propertiesof such models are derived. In particular, we discuss the low-temperaturebehavior of some of these models.
