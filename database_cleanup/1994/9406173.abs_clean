It is shown that the standard mod-$p$ valued intersection form can be used todefine Boltzmann weights of subdivision invariant lattice models with gaugegroup $Z_{p}$. In particular, we discuss a four dimensional model which isbased upon the assignment of field variables to the $2$-simplices of thesimplicial complex. The action is taken to be the intersection form defined onthe second cohomology group of the complex, with coefficients in $Z_{p}$.Subdivision invariance of the theory follows when the coupling constant isquantized and the field configurations are restricted to those satisfying amod-$p$ flatness condition. We present an explicit computation of the partitionfunction for the manifold $\pm CP^{2}$, demonstrating non-triviality.
