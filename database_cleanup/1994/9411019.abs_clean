The free energy is shown to decrease along Wilson renormalization grouptrajectories, in a dimension-independent fashion, for $d>2.$ The argumentassumes the monotonicity of the cutoff function, and positivity of a spectralrepresentation of the two point function. The argument is valid to all ordersin perturbation theory.
