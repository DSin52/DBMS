The BRST quantisation of the Drinfeld - Sokolov reduction applied to the caseof $A^{(1)}_2\,$ is explored to construct in an unified and systematic way thegeneral singular vectors in ${\cal W}_3$ and ${\cal W}_3^{(2)}$ Verma modules.The construction relies on the use of proper quantum analogues of the classicalDS gauge fixing transformations. Furthermore the stability groups $\overlineW^{(\eta)}\,$ of the highest weights of the ${\cal W}\,$ - Verma modules playan important role in the proof of the BRST equivalence of theMalikov-Feigin-Fuks singular vectors and the ${\cal W}$ algebra ones. Theresulting singular vectors are essentially classified by the affine Weyl group$W\, $ modulo $\overline W^{(\eta)}\,$. This is a detailed presentation of theresults announced in a recent paper of the authors (Phys. Lett. B318 (1993)85).
