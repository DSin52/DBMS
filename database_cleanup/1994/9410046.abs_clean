Title: Kaluza-Klein Theory in Perspective

Authors: M. J. Duff

Comments: 38 pages latex, NI-94-015

The Kaluza-Klein idea of extra spacetime dimensions continues to pervadecurrent attempts to unify the fundamental forces, but in ways somewhatdifferent from that originally envisaged. We present a modern perspective onthe role of internal dimensions in physics, focussing in particular onsuperstring theory. A novel result is the interpretation of Kaluza-Klein stringstates as extreme black holes.(Talk delivered at the Oskar Klein CentenaryNobel Symposium, Stockholm, September 19-21, 1994.)
