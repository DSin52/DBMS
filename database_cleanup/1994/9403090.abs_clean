Title: Diffeomorphisms of Curved Manifolds

Comments: 10 pages

We obtain an expression for the curvature of the Lie group SDiff$\cal M$ anduse it to derive Lukatskii's formula for the case where $\cal M$ is locallyEuclidean. We discuss qualitatively some previous findings for SDiff$S^{2}$ inconjunction with our result.
