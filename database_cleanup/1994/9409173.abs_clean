A test on the numerical accuracy of the semiclassical approximation as afunction of the principal quantum number has been performed for thePullen--Edmonds model, a two--dimensional, non--integrable, scaling invariantperturbation of the resonant harmonic oscillator. A perturbative interpretationis obtained of the recently observed phenomenon of the accuracy decrease on theapproximation of individual energy levels at the increase of the principalquantum number. Moreover, the accuracy provided by the semiclassicalapproximation formula is on the average the same as that provided by quantumperturbation theory.
