It is shown that the Coulomb correlation problem for a system of twoelectrons (two charged particles) in an external oscillator potential possessesa hidden $sl_2$-algebraic structure being one of recently-discoveredquasi-exactly-solvable problems. The origin of existing exact solutions to thisproblem, recently discovered by several authors, is explained. A degeneracy ofenergies in electron-electron and electron-positron correlation problems isfound. It manifests the first appearence of hidden $sl_2$-algebraic structurein atomic physics.
