(Talk presented at the 7th Marcel Grossmann Meeting on General Relativity,Stanford, CA, July 24-30, 1994) We study the semi-classical limit of thesolution of the Dirac equation in a background electromagnetic/gravitationalplane wave. We show that the exact solution corresponding to an asymptoticallyfixed incoming momentum satisfies constraints consistent with the classicalnotion of a spinning particle. In order to further analyze the motion of aspinning particle in this external inhomogeneous field one has to considerwave-packet superpositions of these exact solutions. We are currentlyinvestigating the existence of a classical theory of a phenomenological spintensor which reproduces our quantum-mechanical results.
