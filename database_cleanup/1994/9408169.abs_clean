Some years ago Dray and 't Hooft found the necessary and sufficientconditions to introduce a gravitational shock wave in a particular class ofvacuum solutions to Einstein's equations. We extend this work to cover caseswhere non-vanishing matter fields and cosmological constant are present. Thesources of gravitational waves are massless particles moving along a nullsurface such as a horizon in the case of black holes. After we discuss thegeneral case we give many explicit examples. Among them are the $d$-dimensionalcharged black hole (that includes the 4-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om andthe $d$-dimensional Schwarzschild solution as subcases), the 4-dimensionalDe-Sitter and Anti-De-Sitter spaces (and the Schwarzschild-De-Sitter blackhole), the 3-dimensional Anti-De-Sitter black hole, as well as backgrounds witha covariantly constant null Killing vector. We also address the analogousproblem for string inspired gravitational solutions and give a few examples.
