Title: Racks and Orbits of Dressing Transformations

Authors: A. Balinsky

Comments: LaTex-file, 9 pp

New algebraic structure on the orbits of dressing transformations of thequasitriangular Poisson Lie groups is provided. This give the topologicalinterpretation of the link invariants associated with the Weinstein--Xuclassical solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. Some applications tothe three-dimensional topological quantum field theories are discussed.
