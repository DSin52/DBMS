Title: BRST-Antibracket Cohomology in 2D Conformal Gravity

Authors: Friedemann Brandt, Walter Troost and Antoine Van Proeyen

Comments: 14 pages, LaTex, NIKHEF-H 94-16, KUL-TF-94/17, to appear in the

proceedings of the `Geometry of Constrained Dynamical Systems' workshop,Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Cambridge, June 15--18,1994We present results of a computation of the BRST-antibracket cohomology in thespace of local functionals of the fields and antifields for a class of 2dgravitational theories which are conformally invariant at the classical level.In particular all classical local action functionals, all candidate anomaliesand all BRST--invariant functionals depending nontrivially on antifields aregiven and discussed for these models.
