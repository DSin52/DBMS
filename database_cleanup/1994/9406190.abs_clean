Title: A nonmeromorphic extension of the moonshine module vertex operator

algebraComments: 26 pages. Final version to appear in the Proceedings

of the Moonshine, the Monster, and related topics, Summer ResearchConference, Mount Holyoke, 1994, Contemporary MathematicsWe describe a natural structure of an abelian intertwining algebra (in thesense of Dong and Lepowsky) on the direct sum of the untwisted vertex operatoralgebra constructed {}from the Leech lattice and its (unique) irreducibletwisted module. When restricting ourselves to the moonshine module, we obtain anew and conceptual proof that the moonshine module has a natural structure of avertex operator algebra. This abelian intertwining algebra also contains anirreducible twisted module for the moonshine module with respect to the obviousinvolution. In addition, it contains a vertex operator superalgebra and atwisted module for this vertex operator superalgebra with respect to theinvolution which is the identity on the even subspace and is $-1$ on the oddsubspace. It also gives the superconformal structures observed by Dixon,Ginsparg and Harvey.
