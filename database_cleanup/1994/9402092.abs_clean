Two-dimensional SU($N$) gauge theory is accurately analyzed with thelight-front Tamm-Dancoff approximation, both numerically and analytically. Thelight-front Einstein-Schr\"odinger equation for mesonic mass reduces to the 'tHooft equation in the large $N$ limit, $g^2N$ fixed, where $g$ is the couplingconstant. Hadronic masses are numerically obtained in the region of $m^2 \llg^2N$, where $m$ is the bare quark (q) mass. The lightest mesonic and baryonicstates are almost in valence. The second lightest mesonic state is highlyrelativistic in the sense that it has a large 4-body ($ {\rm qq} \bar{\rm q}\bar{\rm q} $) component in addition to the valence (${\rm q} \bar{\rm q}$)one. In the strong coupling limit our results are consistent with theprediction of the bosonization for ratios of the lightest and second lightestmesonic masses to the lightest baryonic one. Analytic solutions to the lightesthadronic masses are obtained, with a reasonable approximation, as$\sqrt{2Cm}(1-1/N^2)^{1/4}$ in the mesonic case and$\sqrt{CmN(N-1)}(1-1/N^2)^{1/4}$ in the baryonic case, where$C=(g^2N\pi/6)^{1/2}$. The solutions well reproduce the numerical ones. The$N$- and $m$-dependences of the hadronic masses are explicitly shown by theanalytical solutions.
