We present evidence for an undiscovered link between N=2 supersymmetricquantum field theories and the mathematical theory of helices of coherentsheaves. We give a thorough review for nonspecialists of both the mathematicsand physics involved, and invite the reader to take up the search for thiselusive connection.
