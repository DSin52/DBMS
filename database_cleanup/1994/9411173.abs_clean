Title: Observation and superselection in quantum mechanics

Comments: LaTeX, 38 pages

We attempt to clarify the main conceptual issues in approaches to`objectification' or `measurement' in quantum mechanics which are based onsuperselection rules. Such approaches venture to derive the emergence ofclassical `reality' relative to a class of observers; those believing that theclassical world exists intrinsically and absolutely are advised against readingthis paper. The prototype approach (Hepp) where superselection sectors areassumed in the state space of the apparatus is shown to be untenable. Instead,one should couple system and apparatus to an environment, and postulatesuperselection rules for the latter. These are motivated by the locality of anyobserver or other (actual or virtual) monitoring system. In this way`environmental' solutions to the measurement problem (Zeh, Zurek) becomeconsistent and acceptable, too. Points of contact with the modal interpretationare briefly discussed. We propose a minimal value attribution to observables intheories with superselection rules, in which only central observables haveproperties. In particular, the eigenvector-eigenvalue link is dropped. This ismainly motivated by Ockham's razor.
