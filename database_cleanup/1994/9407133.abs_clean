We consider wormhole solutions in $2+1$ Euclidean dimensions. A dualitytransformation is introduced to derive a new action from magnetic wormholeaction of Gupta, Hughes, Preskill and Wise. The classical solution ispresented. The vertex operators corresponding to the wormhole are derived.Conformally coupled scalars and spinors are considered in the wormholebackground and the vertex operators are computed.
