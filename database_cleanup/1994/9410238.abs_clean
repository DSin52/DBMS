We discuss a field theoretical extension of the basic structures of classicalanalytical mechanics within the framework of the De Donder--Weyl (DW) covariantHamiltonian formulation. The analogue of the symplectic form is argued to bethe {\em polysymplectic} form of degree $(n+1)$, where $n$ is the dimension ofspace-time, which defines a map between multivector fields or, more generally,graded derivation operators on exterior algebra, and forms of various degreeswhich play a role of dynamical variables. The Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket onmultivector fields induces the graded analogue of the Poisson bracket on forms,which turns the exterior algebra of (horizontal) forms to a Gerstenhaberalgebra. The equations of motion are written in terms of the Poisson bracket onforms and it is argued that the bracket with $H\vol$, where $H$ is the DWHamiltonian function and $\vol$ is the horizontal (i.e. space-time) volumeform, is related to the operation of exterior differentiation of forms.
