preprint LA-UR-94-1949. Invited talk at 2nd International Workshop onHarmonic Oscillators, held at Cocoyoc, Morelos, MexicoFor zero energy, $E=0$, we derive exact, classical and quantum solutions for{\em all} power-law oscillators with potentials $V(r)=-\gamma/r^\nu$,$\gamma>0$ and $-\infty <\nu<\infty$. When the angular momentum is non-zero,these solutions lead to the classical orbits $\r(t)= [\cos \mu(\th(t)-\th_0(t))]^{1/\mu}$, with $\mu=\nu/2-1 \ne 0$. For $\nu>2$, the orbitsare bound and go through the origin. We calculate the periods and precessionsof these bound orbits, and graph a number of specific examples. The unboundorbits are also discussed in detail. Quantum mechanically, this system is alsoexactly solvable. We find that when $\nu>2$ the solutions are normalizable(bound), as in the classical case. Further, there are normalizable discrete,yet {\it unbound}, states. They correspond to unbound classical particles whichreach infinity in a finite time. Finally, the number of space dimensions of thesystem can determine whether or not an $E=0$ state is bound. These and otherinteresting comparisons to the classical system will be discussed.
