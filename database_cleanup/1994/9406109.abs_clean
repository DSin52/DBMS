27th July 1994)Swimming of microorganisms is further developed from a viewpoint of stringsand membranes swimming in the incompressible fluid of low Reynolds number. Inour previous paper the flagellated motion was analyzed in two dimensionalfluid, by using the method developed in the ciliated motion with the Joukowskitransformation. This method is further refined by incorporating the inertiaterm of fluid as the perturbation. Understanding of the algebra controlling thedeformation of microorganisms in the fluid is further developed, obtaining thecentral extension of the algebra with the help of the recent progress on the$W_{1+\infty}$ algebra. Our previous suggestion on the usefulness of the$N$-point string- and membrane-like amplitudes for studying the collectiveswimming motion of $N-1$ microorganisms is also examined.
