We show that the classical equations of motion of the low-energy effectivefield theory describing the massless modes of the heterotic (or type I) stringadmit two classes of supersymmetric self--dual backgrounds. The first class,which was already considered in the literature, consists of solutions with a(conformally) flat metric coupled to axionic instantons. The second includesAsymptotically Locally Euclidean (ALE) gravitational instantonic backgroundscoupled to gauge instantons through the so--called ``standard embedding''. Weshow that some elements of these two classes of solutions are dual to eachother in the sense of Buscher's duality. We give a world--sheet interpretationof the heterotic ALE istanton solutions in terms of superconformal $N=(4,4)$$\s$--models and argue for their validity to all orders in $\alpha^\prime$.Specializing the gravitational background to the Eguchi--Hanson instanton, wecompute the indices of the fermionic operators and give the explicit form ofall the relevant fermionic and bosonic zero--modes.}
