In this talk we review some results concerning a mechanism for reducing themoduli space of a topological field theory to a proper submanifold of theordinary moduli space. Such mechanism is explicitly realized in the example ofconstrained topological gravity, obtained by topologically twisting the N=2Liouville theory.
