Authors: Gerald B. Cleaver

Comments: 11 pages OHSTPY-HEP-T-94-007. Some clarification of statements.

Correction to references. Use standard TeX. One table not included. Toreceive table please send request to gcleaver@pacific.mps.ohio-state.eduI discuss how effective grand unified theories requiring adjoint Higgs fieldsfor breaking to the standard model can be contained within string theory.Initial findings are presented in a search for and classification of effectivethree generation SO(10) SUSY-GUT models built using the free-fermionic stringapproach. Based on talk presented at PASCOS '94, Syracuse, NY.
