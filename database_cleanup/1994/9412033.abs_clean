We complete the classification of (2,2) vacua that can be constructed fromLandau--Ginzburg models by abelian twists with arbitrary discrete torsions.Compared to the case without torsion the number of new spectra is surprisinglysmall. In contrast to a popular expectation mirror symmetry does not seem to berelated to discrete torsion (at least not in the present compactificationwith torsion; for more general potentials, on the other hand, the new spectraneither have nor provide mirror partners in our class of models.
