We study a class of models in which $N$ flavors of massless fermions on thehalf line are coupled by an arbitrary orthogonal matrix to $N$ rotors living onthe boundary. Integrating out the rotors, we find the exact partition functionand Green's functions. We demonstrate that the coupling matrix must satisfy acertain rationality constraint, so there is an infinite, discrete set ofpossible coupling matrices. For one particular choice of the coupling matrix,this model reproduces the low-energy dynamics of fermions scattering from amagnetic monopole. A quick survey of the Green's functions shows that theS-matrix is nonunitary. This nonunitarity is present in previous results forthe monopole-fermion system, although it appears not to have been noted. Weindicate how unitarity may be restored by expanding the Fock space to includenew states that are unavoidably introduced by the boundary interaction.
