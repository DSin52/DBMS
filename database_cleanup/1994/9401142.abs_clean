In the paper the nilpotent conditions of BRST operator for new superconformalstring model were found. This string includes anticommutation $2-d$ fieldsadditional to the standard Neveu-Schwarz superconformal set which carry quarkquantum numbers. In this case the superconformal symmetry is realized by anon-linear way. In the superconformal composite string new constraints for 1and 1/2 conformal dimension should be added to the standard system of Virasorosuperalgebra constraints for 2 and 3/2 conformal dimensions. The number $N$ ofthe constraints and numbers $D$ and $D'$ of bosonic and fermionic $2-d$ fieldsare connected by a simple relationship $D'/2+D-3N-15=0.$ Also perspectives ofthe critical composite superconformal string are discussed.
