The valley structure associated with quantum meta-stability is examined. Itis defined by the new valley equation, which enables consistent evaluation ofthe imaginary-time path-integral. We study the structure of this new valleyequation and solve these equations numerically. The valley is shown to containthe bounce solution, as well as other bubble structures. We find that even whenthe bubble solution has thick wall, the outer region of the valley is made oflarge-radius, thin-wall bubble, which interior is occupied by the true-vacuum.Smaller size bubbles, which contribute to decay at higher energies, are alsoidentified.
