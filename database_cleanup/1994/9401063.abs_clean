We derive general form of finite-dimensional approximations of path integralsfor both bosonic and fermionic canonical systems in terms of symbols ofoperators determined by operator ordering. We argue that for a system with agiven quantum Hamiltonian such approximations are independent of the type ofsymbols up to terms of $O(\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ is infinitesimal timeinterval determining the accuracy of the approximations. A new class of suchapproximations is found for both c-number and Grassmannian dynamical variables.The actions determined by the approximations are non-local and have noclassical continuum limit except the cases of $pq$- and $qp$-ordeeing. As anexplicit example the fermionic oscillator is considered in detail.
