A particular class of random walks with a spin factor on a three dimensionalcubic lattice is studied. This three dimensional random walk model is a simplegeneralization of random walk for the two dimensional Ising model. All criticaldiffusion constants and associated critical exponents are calculated. Continuumfield theories such as Klein-Gordon, Dirac and massive Chern-Simons theoriesare constructed near several critical points.
