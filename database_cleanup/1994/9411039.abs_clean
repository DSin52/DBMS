The quantum commutations $RTT=TTR$ and the orthogonal (symplectic) conditionsfor the inhomogeneous multiparametric $q$-groups of the $B_n,C_n,D_n$ type arefound in terms of the $R$-matrix of $B_{n+1},C_{n+1},D_{n+1}$. A consistentHopf structure on these inhomogeneous $q$-groups is constructed by means of aparticular we obtain the $q$-groups $ISO_{q,r}(n+1,n-1)$, including the quantumPoincar\'e group.
