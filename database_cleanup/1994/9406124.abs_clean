A nonlinear realization of super $W_{\infty}$ algebra is shown to existthrough a consistent superLax formulation of super KP hierarchy. The reductionof the superLax operator gives rise to the Lax operators for $N=2$ generalizedsuper KdV hierarchies, proposed by Inami and Kanno. The Lax equations are shownto be Hamiltonian and the associated Poisson bracket algebra among thesuperfields, consequently, gives rise to a realization of nonlinear super$W_{\infty}$ algebra.
