The renormalized fermionic determinant of QED in 3 + 1 dimensions,$\mbox{det}_{{ren}}$, in a static, unidirectional, inhomogeneous magnetic fieldwith finite flux can be calculated from the massive Euclidean Schwinger model'sdeterminant, $\mbox{det}_{{Sch}}$, in the same field by integrating$\mbox{det}_{{Sch}}$, over the fermion's mass. Since $\mbox{det}_{{ren}}$ forgeneral fields is central to QED, it is desirable to have nonperturbativeinformation on this determinant, even for the restricted magnetic fieldsconsidered here. To this end we continue our study of the physically relevantdeterminant $\mbox{det}_{{Sch}}$. It is shown that the contribution of themassless Schwinger model to $\mbox{det}_{{Sch}}$ is cancelled by a contributionfrom the massive sector of QED in 1 + 1 dimensions and that zero modes aresuppressed in $\mbox{det}_{{Sch}}$. We then calculate $\mbox{det}_{{Sch}}$analytically in the presence of a finite flux, cylindrical magnetic field. Itsbehaviour for large flux and small fermion mass suggests that the zero-energybound states of the two-dimensional Pauli Hamiltonian are the controllingfactor in the growth of $\ln \mbox{det}_{{Sch}}$. Evidence is presented that$\mbox{det}_{{Sch}}$ does not converge to the determinant of the masslessSchwinger model in the small mass limit for finite, nonzero flux magneticfields.
