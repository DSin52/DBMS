We describe flux tubes and their interactions in a low energy sigma modelinduced by $SU(\NF) \goto SO(\NF)$ flavor symmetry breaking in $SO(N_c)$ QCD.Gauge confinement manifests itself in the low energy theory through flux tubeinteractions with unscreened sources. The flux tubes which mediate confinementalso illustrate an interesting ambiguity in defining global Alice strings.
