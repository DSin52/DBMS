We revise the sequences of SUSY for a cyclic adiabatic evolution governed bythe supersymmetric quantum mechanical Hamiltonian. The condition(supersymmetric adiabatic evolution) under which the supersymmetric reductionsof Berry (nondegenerated case) or Wilczek-Zee (degenerated case) phases ofsuperpartners are taking place is pointed out. The analogue of Witten index(supersymmetric Berry index) is determined. As the examples of suggestedconcept of supersymmetric adiabatic evolution the Holomorphic quantum mechanicson complex plane and Meromorphic quantum mechanics on Riemann surface areconsidered. The supersymmetric Berry indexes for the models are calculated.
