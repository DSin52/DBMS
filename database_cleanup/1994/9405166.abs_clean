In the generalized Pauli-Villars regularization of chiral gauge theoryproposed by Frolov and Slavnov , it is important to specify how to sum thecontributions from an infinite number of regulator fields. It is shown that anexplicit sum of contributions from an infinite number of fields in anomaly-freegauge theory essentially results in a specific choice of regulator in the pastformulation of covariant anomalies. We show this correspondence byreformulating the generalized Pauli- Villars regularization as a regularizationof composite current operators. We thus naturally understand why the covariantfermion number anomaly in the Weinberg-Salam theory is reproduced in thegeneralized Pauli-Villars regularization. A salient feature of the covariantregularization,which is not implemented in the lagrangian level in general butworks for any chiral theory and gives rise to covariant anomalies , is that itspoils the Bose symmetry in anomalous theory. The covariant regularizationhowever preserves the Bose symmetry as well as gauge invariance in anomaly-freegauge theory.
