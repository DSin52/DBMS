Comments: (2 references added, small modifications)

In these lectures, I review some recent results on the Calogero-Sutherlandmodel and the Haldane Shastry-chain. The list of topics I cover are theThe form factor of the density operator. 2) The Dunkl operators and theirrelations with monodromy matrices, Yangians and affine-Hecke algebras. 3) TheHaldane-Shastry chain in connection with the Calogero-Sutherland Hamiltonian ata specific coupling constant.
