Title: The $n$--TH Reduced BKP Hierarchy, the String Equation and

$BW_{1+\infty}$--ConstraintsComments: 15 pages of (plain)tex, no figures

We study the BKP hierarchy and its $n$--reduction, for the case that $n$ isodd. This is related to the principal realization of the basic module of thetwisted affine Lie algebra $\hat{sl}_n^{(2)}$. We show that the following two$n$--reduced and satisfies the string equation, i.e. $L_{-1}\tau=0$, where$L_{-1}$ is an element of some `natural' Virasoro algebra. (2) $\tau$ satisfiesthe vacuum constraints of the $BW_{1+\infty}$ algebra. Here $BW_{1+\infty}$ isthe natural analog of the $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra, which plays a role in the KPcase.
