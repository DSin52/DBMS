We consider two level $k$ WZNW models coupled to each other through ageneralized Thirring-like current-current interaction. It is shown that in thelarge $k$ limit, this interacting system can be presented as a two-parameterperturbation around a nonunitary WZNW model. The perturbation operators are thesigma model kinetic terms with metric related to the Thirring couplingconstants. The renormalizability of the perturbed model leads to an algebraicequation for couplings. This equation coincides with the master Virasoroequation. We find that the beta functions of the two-parameter perturbationhave nontrivial zeros depending on the Thirring coupling constants. Thus weexhibit that solutions to the master equation provide nontrivial conformalpoints to the system of two interacting WZNW models.
