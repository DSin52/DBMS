In their recent letter, Chaichian et.~al. present a Lagrangian for a massive($m$) point particle on the plane, with which they claim to realize anyonstatistics. However, we find that there are some inaccuracies in theirformulation and, when these are taken care of, well-known results arereproduced, which already exist in the literature.
