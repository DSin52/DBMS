In the description of the extrinsic geometry of the string world sheetregarded as a conformal immersion of a 2-d surface in $R^3$, it was previouslyshown that, restricting to surfaces with $h\surd{g}\ =\ 1$, where $h$ is themean scalar curvature and $g$ is the determinant of the induced metric on thesurface, leads to Virasaro symmetry. An explicit form of the effective actionon such surfaces is constructed in this article which is the extrinsiccurvature analog of the WZNW action. This action turns out to be the gaugeinvariant combination of the actions encountered in 2-d intrinsic gravitytheory in light-cone gauge and the geometric action appearing in thequantization of the Virasaro group. This action, besides exhibiting Virasarosymmetry in $z$-sector, has $SL(2,C)$ conserved currents in the$\bar{z}$-sector. This allows us to quantize this theory in the$\bar{z}$-sector along the lines of the WZNW model. The quantum theory on$h\surd{g}\ =\ 1$ surfaces in $ R^3$ is shown to be in the same universalityclass as the intrinsic 2-d gravity theory.
