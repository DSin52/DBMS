Title: Topics in Quantum Dynamics

Comments: 31 pages, latex, 2 fig

The paper consists of two parts. In the first part Schroedinger's equationfor a charged quantum particle in a Galilei-Newton curved space-time is derivedin a fully geometrical way. Gravitational and electromagnetic fields are codedinto space metric and space-time connection. The fundamental geometrical objectis a quantum connection in a Hermitian line bundle over the 7-dimensional jetspace of 3-velocities. The secondary object is the bundle of Hilbert spacesover absolute time. Time appears as a superselection quantity while Shroedingerequation is interpreted as parallel transport in this bundle. In the secondpart the problem of measurement in quantum theory is discussed as a part of amore general problem of coupling between quantum and classical systems. Thestandard framework of quantum theory is extended so as to allow for dynamicalcentral observables within dissipative dynamics. It is shown that within thisapproach one obtains not only Liouville equation that describes statisticalensembles, but also a piecewise-deterministic random process describingsequences of "events" that can be monitored by a continuous observation of thesingle, coupled classical system. It also describes "quantum jumps" or "wavepacket reductions" that accompany these events. Two example are worked out insome details. The last one deals with the problem oof "how to determine thewave function ?".
