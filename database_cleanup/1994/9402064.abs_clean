We construct the nonlinear $N=2$ super-$W_3^{(2)}$ algebra with an arbitrarycentral charge at the classical level in the framework of Polyakov "soldering"algebra and $W_3^{(2)}$ and their closure gives the $N=2$ super-$W_3^{(2)}$algebra. Besides the currents of $N=2$ superconformal and $W_3^{(2)}$ algebras,it comprises two pairs of fermionic currents with spins 1 and 2. The hybridfield realization and contractions to the zero central charge are constructed.
