A scheme suitable for describing quantum nonultralocal models includingsupersymmetric ones is proposed. Braided algebras are generalised to be usedthrough Baxterisation for constructing braided quantum Yang--Baxter equations.Supersymmetric and some known nonultralocal models are derived in theframework of the present approach.
