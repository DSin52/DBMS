Title: Quantum and Floer cohomology have the same ring structure

Comments: 62 pages

The action of the total cohomology $H^*(M)$ of the almost Kahler manifold $M$on its Floer cohomology, int roduced originally by Floer, gives a new ringstructure on $H^*(M)$. We prove that the total cohomology space $H^* (M)$,provided with this new ring structure, is isomorphic to the quantum cohomologyring. As a special case, we prove the the formula for the Floer cohomology ringof the complex grassmanians conjectured by Vafa and Witten.
