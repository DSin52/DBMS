A completely integrable dynamical system in discrete time is studied by meansof algebraic geometry. The system is associated with factorization of a linearoperator acting in a direct sum of three linear spaces into a product of threeoperators, each acting nontrivially only in a direct sum of two spaces, and thefollowing reversing of the order of factors. There exists a reduction of thesystem interpreted as a classical field theory in $2+1$-dimensional space-time,the integrals of motion coinciding, in essence, with the statistical sum of aninhomogeneous 6-vertex free-fermion model on the 2-dimensional kagome lattice(here the statistical sum is a function of two parameters). Thus, a connectionwith the ``local'', or ``generalized'', quantum Yang---Baxter equation isrevealed.
