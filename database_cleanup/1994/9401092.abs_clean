We study the spectrum of the QCD Dirac operator near zero virtuality for $N_c=2$. According to a universality argument, it can be described by a randommatrix theory with the chiral structure of QCD, but with $real$ matrixelements. Using results derived by Mehta and Mahoux and Nagao and Wadati, weare able to obtain an analytical result for the microscopic spectral densitythat in turn is the generating function for Leutwyler-Smilga type spectral sumrules.
