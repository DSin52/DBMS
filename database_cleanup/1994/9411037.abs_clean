Title: A Simple Confinement Mechanism for Light-Front Quantum Chromodynamics

Comments: 15 pages, latex, no figures. To appear in Proceedings of the workshop

`Theory of Hadrons and Light-Front QCD,' Poland, August 1994Light-front field theory offers a scenario in which a constituent picture ofhadrons may arise, but only if cutoffs that violate explicit covariance andgauge invariance are used. The perturbative renormalization group can be usedto approximate the cutoff QCD hamiltonian, and even at lowest orders theresultant hamiltonian displays interesting phenomenological features. A generalscheme for computing and using these hamiltonians is discussed and it isexplicitly shown that a confining interaction appears when the hamiltonian iscomputed to second order.
