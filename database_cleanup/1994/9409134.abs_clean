present violations of various symmetries, such as C, P, and T, are assumed toarise from interactions. It is argued that the violation is more fundamentalthan that and is to be found at basic level of the representations of theLorentz group. Revtex 3.0 (20 pages)Journal-ref: Int.J.Mod.Phys.

Continuing our recent argument where we constructed a FNBWW-type spin-$1$boson having opposite relative intrinsic parity to that of the associatedantiparticle, we now study eigenstates of the Charge Conjugation operator.Based on the observation that if $\phi_{_{L}}(p^\mu)$ transforms as a $(0,\,j)$spinor under Lorentz boosts, then $\Theta_{[j]}\,\phi_{_{L}}^\ast(p^\mu)$transforms as a $(j,\,0)$ spinor (with a similar relationship existing between$\phi_{_{R}}(p^\mu)$ and $\Theta_{[j]}\,\phi_{_{R}}^\ast(p^\mu)$; where $\Theta_{[j]}\,{\bf J}\,\Theta_{[j]}^{-1}\,=\,-\,{\bf J}^\ast $ with$\Theta_{[j]}$ the well known Wigner matrix involved in the operation of timereversal) we introduce McLennan-Case type $(j,\,0)\oplus(0,\,j)$ spinors.Relative phases between $\phi_{_{R}}(p^\mu)$ and$\Theta_{[j]}\,\phi_{_{R}}^\ast(p^\mu)$, and$\Theta_{[j]}\,\phi_{_{L}}^\ast(p^\mu)$ and $\phi_{_{L}}(p^\mu)$, turn out tohave physical significance and are fixed by appropriate requirements. Explicitconstruction, and a series of physically relevant properties, for these spinorsare obtained for spin-$1/2$ and spin-$1$ culminating in the construction of anew wave equation and introduction of Dirac-like and Majorana-like quantumfields.
