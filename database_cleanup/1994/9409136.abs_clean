For an ordinary (co-)quasitriangularHopf algebra (H,R) a braided monoidal category of H-(co-)modules with braidinginduced by the R-matrix is considered. It can be shown for a specific class ofQ-supersymmetries in this category that every braided Q-super-Hopf algebra Badmits an ordinary Q-super-Hopf algebra structure on the cross product BxH suchthat H is a sub-Hopf algebra and B is a subalgebra in BxH. Applying thisQ-bosonization to the quantum Koszul complex (K(q,g),d) of the quantumenveloping algebra Uq(g) for Lie algebras g associated with the root systems A,B, C and D one obtains a classical super-Hopf algebra structure on (K(q,g),d)where the structure maps are morphisms of modules with differentiation.
