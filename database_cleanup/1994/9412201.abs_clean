Workshop on Thermal Field Theories, August 1993, Banff, Canada.)Analytic continuation of quantum statistical physics from imaginary to realtime is analyzed. Adiabatic vanishing of interactions at real time infinitiesgives origin to singularities at complex times. This undermines the hypothesisof decoupling of interactions at $t \rightarrow \infty$. Hence an interactingthermal vacuum is a necessary component of the exact real-time formalism.Consequences for Thermo-field dynamics are discussed.
