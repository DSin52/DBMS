In bosonic end perturbative calculations for quantum mechanical anyon systemsa regularization and renormalization procedure, analogous to those used infield theory, is necessary. I examine the reliability and the physicalinterpretation of the most commonly used bosonic end regularization procedures.I then use the regularization procedure with the most transparent physicalinterpretation to derive some bosonic end perturbation theory results on anyonspectra, including a 3-anyon ground state energy.
