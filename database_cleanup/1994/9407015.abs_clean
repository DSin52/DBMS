We study the dynamics of the boundary dilaton gravity coupled to N masslesscalars. We rederive the boundary conditions of [1] and [3] in a way whichmakes the requirement of reparametrization invariance and role of conformalanomaly explicit. We then study the semiclassical behaviour of the boundary inthe N = 24 theory in the presence of an incoming matter wave with a constantenergy flux spreaded over a finite interval. There is a critical value of thematter energy density below which the boundary is stable and all the matter isreflected back. For energy densities greater than this critical value there isa similar behaviour for small values of total energy thrown in. However, whenthe total energy exceeds another critical value, the boundary exibits a runawaybehaviour and the spacetime devolopes singularities and horizons.
