Title: Coadditive differential complexes on quantum groups and quantum spaces

Comments: 9 pages

Journal-ref: J.Phys. A27 (1994) 4497-4504

A regular way to define an additive coproduct (or ``coaddition'') on theq-deformed differential complexes is proposed for quantum groups and quantumspaces related to the Hecke-type R-matrices. Several examples of braidedcoadditive differential bialgebras (Hopf algebras) are presented.
