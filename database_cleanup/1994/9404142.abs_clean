Title: A three parameter invariant of oriented links

Comments: 6 pages

This paper defines a new sequence of finite dimensional algebras as quotientsof the group algebras of the braid groups. This sequence depends on threehomogeneous parameters and has a one-parameter family of Markov traces, and sogives a three parameter invariant of oriented links.
