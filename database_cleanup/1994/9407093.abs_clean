Title: Berezin quantization and unitary representations of Lie groups

Comments: 28 pages

In 1974, Berezin proposed a quantum theory for dynamical systems having aK\"{a}hler manifold as their phase space. The system states were represented byholomorphic functions on the manifold. For any homogeneous K\"{a}hler manifold,the Lie algebra of its group of motions may be represented either byholomorphic differential operators (``quantum theory"), or by functions on themanifold with Poisson brackets, generated by the K\"{a}hler structure(``classical theory"). The K\"{a}hler potentials and the corresponding Liealgebras are constructed now explicitly for all unitary representations of anycompact simple Lie group. The quantum dynamics can be represented in terms of aphase-space path integral, and the action principle appears in thesemi-classical approximation.
