Title: The Strong Perturbation Approach for the Dirac Equation in a Gauge Field

Authors: Marco Frasca

Comments: 4 pages, LaTeX

We discuss a possible approach to the problem of a gauge theory with a strongcoupling constant. It is seen that, instead of plane waves, we have to considerthe adiabatic eigenstates of the perturbation in order to get a meaningfulperturbation approach.
