The Thirring model, that is, a relativistic field theory of fermions with acontact interaction between vector currents, is studied for dimensionalities2<d<4 using the 1/N_f expansion, where N_f is the number of fermion species.The model is found to have no ultraviolet divergences at leading order provideda regularization respecting current conservation is used. Explicit O(1/N_f)corrections are computed, and the model shown to be renormalizable at thisorder in the massless limit; renormalizability appears to hold to all ordersdue to a special case of Weinberg's theorem. This implies there is a universalamplitude for four particle scattering in the asymptotic regime. Comparisonsare made with both the Gross-Neveu model and QED.
