We consider the relation between affine Toda field theories (ATFT) andLandau-Ginzburg Lagrangians as alternative descriptions of deformed 2d CFT.First, we show that the two concrete implementations of the deformation areconsistent once quantum corrections to the Landau-Ginzburg Lagrangian are takeninto account. Second, inspired by Gepner's fusion potentials, we explore thepossibility of a direct connection between both types of Lagrangians; namely,whether they can be transformed one into another by a change of variables. Thisdirect connection exists in the one-variable case, namely, for the sine-Gordonmodel, but cannot be established in general. Nevertheless, we show that bothpotentials exhibit the same structure of extrema.
