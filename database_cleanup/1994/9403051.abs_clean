The interaction of various algebraic structures describing fusion, braidingand group symmetries in quantum projective field theory is an object of aninvestigation in the paper. Structures of projective Zamolodchikov al- gebras,their represntations, spherical correlation functions, correlation charactersand envelopping QPFT-operator algebras, projective \"W-algebras, shiftalgebras, braiding admissible QPFT-operator algebras and projectiveG-hypermultiplets are explored. It is proved (in the formalism of shiftalgebras) that sl(2,C)-primary fields are characterized by their projectiveweights and by the hidden additive weight, a hidden quantum number discoveredin the paper (some discussions on this fact and its possible relation to ahidden 4-dimensional QFT maybe found in the note by S.Bychkov, S.Plotnikov andD.Juriev, Uspekhi Matem. Nauk 47(3) (1992)[in Russian]). The special attentionis paid to various constructions of projective G-hyper- multiplets(QPFT-operator algebras with G-symmetries).
