A mechanism of supersymmetry breaking in two or four-dimensions is given, inwhich the breaking is related to the Fermat's last theorem. It is shown thatsupersymmetry is exact at some irrational number points in parameter space,while it is broken at all rational number points except for the origin.Accordingly, supersymmetry is exact {\it almost everywhere}, as well as broken{\it almost everywhere} on the real axis in the parameter space at the sametime. This is the first explicit mechanism of supersymmetry breaking with anarbitrarily small change of parameters around any exact supersymmetric model,which is possibly useful for realistically small non-perturbative supersymmetrybreakings in superstring model building. As a byproduct, we also give aconvenient superpotential for supersymmetry breaking only for irrational numberparameters. Our superpotential can be added as a ``hidden'' sector to otheruseful supersymmetric models.
