Based on the chiral symmetry breaking pattern and the correspondinglow-energy effective lagrangian, we determine the fermion mass dependence ofthe partition function and derive sum rules for eigenvalues of the QCD Diracoperator in finite Euclidean volume. Results are given for $N_c = 2$ and forYang-Mills theory coupled to several light adjoint Majorana fermions. Theycoincide with those derived earlier in the framework of random matrix theory.
