Title: Asymptotics of Solutions of the Discrete String Equation

Comments: 24 pp., Latex

The main subject of the paper is the so-called Discrete Painlev\'e-1 Equation(DP1). Solutions of DP1 are classified under criterion of their behavior whileargument tends to infinity. The Isomonodromic Deformations Method yieldsasymptotic formulae for regular solutions of DP1. DP1 is an integrable system,what allows to develop appropriate Whitham theory. Asymptotics of singularsolutions of DP1 are calculated by using the Whitham method.
