We show that the supersymmetric nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation can bewritten as a constrained super KP flow in a nonstandard representation of theLax equation. We construct the conserved charges and show that this systemreduces to the super mKdV equation with appropriate identifications. Weconstruct various flows generated by the general nonstandard super Lax equationand show that they contain both the KP and mKP flows in the bosonic limits.This nonstandard supersymmetric KP hierarchy allows us to construct a new superKP equation which is nonlocal.
