The electron-positron `box' diagram produces an effective action which isfourth order in the electromagnetic field. We examine the behaviour of thiseffective action at high-temperature (in analytically continued imaginary-timethermal perturbation theory). We argue that there is a finite, nonzero limit as$T\rightarrow \infty$ (where $T$ is the temperature). We calculate this limitin the nonrelativistic static case, and in the long-wavelength limit. We alsobriefly discuss the self-energy in 2-dimensional QED, which is similar in somerespects.
