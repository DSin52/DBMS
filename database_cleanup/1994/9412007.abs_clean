Complex vector fields with Maxwell, Chern-Simons and Proca terms areminimally coupled to an Abelian gauge field. The consistency of the spectrum isanalysed and 1-loop quantum corrections to the self-energy are explicitlycomputed and discussed. The incorporation of 2-loop contributions and thebehaviour of tree-level scattering amplitudes in the limit of highcenter-of-mass energies are also commented.
