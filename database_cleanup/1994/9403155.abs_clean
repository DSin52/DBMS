A general study of non-abelian duality is presented. We first identify apossible obstruction to the conformal invariance of the dual theory fornon-semisimple groups. We construct the exact non-abelian dual for anyWess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model for any anomaly free subgroup, and thecorresponding extension for coset conformal field theories. We characterize theexact non-abelian dual for $\sigma$-models with chiral isometries and extendthe standard notion of duality to anomalous subgroups ofWZW models, thus giving a way of constructing dual transformations fordifferent groups on the left and on the right. We also present some newexamples of non-abelian duality for four-dimensional gravitational instantons.
