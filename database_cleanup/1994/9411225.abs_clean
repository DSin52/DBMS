We show explicitly that there is particle creation in a static spacetime.This is done by studying the field in a coordinate system based on a physicalprinciple which has recently been proposed. There the field is quantized bydecomposing it into positive and negative frequency modes on a particularspacelike surface. This decomposition depends explicitly on the surface wherethe decomposition is performed, so that an observer who travels from onesurface to another will observe particle production due to the different vacuumstate.
