In 4-D heterotic superstrings, the dilaton and antisymmetric tensor fieldsbelong to a linear N=1 supersymmetric multiplet L. We study the lagrangiandescribing the coupling of one linear multiplet to chiral and gauge multipletsin global and local supersymmetry, with particular emphasis on stringtree-level and loop-corrected effective actions. This theory is dual to anequivalent one with chiral multiplets only. But the formulation with a linearmultiplet appears to have decisive advantages beyond string tree-level since,in particular, <L> is the string loop-counting parameter and the dualitytransformation is in general not exactly solvable beyond tree-level. Thisformulation allows us to easily deduce some powerful non-renormalizationtheorems in the effective theory and to obtain explicitly some loop correctionsto the string effective supergravity for simple compactifications. Finally, wediscuss the issue of supersymmetry breaking by gaugino condensation using thisformalism.
