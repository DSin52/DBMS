Existence of SL(2,Z) duality in toroidally compactified heterotic stringtheory (or in the N=4 supersymmetric gauge theories), that includes the strongweak coupling duality transformation, implies the existence of certainsupersymmetric bound states of monopoles and dyons. We show that the existenceof these bound states, in turn, requires the existence of certain normalizable,(anti-)self-dual, harmonic forms on the moduli space of BPS multi-monopoleconfigurations, with specific symmetry properties. We give an explicitconstruction of this harmonic form on the two monopole moduli space, therebyproving the existence of all the required bound states in the two monopolesector.
