We study the thermal ensemble of a gas of free strings in presence of amagnetic field. We find that the thermodynamical partition function divergeswhen the magnetic field exceeds some critical value $B_{\rm cr}$, which dependson the temperature. We argue that there is a first-order phase transition witha large latent heat. At the critical value an infinite number of states -allstates in a Regge trajectory- seem to become massless, which may be anindication of recuperation of spontaneously broken symmetries.
