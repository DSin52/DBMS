Title: Low--Energy Properties of (0,2) Compactifications

Authors: P. Mayr and S. Stieberger

Comments: 7 pages, Invited talk at the 28th International Symposium on the

Theory of Elementary Particles in Wendisch--Rietz, Aug 30--Sept 3, 1994We investigate the low--energy properties of a Z_12 orbifold with continuousWilson line moduli. They give rise to a (0,2) superstring compactification.Their Kaehler potentials and Yukawa couplings are calculated. We study thediscrete symmetries of the model and their implications on the thresholdcorrections to the gauge couplings as well as for string unification.
