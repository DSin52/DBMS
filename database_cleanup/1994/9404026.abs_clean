We define a discretized Langevin equation in Stratonovich-{\it type}calculus. We show that a generating functional with a field-dependent kernelcan be written in mid-point prescription only when we calculate in thecalculus. Moreover we investigate whether supersymmetry of the stochasticaction with field-dependent kernel exists or not.
