The $SU_{q}(n)$ generators are obtained as large spectral parameter limit ofthe Yang-Baxter operators in the integrable $SU_{q}(n)$ invariant vertex model.The commutation relations, including Serre relations, are obtained as limits ofthe Yang-Baxter equations. The recently found eigenvectors of the $SU_{q}(n)$invariant spin chains are shown to be Highest Weight vectors of thecorresponding quantum group.
