Orbifold techniques are used to study bosonic, type II and heterotic stringsin Rindler space at integer multiples N of the Rindler temperature, and near ablack hole horizon at integer multiples of the Hawking temperature, extendingearlier results of Dabholkar. It is argued that a Hagedorn transition occursnears the horizon for all N>1.
