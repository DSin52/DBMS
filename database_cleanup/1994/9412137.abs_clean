Dynamical Systems Conference, Cambridge, 15-18 June 1994The relationship between the Dirac and reduced phase space quantizations isinvestigated for spin models belonging to the class of Hamiltonian systemshaving no gauge conditions. It is traced out that the two quantization methodsmay give similar, or essentially different physical results, and, moreover, itis shown that there is a class of constrained systems, which can be quantizedonly by the Dirac method. A possible interpretation of the gauge degrees offreedom is given.
