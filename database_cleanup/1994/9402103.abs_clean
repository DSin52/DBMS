We present the extension of the Lagrangian $loop$ representation in such away to introduce matter fields. The partition function of lattice compact U(1)Gauge-Higgs model is expressed as a sum over closed as much as open surfaces.These surfaces correspond to world sheets of loop-like pure electric fluxexcitations and open electric flux tubes carrying matter fields at their ends.There is a duality transformation between this description in terms of loopworld sheets and the $topological$ representation in terms of world sheets ofNielsen-Olesen strings both closed and open joining pairs of monopoles.
