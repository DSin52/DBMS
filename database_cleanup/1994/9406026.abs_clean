It is argued on general ground and demonstrated in the particular example ofthe Chiral Schwinger Model that there is nothing wrong with apparentlyanomalous chiral gauge theory. If quantised correctly, there should be no gaugeanomaly and chiral gauge theory should be renormalisable and unitary, even inhigher dimensions and with non-abelian gauge groups. Furthermore, mass termsfor gauge bosons and chiral fermions can be generated without spoiling thegauge invariance.
