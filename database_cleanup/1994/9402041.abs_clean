Title: On the Duistermaat-Heckman Integration Formula And Integrable Models

Comments: 18 pages. Talk presented by A. Niemi at XXVIIth International

Symposium on the Theory of Elementary Particles Wendisch-Rietz (Germany)September 7-11, 1993Integrable SystemsIn this article we review the Duistermaat-Heckman integration formula and theensuing equivariant cohomology structure, in the finite dimensional case. Inparticular, we discuss the connection between equivariant cohomology andclassical integrability. We also explain how the integration formula isderived, and explore some possible new directions that could eventually yieldnovel integration formulas for nontrivial integrable models.
