We analyse a new class of statistical systems, which simulate differentsystems of random surfaces on a lattice. Geometrical hierarchy of the energyfunctionals on which these theories are based produces corresponding hierarchyof the surface dynamics and of the phase transitions. We specially consider 3Dgonihedric system and have found that it is equivalent to the propagation ofalmost free 2D Ising fermions. We construct dual statistical system with newmatchbox spin variable $G_{\xi}$, high temperature expansion of which equallywell describe these surfaces.
