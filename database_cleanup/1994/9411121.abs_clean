Some physical aspects of $q$-deformed spacetimes are discussed. It is pointedout that, under certain standard assumptions relating deformation andquantization, the classical limit (Poisson bracket description) of the dynamicsis bound to contain unusual features. At the same time, it is argued that theformulation of an associated $q$-deformed field theory is fraught with seriousdifficulties.
