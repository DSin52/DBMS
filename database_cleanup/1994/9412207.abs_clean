Title: Elliptic quantum groups

Authors: Giovanni Felder

Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX

This note for the Proceedings of the International Congress of MathematicalPhysics gives an account of a construction of an ``elliptic quantum group''associated with each simple classical Lie algebra. It is closely related toelliptic face models of statistical mechanics, and, in its semiclassical limit,to the Wess-Zumino-Witten model of conformal field theory on tori.
