We study the $N = 2$ coset models in their formulation as supersymmetricgauged Wess-Zumino-Witten models. A model based on the coset $G/H$ is invariantunder a symmetry group isomorphic to $\Z_{k+Q}$, where $k$ is the level of themodel and $Q$ is the dual Coxeter number of $G$. Using a duality-likerelationship, we show that the $\Z_m$ orbifold of the vectorially gauged modeland the $\Z_{\tilde{m}}$ orbifold of the axially gauged model are each othersmirror partners when $m \tilde{m} = k + Q$.
