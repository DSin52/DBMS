added, edited based on reviewers suggestionsFranson showed that Aspect's experiment to test Bell's inequality did notrule out local realistic theories with delayed determinism. A class of local,deterministic discrete mathematical models with delayed determinism isdescribed that may be consistent with existing experiments. These are nothidden variables theories in the sense that they are not theories of particlesplus hidden variables. They are theories of `hidden' distributed informationstored holographic like throughout a space time region. This information cannotbe uniquely associated with individual particles although it determines theresults observed in particle interactions. The classical parameters of aninteraction are determined as {\it focal points} of continuous nonlinearchanges in the wave function and not as discrete events. In addition to notviolating Bell's inequality this class of theories can in principle bedistinguished from standard quantum mechanics by other experiments. Thesedifferences and the experimental constraints on a test of Bell's inequality todiscriminate between the existing theory and this class of models arediscussed.
