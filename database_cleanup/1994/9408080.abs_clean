International Colloquium on ``Group Theoretical Methods in Physics", Osaka,July 3-9, 1994}We show that the dynamical symmetry of the hydrogen atom leads in a naturalway to an infinite-dimensional algebra, which we identify as the positivesubalgebras of twisted Kac-Moody algebras of $ so(4)$. We also generalize ourresults to the $N$-dimensional hydrogen atom. For odd $N$, we identify thedynamical algebra with the positive part of the twisted algebras $\hat{so}(N+1)^\tau$. However, for even $N$ this algebra corresponds to a parabolicsubalgebra of the untwisted loop algebra $\hat{so}(N+1)$.
