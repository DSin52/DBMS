We analyse with the algebraic, regularisation independent, cohomologicalB.R.S. methods, the renormalisability of torsionless N=2 supersymmetricnon-linear sigma models built on Kahler spaces. Surprisingly enough withrespect to the common wisdom, we obtain an anomaly candidate, at least in thecompact Ricci-flat case. In the compact homogeneous Kahler case, as expected,the anomaly candidate disappears.
