We show that the conformal characters of various rational models ofW-algebras can be already uniquely determined if one merely knows the centralcharge and the conformal dimensions. As a side result we develop several toolsfor studying representations of SL(2,Z) on spaces of modular functions. Thesemethods, applied here only to certain rational conformal field theories, may beuseful for the analysis of many others.
