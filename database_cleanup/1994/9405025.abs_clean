We construct free field representations of the $SW$-algebras SW(3/2,2) andSW(3/2,3/2,2) by using the corresponding Toda-Field-Theories. In constructingthe series of minimal models using covariant vertex operators, we find anecessary restriction on the Cartan matrix of the Super-Lie-Algebra, also forthe general case. Within this framework, this restriction claims that there bea minimum of one non-vanishing element on the diagonal of the Cartan matrix,which is without parallel in bosonic conformal field theory. As a consequenceonly two series of SSLA's yield minimal models, namely Osp(2n|2n-1) andOsp(2n|2n+1). Subsequently some general aspects of degenerate representationsof SW-algebras, notably the fusion rules, are investigated. As an applicationwe discuss minimal models of SW(3/2,2), which were constructed with independentmethods, in this framework. Covariant formulation is used throughout thispaper.
