All the hermitian representations of the ``symmetric" $q$-oscillator areobtained by means of expansions. The same technique is applied to characterizein a systematic way the $k$-order boson realizations of the $q$-oscillator and$su(1,1)_q$. The special role played by the quadratic realizations of$su(1,1)_q$ in terms of boson and $q$-boson operators is analysed andclarified.
