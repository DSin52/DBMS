Progress along the line of a previous article are reported. One main point isto include chiral operators with fractional quantum group spins (fourth orsixth of integers) which are needed to achieve modular invariance. We extendthe study of the chiral bootstrap (recently completed by E. Cremmer, and thepresent authors) to the case of semi-infinite quantum-group representationswhich correspond to positive integral screening numbers. In particular, weprove the Bidenharn-Elliot and Racah identities for q-deformed 6-j symbolsgeneralized to continuous spins. The decoupling of the family of physicalchiral operators (with real conformal weights) at the special valuesC_{Liouville}= =7, 13, and 19, is shown to provide a full solution of Moore andSeiberg's equations, only involving operators with real conformal weights.Moreover, our study confirms the existence of the strongly coupled topologicalmodels. The three-point functions are shown to be given by a product of legfactors similar to the ones of the weakly coupled models. However, contrary tothis latter case, the equality between the quantum group spins of theholomorphic and antiholomorphic components is not preserved by the local vertexoperator. Thus the ``c=1'' barrier appears as connected with a deconfinement ofchirality.
