The actions for all classical (and consequently quantum) $BF$ theories on$n$-manifolds is proven to be given by anti-commutators of hermitian,nilpotent, scalar fermionic charges with Grassmann-odd functionals. In order toshow this, the space of fields in the theory must be enlarged to include ``massterms'' for new, non-dynamical, Grassmann-odd fields. The implications of thisresult on observables are examined.
