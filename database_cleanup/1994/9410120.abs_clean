A model of random triangulations of a domain in $R^{(4)}$ is presented. Theglobal symmetries of the model include SL(4) transformations and translations.If a stable microscopic scale exists for some range of parameters, the modelshould be in a translation invariant phase where SL(4) is spontaneously brokento O(4). In that phase, SL(4) Ward identities imply that the correlation lengthin the spin two channel of a symmetric tensor field is infinite. Consequently,it may be possible to identify the continuum limit of four dimensional QuantumGravity with points inside that phase.
