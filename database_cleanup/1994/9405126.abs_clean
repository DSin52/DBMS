In this article we analyze a two dimensional lattice gauge theory based on aquantum group.The algebra generated by gauge fields is the lattice algebraintroduced recently by A.Yu.Alekseev,H.Grosse and V.Schomerus we define andstudy wilson loops and compute explicitely the partition function on anyRiemann surface. This theory appears to be related to Chern-Simons Theory.
