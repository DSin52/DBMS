Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B350 (1995) 28-32

It is proven that up to possible surface terms, the only non-vanishingmomentum-dependent amplitudes for the self-dual N=2 string in $R^{2,2}$ are thetree-level two and three-point functions, and the only non-vanishingmomentum-independent amplitudes are the one-loop partition function and thetree-level two and four-point functions. The calculations are performed usingthe topological prescription developed in an earlier paper with Vafa. As insupersymmetric non-renormalization theorems, the vanishing proof is based on arelationship between the zero-momentum dilaton and axion.
