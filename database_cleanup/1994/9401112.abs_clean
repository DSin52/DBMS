We study the quantum matrix algebra $R_{21}x_1x_2=x_2x_1 R$ and for thestandard $2\times 2$ case propose it for the co-ordinates of $q$-deformedEuclidean space. The algebra in this simplest case is isomorphic to the usualquantum matrices $M_q(2)$ but in a form which is naturally covariant under theEuclidean rotations $SU_q(2)\otimes SU_q(2)$. We also introduce a quantum Wickrotation that twists this system precisely into the approach to $q$-Minkowskispace based on braided-matrices and their associated spinorial $q$-Lorentzgroup.
