Black hole evaporation is investigated in a (1+1)-dimensional model ofquantum gravity. Quantum corrections to the black hole entropy are computed,and the fine-grained entropy of the Hawking radiation is studied. A generalizedsecond law of thermodynamics is formulated, and shown to be valid undersuitable conditions. It is also shown that, in this model, a black hole canconsume an arbitrarily large amount of information.
