The four-point function arising in the scattering of closed bosonic stringsin their tachyonic ground state is evaluated on a surface of infinite genus.The amplitude has poles corresponding to physical intermediate states anddivergences at the boundary of moduli space, but no new types of divergencesresult from the infinite number of handles. The implications for the universalmoduli space approach are briefly discussed.
