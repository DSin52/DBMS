Title: Extended phase space for a spinning particle

Authors: S. Zakrzewski

Comments: 12 pages, latex

Extended phase space of an elementary (relativistic) system is introduced inthe spirit of the Souriau's definition of the `space of motions' for suchsystem. Our formulation is generally applicable to any homogeneous space-time(e.g. de Sitter) and also to Poisson actions. Calculations concerning theshould either accept two-dimensional trajectories or (Poisson) noncommutingspace-time coordinates.
