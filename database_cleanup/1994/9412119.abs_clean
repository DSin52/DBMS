We solve, by separation of variables, the problem of three anyons with aharmonic oscillator potential. The anyonic symmetry conditions from cyclicpermutations are separable in our coordinates. The conditions from two-particletranspositions are not separable, but can be expressed as reflection symmetryconditions on the wave function and its normal derivative on the boundary of acircle. Thus the problem becomes one-dimensional. We solve this problemnumerically by discretization. $N$-point discretization with very small $N$ isoften a good first approximation, on the other hand convergence as $N\to\infty$is sometimes very slow.
