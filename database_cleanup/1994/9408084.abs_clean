We consider a superradiance effect around rotating dilatonic black holes. We$\alpha=\sqrt{3}$, which effective action is reduced from the 5-dimensionalKaluza-Klein theory, and the other is a slowly rotating dilatonic black holeswith arbitrary coupling constant. We find that there exists a critical value($\alpha \sim 1$), which is predicted from a superstring model, and thesuperradiant emission rate with coupling larger than the critical value becomesmuch higher than the Kerr-Newman case ($\alpha=0$) in the maximally chargedlimit. Consequently, 4-dimensional primordial black holes in higher dimensionalunified theories are either rotating but almost neutral or charged buteffectively non-rotating.
