Title: The Mandelstam--Leibbrandt Prescription and the Discretized Light Front

QuantizationAuthors: Roberto Soldati

Comments: 5 pages, LaTeX, Talk given at the Fourth International Workshop on

Light Cone Quantization and Non--Perturbative Dynamics, Polana ZgorzeliskoIt is shown that the quantization of the unphysical degrees of freedom, whichleads to the Mandelstam--Leibbrandt prescription for the infrared spurioussingularities in the continuum light cone gauge, does indeed suggest some quitenatural recipe to treat the zero modes in the Discretized Light FrontQuantization of gauge theories.
