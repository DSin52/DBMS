We consider bosonized $QCD_2$, and prove that after rewritting the theory interms of gauge invariant fields, there exists an integrability condition validfor the quantum theory as well. Furthermore, performing a duality typetransformation we obtain an appropriate action for the description of thestrong coupling limit, which is still integrable. We also prove that the modeldisplays a complicated set of constraints, restricting the dynamics of part ofthe theory, but which are necessary to maintain the positive metric Hilbertspace.
