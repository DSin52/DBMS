We discuss the issue of going off-shell in the proper time formalism. This isdone by keeping a finite world sheet cutoff. We construct one example of anoff-shell covariant Klein Gordon type interaction. For a suitable choice of thegauge transformation of the scalar field, gauge invariance is maintained offmass shell. However at second order in the gauge field interaction, one findsthat (U(1)) gauge invariance is violated due to the finite cutoff.Interestingly, we find, to lowest order, that by adding a massive mode withappropriate gauge transformation laws to the sigma model background, one canrestore gauge invariance. The gauge transformation law is found to beconsistent, to the order calculated, with what one expects from the interactingequation of motion of the massive field. We also extend some previousdiscussion on applying the proper time formalism for propagating gaugeparticles, to the interacting (i.e. Yang Mills) case.
