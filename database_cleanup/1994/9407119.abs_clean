Coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro and Kac-Moody algebras provide geometricactions for matter coupled to gravity and gauge fields in two dimensions.However, the Gauss' law constraints that arise from these actions are notnecessarily endemic to two-dimensional topologies. Indeed the constraintsassociated with Yang-Mills naturally arise from the coadjoint orbitconstruction of the WZW model. One may in fact use a Yang-Mills theory toprovide dynamics to the otherwise fixed coadjoint vectors that define theorbits. In this letter we would like to exhibit an analogue of the Yang-Millsclassical action for the diffeomorphism sector. With this analogue one maypostulate a 4D theory of gravitation that is related to an underlying twodimensional theory. Instead of quadratic differentials, a (1,3) pseudo tensorbecomes the dynamical variable. We briefly discuss how this tensor may beclassically coupled to matter.
