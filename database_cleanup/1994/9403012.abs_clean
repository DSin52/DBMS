Recently the quantum hamiltonian reduction was done in the case of general$s\ell(2)$ embeddings into Lie algebras and superalgebras. In this paper weextend the results to the quantum hamiltonian reduction of $N=1$ affine Liesuperalgebras in the superspace formalism. We show that if we choose a gaugefor the supersymmetry, and consider only certain equivalence classes of fields,then our quantum hamiltonian reduction reduces to quantum hamiltonian reductionof non-supersymmetric Lie superalgebras. We construct explicitly the superenergy-momentum tensor, as well as all generators of spin 1 (and $\hf$); thuswe construct explicitly all generators in the superconformal,quasi-superconformal and $\Z_2 \times \Z_2$ superconformal algebras.
