Euclidean invariant Klein-Gordon, Dirac and massive Chern-Simons fieldtheories are constructed in terms of a random walk with a spin factor on athree dimensional lattice. We exactly calculate the free energy and thecorrelation functions which allow us to obtain the critical diffusion constantand associated critical exponents. It is pointed out that these criticalexponents do not satisfy the hyper-scaling relation but the scalinginequalities. We take the continuum limit of this theory on the basis of theseanalyses. We check the universality of obtained results on other latticestructure such as triclinic lattice and body centered lattice.
