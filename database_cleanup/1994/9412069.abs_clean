tiling was incorrect in the first version of the paper (p. 14)A differential calculus on an associative algebra A is an algebraic analogueof the calculus of differential forms on a smooth manifold. It supplies A witha structure on which dynamics and field theory can be formulated to some extentin very much the same way we are used to from the geometrical arena underlyingclassical physical theories and models. In previous work, certain differentialcalculi on a commutative algebra exhibited relations with lattice structures,stochastics, and parametrized quantum theories. This motivated the presentsystematic investigation of differential calculi on commutative and associativealgebras. Various results about their structure are obtained. In particular, itis shown that there is a correspondence between first order differentialcalculi on such an algebra and commutative and associative products in thespace of 1-forms. An example of such a product is provided by the Ito calculusof stochastic differentials.For the case where the algebra A is freely generated by `coordinates' x^i,i=1,...,n, we study calculi for which the differentials dx^i constitute a basisof the space of 1-forms (as a left A-module). These may be regarded as`deformations' of the ordinary differential calculus on R^n. For n < 4 aclassification of all (orbits under the general linear group of) such calculiwith `constant structure functions' is presented. We analyse whether thesecalculi are reducible (i.e., a skew tensor product of lower-dimensionalcalculi) or whether they are the extension (as defined in this article) of aone dimension lower calculus. Furthermore, generalizations to arbitrary n areobtained for all these calculi.
