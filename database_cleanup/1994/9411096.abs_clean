1169-1176In this paper we investigate the problem of spontaneous supersymmetrybreaking without a cosmological term in $N=3$ supergravity with matter vectormultiplets, scalar fields geometry being $SU(3,m)/SU(3)\otimes SU(m)\otimesU(1)$. At first, we consider the case of minimal coupling with differentpossible gaugings (compact as well as non-compact). Then we show that thereexist dual version of such a theory (with the same scalar field geometry),which turns out to be the generalization of the $N=3$ hidden sector,constructed some time ago by one of us, to the case of arbitrary number ofvector multiplets. We demonstrate that spontaneous supersymmetry breaking isstill possible in the presence of matter multiplets.
