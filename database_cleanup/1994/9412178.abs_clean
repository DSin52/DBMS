Title: Vacuum polarization around a straight wire carrying a steady current

Authors: B. Linet

Comments: 11 pages, latex, no figures

Motivated by the example of the superconducting cosmic string which can be aphysical representation of a straight wire carrying a steady current, we derivein this case the explicit expressions of the induced vector potential, currentdensity and magnetic field due to the vacuum polarization at the first order inthe fine structure constant.
