A four-dimensional dilaton-gravity action whose spherical reduction to twodimensions leads to the Jackiw-Teitelboim theory is presented. A nonsingularblack hole solution of the theory is obtained and its physical interpretationis discussed. The classical and semiclassical properties of the solution and ofits 2d counterpart are analysed. The 2d theory is also used to model theevaporation process of the near-extremal 4d black hole. We describe in detailthe peculiarities of the black hole solutions, in particular the purelytopological nature of the Hawking radiation, in the context of theJackiw-Teitelboim theory.
