We study the interplay between T-duality, compactification and supersymmetry.We prove that when the original configuration has unbroken space-timesupersymmetries, the dual configuration also does if a special condition ison the coordinate which corresponds to the isometry direction of the bosonicfields used for duality. Examples of ``losers" (T-duals are not supersymmetric)and ``winners" (T-duals are supersymmetric) are given.
