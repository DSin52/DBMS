Title: On the Additional Symmetry; Many-Body Problem Related to the KP

HierarchyAuthors: Kazuhiro Hikami and Miki Wadati

Comments: 8 pages

Nonlinear integrable equations, such as the KdV equation, the Boussinesqequation and the KP equation, have the close relation with many-body problem.The solutions of such equations are the same as the restricted flows of theclassical Calogero model, which is one-dimensional particle system with inversesquare interactions. The KP hierarchy and the Calogero model share the samestructure called ``additional symmetry''. This symmetry plays a crucial role inthis relation.
