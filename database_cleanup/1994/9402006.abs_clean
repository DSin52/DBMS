We investigate the generic distribution of bosonic and fermionic states atall mass levels in non-supersymmetric string theories, and find that a hidden``misaligned supersymmetry'' must always appear in the string spectrum. We showthat this misaligned supersymmetry is ultimately responsible for the finitenessof string amplitudes in the absence of full spacetime supersymmetry, andtherefore the existence of misaligned supersymmetry provides a naturalconstraint on the degree to which spacetime supersymmetry can be broken instring theory without destroying the finiteness of string amplitudes.Misaligned supersymmetry also explains how the requirements of modularinvariance and absence of physical tachyons generically affect the distributionof states throughout the string spectrum, and implicitly furnishes atwo-variable generalization of some well-known results in the theory of modularfunctions.
