It is shown that the perturbative expansions of the correlation functions ofa relativistic quantum field theory at finite temperature are uniquelydetermined by the equations of motion and standard axiomatic requirements,including the KMS condition. An explicit expression as a sum over generalizedFeynman graphs is derived. The canonical formalism is not used, and thederivation proceeds from the beginning in the thermodynamic limit. No doublingof fields is invoked. An unsolved problem concerning existence of theseperturbative expressions is pointed out.
