Using a cohomological characterization of the consistent and the covariantLorentz and gauge anomalies, derived from the complexification of the relevantalgebras, we study in $d=2$ the definition of the Weyl determinant for anon-abelian theory with Riemannian background. We obtain two second orderoperators that produce, by means of $\zeta$-function regularization,respectively the consistent and the covariant Lorentz and gauge anomalies,preserving diffeomorphism invariance. We compute exactly their functionalthe non-abelian generalization of the classical Leutwyler's result, while the``covariant'' one gives rise to a covariant version of the usualWess-Zumino-Witten action.
