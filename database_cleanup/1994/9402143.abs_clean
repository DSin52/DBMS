ENSLAPP-L-456/94, BONN-HE-94-03Using finite-size-scaling methods, we study the quantum chain version of thespin-$1$-Blume-Capel model coupled to an imaginary field. The aim is to realizehigher order non-unitary conformal field theories in a simple Ising-type spinmodel. We find that the first ground-state level crossing in thehigh-temperature phase leads to a second-order phase transition of the Yang-Leeuniversality class (central charge $c=-22/5$). The Yang-Lee transition regionends at a line of a new type of tricriticality, where the {\em three} lowestenergy levels become degenerate. The analysis of the spectrum at two points onthis line gives good evidence that this line belongs to the universality classof the ${\cal M}_{2,7}$-conformal theory with $c=-68/7$.
