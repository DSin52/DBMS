We construct the exponentials of the Liouville field with continuous powerswithin the operator approach. Their chiral decomposition is realized using theexplicit Coulomb-gas operators we introduced earlier. {}From the quantum-groupviewpoint, they are related to semi-infinite highest or lowest weightrepresentations with continuous spins. The Liouville field itself is defined,and the canonical commutation relations verified, as well as the validity ofthe quantum Liouville field equations.In a second part, both screening charges are considered. The braiding of thechiral components is derived and shown to agree with the ansatz of a parallel$U_q(sl(2)) \odot U_{\qhat}(sl(2))$ is a non trivial extension of $U_q(sl(2))$and $U_{\qhat}(sl(2))$. We construct the corresponding generalized exponentialsand the generalized Liouville field.
