We give close formulas for the counting functions of rational curves oncomplete intersection Calabi-Yau manifolds in terms of special solutions ofgeneralized hypergeometric differential systems. For the one modulus cases wederive a differential equation for the Mirror map, which can be viewed as ageneralization of the Schwarzian equation. We also derive a nonlinear seventhorder differential equation which directly governs the instanton correctedYukawa coupling.
