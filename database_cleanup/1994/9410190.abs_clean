We study the 1-form diffeomorphism cohomologies within a local conformalLagrangian Field Theory model built on a two dimensional Riemann surface withno boundary. We consider the case of scalar matter fields and the complexstructure is parametrized by Beltrami differential. The analysis is firstperformed at the Classical level, and then we improve the quantum extension,introducing the current in the Lagrangian dynamics, coupled to external sourcefields. We show that the anomalies which spoil the current conservations takeorigin from the holomorphy region of the external fields, and only thedifferential spin 1 and 2 currents (as well their c.c) could be anomalous.
