A functional integral representation is given for a large class of quantummechanical models with a non--L2 ground state. As a prototype the particle in astate on the Weyl algebra, and a functional measure (spectral stochasticprocess) is constructed on trajectories taking values in the spectrum of themaximal abelian subalgebra of the Weyl algebra isomorphic to the algebra ofalmost periodic functions. The thermodynamical limit of the finite volumefunctional integrals for such models is discussed, and the superselectionsectors associated to an observable subalgebra of the Weyl algebra aredescribed in terms of boundary conditions and/or topological terms in thefinite volume measures.
