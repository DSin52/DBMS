PAR-LPTHE 93/59We examine the geometrical and topological properties of surfaces surroundingclusters in the 3--$d$ Ising model. For geometrical clusters at the percolationtemperature and Fortuin--Kasteleyn clusters at $T_c$, the number of surfaces ofgenus $g$ and area $A$ behaves as $A^{x(g)}e^{-\mu(g)A}$, with $x$approximately linear in $g$ and $\mu$ constant. We observe that cross--sectionsof spin domain boundaries at $T_c$ decompose into a distribution $N(l)$ ofloops of length $l$ that scales as $l^{-\tau}$ with $\tau \sim 2.2$. We addressthe prospects for a string--theoretic description of cluster boundaries.
