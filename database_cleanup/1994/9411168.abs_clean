It has recently been shown that the $W_3$ and $W_3^{(2)}$ algebras can beconsidered as subalgebras in some linear conformal algebras. In this paper weshow that the nonlinear algebras $W_{2,4}$ and $WB_2$ as well asZamolodchikov's spin $5/2$ superalgebra also can be embedded as subalgebrasinto some linear conformal algebras with a finite set of currents. These linearalgebras give rise to new realizations of the nonlinear algebras which could besuitable in the construction of $W$-string theories.
