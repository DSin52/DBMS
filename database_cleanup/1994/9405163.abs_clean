We study the thermodynamics of the relativistic Quantum Field Theory ofmassive fermions in three space-time dimensions coupled to an AbelianMaxwell-Chern-Simons gauge field. We evaluate the specific heat at finitetemperature and density and find that the variation with the statistical angleis consistent with the non-relativistic ideas on generalized statistics.
