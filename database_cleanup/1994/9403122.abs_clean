In this review article, we review the recent developments in constructingstring field theories that have been proposed, all of which correctly reproducefree fermion field theory (b) collective string field theory (c) temporal gaugestring field theory (d) non-polynomial string field theory. We analyze discretestates, the $w(\infty)$ symmetry, and correlation functions in terms of thesedifferent string field theories. We will also comment on the relationshipbetween these various field theories. (To appear in Int. J. of Mod. Phys.Written in LATEX.)
