It is argued that the nonintegrably singular energy density of the electron'selectromagnetic field (in both the classical point-charge model and quantumelectrodynamics) must entail very strong self-gravitational effects, which, viablack hole phenomena at finite radii, could well cut off the otherwise infiniteelectromagnetic contribution to the electron's mass. The general- relativisticequations for static, spherically symmetric stellar structure are specializedto treat the self-gravitational effects of static, spheri- cally symmetric,nonnegative, localized energy densities which may exhibit nonintegrablesingularities at zero radius. It is demonstrated that in many situations,including the electromagnetic ones of interest here, such a system has a blackhole whose Schwarzschild radius is that where the original energy per radialdistance (the spherical shell area times the original energy density) reachesthe inverse of (2G). The total mass of the system is that of this black hole(which follows in the usual way from its Schwarz- schild radius) plus theintegrated original energy density outside this black hole. These resultsproduce, for the classical point-charge model of the electron, an electrostaticcontribution to its mass which is many orders of magnitude larger than itsmeasured mass. For quantum electrodynamics, how- ever, the result is anelectromagnetic mass contribution which is approxi- mately equal to its baremass -- thus about half of its measured mass.
