123-128In this talk the class of multi-fields reductions of the KP and super-KPhierarchies (leading to non-purely differential Lax operators) is revisitedfrom the point of view of coset construction. This means in particular that allthe hamiltonian densities of the infinite tower belong to a coset algebra of agiven Poisson brackets structure.
