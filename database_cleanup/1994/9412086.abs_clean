Title: The Linear Multiplet and Quantum String Effective Actions

Comments: 14 pages, latex

Quantum symmetries of four-dimensional superstrings are frequently realizedin an anomaly-cancellation mode in the effective low-energy supergravity. Themassless antisymmetric tensor plays an important r\^ole in this mechanism andthe choice of its supersymmetric description, using either a chiral or a linearmultiplet, appears to introduce significant conceptual and practicaldifferences at the string loop level. This paper reviews the construction ofloop-corrected string effective supergravities with the dilaton andantisymmetric tensor embedded in a linear multiplet. Using anomaly cancellationand the linear multiplet allows to obtain an all-order renormalization-groupinvariant effective lagrangian for a pure gauge sector with field-dependentgauge coupling constant.Presented at the Workshop "Physics from Planck Scale to Electroweak Scale",Warsaw, Poland, September 1994.
