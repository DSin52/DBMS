We present a classical integrable model of $SU(N)$ isospin defined on complexprojective phase space in the external magnetic field and solve it exactly byconstructing the action-angle variables for the system. We quantize the systemusing the coherent state path integral method and obtain an exact expressionfor quantum mechanical propagator by solving the time-dependent Schr\"odingerequations.
