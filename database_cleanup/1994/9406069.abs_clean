Starting with the Taub--NUT solution to Einstein's equations, together with aconstant dilaton, a dyonic Taub--NUT solution of low energy heterotic stringtheory with non--trivial dilaton, axion and $U(1)$ gauge fields is constructedby employing $O(1,1)$ transformations. The electromagnetic dual of thissolution is constructed, using $SL(2,\rline)$ transformations. By anappropriate change to scaled variables, the extremal limit of the dual solutionis shown to correspond to the low energy limit of an exact conformal fieldtheory presented previously.
