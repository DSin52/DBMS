Title: Black hole entropy and the semiclassical approximation

Authors: Samir D. Mathur

Comments: 9 pages, 1 figure (included), plain tex. (Section on quantum gravity

is rewritten to explain basic ideas more clearly.)We compute the entropy of the Hawking radiation for an evaporating blackhole, in 1+1 dimensions and in 3+1 dimensions. We investigate the validity ofthe semiclassical approximation for the evaporation process. It appears thatthere might be a large entropy of entanglement between the classical degrees offreedom describing the black hole and the radiation fields when the theory ofquantum gravity plus matter is considered.
