The concept of the one -- dimensional quantum mechanics in the relativisticconfigurational space (RQM) is reviewed briefly. The Relativistic Schroedingerequation (RSE) arising here is the finite-difference equation with the stepequal to the Compton wave length of the particle. The different generalizationsof the Dirac -- Infeld -- Hall factorizarion method for this case areconstructed. This method enables us to find out all possible finite-differencegeneralizations of the most important nonrelativistic integrable case -- theharmonic oscillator. As it was shown (\cite{kmn},\cite{mir6}) in RQM theharmonic oscillator = $q$ -- oscillator. It is also shown that the relativisticand nonrelativistic QM's are different representations of the same theory.Thetransformation connecting these two representations is found in explicitform. It could be considered as the generalization of the Kontorovich --Lebedev transformation.
