Title: The Continuum Limit of the Schwinger-Dyson Equations of the One and Two

Matrix Model with Finite Loop LengthComments: 13 pages, LaTeX

Journal-ref: Phys. Lett. B348 (1995) 365

We take the continuum limit of the \sdeq s of the one and two matrix modelwithout expanding them in the length of the loop. The resulting equations agreewith those proposed for string field theory in the temporal gauge. We find thatthe loop operators are required to mix in the two matrix model case anddetermine the non-constant tadpole terms.
