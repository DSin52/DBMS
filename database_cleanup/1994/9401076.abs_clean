The tetrahedron equation arises as a generalization of the famousYang---Baxter equation to the 2+1-dimensional quantum field theory and the3-dimensional statistical mechanics. Very little is still known about itssolutions. Here a systematic method is described that does produce non-trivialsolutions to the tetrahedron equation with spin-like variables on the links.The essence of the method is the use of the so-called tetrahedral Zamolodchikovalgebras.
