Given an irreducible inclusion of infinite von-Neumann-algebras $\cn \subsetthat the inclusion has depth 2, we show quite explicitely how $\cn $ can beviewed as the fixed point algebra of $\cm$ w.r.t. an outer action of a compactKac-algebra acting on $\cm$. This gives an alternative proof, under thisspecial setting of a more general result of M. Enock and R. Nest, [E-N], seealso S. Yamagami, [Ya2].
