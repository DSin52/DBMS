We review the status of solitons in superstring theory, with a view tounderstanding the strong coupling regime. These {\it solitonic} solutions arenon-singular field configurations which solve the empty-space low-energy fieldequations (generalized, whenever possible, to all orders in $\alpha'$), carry anon-vanishing topological "magnetic" charge and are stabilized by a topologicalconservation law. They are compared and contrasted with the {\it elementary}solutions which are singular solutions of the field equations with a$\sigma$-model source term and carry a non-vanishing Noether "electric" charge.In both cases, the solutions of most interest are those which preserve half thespacetime supersymmetries and saturate a Bogomol'nyi bound. They typicallyarise as the extreme mass=charge limit of more general two-parameter solutionswith event horizons. We also describe the theory {\it dual} to the fundamentalstring for which the roles of elementary and soliton solutions areinterchanged. In ten spacetime dimensions, this dual theory is a superfivebraneand this gives rise to a string/fivebrane duality conjecture according to whichthe fivebrane may be regarded as fundamental in its own right, with thestrongly coupled string corresponding to the weakly coupled fivebrane andvice-versa. After compactification to four spacetime dimensions, the fivebraneappears as a magnetic monopole or a dual string according as it wraps aroundfive or four of the compactified dimensions. This gives rise to afour-dimensional string/string duality conjecture which subsumes aMontonen-Olive type duality in that the magnetic monopoles of the fundamentalstring correspond to the electric winding states of the dual string. This leadsto a {\it duality of dualities} whereby under string/string duality the thestrong/weak coupling $S$-duality trades places with the minimum/maximum length$T$-duality. Since these magnetic monopoles are extreme black holes, aprediction of $S$-duality is that the corresponding electric massive states ofthe fundamental string are also extreme black holes.
