Title: Classical and quantum representation theory

Comments: LaTeX, 40 pages

These notes present an introduction to an analytic version of deformationquantization. The central point is to study algebras of physical observablesand their irreducible representations. In classical mechanics one deals withreal Poisson algebras, whereas in quantum mechanics the observables have thestructure of a real non-associative Jordan-Lie algebra. The non-associativityis proportional to $\pl^2$, hence for $\pl\raw 0$ one recovers a real Poissonalgebra. This observation lies at the basis of `strict' deformationquantization, where one deforms a given Poisson algebra into a $C^*$-algebra,in such a way that the basic algebraic structures are preserved. Our maininterest lies in degenerate Poisson algebras and their quantization bynon-simple Jordan-Lie algebras. The traditional symplectic manifolds ofclassical mechanics, and their quantum counterparts (Hilbert spaces andoperator algebras which act irreducibly) emerge from a generalizedrepresentation theory. This two-step procedure sheds considerable light on thesubject. We discuss a large class of examples, in which the Poisson algebracanonically associated to an (integrable) Lie algebroid is deformed into theJordan-Lie algebra of the corresponding Lie groupoid. A special case of thisconstruction, which involves the gauge groupoid of a principal fibre bundle,describes the classical and quantum mechanics of a particle moving in anexternal gravitational and Yang-Mills field.
