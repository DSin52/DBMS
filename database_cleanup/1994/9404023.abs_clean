Title: q-deformed Dirac Monopole With Arbitrary Charge

Authors: Chong-Sun Chu, Pei-Ming Ho and Harold Steinacker

Comments: Technical modifications made on the definition of the base. A more

geometrical trivialization is used in section 4Journal-ref: Z.Phys. C71 (1996) 171-177

We construct the deformed Dirac monopole on the quantum sphere for arbitrarycharge using two different methods and show that it is a quantum principalbundle in the sense of Brzezinski and Majid. We also give a connection andcalculate the analog of its Chern number by integrating the curvature over$S^2_q$.
