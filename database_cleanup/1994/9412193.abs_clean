contribuited to XXVI Int. Conf.on HEP, Dallas, Texas, August 1992The scalar field is quantized in the discretized light-front frameworkfollowing the {\em standard} Dirac procedure and its infinite volume limittaken. The background field and the nonzero mode variables do not commute forfinite volume; they do so only in the continuum limit. A {\em non-localconstraint} in the theory relating the two is shown to follow and we must dealwith it along with the Hamiltonian. At the tree level the constraint leads to adescription of the spontaneous symmetry breaking. The elimination of theconstraint would lead to a highly involved light-front Hamiltonian in contrastto the one found when we ignore altogether the background field. Therenormalized constraint equation would also account for the instability of thesymmetric phase for large enough couping constant.
