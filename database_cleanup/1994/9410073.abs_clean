We show that the four-dimensional extreme dilaton black hole with dilatoncoupling constant $a= \sqrt{p/(p+2)}$ can be interpreted as a {\it completelynon-singular}, non-dilatonic, black $p$-brane in $(4+p)$ dimensions providedthat $p$ is {\it odd}. Similar results are obtained for multi-black holes anddilatonic extended objects in higher spacetime dimensions. The non-singularblack $p$-brane solutions include the self-dual three brane of ten-dimensionalN=2B supergravity and a multi-fivebrane solution of eleven-dimensionalsupergravity. In the case of a supersymmetric non-dilatonic $p$-brane solutionof a supergravity theory, we show that it saturates a bound on the energy perunit $p$-volume.
