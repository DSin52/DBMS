A manifestly Lorentz and diffeomorphism invariant form for the abelian gaugefield action with local duality symmetry of Schwarz and Sen is given. Some ofthe underlying symmetries of the covariant action are further considered. TheNoether conserved charge under continuous local duality rotations is found. Thecovariant couplings with gravity and the axidilaton field are discussed.
