Title: Extensions and contractions of the Lie algebra of q-pseudodifferential

symbolsComments: 39 pages. Minor typos corrected, 4 references added and

acknowledgements extendedWe construct cocycles on the Lie algebra of pseudo- and q-pseudodifferentialPoisson algebra on two-torus. A ``quantum'' Godbillon-Vey cocycle on(pseudo)-differential operators appears in this construction as a naturalgeneralization of the Gelfand-Fuchs 3-cocycle on periodic vector fields. Wedescribe a nontrivial embedding of the Virasoro algebra into (a completion of)q-pseudodifferential symbols, and propose q-analogs of the KP andKdV-hierarchies admitting an infinite number of conserved charges.
