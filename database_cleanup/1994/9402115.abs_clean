We investigate the global structure of inflationary universe both byanalytical methods and by computer simulations of stochastic processes in theearly Universe. We show that the global structure of the universe dependscrucially on the mechanism of inflation. In the simplest models of chaoticinflation the Universe looks like a sea of thermalized phase surroundingpermanently self-reproducing inflationary domains. In the theories whereinflation occurs near a local extremum of the effective potential correspondingto a metastable state, the Universe looks like de Sitter space surroundingislands of thermalized phase. A similar picture appears even if the state $\phi= 0$ is unstable but the effective potential has a discrete symmetry $\phi \to=-\phi$. In this case the Universe becomes divided into domains containingdifferent phases. These domains will be separated from each other by domainwalls. However, unlike ordinary domain walls, these domain walls will inflate,and their thickness will exponentially grow. In the theories with continuoussymmetries inflation generates exponentially expanding strings and monopolessurrounded by thermalized phase. Inflating topological defects will be stable,and they will unceasingly produce new inflating topological defects. This meansthat topological defects may play a role of indestructible seeds for eternalinflation.
