Title: Unitary Rules for Black Hole Evaporation

Comments: 19 pages, 8 uuencoded figures, references added

Hawking has proposed non-unitary rules for computing the probabilisticoutcome of black hole formation. It is shown that the usual interpretation ofthese rules violates the superposition principle and energy conservation.Refinements of Hawking's rules are found which restore both the superpositionprinciple and energy conservation, but leave completely unaltered Hawking'sprediction of a thermal emission spectrum prior to the endpoint of black holeevaporation. These new rules violate clustering. They further imply theexistence of superselection sectors, within each of which clustering isrestored and a unitary $S$-matrix is shown to exist. -- This is an expandedversion of a talk given at the Seventh Marcel Grossman Meeting on GeneralRelativity, Stanford CA.
