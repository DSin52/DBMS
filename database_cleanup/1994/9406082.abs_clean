We consider the conformal gauging of non-abelian groups. In such cases thereare inequivalent ways of gauging (generalizing the axial and vector cases forabelian groups) corresponding to external automorphisms of the group. Different$\s$-models obtained this way correspond to the same conformal field theory. Weuse the method of quotients to formulate this equivalence as a new dualitysymmetry.
