Authors: Hidenori Sonoda

Comments: 6 pages (plain TeX), UCLA/94/TEP/20

We consider the linear space of composite fields as an infinite dimensionalvector bundle over the theory space whose coordinates are simply the parametersof a renormalized field theory. We discuss a geometrical expression for theshort distance singularities of the composite fields in terms of betafunctions, anomalous dimensions, and a connection. (Based upon a talk given atthe International Colloquim on Modern Quantum Field Theory, 5--11 January 1994,Bombay, India.)
