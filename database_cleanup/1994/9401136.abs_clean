Alain Connes' construction of the standard model is based on a generalizedDirac-Yukawa operator and the K-cycle $(\HD ,D)$, with $\HD$ a fermionicHilbert space. If this construction is reformulated at the level of thedifferential algebra then a direct comparison with the alternative approach bythe Marseille-Mainz group becomes possible. We do this for the case of the toymodel based on the structure group $U(1)\times U(1)$ and for the $SU(2)\timesU(1)$ of electroweak interactions. Connes' results are recovered without thesomewhat disturbing $\gamma_{5}$-factors in the fermion mass terms and Yukawacouplings. We discuss both constructions in the same framework and, inparticular, pinpoint the origin of the difference in the Higgs potentialobtained by them.
