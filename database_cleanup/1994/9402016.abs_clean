The 1--loop string background equations with axion and dilaton fields areshown to be integrable in four dimensions in the presence of two commutingKilling symmetries and $\delta c = 0$. Then, in analogy with reduced gravity,there is an infinite group that acts on the space of solutions and generatesnon--trivial string backgrounds from flat space. The usual $O(2,2)$ and$S$--duality transformations are just special cases of the string Geroch group,which is infinitesimally identified with the $O(2,2)$ current algebra. We alsofind an additional $Z_{2}$ symmetry interchanging the field content of thedimensionally reduced string equations. The method for constructingmulti--soliton solutions on a given string background is briefly discussed.
