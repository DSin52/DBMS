A set of compatible formulas for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of thequantum algebra $U_{q}({\rm su}_2)$ is given in this paper. These formulas areand Racah formulas. They serve as starting points for deriving variousrealizations of the unit tensor of $U_{q}({\rm su}_2)$ in terms of $q$-bosonoperators. The passage from the one-parameter quantum algebra $U_{q }({\rmsu}_2)$ to the two-parameter quantum algebra $U_{qp}({\rm u}_2)$ is discussedat the level of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.
