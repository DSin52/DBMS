We study systems without quenched disorder with a complex landscape, and weuse replica symmetry theory to describe them. We discuss theGolay-Bernasconi-Derrida approximation of the low autocorrelation model, and wereconstruct it by using replica calculations. Then we consider the full model,its low $T$ properties (with the help of number theory) and a Hartree-Fockresummation of the high-temperature series. We show that replica theory allowsto solve the model in the high $T$ phase. Our solution is based on one-linkintegral techniques, and is based on substituting a Fourier transform with ageneric unitary transformation. We discuss this approach as a powerful tool todescribe systems with a complex landscape in the absence of quenched disorder.
