A light-like Wilson loop is computed in perturbation theory up to ${\cal O}(g^4)$ for pure Yang--Mills theory in 1+1 dimensions, using Feynman andlight--cone gauges to check its gauge invariance. After dimensionalregularization in intermediate steps, a finite gauge invariant result isobtained, which however does not exhibit abelian exponentiation. Our result isat variance with the common belief that pure Yang--Mills theory is free in 1+1dimensions, apart perhaps from topological effects.
