We review our approach to time and quantum dynamics based on non-criticalstring theory, developing its relationship to previous work on non-equilibriumquantum statistical mechanics and the microscopic arrow of time. We exhibitspecific non-factorizing contributions to the ${\nd S}$ matrix associated withtopological defects on the world sheet, explaining the r\^ole that the leakageof ${W_{\infty}}$ charges plays in the loss of quantum coherence. We stress theanalogy with the quantum Hall effect, discuss the violation of $CPT$, and alsoapply our approach to cosmology.
