Title: Quantum groups and zeta-functions

Comments: 12 pages

A $q$-analogue of the Hurwitz zeta-function is introduced throughconsiderations on the spectral zeta-function of quantum group $SU_{q}(2)$, andits analytic aspects are studied via the Euler-MacLaurin summation formula.Asymptotic formulas of some relevant $q$-functions are discussed.
