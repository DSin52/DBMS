It is possible to extract values for critical couplings and gamma_string inmatrix models by deriving a renormalization group equation for the variation ofthe of the free energy as the size N of the matrices in the theory is varied.In this paper we derive a ``renormalization group equation'' for the Pennermodel by direct differentiation of the partition function and show that itreproduces the correct values of the critical coupling and gamma_string and isconsistent with the logarithmic corrections present for g=0,1.
