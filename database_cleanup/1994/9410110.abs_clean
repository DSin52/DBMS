We give a simple combinatoric proof of an exponential upper bound on thenumber of distinct 3-manifolds that can be constructed by successivelyidentifying nearest neighbour pairs of triangles in the boundary of asimplicial 3-ball and show that all closed simplicial manifolds that can beconstructed in this manner are homeomorphic to $S^3$. We discuss the problem ofproving that all 3-dimensional simplicial spheres can be obtained by thisconstruction and give an example of a simplicial 3-ball whose boundarytriangles can be identified pairwise such that no triangle is identified withany of its neighbours and the resulting 3-dimensional simplicial complex is asimply connected 3-manifold.
