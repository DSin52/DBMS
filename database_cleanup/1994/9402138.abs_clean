We explicitly construct a series of lattice models based upon the gauge group$Z_{p}$ which have the property of subdivision invariance, when the couplingparameter is quantized and the field configurations are restricted to satisfy atype of mod-$p$ flatness condition. The simplest model of this type yields theDijkgraaf-Witten invariant of a $3$-manifold and is based upon a single link,or $1$-simplex, field. Depending upon the manifold's dimension, other modelsmay have more than one species of field variable, and these may be based onhigher dimensional simplices.
