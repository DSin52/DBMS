The existence of a minimal observable length has long been suggested, inquantum gravity, as well as in string theory. In this context a generalizeduncertainty relation has been derived which quantum theoretically describes theminimal length as a minimal uncertainty in position measurements. Here we studyin full detail the quantum mechanical structure which underlies thisuncertainty relation.
