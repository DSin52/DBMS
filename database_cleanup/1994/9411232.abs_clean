We apply stochastic quantization method to matrix models for the secondquantization of loops in both discretized and continuum levels. The fictitioustime evolution described by the Langevin equation is interpreted as the timeevolution in a field theory of loops. The corresponding Fokker-Planckhamiltonian defines a non-critical string field theory. We study bothorientable and non-orientable interactions of loops in terms of matrix modelsand take the continuum limit for one-matrix case. As a consequence, we show theequivalence of stochastic quantization of matrix models in loop space to thetransfer-matrix formalism in dynamical triangulation of random surfaces. Wealso clarifies the origin of Virasoro algebra in this context.
