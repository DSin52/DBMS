We discuss the effective action for Polyakov-Wilson loops winding aroundcompact Euclidean time, which serve as order parameters for the finitetemperature deconfinement transition in $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills gauge theory. Wethen apply our results to the study of the high temperature continuation of theconfining phase, and to the analysis of certain $Z_N$ domain walls that havebeen argued to play a role in cosmology. We argue that the free energy of thesewalls is much larger than previously thought.
