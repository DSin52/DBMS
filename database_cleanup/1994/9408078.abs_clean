Title: Representations of tensor categories and Dynkin diagrams

Comments: 10 pages; errors in indexation in the Clebsch-Gordan and truncated

Clebsch-Gordan formulas are correctedinteresting algebras and representations defined over Z_+ come from categorytheory, and are best understood when their categorical origination has beendiscovered. We show that indecomposable Z_+-representations of the characterring of SU(2) satisfying certain conditions correspond to affine and infiniteDynkin diagrams with loops. We also show that irreducible Z_+-representationsof the Verlinde algebra (the character ring of the quantum group SU(2)_q, whereq is a root of unity), satisfying similar conditions correspond to usual(non-affine) Dynkin diagrams with loops. Conjecturedly, the last result isrelated to the ADE classification of conformal field theories with the chiralalgebra \hat{sl(2)}.
