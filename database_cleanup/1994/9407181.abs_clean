All the causally regular geometries obtained from (2+1)-anti-de Sitter spaceby identifications by isometries of the form $P \rightarrow (\exp \pi\xi) P$,where $\xi$ is a self-dual Killing vector of $so(2,2)$, are explicitelyconstructed. Their remarkable properties (Killing vectors, Killing spinors) arelisted. These solutions of Einstein gravity with negative cosmological constantare also invariant under the string duality transformation applied to theangular translational symmetry $\phi \rightarrow \phi+a$ The analysis is madeparticularly convenient through the construction of {\em global} coordinatesadapted to the identifications.}
