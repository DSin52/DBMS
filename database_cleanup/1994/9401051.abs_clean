In this paper we give a new derivation of the quark-antiquark potential inthe Wilson loop context. This makes more explicit the approximations involvedand enables an immediate extension to the three-quark case. In the$q\overline{q}$ case we find the same semirelativistic potential obtained inpreceding papers but for a question of ordering. In the $3q$ case we find aspin dependent potential identical to that already derived in the literaturefrom the ad hoc and non correct assumption of scalar confinement. Furthermorewe obtain the correct form of the spin independent potential up to the $1/m^2$order.
