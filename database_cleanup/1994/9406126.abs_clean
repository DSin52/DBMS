Static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions with non-zerocosmological constant are investigated. A formal power series solution isfound. It is proved that the number of regular horizons is less than or equalto 2 for positive cosmological constant and is less than or equal to 1 fornegative cosmological constant. This shows a striking contrast to the fact thatthe Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m-de Sitter black hole with positive cosmologicalhorizon has 3 regular horizons.
