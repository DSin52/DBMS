We present the anyon equation on a cylinder and in an infinite potential wallfrom the abelian Chern-Simons theory coupled to non-relativistic matter fieldby obtaining the effective hamiltonian through the canonical transformationmethod used for the theory on a plane and on a torus. We also give the periodicproperty of the theory on the cylinder.
