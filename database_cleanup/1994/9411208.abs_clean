We study properties of differential graded (dg) operads modulo weakequivalences, that is, modulo the relation given by the existence of a chain ofdg operad maps inducing a homology isomorphism. This approach, naturallyarising in string theory, leads us to consider various versions of models.Besides of some applications in topology and homological algebra we show thatour theory enables one to prove the existence of homotopy structures onphysically relevant spaces. For example, we prove that a closed string-fieldtheory induces a homotopy Lie algebra structure on the space of relativestates, which is one of main results of T. Kimura, A. Voronov and J. Stasheff(see [16]). Our theory gives a systematic way to prove statements of this type.The paper is a corrected version of a preprint which began to circulate inMarch 1994, with some new examples added.
