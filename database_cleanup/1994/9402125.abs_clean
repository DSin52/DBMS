Susskind has recently shown that a relativistic string approaching the eventhorizon of a black hole spreads in both the transverse and longitudinaldirections in the reference frame of an outside observer. The transversespreading can be described as a branching diffusion of wee string bits. Thisstochastic process provides a mechanism for thermalizing the quantum state ofthe string as it spreads across the stretched horizon.
