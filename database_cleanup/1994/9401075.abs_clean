Symmetry transformations of the space-time fields of string theory aregenerated by certain similarity transformations of the stress-tensor of theassociated conformal field theories. This observation is complicated by thefact that, as we explain, many of the operators we habitually use in stringtheory (such as vertices and currents) have ill-defined commutators. However,we identify an infinite-dimensional subalgebra whose commutators are notsingular, and explicitly calculate its structure constants. This constitutes asubalgebra of the gauge symmetry of string theory, although it may act onauxiliary as well as propagating fields. We term this object a {\it weightedtensor algebra}, and, while it appears to be a distant cousin of the$W$-algebras, it has not, to our knowledge, appeared in the literature before.
