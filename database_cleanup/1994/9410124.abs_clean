Title: Review of Non-Commutative Geometric Methods Applied to Particle Physics

Authors: A. H. Chamseddine

Comments: 16 pages

This is a brief review where some basic elements of non-commutative geometryare given. The rules and ingredients that enter in the construction of thestandard model and grand unification models in non-commutative geometry aresummarized. A connection between some space-time supersymmetric models andnon-commutative geometry is made. The advantages and problems of this directionare discussed.
