Title: Value of generalized hypergeometric function at unity

Authors: A. Kazarnovski-Krol

Comments: Ams-Tex error is corrected.

Value of generalized hypergeometric function at a special point iscalculated. More precisely, value of certain multiple integral over vanishingcycle (all arguments collapse to unity) is calculated. The answer is expressedin terms of $\Gamma$-functions. The constant is relevant to the part of $\rho$in the Gindikin-Karpelevich formula for c-function of Harish-Chandra.Calculation is an adaptation of classical calculations of Gelfand and Naimark(1950) to the Heckman-Opdam hypergeometric functions in the case of root systemof type $A_{n-1}$.
