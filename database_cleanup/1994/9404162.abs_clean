After adding a scalar chiral boson to the usual superspace variables, thefour-dimensional Green-Schwarz superstring is quantized in a manifestly SO(3,1)super-Poincar\'e covariant manner. The constraints are all first-class and forman N=2 superconformal algebra with $c=-3$. Since the Calabi-Yau degrees offreedom are described by an N=2 superconformal field theory with $c=9$, thecombined Green-Schwarz and Calabi-Yau systems form the $c=6$ matter sector of acritical N=2 string.Using the standard N=2 super-Virasoro ghosts, a nilpotent BRST charge isdefined and vertex operators for the massless supermultiplets are constructed.Four-dimensional superstring amplitudes can be calculated with manifest SO(3,1)super-Poincar\'e invariance by evaluating correlation functions of theseBRST-invariant vertex operators on N=2 super-Riemann surfaces.
