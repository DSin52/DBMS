An ambiguity is pointed out in J.S. Bell's argument that the distinctionbetween quantum mechanics and hidden variable theories cannot be found in thebehavior of single-particle beams. Within the context of theories for whichstates are unambiguously defined it is shown that the question of whetherquantum mechanics or a locally realistic theory is valid may indeed be answeredby single-particle beam measurements. It is argued that two-particlecorrelation experiments are required to answer the more fundamental question ofwhether or not the notion of a state can be unambiguously defined. As abyproduct of the discussion the general form of completely entangled states isdeduced.
