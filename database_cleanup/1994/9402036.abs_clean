We use the canonical quantization of spherically symetric dust universes, andcalculate the expectation value of the quantized metric, $<\Psi|\hat{g}|\Psi>$.Though the classical solutions are singular, and the wave functions have nozero support on singular geometries, the expectation values are everywhereregular. For a quasi-classical (coherent) state, the metric expectation valuedescribes a universe (or star) that collapses to a minimum radius, the Planckradius, and re-expands again.
