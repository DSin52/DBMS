We examine the conformal property of the second Hamiltonian structure ofconstrained KP hierarchy derived by Oevel and Strampp. We find that itnaturallygives a family of nonlocal extended conformal algebras. We give twoexamples of such algebras and find that they are similar to Bilal's V algebra.By taking a gauge transformation one can map the constrained KP hierarchy toKuperschmidt's nonstandard Lax hierarchy. We consider the second Hamiltonianstructure in this representation. We show that after mapping the Lax operatorto a pure differential operator the second structure becomes the sum of thesecond and the third Gelfand-Dickey brackets defined by this differentialoperator. We show that this Hamiltonian structure defines the W-U(1)-Kac-Moodyalgebra by working out its conformally covariant form.
