We consider a model of discretized 2d gravity interacting with Ising spinswhere phase boundaries are restricted to have minimal length and showanalytically that the critical exponent $\gamma= 1/3$ at the spin transitionpoint. The model captures the numerically observed behavior of standardmultiple Ising spins coupled to 2d gravity.
