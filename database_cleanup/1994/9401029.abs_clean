We compute the elliptic genus for arbitrary two dimensional $N=2$Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds. This is used to search for possible mirror pairs ofsuch models. We show that if two Landau-Ginzburg models are conjugate to eachother in a certain sense, then to every orbifold of the first theorycorresponds an orbifold of the second theory with the same elliptic genus (upto a sign) and with the roles of the chiral and anti-chiral rings interchanged.These orbifolds thus constitute a possible mirror pair. Furthermore, new pairsof conjugate models may be obtained by taking the product of old ones. We alsogive a sufficient (and possibly necessary) condition for two models to beconjugate, and show that it is satisfied by the mirror pairs proposed by one ofthe authors and~H\"ubsch.
