Title: Current Directions in String Theory and Abstract Supersymmetry

Authors: Jeffrey A. Harvey

Comments: 14 pages, latex, world_sci.sty, no figures, minor typos corrected

I discuss some current thoughts on how low-energy measurements andconsistency constrain theories at high energies with emphasis on string theory.I also discuss some recent work on the dynamics of supersymmetric gaugetheories.
