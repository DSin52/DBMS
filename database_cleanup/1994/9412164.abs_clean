270-291A consistent quantization procedure of anomalous chiral models is discussed.It is based on the modification of the classical action by adding Wess-Zuminoterms. The $SO(3)$ invariant WZ action for the $SO(3)$ model is constructed.Quantization of the corresponding modified theory is considered in details.
