We obtain a new free field realization of $N=2$ super $W_{3}$ algebra usingthe technique of quantum hamiltonian reduction. The construction is based on aparticular choice of the simple root system of the affine Lie superalgebra$sl(3|2)^{(1)}$ associated with a non-standard $sl(2)$ embedding. Aftertwisting and a similarity transformation, this $W$ algebra can be identified asthe extended topological conformal algebra of non-critical $W_{3}$ stringtheory.
