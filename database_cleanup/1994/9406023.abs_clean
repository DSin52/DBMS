Title: A-Genus and the Sigma Model

Authors: Kelly Jay Davis

Comments: 16 Pages

This set of lecture notes presents a pedantic derivation of the connectionbetween the $ {\hat A} $-genus of spacetime's loop space and the genus onepartition function of the $ N=1/2 $ sigma model. It concludes with some remarkson possible generalizations of the $ {\hat A} $-genus which follow naturallyfrom the `stringy' point-of-view but have yet to be explored mathematically.This set of lecture notes is geared towards a mathematical audience unfamiliarwith the $ N=1/2 $ sigma model.
