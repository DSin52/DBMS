High energy scattering in 2+1 QCD is studied using the recent approach ofVerlinde and Verlinde. We calculate the color singlet part of the quark-quarkscattering exactly within this approach, and discuss some physical implicationof this result. We also demonstrate, by two independent methods, thatreggeization fails for the color singlet channel. We briefly comment on theproblem in 3+1 QCD.
