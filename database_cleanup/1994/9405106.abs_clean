A systematic formulation of the higher genus expansion in topological stringtheory is considered. We also develop a simple way of evaluating genus zerocorrelation functions. At higher genera we derive some interesting formulas forthe free energy in the $A_1$ and $A_2$ models. We present some evidence thattopological minimal models associated with Lie algebras other than the A-D-Etype do not have a consistent higher genus expansion beyond genus one. We alsopresent some new results on the $CP^1$ model at higher genera.
