The scattering of vortices at a critical value of the coupling constant inthe Lagrangian can be approximated by a geodesic motion in the moduli space ofclassical static configurations of vortices. In this paper we give a scheme forgeneralising this idea to couplings that are near to the critical value. Byperturbing a critically coupled field, we show that scattering of vortices atnear-critical coupling can be approximated by motion in the original modulispace with a perturbed metric, and a potential. We apply this method to thescattering of two vortices, and compare our results to recent numericalsimulations, and find good agreement where the scattering is not highlysensitive to radiation into other field modes. We also investigate thepossibility of bound stable orbits of two vortices in the quantum field theory.
