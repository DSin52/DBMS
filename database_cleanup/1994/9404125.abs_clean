theory in four-dimensions, which describes the consistent massless backgroundfields for $~N=2$~ superstring, generates the actions for $~N=1$~ and $~N=2$~supersymmetric non-Abelian Chern-Simons theories in three-dimensions afterappropriate dimensional reductions. Since the latters play important roles forsupersymmetric integrable models, this result indicates the fundamentalsignificance of the $~N=2$~ superstring theory controlling (possibly all)supersymmetric integrable models in lower-dimensions.
