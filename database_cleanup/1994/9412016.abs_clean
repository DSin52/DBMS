Title: Coordinate System In Quantum Gravity

Comments: 7 pages , LaTex

We discuss a Gedanken experiment in which we construct a physical coordinatesystem which covers the universe. Using general properties of quantum gravitywe find that the minimum uncertainty of the coordinate system is $\sqrt[5]{R}$where $R$ is the radius of the universe
