Title: Equations for Correlation Functions of Eight-Vertex Model

and Disordered PhasesComments: 16 pages, a new section inserted instead of Eq. (4.15)

The Kyoto group (Jimbo, Miwa, Nakayashikiet al.) showed that the partitionfunction and correlation funtions of the eight-vertex model inantiferromagnetic phases can be calculated using simple analytical propertiesof the $R$-matrix. We extend these methods to ferromagnetic and disorderedphases. We use Baxter's symmetries to obtain appropriate parametrizations ofthe $R$-matrix and to substantiate the validity of the analytical approach forthese phases. These symmetries allow one to relate correlation functions indifferent phases.
