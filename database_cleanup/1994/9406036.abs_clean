Let $X$ be a compact Kahler manifold and $L\to X$ a quantizing holomorphicHermitian line bundle. To immersed Lagrangian submanifolds $\Lambda$ of $X$satisfying a Bohr-Sommerfeld condition we associate sequences $\{ |\Lambda,k\rangle \}_{k=1}^\infty$, where $\forall k$ $|\Lambda, k\rangle$ is aholomorphic section of $L^{\otimes k}$. The terms in each sequence concentrateon $\Lambda$, and a sequence itself has a symbol which is a half-form,$\sigma$, on $\Lambda$. We prove estimates, as $k\to\infty$, of the normsquares $\langle \Lambda, k|\Lambda, k\rangle$ in terms of $\int_\Lambda\sigma\overline{\sigma}$. More generally, we show that if $\Lambda_1$ and$\Lambda_2$ are two Bohr-Sommerfeld Lagrangian submanifolds intersectingcleanly, the inner products $\langle\Lambda_1, k|\Lambda_2, k\rangle$ have anasymptotic expansion as $k\to\infty$, the leading coefficient being an integralover the intersection $\Lambda_1\cap\Lambda_2$. Our construction is aquantization scheme of Bohr-Sommerfeld Lagrangian submanifolds of $X$. We provethat the Poincar\'e series on hyperbolic surfaces are a particular case, andtherefore obtain estimates of their norms and inner products.
