We introduce the notion of (nondegenerate) strong-modular fusion algebras.Here strongly-modular means that the fusion algebra is induced via Verlinde'sformula by a representation of the modular group SL(2,Z) whose kernel containsa congruence subgroup. Furthermore, nondegenerate means that the conformaldimensions of possibly underlying rational conformal field theories do notdiffer by integers. Our main result is the classification of allstrongly-modular fusion algebras of dimension two, three and four and theclassification of all nondegenerate strongly-modular fusion algebras ofdimension less than 24. We use the classification of the irreduciblerepresentations of the finite groups SL(2,Z_{p^l}) where p is a prime and l apositive integer. Finally, we give polynomial realizations and fusion graphsfor all simple nondegenerate strongly-modular fusion algebras of dimension lessthan 24.
