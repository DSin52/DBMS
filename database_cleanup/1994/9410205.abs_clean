The principle of S-duality is used to incorporate gaugino condensates intoeffective supergravity (superstring) Lagrangians. We discuss twoimplementations of S-duality which differ in the way the coupling constant istransformed. Both solve the problem of the runaway dilaton and lead tosatisfactory supersymmetry breaking in models with a {\em single} gauginocondensate. The breakdown of supersymmetry is intimately related to anontrivial transformation of the condensate under T-duality.
