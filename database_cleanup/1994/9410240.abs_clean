Light-cone quantization of (3+1)-dimensional electrodynamics is discussed,using discretization as an infrared regulator and paying careful attention tothe interplay between gauge choice and boundary conditions. In the zerolongitudinal momentum sector of the theory a general gauge fixing is performedand the corresponding relations that determine the constrained modes of thegauge field are obtained. The constraints are solved perturbatively and thestructure of the theory is studied to lowest nontrivial order.
