We consider possible definitions of physical variables in QED. We demonstratethat the condition $\partial_i A_i$$=0$ is the most convenient one because itleads to path integral over physical components with local action. However,other choices, as $A_3=0$, are also possible. The standard expression forconfiguration space path integral in $A_3=0$ gauge is obtained starting withreduced phase space formulation. Contrary to the claims of the paper [M.Lavelleand D.McMullan,Phys. Lett. B316 (1993)172] the $A_3=0$ gauge is notoverconstrained.
