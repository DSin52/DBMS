A thorough analysis of the general features of $(p=2)$ parasupersymmetricquantum mechanics is presented. It is shown that for both Rubakov--Spiridonovand Beckers--Debergh formulations of $(p=2)$-parasupersymmetric quantummechanics, the degeneracy structure of the energy spectrum can be derived usingthe defining parasuperalgebras. Thus the results of the present article isindependent of the details of the Hamiltonian. In fact, they are valid forarbitrary systems based on arbitrary dimensional coordinate manifolds. Inparticular, the Rubakov--Spiridonov (R-S) and Beckers--Debergh (B-D) systemspossess identical degeneracy structures. For a subclass of R-S (alternativelyB-D) systems, a new topological invariant is introduced. This is a counterpartof the Witten index of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
