The general theory of a massless fermion coupled to a massive vector meson intwo dimensions is formulated and solved to obtain the complete set of Green'sfunctions. Both vector and axial vector couplings are included. In addition tothe boson mass and the two coupling constants, a coefficient which denotes aparticular current definition is required for a unique specification of themodel.The resulting four parameter theory and its solution are shown to reduce inappropriate limits to all the known soluble models, including in particular theSchwinger model and its axial vector variant.
