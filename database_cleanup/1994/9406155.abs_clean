We study the general structure of Smirnov's axioms on form factors of localoperators in integrable models. We find various consistency conditions that theform factor functions have to satisfy. For the special case of the $O(3)$$\sigma$-model we construct simple polynomial solutions for the operators ofthe spin-field, current, energy-momentum tensor and topological charge density.
