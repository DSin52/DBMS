Upto ten crossing number, there are two knots, $9_{42}$ and $10_{71}$ whosechirality is not detected by any of the known polynomials, namely, Jonesinvariants and their two variable generalisations, HOMFLY and Kauffmaninvariants. We show that the generalised knot invariants, obtained through$SU(2)$ Chern-Simons topological field theory, which give the known polynomialsas special cases, are indeed sensitive to the chirality of these knots.
