We consider the spin $k/2$ XXZ model in the antiferomagnetic regime using thefree field realization of the quantum affine algebra $\uqa$ of level $k$. Wegive a free field realization of the type II $q$-vertex operator, whichdescribes creation and annihilation of physical particles in the model. Bytaking a trace of the type I and the type II $q$-vertex operators over theirreducible highest weight representation of $\uqa$, we also derive an integralformula for form factors in this model. Investigating the structure of poles,we obtain a residue formula for form factors, which is a lattice analog of thehigher spin extension of the Smirnov's formula in the massive integrablequantum field theory. This result as well as the quantum deformation of theKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation for form factors shows a deep connection in themathematical structure of the integrable lattice models and the massiveintegrable quantum field theory.
