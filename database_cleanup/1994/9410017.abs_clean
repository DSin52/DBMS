In a Fock representation, a non-surjective Bogoliubov transformation of CARleads to a reducible representation. For the case that the correspondingBogoliubov operator has finite corank, the decomposition into irreduciblesubrepresentations is clarified. In particular, it turns out that the number ofappearing subrepresentations is completely determined by the corank.
