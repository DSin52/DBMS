We present an extension of ``smooth bosonization'' to the non-Abelian case.We construct an enlarged theory containing both bosonic and fermionic fieldswhich exhibits a local chiral gauge symmetry. A gauge fixing function dependingon one real parameter allows us to interpolate smoothly between a purelyfermionic and a purely bosonic representation. The procedure is, in the specialcase of bosonization, complementary to the approach based on duality.
