64-77Some relations between different objects associated with quantum affinealgebras are reviewed. It is shown that the Frenkel-Jing bosonization of a newrealization of quantum affine algebra $\Uqa$ as well as bosonization of$L$-operators for this algebra can be obtained from Zamolodchikov-Faddeevalgebras defined by the quantum $R$-matrix satisfying unitarity andcrossing-symmetry conditions.
