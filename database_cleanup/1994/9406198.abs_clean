After simultaneous compactification of spacetime and worldvolume on $K3$, the$D=10$ heterotic fivebrane with gauge group $SO(32)$ behaves like a $D=6$heterotic string with gauge group $SO(28) \times SU(2)$, but with Kac--Moodylevels different from those of the fundamental string. Thus thestring/fivebrane duality conjecture in $D=10$ gets replaced by a string/stringduality conjecture in $D=6$. Since $D=6$ strings are better understood than$D=10$ fivebranes, this provides a more reliable laboratory in which to testthe conjecture. According to string/string duality, the Green--Schwarzfactorization of the $D=6$ spacetime anomaly polynomial $I_{8}$ into $X_4\,\tilde{X}_4$ means that just as $X_4$ is the $\sigma$-model anomaly polynomialof the fundamental string worldsheet so $\tilde{X}_4$ should be thecorresponding polynomial of the dual string worldsheet. To test this idea weperform a classical dual string calculation of $\tilde{X}_4$ and find agreementwith the quantum fundamental string result. This also provides an {\it aposteriori} justification for assumptions made in a previous paper onstring/fivebrane duality. Finally we speculate on the relevance ofstring/string duality to the vacuum degeneracy problem.
