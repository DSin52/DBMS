Title: Renormalization in 1D Quantum Mechanics

Comments: Four figures not included (but two of them sketched)

We build a toy model of the Wilson-Kogut renormalization group in onedimensional Quantum Mechanics. With it, we show how the RG flow in the space of1-D S matrices of finite range defines, as renormalized interactions, the knownfour parametric set of contact interactions, thus providing a suitableframework for its study.
