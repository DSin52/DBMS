We perform a marginal deformation of the SL(2,R) WZW model in a nulldirection. If we send the deformation parameter to infinity we obtain a lineardilaton background plus two free bosons. We show in addition that such abackground can be obtained by a duality transformation of the undeformed WZWmodel. In the end we indicate how to generalize the given procedure.
