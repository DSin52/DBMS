The theory of a massless two-dimensional scalar field with a periodicboundary interaction is considered. At a critical value of the period thissystem defines a conformal field theory and can be re-expressed in terms offree fermions, which provide a simple realization of a hidden $SU(2)$ symmetryof the original theory. The partition function and the boundary $S$-matrix canbe computed exactly as a function of the strength of the boundary interaction.We first consider open strings with one interacting and one Dirichlet boundary,and then with two interacting boundaries. The latter corresponds to motion in aperiodic tachyon background, and the spectrum exhibits an interesting bandstructure which interpolates between free propagation and tight binding as theinteraction strength is varied.
