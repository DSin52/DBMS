We consider the formulation of two dimensional QCD in terms of gaugeinvariant bilocal operators (string field) which satisfy a $W_\infty$ algebra.In analogy with our work on the $c=1$ string field theory we derive an actionand associated constraints for the bilocal field using the method of coadjointorbits. The $1/N$ perturbation theory around a classical solution thatcorresponds to the filled Dirac sea leads to the 'tHooft equation for mesonfluctuations. It is shown that the spectrum of mesons, which are the higherstring modes, transform as a representation of the wedge subalgebra$W_{\infty+} \otimes W_{\infty-}$. We briefly discuss the baryon as a stringysolitonic configuration and its characterization in terms of $W_\infty$algebra.
