We analyse the stringy gravitational wave background based on the currentalgebra $E^{c}_{2}$. We determine its exact spectrum and construct the modularinvariant vacuum energy. The corresponding N=1 extension is also constructed.The algebra is again mapped to free bosons and fermions and we show that thisbackground has N=4 (N=2) unbroken spacetime supersymmetry in the type II(heterotic case).
