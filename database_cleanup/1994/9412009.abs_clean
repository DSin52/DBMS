The recently introduced Galois symmetries of RCFT are generalized, for theWZW case, to `quasi-Galois symmetries'. These symmetries can be used to derivea large number of equalities and sum rules for entries of the modular matrix S,including some that previously had been observed empirically. In addition,quasi-Galois symmetries allow to construct modular invariants and to relateS-matrices as well as modular invariants at different levels. They also lead usto an extremely plausible conjecture for the branching rules of the conformalembeddings of g into so(dim g).
