In this letter we consider the nonlinear realizations of the classicalPolyakov's algebra $W_3^{(2)}$. The coset space method and the covariantreduction procedure allow us to deduce the Boussinesq equation withinterchanged space and evolution coordinates. By adding one more spacecoordinate and introducing two copies of the $W_3^{(2)}$ algebra, the samemethod yields the $sl(3,R)$ Toda lattice equations.
