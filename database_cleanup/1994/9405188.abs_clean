We study some conditions for the hierarchy $m_{3/2} << M_P$ to occurnaturally in a generic effective supergravity theory. Absence of fine-tuningand perturbative calculability require that the effective potential has asliding gravitino mass and vanishing cosmological constant, up to ${\calO}(m_{3/2}^4)$ corrections. In particular, cancellation of quadraticallydivergent contributions to the one-loop effective potential should take place,including the `hidden sector' of the theory. We show that these conditions canbe met in the effective supergravities derived from four-dimensionalsuperstrings, with supersymmetry broken either at the string tree level viacompactification, or by non-perturbative effects such as gaugino condensation.A crucial role is played by some approximate scaling symmetries, which areremnants of discrete target-space dualities in the large moduli limit. Wederive explicit formulae for the soft breaking terms arising from this class of`large hierarchy compatible' (LHC) supergravities.
