The question of the integrability of real-coupling affine toda field theoryon a half line is discussed. It is shown, by examining low-spin conservedcharges, that the boundary conditions preserving integrability are stronglyconstrained. In particular, among the cases treated so far, $e_6^{(1)}$,$d_n^{(1)}$ and $a_n^{(1)}, \ n\ge 2$, there can be no free parametersintroduced by such boundary conditions; indeed the only remaining freedom(apart from choosing the simple condition $\partial_1\phi =0$), resides in achoice of signs. For a special case of the boundary condition, accessible onlyfor $a_n^{(1)}$, it is pointed out that the classical boundary bound statespectrum may be related to a set of reflection factors in the quantum fieldtheory. Some preliminary calculations are reported for other boundaryconditions, demonstrating that the classical scattering data satisfies the weakcoupling limit of the reflection bootstrap equation.
