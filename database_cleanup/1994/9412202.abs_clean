(Talk delivered at the International Conference of Mathematical Physics,Paris 18-23 July 1994)1) classification of conformal field theories; 2) construction of latticeintegrable realizations of the latter; 3) solutions to the WDVV equations oftopological field theories. I show that a structure of Coxeter group is hiddenbehind these three related problems.
