It is shown how to treat the degrees of freedom of Nielsen-Olesen vortices inthe $3+1$-dimensional $U(1)$ higgs model by a collective coordinate method. Inthe london limit, where the higgs mass becomes infinite, the gauge andgoldstone degrees of freedom are integrated out, resulting in the vortexworld-sheet action. Introducing an ultraviolet cut-off mimics the effect offinite higgs mass. This action is non-polynomial in derivatives and depends onthe extrinsic curvature of the surface. Flat surfaces are stable if thecoherence length is less than the penetration depth. It is argued that in thequantum abelian higgs model, vortex world-sheets are dominated by branchedpolymers.
