In these lectures, we study and compare two different formulations of$SU(2)$, level $k=1$, Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory. The first,conventional, formulation employs the affine symmetry of the model; in thisapproach correlation functions are derived from the so-calledKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations. The second formulation is based on anentirely different algebraic structure, the so-called Yangian $Y(sl_2)$. Inthis approach, the Hilbert space of the theory is obtained by repeatedapplication of modes of the so-called spinon field, which has $SU(2)$ spin$j=\thalf$ and obeys fractional (semionic) statistics. We show how this newformulation, which can be generalized to many other rational conformal fieldtheories, can be used to compute correlation functions and to obtain newexpressions for the Virasoro and affine characters in the theory.
