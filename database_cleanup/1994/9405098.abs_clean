The BH algebra is defined by two sets of generators one of which satisfy therelations of the braid group and the other the relations of the Hecke algebraof projectors.These algebras are then combined by additional relations in a waywhich generalizes the Birman-Wenzl algebra.In this paper we Yang-Baxterize thealgebra BH and compute solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation.The solutionsfound are expressed algebraically in terms of the generators of the algebra.Theexpression generalizes the known one for the Birman-Wenzl algebra.
