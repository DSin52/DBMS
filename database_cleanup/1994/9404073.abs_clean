The string theory defined by gauging $\W_{\infty/2}$, the sub-algebra of$\W_{\infty}$ generated by the currents of even spin, is discussed. Thecritical value of the central charge is calculated using zeta-functiontechniques and shown to be $c=1$. A critical string theory is constructed bycoupling a free boson to $\W_{\infty/2}$-gravity and the physical states areanalysed.
