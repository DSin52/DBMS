In these lectures a general introduction to T-duality is given. In theabelian case the approaches of Buscher, and Ro\u{c}ek and Verlinde arereviewed. Buscher's prescription for the dilaton transformation is recoveredfrom a careful definition of the gauge integration measure. It is also shownhow duality can be understood as a quite simple canonical transformation. Someaspects of non-abelian duality are also discussed, in particular what is knownon relation to canonical transformations. Some implications of the existence ofduality on the cosmological constant and the definition of distance in StringTheory are also suggested.
