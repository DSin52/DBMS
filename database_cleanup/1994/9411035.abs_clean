Title: Generalized Gaudin Models and Riccatians

Comments: LaTeX, 37 pages

The systems of differential equations whose solutions coincide with Betheansatz solutions of generalized Gaudin models are constructed. These equationswe call the {\it generalized spectral Riccati equations}, because the simplestequation of this class has a standard Riccatian form. The general form of theseequations is $R_{n_i}[z_1(\lambda),\ldots, z_r(\lambda)] = c_{n_i}(\lambda), \i=1,\ldots, r$, where $R_{n_i}$ denote some homogeneous polynomials of degrees$n_i$ constructed from functional variables $z_i(\lambda)$ and theirderivatives. It is assumed that $\deg \partial^k z_i(\lambda) = k+1$. Theproblem is to find all functions $z_i(\lambda)$ and $c_{n_i}(\lambda)$satisfying the above equations under $2r$ additional constraints $P \z_i(\lambda)=F_i(\lambda)$ and $(1-P) \ c_{n_i}(\lambda)=0$, where $P$ is aprojector from the space of all rational functions onto the space of rationalfunctions having their singularities at {\it a priori} given points. It turnsout that this problem has solutions only for very special polynomials $R_{n_i}$called {\it Riccatians}. There exist a one-to-one correspondence betweensystems of Riccatians and simple Lie algebras. Functions $c_{n_i}(\lambda)$satisfying the system of equations constructed from Riccatians of the type${\cal L}_r$ exactly coincide with eigenvalues of the Gaudin spectral problemassociated with algebra ${\cal L}_r$. This result suggests that the generalizedGaudin models admit a total separation of variables.
