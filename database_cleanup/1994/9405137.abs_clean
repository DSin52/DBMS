Title: Exact Heavy To Light Meson Form Factors In The Chiral Limit Of Planar

1+1 QCDAuthors: Benjamin Grinstein

Comments: 8p (uuencoded, includes 4 eps figs, LaTeX & epsf), SMU-HEP/94-11 and

UCSD/PTH 94-09The form factors of the flavor changing vector current between a $\bar qQ$-meson and the lightest $\bar q q$ (pseudoscalar-)meson are computed exactlyand explicitly in the 't~Hooft model (planar QCD in $1+1$ dimensions) in thelimit that the mass of $q$-quark vanishes.
