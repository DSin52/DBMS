Title: Moduli Space Cohomology and Wavefunctions in 3D Quantum Gravity

Authors: R. Brooks

Comments: 3 pages, CTP-2363, LaTeX

Wavefunctionals of three dimensional quantum gravity are extracted from the3D field theoretic analogs of the four dimensional Donaldson polynomials. Ourprocedure is generalizable to four and other dimensions. This is a summary of atalk presented at the Seventh Marcel Grossmann Meeting on General Relativity,Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA, July 24 - 30, 1994
