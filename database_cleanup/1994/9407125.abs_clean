We construct the gauge invariant fermion correlator in the Schwinger model onthe torus. At zero temperature, this correlator falls off with a rate given bythe Coulomb energy of an infinitely heavy charge. At high temperature, thescreening mass approaches $\pi T/2$, and this in the presence of a mass gap.The fractional Matsubara frequency arises from the action of a pair of inducedmerons at high temperature that are localized over a range on the order of themeson Compton wavelength $1/m=\sqrt{\pi}/g$. We discuss the quenchedapproximation in this model, and comment on the possible relevance of some ofthese results to higher dimensions.
