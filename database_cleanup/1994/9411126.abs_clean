Title: On quantum flag algebras

Comments: 4 pages; AMS-TeX

Let g be a semisimple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field k ofcharacteristic 0. Let V be a simple finite-dimensional g-module and let y\in Vbe a highest weight vector. It is a classical result of B. Kostant that thealgebra of functions on the closure of the orbit of y under the simplyconnected group which corresponds to g is quadratic (i.e. the closuree of theorbit is a quadratic cone). In the present paper we extend this result ofKostant to the case of the quantized universal enveloping algebra U_q(g). Theresult uses certain information about spectrum of braiding operators for U_q(g)due to Reshetikhin and Drinfeld.
