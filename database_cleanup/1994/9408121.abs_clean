We discuss duality and mirror symmetry phenomena of Landau-Ginzburg orbifoldsconsidering their elliptic genera. Under the duality (or mirror) transformperformed by orbifoldizing the Landau-Ginzburg model via some discrete group ofthe superpotential we observe that the roles of the untwisted and twistedsectors are exchanged. As explicit evidence detailed orbifold data arepresented for $N=2$ minimal models, Arnold's exceptional singularities, $K3$surfaces constructed from Arnold's singularities and Fermat hypersurfaces.
