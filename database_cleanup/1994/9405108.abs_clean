We study a class of subdivision invariant lattice models based on the gaugegroup $Z_{p}$, with particular emphasis on the four dimensional example. Thismodel is based upon the assignment of field variables to both the $1$- and$2$-dimensional simplices of the simplicial complex. The property ofsubdivision invariance is achieved when the coupling parameter is quantized andthe field configurations are restricted to satisfy a type of mod-$p$ flatnesscondition. By explicit computation of the partition function for the manifold$RP^{3} \times S^{1}$, we establish that the theory has a quantum Hilbert spacewhich differs from the classical one.
