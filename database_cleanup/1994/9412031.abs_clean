Let $G$ be a semisimple Lie group, ${\frak g}$ its Lie algebra. For anysymmetric space $M$ over $G$ we construct a new (deformed) multiplication inthe space $A$ of smooth functions on $M$. This multiplication is invariantunder the action of the Drinfeld--Jimbo quantum group $U_h{\frak g}$ and isA\otimes A$. Such a multiplication is unique. Let $M$ be a k\"{a}hleriansymmetric space with the canonical Poisson structure. Then we construct a$U_h{\frak g}$-invariant multiplication in $A$ which depends on two parametersand is a quantization of that structure.
