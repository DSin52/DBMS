Within the setting of algebraic quantum field theory a relation betweenphase-space properties of observables and charged fields is established. Theseproperties are expressed in terms of compactness and nuclearity conditionswhich are the basis for the characterization of theories with physicallyreasonable causal and thermal features. Relevant concepts and results of phasespace analysis in algebraic quantum field theory are reviewed and theunderlying ideas are outlined.
