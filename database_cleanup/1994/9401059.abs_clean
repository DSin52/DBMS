We argue that the spectrum of the QCD Dirac operator near zero virtuality canbe described by random matrix theory. As in the case of classical random matrixensemble (chGOE), the chiral unitary ensemble (chGUE) and the chiral symplecticensemble (chGSE). They correspond to gauge groups $SU(2)$ in the fundamentalrepresentation, $SU(N_c), N_c \ge 3$ in the fundamental representation, andgauge groups for all $N_c$ in the adjoint representation, respectively. Thejoint probability density reproduces Leutwyler-Smilga sum rules.
