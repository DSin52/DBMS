8-24We clarify the algebraic structure of continuous and discrete quasi-exactlysolvable spectral problems by embedding them into the framework of the quantuminverse scattering method. The quasi-exactly solvable hamiltonians in onedimension are identified with traces of quantum monodromy matrices for specificintegrable systems with non-periodic boundary conditions. Applications to theAzbel-Hofstadter problem are outlined.
