IPNO/TH 94-20In the nonrelativistic case we find that whenever the relation $mc^2/e^2<X(\al,g_m)$ is satisfied, where $\al$ is a flux in the units of the fluxquantum, $g_m$ is magnetic moment, and $X(\al,g_m)$ is some function that isnonzero only for $g_m>2$ (note that $g_m=2.00232$ for the electron), then thematter is unstable against formation of the flux $\al$. The result persistsdown to $g_m=2$ provided the Aharonov-Bohm potential is supplemented with ashort range attractive potential. We also show that whenever a bound state ispresent in the spectrum it is always accompanied by a resonance with the energyproportional to the absolute value of the binding energy. is considered.For the Klein-Gordon equation with the Pauli coupling which exists in (2+1)dimensions without any reference to a spin the matter is again unstable for$g_m>2$. The results are obtained by calculating the change of the density ofstates induced by the Aharonov-Bohm potential. The Krein-Friedel formula forthis long-ranged potential is shown to be valid when supplemented with zeta
