Quantum Hall EffectAuthors: M.Eliashvili

It is shown, that a spectrum generating algebras and wave functions for theintegral and fractional quantum Hall effect are related by the non-unitarysimilarity transformation. This transformation corresponds to the introductionof the complex Chern-Simons gauge fields, in terms of which the secondquantized form of FQHE can be developed
