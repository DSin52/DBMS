We investigate the $W_{\infty}$ algebra in the integer quantum Hall effects.Defining the simplest vacuum, the Dirac sea, we evaluate the central extensionfor this algebra. A new algebra which contains the central extension is calledthe $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra. We show that this $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra is anorigin of the Kac-Moody algebra which determines the behavior of edge states ofthe system. We discuss the relation between the $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra and theincompressibility of the integer quantum Hall system.
