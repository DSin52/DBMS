The moduli associated with boundaries in a Riemann surface are parametrizedby the positions and strengths of electric charges. This suggests a method forsumming over orientable Riemann surfaces with Dirichlet boundary conditions onthe embedding coordinates. A light-cone parameterization of such boundaries isalso discussed.
