The high-temperature expansion for closed superstring one-loop free energy isstudied. The Laurent series representation is obtained and its sum isanalytically continued in order to investigate the nature of the critical(Hagedorn) temperature. It is found that beyond this critical temperature thestatistical sum contribution of the free energy is finite but has an imaginarypart, signalling a possible metastability of the system.
