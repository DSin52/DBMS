The SL(2,R)/U(1) gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model is an exact conformal fieldtheory describing a black hole in two-dimensional space-time. The free fieldapproach of Bershadsky and Kutasov is a suitable formulation of this CFT inorder to compute physically interesting quantities of this black hole. We findthe space-time interpretation of this model for k=9/4 and show that itreproduces the metric and the dilaton found by Dijkgraaf, E. Verlinde andH. Verlinde in the mini-superspace approximation. We compute the two- andthree-point functions of tachyons interacting in the black hole background andanalyse in detail the form of the four-point tachyon scattering amplitude. Wediscuss the connection to the c=1 matrix model and the deformed matrix model ofJevicki and Yoneya.
