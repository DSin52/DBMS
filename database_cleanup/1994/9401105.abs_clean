We show that bosonization in two dimensions can be derived as a special caseof the duality transformations that have recently been used to good effect instring theory. This allows the construction of the bosonic counterpart of anyfermionic theory simply by `following your nose' using the standard dualitytransformation rules. We work through the bosonization of the Dirac fermion,the massive and massless Thirring models, and a fermion on a cylindricalspacetime as illustrative examples.
