We introduce the linear connection in the noncommutative geometry model ofthe product of continuous manifold and the discrete space of two points. Wediscuss its metric properties, define the metric connection and calculate thecurvature. We define also the Ricci tensor and the scalar curvature. We findthat the latter differs from the standard scalar curvature of the manifold by aterm, which might be interpreted as the cosmological constant and apart fromthat we find no other dynamical fields in the model. Finally we discuss anexample solution of flat linear connection, with the nontrivial scalingdependence of the metric tensor on the discrete variable. We interpret theobtained solution as confirmed by the Standard Model, with the scaling factorcorresponding to the Weinberg angle.
