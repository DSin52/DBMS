( We present complete solutions of $K$-matrix for the quantumMikhailov-Shabat model. It has been known that there are three diagonalsolutions with no free parameters, one being trivial identity solution, theothers non-trivial. The most general solutions which we found consist of threefamilies corresponding to each diagonal solutions. One family of solutionsdepends on two arbitrary parameters. If one of the parameters vanishes, theother must also vanish so that the solutions reduces to trivial identitysolution. The other two families for each non-trivial diagonal solutions haveonly one arbitrary parameter.)
