We perform a spectral decomposition of the dynamical correlation function ofthe spin $1/2$ XXZ model into an infinite sum of products of form factors.Beneath the four-particle threshold in momentum space the only non-zerocontributions to this sum are the two-particle term and the trivial vacuumterm. We calculate the two-particle term by making use of the integralexpressions for form factors provided recently by the Kyoto school. We evaluatethe necessary integrals by expanding to twelfth order in $q$. We show plots of$S(w,k)$, for $k=0$ and $\pi$ at various values of the anisotropy parameter,and for fixed anisotropy at various $k$ around $0$ and $\pi$.
