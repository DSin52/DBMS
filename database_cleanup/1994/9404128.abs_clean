442-455We analyze the analytic continuation of the formally divergent one-loopamplitude for scattering of the graviton multiplet in the Type II Superstring.In particular we obtain explicit double and single dispersion relations,formulas for all the successive branch cuts extending out to plus infinity, aswell as for the decay rate of a massive string state of arbitrary mass 2N intotwo string states of lower mass. We compare our results with the box diagram ina superposition of $\phi^3$-like field theories. The stringy effects are tracedto a convergence problem in this superposition.
