In the spirit of Non-commutative differential calculus on discrete group, weconstruct a toy model of spontaneous $CP$ violation (SCPV). Our model isdifferent from the well-known Weinberg-Branco model although it involves threeHiggs doublets and preserve neutral flavor current conservation (NFC) afterusing the $Z_2 \ti Z_2 \ti Z_2$ discrete symmetry and imposing some constraintson Yukawa couplings.
