We show that the partition function for a scalar field in a static spacetimebackground can be expressed as a functional integral in the correspondingoptical space, and point out that the difference between this and thefunctional integral in the original metric is a Liouville type action. Ageneral formula for the free energy is derived in the high temperatureapproximation and applied to various cases. In particular we find thatthermodynamics in the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om space has extrasingularities that make it ill-defined.
