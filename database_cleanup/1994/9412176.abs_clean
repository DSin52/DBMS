158-191This review contains a summary of work by J.-L. Gervais and the author on theoperator approach to 2d gravity. Special emphasis is placed on the constructionof local observables -the Liouville exponentials and the Liouville field itselfgroup structure arising from the presence of two screening charges is discussedand the generalized algebra and field operators are derived. In the last part,we show that our construction gives rise to a natural definition of a quantumtau function, which is a noncommutative version of the classicalgroup-theoretic representation of the Liouville fields by Leznov and Saveliev.
