We discuss a realization of the bosonic string as a noncritical $W_3$-string.The relevant noncritical $W_3$-string is characterized by a Liouville sectorwhich is restricted to a (non-unitary) $(3,2)$ $W_3$ minimal model with centralcharge contribution $c_l = - 2$. Furthermore, the matter sector of this$W_3$-string contains $26$ free scalars which realize a critical bosonicstring. The BRST operator for this $W_3$-string can be written as the sum ofa way that the scalars which realize the bosonic string appear only in $Q_0$while the central charge contribution of the fields present in $Q_1$ equalszero. We argue that, in the simplest case that the Liouville sector is given bythe identity operator only, the $Q_1$-cohomology is given by a particular(non-unitary) $(3,2)$ Virasoro minimal model at $c=0$.
