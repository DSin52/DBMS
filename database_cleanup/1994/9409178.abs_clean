Yang-Baxterising a braid group representation associated with multideformedversion of $GL_{q}(N)$ quantum group and taking the corresponding $q\rightarrow1$ limit, we obtain a rational $R$-matrix which depends on $\left ( 1+ {N(N-1)\over 2} \right ) $ number of deformation parameters. By using such rational$R$-matrix subsequently we construct a multiparameter dependent extension of$Y(gl_N)$ Yangian algebra and find that this extended algebra leads to amodification of usual asymptotic condition on monodromy matrix $T(\lambda )$,at $ \lambda \rightarrow \infty $ limit. Moreover, it turns out that, thereexists a nonlinear realisation of this extended algebra through the generatorsof original $Y(gl_N)$ algebra.  Such realisation interestingly provides a novel$\left ( 1 + { N(N-1) \over 2 } \right ) $ number of deformation parameterdependent coproduct for standard $Y(gl_N)$ algebra.
