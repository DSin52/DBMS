Treating the QCD Wilson loop as amplitude for the propagation of the firstquantized particle we develop the second quantization of the same propagation.The operator of the particle position $\hat{\cal X}_{\mu}$ (the endpoint of the"open string") is introduced as a limit of the large $N$ Hermitean matrix. Wethen derive the set of equations for the expectation values of the vertexoperators $\VEV{ V(k_1)\dots V(k_n)} $. The remarkable property of theseequations is that they can be expanded at small momenta (less than the QCD massscale), and solved for expansion coefficients. This provides the relations formultiple commutators of position operator, which can be used to construct thisoperator. We employ the noncommutative probability theory and find theexpansion of the operator $\hat{\cal X}_\mu $ in terms of products of creationoperators $ a_\mu^{\dagger}$. In general, there are some free parameters leftin this expansion. In two dimensions we fix parameters uniquely from thesymplectic invariance. The Fock space of our theory is much smaller than thatof perturbative QCD, where the creation and annihilation operators werelabelled by continuous momenta. In our case this is a space generated by $d =4$ creation operators. The corresponding states are given by all sentences madeof the four letter words. We discuss the implication of this construction forthe mass spectra of mesons and glueballs.
