We advocate a new approach to the study of unitary matrix models in externalfields which emphasizes their relationship to Generalized Kontsevich Models(GKM) with non-polynomial potentials. For example, we show that the partitionfunction of the Brezin-Gross-Witten Model (BGWM), which is defined as anintegral over unitary $N\times N$ matrices, $\int [dU] e^{\rm{Tr}(J^\dagger U +JU^\dagger)}$, can also be considered as a GKM with potential ${\cal V}(X) =\frac{1}{X}$. Moreover, it can be interpreted as the generating functional forcorrelators in the Penner model. The strong and weak coupling phases of theBGWM are identified with the "character" (weak coupling) and "Kontsevich"(strong coupling) phases of the GKM, respectively. This sort of GKM deservesclassification as $p=-2$ one (i.e. $c=28$ or $c=-2$) when in the Kontsevichphase. This approach allows us to further identify theHarish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber (IZ) integral with a peculiar GKM, which arisesin the study of $c=1$ theory and, further, with a conventional 2-matrix modelwhich is rewritten in Miwa coordinates. Inspired by the considered unitarymatrix models, some further extensions of the GKM treatment which are inspiredby the unitary matrix models which we have considered are also developed. Inparticular, as a by-product, a new simple method of fixing the Ward identitiesfor matrix models in an external field is presented.
