Title: Generalized Runge-Lenz Vector in Taub-Nut Spinning Space

Comments: 9 pages

Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B339 (1994) 28-34

The generalized Killing equations and the symmetries of Taub-NUT spinningspace are investigated. For spinless particles the Runge-Lenz vector defines aconstant of motion directly, whereas for spinning particles it now requires anon-trivial contribution from spin. The generalized Runge-Lenz vector forspinning Taub-NUT space is completely evaluated.
