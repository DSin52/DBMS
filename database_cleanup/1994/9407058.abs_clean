We study the non-critical string field theory with non-orientable stringinteractions by using the transfer matrix formalism in the dynamicaltriangulation. For any value of $c$ (total central charge of matter), we haveconstructed the non-orientable string field theory at the discrete level. Twocoupling constants $G$ and $\Gx$ which satisfy the relation $(\Gx)^3 = G \Gx$are introduced, where $G$ counts the number of untwisted handles of theworld-sheet while $\Gx$ counts the number of cross-caps. In the case of thenon-critical string theory which correspond to multicritical one matrix models(including $c=0$ case), we have succeeded in taking the continuum limit, andthen have obtained the continuous string field theory.
