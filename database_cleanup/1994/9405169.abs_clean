The relation between the spin and the mass of an infinite number of particlesin a $q$-deformed dual string theory is studied. For the deformation parameter$q$ a root of unity, in addition to the relation of such values of $q$ with therational conformal field theory, the Fock space of each oscillator mode in theFubini-Veneziano operator formulation becomes truncated. Thus, based on generalphysical grounds, the resulting spin-(mass)$^2$ relation is expected to bebelow the usual linear trajectory. For such specific values of $q$, we findthat the linear Regge trajectory turns into a square-root trajectory as themass increases.
