Title: Quantum Integrals of Motion for the Heisenberg Spin Chain

Authors: Marek P. Grabowski and Pierre Mathieu

Comments: 10 pages Report #

An explicit expression for all the quantum integrals of motion for theisotropic Heisenberg $s=1/2$ spin chain is presented.The conserved quantities are expressed in terms of a sum over simplepolynomials in spin variables. This construction is direct and independent ofthe transfer matrix formalism. Continuum limits of these integrals in bothferrromagnetic and antiferromagnetic sectors are briefly discussed.
