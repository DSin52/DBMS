Title: Quantum inconsistency of W3-gravity models associated with magical

Jordan algebrasAuthors: S.A. Lyakhovich and A.A. Sharapov

Comments: LaTeX, 4 pages, no figures

It is shown that the Sugawara-type construction for W3-algebra associatedwith the four magical Jordan algebras leads to the anomalous theory ofW3-gravity.
