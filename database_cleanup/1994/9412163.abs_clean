Rigidly superconformal sigma models in higher than two dimensions areconstructed. These models rely on the existence of conformal Killing spinors onthe $p+1$ dimensional worldvolume $(p\le 5)$, and homothetic conformal Killingvectors in the $d$--dimensional target space. In the bosonic case, substitutinginto the action a particular form of the target space metric admitting suchKilling vectors, we obtain an action with manifest worldvolume conformalsymmetry, which describes the coupling of $d-1$ scalars to a conformally flatmetric on the worldvolume. We also construct gauged sigma models withworldvolume conformal supersymmetry. The models considered here aregeneralizations of the singleton actions on $S^p\times S^1$, constructedsometime ago by Nicolai and these authors.
