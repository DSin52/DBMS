This paper reemphasizes the ubiquitous role of moduli spaces of algebraicthe space of an operad with multiplication is a homotopy G- (i.e., homotopygraded Poisson) algebra; (2) the singular cochain complex is naturally anoperad; (3) the operad of decorated moduli spaces acts naturally on the de Rhamcomplex $\Omega^\bullet X$ of a K\"{a}hler manifold $X$, thereby yielding themost general type of homotopy G-algebra structure on $\Omega^\bullet X$. One ofthe reasons to put this operadic nonsense on the physics bulletin board is thatwe use a typical construction of supersymmetric sigma-model, the constructionof Gromov-Witten invariants in Kontsevich's version.
