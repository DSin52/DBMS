We compute the beta function at one loop for Yang-Mills theory using asregulator the combination of higher covariant derivatives and Pauli-Villarsdeterminants proposed by Faddeev and Slavnov. This regularization prescriptionhas the appealing feature that it is manifestly gauge invariant and essentiallyfour-dimensional. It happens however that the one-loop coefficient in the betafunction that it yields is not $-11/3,$ as it should be, but $-23/6.$ Thedifference is due to unphysical logarithmic radiative corrections generated bythe Pauli-Villars determinants on which the regularization method is based.This no-go result discards the prescription as a viable gauge invariantregularization, thus solving a long-standing open question in the literature.We also observe that the prescription can be modified so as to not generateunphysical logarithmic corrections, but at the expense of losing manifest gaugeinvariance.
