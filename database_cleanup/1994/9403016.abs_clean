Usually quantum chains with quantum group symmetry are associated withrepresentations of quantized universal algebras $U_q(g) $ . Here we propose amethod for constructing quantum chains with $C_q(G)$ global symmetry , where$C_q(G)$ is the algebra of functions on the quantum group. In particular wewill construct a quantum chain with $GL_q(2)$ symmetry which interpolatesbetween two classical Ising chains.It is shown that the Hamiltonian of thischain satisfies in the generalised braid group algebra.
