The geodesic motion of pseudo-classical spinning particles in the EuclideanTaub-NUT space is analysed. The generalized Killing equations for spinningspace are investigated and the constants of motion are derived in terms of thesolutions of these equations. A simple exact solution, corresponding totrajectories lying on a cone, is given.
