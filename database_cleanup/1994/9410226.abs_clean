Symplectic modular invariance of the bosonic string partition function hasbeen verified at genus 2 and 3 using the period matrix coordinatization ofmoduli space. A calculation of the transformation of the holomorphic part ofthe differential volume element shows that an extra phase arises together withthe factor associated with a specific modular weight; the phase is cancelled inthe transformation of the entire volume element including the complexconjugate. An argument is given for modular invariance of the reggeon measureat genus twelve.
