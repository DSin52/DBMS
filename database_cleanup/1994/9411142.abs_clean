We discuss the equivalence between the path integral representations of spindynamics for anti-commuting (Grassmann) and commuting variables and establish abosonization dictionary for both generators of spin and single fermionoperators. The content of this construction in terms of the representations ofthe spin algebra is discussed in the path integral setting. Finally it is shownhow a `free field realization' (Dyson mapping) can be constructed in the pathintegral.
