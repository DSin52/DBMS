The structure of equivariant cohomology in non-abelian localization formulasand topological field theories is discussed. Equivariance is formulated interms of a nilpotent BRST symmetry, and another nilpotent operator whichrestricts the BRST cohomology onto the equivariant, or basic sector. Asuperfield formulation is presented and connections to reducible (BFV)quantization of topological Yang-Mills theory are discussed.
