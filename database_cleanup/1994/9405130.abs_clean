We investigate the Ward identities of the $\W_{\infty}$ symmetry in thesuper-Liouville theory coupled to the super-conformal matter of central charge${\hat c}_M = 1-2(p-q)^2 /pq$. The theory is classified into two chiralities.For the positive chirality, all gravitationally dressed scaling operators aregenerated from the $q-1$ gravitational primaries by acting one of the ringgenerators in the R-sector on them repeatedly. After fixing the normalizationsof the dressed scaling operators, we find that the Ward identities areexpressed in the form of the {\it usual} $\W_q$ algebra constraints as in the1-k})$, where the equations for even and odd $n$ come from the currents in theNS- and the R-sector respectively. The non-linear terms come from the anomalouscontributions at the boundaries of moduli space. The negative chirality isdefined by interchanging the roles of $p$ and $q$. Then we get the $\W_p $algebra constraints.
