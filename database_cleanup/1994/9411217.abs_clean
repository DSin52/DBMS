Title: Classical Solutions of 2D String Theory in any Curved Spacetime

Comments: Latex, 31 pages, including 6 figures. Lecture at the "Journe'e

Cosmologique", Observatoire de Paris, May 94The complete set of solutions of two dimensional classical string theory areconstructed for any curved spacetime. They describe folded strings moving incurved spacetime. Surprizing stringy behavior becomes evident at singularitiessuch as black holes.The solutions are given in the form ofa map from the worldsheet to target spacetime, where the world sheet has to be divided into latticeto a transfer matrix connects these maps into a single continuous map. This``transfer matrix'' encodes the properties of the world sheet lattice as wellas the geometry of spacetime. The solutions are completely classified by theirbehavior in the asymptotically flat region of spacetime where they reduce, asboundary conditions, to the folded string solutions that have been known for 19years.
