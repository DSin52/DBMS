We formulate sigma-model duality transformations in terms of spin connection.This allows to investigate the symmetry of the string action including higherorder $\alpha'$ corrections. An important feature of the new dualitytransformations is a simple homogeneous transformation rule of the spinconnection (with torsion) and specifically adjusted transformation of theYang-Mills field. We have found that under certain conditions this duality is asymmetry of the full effective string action in the target space, free of$\alpha'$ corrections. We demonstrate how the exact duality generates newfundamental string solutions from supersymmetric string waves.
