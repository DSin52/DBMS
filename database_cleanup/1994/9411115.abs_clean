The $\kappa$-deformed $D=4$ Poincar{\'e} superalgebra written in Hopfsuperalgebra form is transformed to the basis with classical Lorentz subalgebragenerators. We show that in such a basis the $\kappa$-deformed $D=4$ Poincaresuperalgebra can be written as graded bicrossproduct. We show that the$\kappa$-deformed $D=4$ superalgebra acts covariantly on $\kappa$-deformedchiral superspace.
