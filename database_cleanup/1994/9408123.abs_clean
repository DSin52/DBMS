We show how Wigner's little group approach to the representation theory ofPoincar\'e group may be generalized to the case of $\kappa$-deformedPoincar\'e group. We also derive the deformed Lorentz transformations ofenergy and momentum. We find that if the $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'e group isadopted as the fundamental symmetry of nature, it results in deviations frompredictions of the Poincar\'e symmetry at large energies, which may beexperimentally observable.
