We calculate the B-model on the mirror pair of $X_{2N-2}(2,2,\cdots,2,1,1)$ ,which is an $(N-2)$-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold and has two marginaloperators i.e. $h^{1,1}(X_{2N-2}(2,2,\cdots,2,1,1))=2$. In \cite{nagandjin} wehave discussed about mirror symmetry on $X_N(1,1,\cdots,1)$ and its mirrorpair. However, $X_N(1,1,\cdots,1)$ had only one moduli. In this paper we extendits methods to the case with a few moduli using toric geometry.
