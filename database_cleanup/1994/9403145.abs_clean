Title: Hard Thermal Loops, Chern-Simons Theory and the Quark-Gluon Plasma

Authors: V.P.Nair

Comments: 8 pages, October, 1993. (Plain TeX)

The generating functional for hard thermal loops in QCD is important insetting up a resummed perturbation theory. I review how this functional isrelated to the eikonal for a Chern-Simons theory, and using an auxiliary field,to the gauged WZNW-action. The induced current due to hard thermal loops,properly incorporating damping effects, is also briefly discussed.
