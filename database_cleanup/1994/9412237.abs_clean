changes; 13 pages, TeX (with phyzzx macros)A generalization of the quantum inverse scattering method is proposedreplacing the quantum group $RLL$ commutation relations of Lax operators byreflection equation type $RLRL$ commutation relations. Under some naturalassumptions the most general algebra of this type allowing to construct theneccessary integrals of motion is found. It serves to describe Lax operatorswith completely non-ultralocal commutation relations. An example of this newformalism is an integrable model on monodromies of flat connections on aRiemann surface which is related to the XXZ quantum spin chain.
