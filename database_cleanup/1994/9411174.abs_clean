The connection between space-time covariant representations (obtained byinducing from the Lorentz group) and irreducible unitary representations(induced from Wigner's little group) of the Poincar\'{e} group is re-examinedin the massless case. In the situation relevant to physics, it is found thatthese are related by Marsden-Weinstein reduction with respect to a gauge group.An analogous phenomenon is observed for classical massless relativisticparticles. This symplectic reduction procedure can be (`second') quantizedusing a generalization of the Rieffel induction technique in operator algebratheory, which is carried through in detail for electro- magnetism. Startingfrom the so-called Fermi representation of the field algebra generated by thefree abelian gauge field, we construct a new (`rigged') sesquilinear form onthe representation space, which is positive semi-definite, and given in termsof a Gaussian weak distribution (promeasure) on the gauge group (taken to be aHilbert Lie group). This eventually constructs the algebra of observables ofquantum electro- magnetism (directly in its vacuum representation) as arepresentation of the so-called algebra of weak observables induced by thetrivial representation of the gauge group.
