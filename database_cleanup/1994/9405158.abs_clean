Using a simple identity between various partial derivatives of the energy ofthe vector model in 0+0 dimensions, we derive explicit results for thecoefficients of the large N expansion of the model. These coefficients arefunctions in a variable $\rho^2$, which is the expectation value of the twopoint function in the limit $N=\infty$. These functions are analytic and haveonly one (multiple) pole in $\rho^2$. We show to all orders that theseexpressions obey a given general formula. Using this formula it is possible toderive the double scaling limit in an alternative way. All the results obtainedfor the double scaling limit agree with earlier calculations.
