Chern-Simons gauge theory is formulated on three dimensional $Z_2$ orbifolds.The locus of singular points on a given orbifold is equivalent to a link ofWilson lines. This allows one to reduce any correlation function on orbifoldsto a sum of more complicated correlation functions in the simpler theory onmanifolds. Chern-Simons theory on manifolds is known to be related to 2D CFT onclosed string surfaces; here I show that the theory on orbifolds is related to2D CFT of unoriented closed and open string models, i.e. to worldsheet orbifoldmodels. In particular, the boundary components of the worldsheet correspond tothe components of the singular locus in the 3D orbifold. This correspondenceleads to a simple identification of the open string spectra, including theirChan-Paton degeneration, in terms of fusing Wilson lines in the correspondingChern-Simons theory. The correspondence is studied in detail, and some exactlysolvable examples are presented. Some of these examples indicate that it isnatural to think of the orbifold group $Z_2$ as a part of the gauge group ofthe Chern-Simons theory, thus generalizing the standard definition of gaugetheories.
