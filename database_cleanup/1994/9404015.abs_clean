We obtain both topological as well as nontopological self-dual charged vortexsolutions of finite energy per unit length in a generalized abelian Higgs modelin $3+1$ dimensions. In this model the Bogomol'nyi bound on the energy per unitlength is obtained as a linear combination of the magnetic flux and theelectric charge per unit length.
