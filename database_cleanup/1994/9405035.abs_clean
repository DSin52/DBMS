Title: Enumeration of rational curves via torus actions

Comments: several errors in formulas are corrected

This paper contains an attempt to formulate rigorously and to checkpredictions in enumerative geometry of curves following from Mirror Symmetry.The main tool is a new notion of stable map. We give an outline of acontsruction of Gromov-Witten invariants for all algebraic projective or closedsymplectic manifolds. Mirror Symmetry in the basic example of rational curveson a quintic 3-folds is reduced to certain complicated but explicit identity.problems to questions concerning Chern classes on spaces of curves on theambient projective space, 2) using Bott's residue formula we pass to the spaceof (degenerate) curves invariant under the action of the group of diagonalmatrices, 3) we get a sum over trees and evaluate it using the technique ofFeynman diagrams. Our computation scheme gives ``closed'' formulas forgenerating functions in topological sigma-model for a wide class of manifolds,covering many Calabi-Yau and Fano varieties.
