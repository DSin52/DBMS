We describe, in some detail, a number of different Coulomb gas formulationsof $N=2$ superconformal coset models. We also give the mappings between theseformulations. The ultimate purpose of this is to show how the Landau-Ginzburgstructure of these models can be used to extract the $W$-generators, and toshow how the computation of the elliptic genus can be refined so as to extractvery detailed information about the characters of component parts of the model.
