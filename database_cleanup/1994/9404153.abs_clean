This paper is part of the lecture given at the TH Division of CERN anddevoted to the CXXV anniversary of the birthday of Elie Cartan (1869-1951). Itis shown how the methods of differential geometry, due to E. Cartan, wereapplied to the construction of the supersymmetry transformation law and to theactions for Goldstone fermions and supergravity.
