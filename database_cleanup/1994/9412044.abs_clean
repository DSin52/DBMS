Title: Folded Strings

Comments: Latex, 17 pages including 6 figures Lecture at the Gursey Memorial

Conference I, Strings and Symmetries, June 94Recent progress on the complete set of solutions of two dimensional classicalstring theory in any curved spacetime is reviewed. When the curvature is smooththe string solutions are deformed folded string solutions as compared to flatspacetime folded strings that were known for 19 years. However, surprizing newstringy behavior becomes evident at singularities such as black holes. Theglobal properties of these solutions require that the ``bare singularityregion"of the black hole be included along with the usual black hole spacetime.The mathematical structure needed to describe the solutions include a recursionrelation that is analogous to the transfer matrix of lattice theories. Thisencodes lattice properties on the worldsheet on the one hand and the geometryof spacetime on the other hand. A case is made for the presence of foldedstrings in the quantum theory of non-critical strings for $d\geq 2$.
