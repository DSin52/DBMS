Some general properties of the relativistic $p$-dimensional surface imbeddedinto $D$-dimensional spacetime and its reduction to the sim\-plest case of thequadratic Lagrangian (the linearized model) are considered. The solutions ofthe equations of motion of the linearized model for the $p$-brane witharbitrary topology and massless eigenstates, as well as with critical dimensionafter quantization are presented. Some generalizations for the supermembraneare discussed.
