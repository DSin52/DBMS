We derive a set of recursion formulae to construct singular vectors for the$N=2$ (untwisted) algebra, by using the approach of Bauer, di Francesco,Itzykson and Zuber. Applying these formulae, we obtain explicit expressions forthe charged singular vectors and for a class of uncharged singular vectors.
