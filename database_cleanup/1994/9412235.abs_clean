A string action is considered in four spacetime dimensions which is obtainedby dimensionally reducing the ten dimensional effective action. The equationsof motion admit string like solutions. The symmetry properties of the fourdimensional action is discussed. It is shown that new background configurationscan be generated by implementing suitable $O(d,d)$ transformations.
