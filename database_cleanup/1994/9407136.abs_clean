Title: Strings and Loops in Event Symmetric Space-Time

Open and Closed super-string field theories are constructed in anevent-symmetric target space. The partition functions of Statistical andQuantum models are constructed in terms of invariants defined on Lie-algebrarepresentations. An attractive feature of the closed string models is theelegant unification of the space-time symmetries with the gauge symmetries.
