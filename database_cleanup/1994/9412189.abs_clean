First, the geometry of themost general stationary black hole in four dimensions is described and someclassical quantities are defined. Then, a derivation of the spectrum of theradiation emitted during the evaporation is presented. In section four, a twodimensional model which has black hole solutions is introduced, the so-calledCGHS model. These two dimensional black holes are found to evaporate. Unlikethe four dimensional case, the evaporation process can be studied analyticallyas long as the mass of the black hole is well above the two dimensional analogof the Planck mass. Finally, some proposals for resolving the so-calledinformation paradox are reviewed and it is concluded that none of them is fullysatisfactory.
