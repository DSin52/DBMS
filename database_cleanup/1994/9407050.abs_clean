Authors: M. Kibler

Comments: 10 pages, Tex, LYCEN 9338

Some consequences of a $qp$-quantization of a point group invariant developedin the enveloping algebra of $SU(2)$ are examined in the present note. A set ofopen problems concerning such invariants in the $U_{qp}(u(2))$ quantum algebrapicture is briefly discussed.
