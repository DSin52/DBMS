We extend the concept of conjugate vertex operators, first introduced byDotsenko in the case of the bosonization of the $su(2)$ conformal field theory,to the bosonization of the dynamical vertex operators (type II in theclassification of the Kyoto school) of the higher spin XXZ model. We show thatthe introduction of the conjugate vertex operators leads to simpler expressionsfor the N-point matrix elements of the dynamical vertex operators, that is,without redundant Jackson integrals that arise from the insertion of screeningcharges. In particular, the two-point matrix element can be represented withoutany integral.
