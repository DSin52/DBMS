The edge states of a sample displaying the quantum Hall effect (QHE) can bedescribed by a 1+1 dimensional (conformal) field theory of $d$ massless scalarfields taking values on a $d$-dimensional torus. It is known from the work ofNaculich, Frohlich et al.\@ and others that the requirement of chirality ofcurrents in this \underline{scalar} field theory implies the Schwinger anomalyin the presence of an electric field, the anomaly coefficient being related ina specific way to Hall conducvivity. The latter can take only certainrestricted values with odd denominators if the theory admits fermionic states.We show that the duality symmetry under the $O(d,d;{\bf Z})$ group of the freetheory transforms the Hall conductivity in a well-defined way and relatesinteger and fractional QHE's. This means, in particular, that the edge spectrafor dually related Hall conductivities are identical, a prediction which may beexperimentally testable. We also show that Haldane's hierarchy as well ascertain of Jain's fractions can be reproduced from the Laughlin fractions usingthe duality transformations. We thus find a framework for a unified descriptionof the QHE's occurring at different fractions. We also give a derivation of thewave functions for fractions in Haldane's hierarchy.
