We review the Batalin-Tyutin approach of quantising second class systemswhich consists in enlarging the phase space to convert such systems into firstclass. The quantisation of first class systems, it may be mentioned, is alreadywell founded. We show how the usual analysis of Batalin-Tyutin may begeneralised, particularly if one is dealing with nonabelian theories. In orderto gain a deeper insight into the formalism we have considered two specificexamples of second class theories-- the massive Maxwell theory (Proca model)and its nonabelian extension. The first class constraints and the involutiveHamiltonian are explicitly constructed. The connection of our Hamiltonianapproach with the usual Lagrangian formalism is elucidated. For the Proca modelwe reveal the importance of a boundary term which plays a significant role inestablishing an exact identification of the extra fields in the Batalin-Tyutinapproach with the St\"uckelberg scalar. Some comments are also made concerningthe corresponding identification in the nonabelian example.
