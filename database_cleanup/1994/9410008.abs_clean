Title: Black holes and exact solutions in string theory

Authors: A.A. Tseytlin

Comments: 14 p., harvmac, Imperial/TP/93-94/59

We review some recent results about exact classical solutions in stringtheory. In particular, we consider four dimensional extremal electric blackholes which are related via dimensional reduction to the exact five dimensionalfundamental string solutions. We also comment on the issue of \a' correctionsto non-extremal black holes. (To appear in Proceedings of the Conference onCurrent Topics in Astrofundamental Physics, September 1994, Erice)
