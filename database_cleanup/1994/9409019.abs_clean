We investigate (1+1)-dimensional $\phi^4$ field theory in the symmetric andbroken phases using discrete light-front quantization. We calculate theperturbative solution of the zero-mode constraint equation for both thesymmetric and broken phases and show that standard renormalization of thetheory yields finite results. We study the perturbative zero-mode contributionto two diagrams and show that the light-front formulation gives the same resultas the equal-time formulation. In the broken phase of the theory, we obtain thenonperturbative solutions of the constraint equation and confirm our previousspeculation that the critical coupling is logarithmically divergent. We discussthe renormalization of this divergence but are not able to find a satisfactorynonperturbative technique. Finally we investigate properties that areinsensitive to this divergence, calculate the critical exponent of the theory,and find agreement with mean field theory as expected.
