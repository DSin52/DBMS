We show that the Classical Constraint Algebra of a Parametrized RelativisticGauge System induces a natural structure of Conformal Foliation on aTransversal Gauge. Using the theory of Conformal Foliations, we provide anatural Factor Ordering for the Quantum Operators associated to the CanonicalQuantization of such Gauge System.
