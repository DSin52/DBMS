A large class of non-critical string theories with extended worldsheet gaugesymmetry are described by two coupled, gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten Models. Wegive a detailed analysis of the gauge invariant action and in particular thegauge fixing procedure and the resulting BRST symmetries. The results areapplied to the example of ${\cal W}_3$ strings.
