Title: On the classical $\kappa$-particle

Authors: S. Zakrzewski

Comments: 5 pages, latex

The dependence of velocity on momentum for the free massive particle obeyingthe $\kappa $-Poincar\'{e} Poisson symmetry is calculated in terms of intrinsicnon-commuting space-time coordinates and shown to have a monotonic character,with upper limit of velocity equal to 1.
