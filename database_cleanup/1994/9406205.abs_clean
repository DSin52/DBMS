Title: Bicovariant differential calculus on quantum groups from Poisson Lie

structuresComments: 12 pages, Invited talk given by G.E.Arutyunov at the XXX Winter

School of Theoretical Physics in KarpaczThe aim of this lecture is to give a pedagogical explanation of the notion ofa Poisson Lie structure on the external algebra of a Poisson Lie group whichwas introduced in our previous papers. Using this notion as a guide weconstruct quantum external algebras on $SL_q(N)$ with proper (classical)dimension.
