We present a systematic technique to construct solutions to the Yang-Baxterequation which depend not only on a spectral parameter but in addition onfurther continuous parameters. These extra parameters enter the Yang-Baxterequation in a similar way to the spectral parameter but in a non-additive form.We exploit the fact that quantum non-compact algebras such as $U_q(su(1,1))$and type-I quantum superalgebras such as $U_q(gl(1|1))$ and $U_q(gl(2|1))$ areknown to admit non-trivial one-parameter families of infinite-dimensional andfinite dimensional irreps, respectively, even for generic $q$. We develop atechnique for constructing the corresponding spectral-dependent R-matrices. Asexamples we work out the the $R$-matrices for the three quantum algebrasmentioned above in certain representations.
