We study supersymmetric, four-dimensional (4-d), Abelian charged black holes(BH's) arising in (4+n)-d (1 \le n \le 7) Kaluza-Klein (KK) theories. Suchsolutions, which satisfy supersymmetric Killing spinor equations (formallysatisfied for any n) and saturate the corresponding Bogomol'nyi bounds, can beobtained if and only if the isometry group of the internal space is broken downto the U(1)_E \times U(1)_M gauge group; they correspond to dyonic BH's withelectric Q and magnetic P charges associated with {\it different} U(1) factors.The internal metric of such configurations is diagonal with (n-2) internalradii constant, while the remaining two radii (associated with the respectiveelectric and magnetic U(1) gauge fields) and the 4-d part of the metric turnout to be independent of n, i.e., solutions are effectively those ofsupersymmetric 4-d BH's of 6-d KK theory. For Q \ne 0 and P \ne 0, 4-dspace-time has a null singularity, finite temperature (T_H \propto 1 /\sqrt{|QP|}) and zero entropy. Special cases with either Q=0 or P=0 correspondto the supersymmetric 4-d BH's of 5-d KK theory, first derived by Gibbons andPerry, which have a naked singularity and infinite temperature.
