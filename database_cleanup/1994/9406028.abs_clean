We study solutions of the tree level string effective action in the presenceof the tachyon mode.We find that the 2-dim. static black hole is stable againsttachyonic perturbations.For a particular ansatz for the tachyon field we findan exact solution of the equations of motion which exhibits a nakedsingularity.In the case of static fields we find numerically that the fullsystem has a black hole solution,with the tachyon regular at the horizon.
