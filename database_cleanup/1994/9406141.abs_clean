Authors: Costas Efthimiou

Comments: (talk given at the MRST meeting, held at McGill University) Cornell

preprint CLNS 94/1289We review some ideas from a recent construction which introduced the notionof vertex operators and form factors as vacuum expectation values of relatedvertex operators in the space of fields. The vertex operators are constructedexplicitly in radial quantization. These ideas are explained at thefree-fermion point of the sine-Gordon theory.
