The dynamics of massive particles in the collinear high momentum regime isinvestigated. Methods hitherto exploiting large time asymptotic Hamiltonians inthe Dirac picture for the treatment of infrared divergences are adapted to thecollinear asymptotic dynamics. The essential role of time ordering of thedressing operators is brought out.
