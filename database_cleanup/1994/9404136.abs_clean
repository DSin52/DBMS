A model is proposed which can be regarded as a mean field approximation forpure lattice QCD and chiral field. It always possesses a phase transitionbetween a strong coupling phase (where it reduces to a one-plaquette integral)and a non-trivial weak coupling one. For the U(N) gauge group, it is equivalentto some multi-matrix model. This analogy allows for determining possible largeN critical regimes thus generalizing the Gross-Witten phase transition in theone-plaquetee model.
