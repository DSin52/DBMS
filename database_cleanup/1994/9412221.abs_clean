We construct a field theory for anyons in the lowest Landau level startingfrom the $N$-particle description, and discuss the connection to the full fieldtheory of anyons defined using a statistical gauge potential. The theory istransformed to free form, with the fields defined on the circle and satisfyingmodified commutation relations. The Fock space of the anyons is discussed, andthe theory is related to that of edge excitations of an anyon droplet in aharmonic oscillator well.
