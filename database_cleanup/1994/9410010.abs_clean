The set of modular invariants that can be obtained from Galoistransformations is investigated systematically for WZW models. It is shown thata large subset of Galois modular invariants coincides with simple currentinvariants. For algebras of type B and D infinite series of previously unknownexceptional automorphism invariants are found.
