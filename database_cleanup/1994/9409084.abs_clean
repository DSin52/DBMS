Authors: Thomas Heinzl

Comments: 4 pages, Latex; talk presented at QCD 94, Montpellier, France, July

7-13, and at the Fourth International Workshop on Light Cone Quantization andNon- Perturbative Dynamics, Polana Zgorzelisko, Poland, August 15-25, TPR94-24Journal-ref: Nucl.Phys.Proc.Suppl. 39BC (1995) 217-219

We discuss the light-front formulation of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory on a torus.The gauge choice we use allows for an exact and unambiguous solution of Gauss'slaw.
