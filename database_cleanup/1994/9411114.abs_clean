Title: The Effective Action for QCD at High Energies

Authors: Lech Szymanowski

Comments: 6 pages in LATEX ( Talk given at the "Theory of Hadrons and

Light-front QCD" workshop in Zgorzelisko, Poland, 15-25 Aug. 1994 )I discuss the construction of the effective action for QCD suitable for thedescription of high-energy and small momentum transfer diffractive processes.
