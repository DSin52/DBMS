Authors: Michael R. Douglas

Comments: In this version we added comments on the relation to earlier work of

Haan and of Cvitanovic, Lauwers and Scharbach. (We also made minorimprovements to the body of the paper.) (20pp. harvmac, 1 figure)Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B344 (1995) 117-126

We treat the stochastic equation for large N master fields proposed byGreensite and Halpern using a construction of master fields modelled after workof Voiculescu, and show that it contains the same information as the usualfactorized Schwinger-Dyson equations.
