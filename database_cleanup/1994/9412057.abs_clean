I investigate the effects of the Chern-Simons coupling on high-energybehavior in $2+1$ dimensional U(1) gauged $\eta(\phi^\dagger\phi)^3$ theorywith a Chern-Simons term. The effective potential and the $\beta$ function for$\eta$ are calculated to the next-to-leading order of the $1/N$ expansion asfunctions of $\theta$ (the Chern-Simons coupling). For all $\theta$, the theoryis found to be driven to instability region at high momenta. It is brieflydiscussed on radiative corrections to $\theta$.
