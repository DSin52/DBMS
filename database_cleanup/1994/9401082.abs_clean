It is nearly twenty years that there exist computer programs to reduceproducts of Lie algebra irreps. This is a contribution in the field that uses amodern computer language (``C'') in a highly structured and object-orientedway. This gives the benefits of high portability, efficiency, and makes iteasier to include the functions in user programs. Characteristic of this set ofroutines is the {\it all-dynamic} approach for the use of memory, so that thepackage only uses the memory resources as needed.
