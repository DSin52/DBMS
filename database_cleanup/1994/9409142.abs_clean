A formula for the mass-gap of the supersymmetric $\CP^{n-1}$ sigma model ($nMS}}=\sin(\pi\Delta)/(\pi\Delta)$ where $\Delta=1/n$ and $m$ is the mass of thefundamental particle multiplet. This result is obtained by comparing twoexpressions for the free-energy density in the presence of a coupling to aconserved charge; one expression is computed from the exact S-matrix ofK\"oberle and Kurak via the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz and the other iscomputed using conventional perturbation theory. These calculations provide astringent test of the S-matrix, showing that it correctly reproduces theuniversal part of the beta-function and resolving the problem of CDDambiguities.
