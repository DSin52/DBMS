We examine an extension of the ideas of quantum cosmology and, in particular,the proposal of Hartle and Hawking for the boundary conditions of the Universe,to models which incorporate Yang-Mills fields. Inhomogeneous perturbationsabout a homogeneous, isotropic minisuperspace background model are considered,by expanding the Yang-Mills fields in harmonics of the spatial directions whichare taken to be three-spheres. The expansions are made explicit for $SO(N)$gauge fields thereby obtaining formulae compatible with the formalismconventionally used in quantum cosmology. We apply these results to the gaugegroup $SO(3)$ and derive the Lagrangian and the semi-classical wave functionfor this special case.
