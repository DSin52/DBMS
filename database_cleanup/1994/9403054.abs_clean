We derive a condition under which (0,2) linear sigma models possess a``left-moving'' conformal stress tensor in $\bq$ cohomology (i.e. which leavesinvariant the ``right-moving'' ground states) even away from their criticalpoints. At the classical level this enforces quasihomogeneity of thesuperpotential terms. The persistence of this structure at the quantum level onthe worldsheet is obstructed by an anomaly unless the charges andsuperpotential degrees satisfy a condition which is equivalent to the conditionfor the cancellation of the anomaly in a particular ``right-moving'' U(1)R-symmetry.
