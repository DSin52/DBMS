The aim of the present letter is to critically review the stability of theBartnik-McKinnon solutions of the Einstein-Yang-Mills theory. The stabilityquestion was already studied by several authors, but there seems to be someconfusion about the nature and the number of unstable modes. We suggest todistinguish two different kind of instabilities, which we call `gravitational'respectively `sphaleron' instabilities. We claim that the $n^{\rm th}$Bartnik-McKinnon solution has exactly $2n$ unstable modes, $n$ of either type.
