Recently it has been discovered that the W-algebras (orbifold of) WD_n can bedefined even for negative integers n by an analytic continuation of theircoupling constants. In this letter we shall argue that also the algebrasWA_{-n-1} can be defined and are finitely generated. In addition, we show thata surprising connection exists between already known W-algebras, for examplebetween the CP(k)-models and the U(1)-cosets of the generalizedPolyakov-Bershadsky-algebras.
