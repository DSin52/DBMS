Surgery CalculusComments: 29 pages, "\draft" declaration has been removed

stationary phase approximation and a surgery calculus. We give a detaileddescription of the 1-loop approximation formula for Witten's invariant and ofthe technics involved in deriving its exact value through a surgeryconstruction of a manifold. Finally we compare the formulas produced by bothmethods for a 3-dimensional sphere S^3 and a lens space L(p,1).
