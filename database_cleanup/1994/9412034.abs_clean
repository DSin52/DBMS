There exist certain intrinsic relations between the ultraviolet divergentgraphs and the convergent ones at the same loop order in renormalizable quantumfield theories. Whereupon we may establish a new method, the intrinsicregularization method, to regulate those divergent graphs. In this note, wepresent a proposal, the inserter proposal, to the method. The $\phi^4$ theoryand QED at the one loop order are dealt with in some detail. Inserters in thestandard model are given. Some applications to SUSY-models are also made at theone loop order.
