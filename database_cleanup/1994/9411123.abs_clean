Title: Electroweak Parity Breaking by Isospin Deformation and the Copenhagen

VacuumComments: Talk given at the 28th Symposion on the Theory of Elementary

Particles, Wendisch-Rietz, August 30 - September 3, 1994, to apear in theseproceedings, 8 p., LaTeX no special macros or styles neededFrom the global chiral SU(2)*U(1) that appears in the electroweak Left-RightModel in the fundamental representation, a continuous transition to therepresentation of the minimal Standard Model is considered in the Cartansubalgebra of the right-handed sector. The connecting parameter is thesplitting of U(1)_R quantum numbers. It is a deformation parameter, breaksSU(2)_R and parity and is proportional to an isomagnetic field, leading toCopenhagen type vacuum. A simple mapping on the fundamental representation ofSU(2)_q gives the splitting in terms of q.
