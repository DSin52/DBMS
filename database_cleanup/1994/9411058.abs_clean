It is shown that for a large class of non-holonomic quantum mechanicalsystems one can make the computation of BRST charge fully algorithmic. Twocomputer algebra programs written in the language of {\tt REDUCE} aredescribed. They are able to realize the complex calculations needed todetermine the charge for general nonlinear algebras. Some interesting specificsolutions are discussed.
