Title: The Loop Representation in Gauge Theories and Quantum Gravity

Authors: Rodolfo Gambini

Comments: 55 pages, 25 figures.Figures are not included available from the

author upon request.Report IF-FI-91/8We review the application of the loop representation to gauge theories andgeneral relativity. The emphasis lies on exhibiting the loop calculustechniques, and their application to the canonical quantization. We discuss therole that knot theory and loop coordinates play in the determination ofnondegenerate quantum states of the gravitational field.
