It is shown that the heat kernel operator for the Laplace operator on anycovariantly constant curved background, i.e. in symmetric spaces, may bepresented in form of an averaging over the Lie group of isometries with somenontrivial measure. Using this representation the heat kernel diagonal, i.e.the heat kernel in coinciding points is obtained. Related topics concerning thestructure of symmetric spaces and the calculation of the effective action arediscussed.
