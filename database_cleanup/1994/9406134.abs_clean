Mass independent renormalization group functions in massive theories arerelated to normalization properties of the Green functions in the asymptoticregion, where mass effects are neglected. In this special form therenormalization group invariance is restricted to the asymptotic region andconsequently mass effects cannot be recoverd by a integration of therenormalziation group equation. It is shown, that mass independence results inthe limit of a large normalization point, whenever a Callan-Symanzik equationexists and contains the same differential operators as the renormalizationgroup equation.
