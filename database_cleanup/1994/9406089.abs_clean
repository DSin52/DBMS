Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of a free spinning particle in2+1-dimensions or {\it anyon} are established, following closely the analysisof Hanson and Regge. Two viable (and inequivalent) Lagrangians are derived. Itis also argued that one of them is more favourable. In the Hamiltonian analysisnon-triviaal Dirac Brackets of the fundamental variables are computed for boththe models. Important qualitative differences with a recently proposed modelfor anyons are pointed out.
