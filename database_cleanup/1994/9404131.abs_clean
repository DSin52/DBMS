In a recent work it has been shown that the bosonic strings could be embeddedinto a special class of $N=1$ fermionic strings. We argue that thesuperpartners of any physical state in the spectrum of this fermionic string isnon-physical. So, there is no supersymmetry in the space of physical states andthe embedding is, in this sense, ``trivial''. We here propose two differentconstructions as possible candidates of non-trivial embeddings of thenon-critical bosonic strings into some special class of $N=1$ fermionic stringsof which one is the non-critical NSR string. The BRST charge of the $N=1$fermionic strings in both cases decompose as $Q_{N=1} = Q_B + {\tilde Q}$,where $Q_B$ is the BRST charge of the bosonic string.
