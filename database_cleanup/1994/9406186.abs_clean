Title: Differential calculus on q-Minkowski space

Journal-ref: An. Fisica (Monogr.) 2 (1995) 107-130

We wish to report here on a recent approach to the non-commutative calculuson $q$-Minkowski space which is based on the reflection equations with nospectral parameter. These are considered as the expression of the invariance(under the coaction of the $q$-Lorentz group) of the commutation propertieswhich define the different $q$-Minkowski algebras. This approach also allows usto discuss the possible ambiguities in the definition of $q$-Minkowski space${\cal M}_q$ and its differential calculus. The commutation relations among thegenerators of ${\cal M}_q$ (coordinates), ${\cal D}_q$ (derivatives),$\Lambda_q$ (one-forms) and a few invariant (scalar) operators are establishedand compared with earlier results.
