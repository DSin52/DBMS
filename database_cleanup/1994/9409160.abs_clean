Reconsidering the harmonic space description of the self-dual Einsteinequations, we streamline the proof that all self-dual pure gravitational fieldsallow a local description in terms of an unconstrained analytic prepotential inharmonic space. Our formulation yields a simple recipe for constructingself-dual metrics starting from any explicit choice of such prepotential; andwe illustrate the procedure by producing a metric related to the Taub-NUTsolution from the simplest monomial choice of prepotential.
