In these lectures I review classical aspects of the self-dual Chern-Simonssystems which describe charged scalar fields in $2+1$ dimensions coupled to agauge field whose dynamics is provided by a pure Chern-Simons Lagrangian. Theseself-dual models have one realization with nonrelativistic dynamics for thescalar fields, and another with relativistic dynamics for the scalars. In eachmodel, the energy density may be minimized by a Bogomol'nyi bound which issaturated by solutions to a set of first-order self-duality equations. In thenonrelativistic case the self-dual potential is quartic, the system possesses adynamical conformal symmetry, and the self-dual solutions are equivalent to thestatic zero energy solutions of the equations of motion. The nonrelativisticself-duality equations are integrable and all finite charge solutions may befound. In the relativistic case the self-dual potential is sixth order and theself-dual Lagrangian may be embedded in a model with an extended supersymmetry.The self-dual potential has a rich structure of degenerate classical minima,and the vacuum masses generated by the Chern-Simons Higgs mechanism reflect theself-dual nature of the potential.
