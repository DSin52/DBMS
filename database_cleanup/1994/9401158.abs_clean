By boosting the vertex operators of Witten's $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ black hole, weshow that in the region V they lead to the primary fields of $c=1$ mattercoupled to gravity at nonzero cosmological constant, while there is no suchcorrespondence in the region I, showing that Witten's black hole corresponds to$2d$ gravity only in a certain region and in a specific limit. By using thefree field representation , we will show that the stress tensor of $SL(2,R)$gauged by its nilpotent subgroup is equivalent to that of the Liouville theorywith zero cosmological constant.
