(Presented at conference on Fundamental Problems in Physics - UMBC - June1994) It is shown that among the orthogonal sets of EPR (completely entangled)states there is a unique basis (up to equivalence) that is a also a perfectlyresolved set of coherent states with respect to a pair of complementaryobservables. This basis defines a lattice phase space in which quadraticHamiltonians constructed from the observables induce site-to-site hopping atdiscrete time intervals. When recently suggested communicationschemes\cite{BENa} are adapted to the lattice they are greatly enhanced,because the finite Heisenberg group structure allows dynamic generation ofsignal sequences using the quadratic Hamiltonians. We anticipate thepossibility of interferometry by determining the relative phases betweensuccessive signals produced by the simplest Hamiltonians of this type, and weshow that they exhibit a remarkable pattern determined by the number-theoreticLegendre symbol.
