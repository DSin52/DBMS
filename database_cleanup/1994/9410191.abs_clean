We discuss the conformal factor dynamics in $D=6$. Accepting the proposalthat higher-derivative dimensionless terms in the anomaly-induced effectiveaction may be dropped, we obtain a superrenormalizable (like in $D=4$)effective theory for the conformal factor. The one-loop analysis of this theorygives the anomalous scaling dimension for the conformal factor and provides anatural mechanism to solve the cosmological constant problem.
