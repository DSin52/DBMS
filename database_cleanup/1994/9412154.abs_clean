Title: Supersymmetric Analogs of the Gordon-Andrews Identities, and Related TBA

SystemsComments: 20 pages, using harvmac (b)

The Gordon-Andrews identities, which generalize the Rogers-Ramanujan-Schuridentities, provide product and fermionic forms for the characters of theminimal conformal field theories (CFTs) M(2,2k+1). We discuss/conjectureidentities of a similar type, providing two different fermionic forms for thecharacters of the models SM(2,4k) in the minimal series of N=1 super-CFTs.These two forms are related to two families of thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA)systems, which are argued to be associated with the $\hat{\phi}_{1,3}^{\rmtop}$- and $\hat{\phi}_{1,5}^{\rm bot}$-perturbations of the models SM(2,4k).Certain other q-series identities and TBA systems are also discussed, as wellas a possible representation-theoretical consequence of our results, based onAndrews's generalization of the Gollnitz-Gordon theorem.
