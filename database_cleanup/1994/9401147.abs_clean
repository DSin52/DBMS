The evolution of a closed NSR string is considered in the background ofconstant graviton and antisymmetric fields. The $\sigma$-model action iswritten in a manifestly supersymmetric form in terms of superfields. The firstorder formalism adopted for the closed bosonic string is generalised toimplement duality transformations and the constant dual backgrounds areobtained for the dual theory. We recover the $G \rightarrow G^{-1}$ duality forthe case when antisymmetric tensor field is set to zero. Next, the case whenthe backgrounds depend on one superfield, is also analysed. This scenario issimilar to the cosmological case envisaged for the bosonic string. The explicitform of the duality transformation is given for this case.
