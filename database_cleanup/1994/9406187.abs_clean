We present the effective potential for nonrelativistic matter coupled tonon-Abelian Chern-Simons gauge fields. We perform the calculation using afunctional method in constant background fields to satisfy Gauss's law and tosimplify the computation. Both the quantum gauge and matter fields areintegrated over. The gauge fixing is achieved with an $R_\xi$-gauge in the$\xi\to 0$ limit. Divergences appearing in the matter sector are regulated viaoperator regularization. We find no corrections to the Chern-Simons couplingconstant and the system experiences conformal symmetry breaking to one-looporder except at the known value of self-duality. These results agree withprevious analysis of the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm scattering.
