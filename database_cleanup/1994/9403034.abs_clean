We analyze quasi-topological solitons winding around a mexican-hat potentialin two space-time dimensions.They are prototypes for a large number of physical excitations, includingSkyrmions of the Higgs sector of the standard electroweak model, magneticbubbles in thin ferromagnetic films, and strings in certain non-trivialbackgrounds.We present explicit solutions, derive the conditions for classical stability,and show that contrary to the naive expectation these can be satisfied in theweak-coupling limit. In this limit we can calculate the soliton propertiesreliably, and estimate their lifetime semiclassically. We explain why gaugeinteractions destabilize these solitons, unless the scalar sector is extended.
