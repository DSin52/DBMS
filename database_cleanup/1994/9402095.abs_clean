Title: Black Holes and Nonperturbative Canonical 2D Dilaton Gravity

Authors: A. Mikovic

Comments: 20 pgs, Imperial-TP/93-94/16, LaTex, (Argument about the presence of

the Hawking radiation in the semiclassical limit has been made more precise.)We investigate nonperturbative canonical quantization of two dimensionaldilaton gravity theories with an emphasis on the CGHS model. We use an approachwhere a canonical transformation is constructed such that the constraints takea quadratic form. The required canonical transformation is obtained by using amethod based on the B\"acklund transformation from the Liouville theory. Wequantize dilaton gravity in terms of the new variables, where it takes a formof a bosonic string theory with background charges. Unitarity is thenestablished by going into a light-cone gauge. As a direct consequence, blackholes in this theory do not violate unitarity, and there is no informationloss. We argue that the information escapes during the evaporation process. Wealso discuss the implications of this quantization scheme for the quantum fateof real black holes. The main conclusion is that black holes do not have toviolate quantum mechanics.
