We study the $O(N)$ nonlinear $\sigma$ model on a three-dimensional compactspace $S^1 \times S^2$ (of radii $L$ and $R$ respectively) by means of large$N$ expansion, focusing on the finite size effects and conformal symmetries ofthis model at the critical point. We evaluate the correlation length and theCasimir energy of this model and study their dependence on $L$ and $R$. Weexamine the modular transformation properties of the partition function, andstudy the dependence of the specific heat on the mass gap in view of possibleextension of the $C-$theorem to three dimensions.
