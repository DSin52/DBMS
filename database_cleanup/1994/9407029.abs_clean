Title: Mass Generation for Gauge Fields without Scalars

Authors: D. Caenepeel and M. Leblanc

Comments: 6 pages, talk given by D.C. at the MRST-94 Conference "What Next?

Exploring the Future of High-Energy Physics", McGill University, Montreal,Canada, may 1994, UdeM-LPN-TH-94-201We present an alternative to the Higgs mechanism to generate masses fornon-abelian gauge fields in (3+1)-dimensions. The initial Lagrangian iscomposed of a fermion with current-current and dipole-dipole typeself-interactions minimally coupled to non-abelian gauge fields. The massgeneration occurs upon the fermionic functional integration. We show that byfine-tuning the coupling constants the effective theory contains massivenon-abelian gauge fields without any residual scalars or other degrees offreedom.
