Theory and WZW model during Dec. 5-10, also a concise version ofhep-th/9412034There exist certain intrinsic relations between the ultraviolet divergentgraphs and the convergent ones at the same loop order in renormalizable quantumfield theories. Whereupon we present a new method, the inserter regularizationmethod, to regulate those divergent graphs. In this letter, we demonstrate thismethod with the $\phi^4$ theory and QED at the one loop order. Someapplications to SUSY-models are also made at the one loop order, which showsthat supersymmetry is preserved manifestly and consistently.
