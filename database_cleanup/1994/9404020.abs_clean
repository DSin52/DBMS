We discuss the ``gravitationally dressed'' beta functions in the Gross--Neveumodel interacting with 2d Liouville theory and in $SU(N)$ gauge theoryinteracting with the conformal sector of 4d quantum gravity. Among the effectsthat we suggest may feel the gravitational dressing are the minimum of theeffective potential and the running of the gauge coupling.
