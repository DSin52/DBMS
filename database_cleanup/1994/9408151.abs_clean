Title: A $SU(2)$ Generalized Gauge Field Model With Higgs Mechanism

Authors: Hanying Guo and Jianming Li, 7 pages , Latex, ASITP-94-25

By means of the non-commutative differential geometry, we construct an$SU(2)$ generalized gauge field model. It is of $SU(2) \times \pi_4(SU(2))$gauge invariance. We show that this model not only includes the Higgs fieldautomatically on the equal footing with ordinary Yang-Mills gauge potentialsbut also is stable against quantum correlation.
