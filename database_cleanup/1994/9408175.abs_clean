Title: Some beautiful equations of mathematical physics

Comments: 18 pages

The basic ideas and the important role of gauge principles in modernelementary particle physics are outlined. There are three theoreticallyof electromagnetism and the standard model, the spin-2 gauge principle ofgeneral relativity, and the spin-3/2 gauge principle of supergravity.
