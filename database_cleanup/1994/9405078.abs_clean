\noindent It is find a non-linear partial differential equation which we showcontains the first Heavenly equation of Self-dual gravity and generalize thesecond one. This differential equation we call "Weak Heavenly Equation" (${\calWH}$-equation). For the two-dimensional case the ${\cal WH}$-equation isbrought into the evolution form (Cauchy-Kovalevski form) using the Legendretransformation. Finally, we find that this transformed equation ("EvolutionWeak Heavenly Equation") does admit very simple solutions.
