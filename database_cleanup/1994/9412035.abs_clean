This paper is devoted to the study of closed string field theory in twotheory and the string effective Lagrangian. We show that the quadratic actionand the pole structures of tree-level scattering amplitudes agree. We studymerits and drawbacks of various gauge fixing procedures. In particular, wediscuss conformal gauge in the context of the effective Lagrangian, and Siegeland Lorentz-like gauge in the general BRST approach. We discuss the ways inwhich discrete states survive a particular gauge fixing both by directlysolving the equations of motion, and by analyzing pole structure of thescattering amplitudes.
