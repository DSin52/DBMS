We study the excitation spectrum and the correlation functions of the Z_3-chiral Potts model in the massive high-temperature phase using perturbationexpansions and numerical diagonalization. We are mainly interested in resultsfor general chiral angles but we consider also the superintegrable case. Forthe parameter values considered, we find that the band structure of the low-lying part of the excitation spectrum has the form expected from aquasiparticle picture with two fundamental particles. Studying the N-dependenceof the spectrum, we confirm the stability of the second fundamental particle ina limited range of the momentum, even when its energy becomes so high that itlies very high up among the multiparticle scattering states. This is not aphenomenon restricted to the superintegrable line. Calculating anon-translationally invariant correlation function, we give evidence that it isoscillating. Within our numerical accuracy we find a relation between theoscillation length and the dip position of the momentum dispersion of thelightest particle which seems to be quite independent of the chiral angles.
