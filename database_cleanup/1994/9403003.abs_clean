Title: Spherical Functions for the Quantum Group su_q(2)

Comments: 8 pages

The representation theory of the quantum group su$_q(2)$ is used to introduce$q$-analogues of the Wigner rotation matrices, spherical functions, andLegendre polynomials. The method amounts to an extension of variable separationfrom Laplace equations to certain differential-dilation equations.
