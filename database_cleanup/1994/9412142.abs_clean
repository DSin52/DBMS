Extension of the braid relations to the multiple braided tensor product ofalgebras that can be used for quantization of nonultralocal models ispresented. The Yang--Baxter--type consistency conditions as well as conditionsfor the existence of the multiple coproduct (monodromy matrix), which can beused for construction of the commuting subalgebra, are given. Homogeneous andlocal algebras are introduced, and simplification of the Yang--Baxter--typeconditions for them is shown. The Yang--Baxter--type equations and multiplecoproduct conditions for homogeneous and local of order 2 algebras are solved.
