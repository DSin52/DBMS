The quantization of the induced 2d-gravity on a compact spatial section iscarried out in three different ways. In the three approaches the supermomentumconstraint is solved at the classical level but they differ in the way thehamiltonian constraint is imposed. We compare these approaches establishing anisomorphism between the resulting Hilbert spaces.
