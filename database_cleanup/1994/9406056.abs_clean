We study the $(1,q=-1)$ model coupled to topological gravity as a candidateto describing $2d$ string theory at the self-dual radius. We define the modelby analytical continuation of $q>1$ topological recursion relations to $q=-1$.We show that at genus zero the $q=-1$ recursion relations yield the$W_{1+\infty}$ Ward identities for tachyon correlators on the sphere. A schemefor computing correlation functions of $q=-1$ gravitational descendants isproposed and applied for the computation of several correlators. It issuggested that the latter correspond to correlators of discrete states of the$c=1$ string. In a similar manner to the $q>1$ models, we show that there existtopological recursion relations for the correlators in the $q=-1$ theory thatconsist of only one and two splittings of the Riemann surface. Using apostulated regularized contact, we prove that the genus one $q=-1$ recursionrelations for tachyon correlators coincide with the $W_{1+\infty}$ Wardidentities on the torus. We argue that the structure of these recursionrelations coincides with that of the $W_{1+\infty}$ Ward identities for anygenus.
