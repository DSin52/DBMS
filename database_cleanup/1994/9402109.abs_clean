It is proposed that gravity may arise in the low energy limit of a model ofmatter fields defined on a special kind of a dynamical random lattice. Time isdiscretized into regular intervals, whereas the discretization of space israndom and dynamical. A triangulation is associated to each distribution of thespacetime points using the flat metric of the embedding space. We introduce adiffeomorphism invariant, bilinear scalar action, but no ``pure gravity''action.Evidence for the existence of a non-trivial continuum limit is provided byshowing that the zero momentum scalar excitation has a finite energy in thelimit of vanishing lattice spacing. Assuming the existence of localized lowenergy states which are described by a natural set of observables, we show thatan effective curved metric will be induced dynamically. The components of themetric tensor are identified with quasi-local averages of certain microscopicproperties of the quantum spacetime. The Planck scale is identified with thehighest mass scale of the matter sector.
