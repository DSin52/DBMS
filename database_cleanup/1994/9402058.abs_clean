Title: Infinite Abelian Subalgebras in Quantum W-Algebras

Comments: 22 pages, 2 fig. included

An elementary proof is given for the existence of infinite dimensionalabelian subalgebras in quantum W-algebras. In suitable realizations thesesubalgebras define the conserved charges of various quantum integrable systems.We consider all principle W-algebras associated with the simple Lie algebras.The proof is based on the more general result that for a class of vertexoperators the quantum operators are related to their classical counterparts byan equivalence transformation.
