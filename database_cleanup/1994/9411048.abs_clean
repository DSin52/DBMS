We present a first step towards generalizing the work of Seiberg and Wittenon N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to arbitrary gauge groups.Specifically, we propose a particular sequence of hyperelliptic genus $n-1$Riemann surfaces to underly the quantum moduli space of $SU(n)$ N=2supersymmetric gauge theory. These curves have an obvious generalization toarbitrary simply laced gauge groups, which involves the A-D-E type simplesingularities. To support our proposal, we argue that the monodromy in thesemiclassical regime is correctly reproduced. We also give some remarks on apossible relation to string theory.
