We formulate the Schwinger-Dyson equations in the ladder approximation for 2Dinduced quantum gravity with fermions using covariant gauges of harmonic type.It is shown that these equations can be formulated consistently in a gauge ofLandau type (for negative cosmological constant). A numerical analysis of theequations hints towards the possibility of chiral symmetry breaking, dependingon the value of the coupling constant.
