Authors: F. Toppan

Comments: 8 pages, LaTex, Talk given at Rakhov, February 1994

The structure of classical non-linear $\cw$ algebras closing on rationalfunctions is analyzed both for the ordinary and the supersymmetric case. Suchalgebras appear as a result of a coset construction. Their relevance tophysical applications is pointed out.
