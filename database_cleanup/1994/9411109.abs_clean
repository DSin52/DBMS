Using the effective potential, we study the one-loop renormalization of amassive self-interacting scalar field at finite temperature in flat manifoldswith one or more compactified spatial dimensions. We prove that, owing to thecompactification and finite temperature, the renormalized physical parametersof the theory (mass and coupling constant) acquire thermal and topologicalcontributions. In the case of one compactified spatial dimension at finitetemperature, we find that the corrections to the mass are positive, but thoseto the coupling constant are negative. We discuss the possibility oftriviality, i.e. that the renormalized coupling constant goes to zero at sometemperature or at some radius of the compactified spatial dimension.
