We consider the infrared and ultraviolet behaviour of the effective quantumfield theory of a single $Z_2$ symmetric scalar field. In a previous paper weproved to all orders in perturbation theory the renormalizability of massiveeffective scalar field theory using Wilson's exact renormalization groupequation. Here we show that away from exceptional momenta the massless theoryis similarly renormalizable, and we prove detailed bounds on Green's functionsas arbitrary combinations of exceptional Euclidean momenta are approached. As acorollary we also prove Weinberg's Theorem for the massive effective theory, inthe form of bounds on Green's functions at Euclidean momenta much greater thanthe particle mass but below the naturalness scale of the theory.
