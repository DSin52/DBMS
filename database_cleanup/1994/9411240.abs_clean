Title: Integrable Systems with Pairwise Interactions and Functional Equations

Comments: 32 pages latex2e. Some Proofs removed. New Examples

A new ansatz is presented for a Lax pair describing systems of particles onthe line interacting via (possibly nonsymmetric) pairwise forces. Particularcases of this yield the known Lax pairs for the Calogero-Moser and Todasystems, as well as their relativistic generalisations. The ansatz leads to asystem of functional equations. Several new functional equations are describedand the general analytic solution to some of these is given. New integrablesystems are described.
