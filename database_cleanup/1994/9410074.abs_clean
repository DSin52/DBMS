We give some examples in which neglecting the interactions between particlesor truncating the description of a black hole to the spherically symmetric modeleads to unphysical results. The restoration of the interactions and higherangular momentum modes resolves these problems. It is argued that mathematicalconsistency of the description of black holes in the Schwarzschild coordinatesystem requires that we neither truncate the theory nor ignore theinteractions. We present two hypotheses on how matter must behave under largeLorentz boosts in order for black holes to be consistent with quantummechanics. Finally, we argue that string theory exhibits these properties. Talkpresented at the PASCOS meeting in Syracuse, New York, May 1994.
