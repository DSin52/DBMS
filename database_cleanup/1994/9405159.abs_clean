Recently an algorithm was found by means of which one can calculate terms atarbitrary oscillator level in the four-Ramond vertex obtained by sewing. Herewe show that this algorithm is applicable also to the case of ${\bfZ}_2$-twisted scalars and derive the full propagator for scalars on the Riemannsphere with two branch cuts. The relation to similar results previously derivedin the literature by other means is discussed briefly.
