We construct quantum states for a (1+1) dimensional gravity-matter model thatis also a gauge theory based on the centrally extended Poincar\'e group.Explicit formulas are found, which exhibit interesting structures. For examplewave functionals are gauge invariant except for a gauge non-invariant phasefactor that is the Kirillov-Kostant 1-form on the (co-) adjoint orbit of thegroup. However no evidence for gravity-matter forces is found.
