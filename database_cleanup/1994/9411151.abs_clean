We investigate how exotic differential structures may reveal themselves inparticle physics. The analysis is based on the A. Connes' construction of thestandard model. It is shown that, if one of the copies of the spacetimemanifold is equipped with an exotic differential structure, compact object ofgeometric origin may exist even if the spacetime is topologically trivial.Possible implications are discussed. An $SU(3)\otimes SU(2)\otimes U(1)$ gaugemodel is constructed. This model may not be realistic but it shows what kind ofphysical phenomena might be expected due to the existence of exoticdifferential structures on the spacetime manifold.
