The renormalization group (RG) is used in order to obtain the RG improvedeffective potential in curved spacetime. This potential is explicitlycalculated for the Yukawa model and for scalar electrodynamics, i.e. theorieswith several (namely, more than one) mass scales, in a space of constantcurvature. Using the $\lambda \varphi^4$-theory on a general curved spacetimeas an example, we show how it is possible to find the RG improved effectiveLagrangian in curved spacetime. As specific applications, we discuss thepossibility of curvature induced phase transitions in the Yukawa model and theeffective equations (back-reaction problem) for the $\lambda \varphi^4$-theoryon a De Sitter background.
