Title: On the Geometry of W_n gravity

Authors: Suresh Govindarajan

Comments: 10 pages, LaTeX, TIFR/TH/94-17

We report work done with T. Jayaraman (hep-th/9405146) in this talk. In arecent paper, Hitchin introduced generalisations of the Teichmuller space ofRiemann surfaces. We relate these spaces to the Teichmuller spaces ofW-gravity. We show how this provides a covariant description of W-gravity andnaturally leads to a Polyakov path integral prescription for W-strings.
