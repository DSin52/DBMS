The form-factor bootstrap approach is applied to the perturbed minimal models$M_{2,2n+3}$ in the direction of the primary field $\phi_{1,3}$. These theoriesare integrable and contain $n$ massive scalar particles, whose $S$--matrix ispurely elastic. The form-factor equations do not refer to a specific operator.We use this fact to classify the operator content of these models. We show thatthe perturbed models contain the same number of primary fields as the conformalones. Explicit solutions are constructed and conjectured to correspond to theoff-critical primary fields $\phi_{1,k}$.
