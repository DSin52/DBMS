It is pointed out that string-loop modifications of the low-energy mattercouplings of the dilaton may provide a mechanism for fixing the vacuumexpectation value of a massless dilaton in a way which is naturally compatiblewith existing experimental data. Under a certain assumption of universality ofthe dilaton coupling functions , the cosmological evolution of thegraviton-dilaton-matter system is shown to drive the dilaton towards valueswhere it decouples from matter (``Least Coupling Principle"). Quantitativeestimates are given of the residual strength, at the present cosmologicalepoch, of the coupling to matter of the dilaton. The existence of a weaklycoupled massless dilaton entails a large spectrum of small, but non-zero,observable deviations from general relativity. In particular, our resultsprovide a new motivation for trying to improve by several orders of magnitudethe various experimental tests of Einstein's Equivalence Principle(universality of free fall, constancy of the constants,\dots).
