(1996) 1900-1947These lectures were prepared to be presented at A.A. Belavin seminar on CFTat Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics. We review bosonization of CFT andshow how it can be applied to the studying of representations ofZamolodchikov-Faddeev (ZF) algebras. In the bosonic construction we obtainexplicit realization of chiral vertex operators interpolating betweenirreducible representations of the deformed Virasoro algebra. The commutationrelations of these operators are determined by the elliptic matrix of IRF typeand their matrix elements are given in the form of the contour integrals ofsome meromorphic functions.
