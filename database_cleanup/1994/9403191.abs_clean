We analyze the coset model $(E_2^c \ti E_2^c)/E_2^c$ and construct a class ofexact string vacua which describe plane gravitational waves and their duals,generalizing the plane wave background found by Nappi and Witten. Inparticular, the vector gauging describes a two-parameter family of singulargeometries with two isometries, which is dual to plane gravitational waves. Inaddition, there is a mixed vector-axial gauging which describes a one-parameterfamily of plane waves with five isometries. These two backgrounds are relatedby a duality transformation which generalizes the known axial-vector dualityfor abelian subgroups.
