Time-dependent solutions of bosonic string theory resemble renormalisationbetween repulsive and attractive static solutions. It is shown that theattractive static solutions are those whose spatial sections are minima of|\bar c-25|, where \bar c is the `c-function'. The size of the domain ofattraction of such a solution may be a measure of the probability of thecorresponding string vacuum. Our discussion has also an implication for the RGc>25 to models with c<25 is forbidden.
