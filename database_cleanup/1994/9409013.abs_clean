The stability of the magnetically charged Reissner-Nordstrom black holesolution is investigated in the context of a theory with massive charged vectormesons. By exploiting the spherical symmetry of the problem, the linearperturbations about the Reissner-Nordstrom solution can be decomposed intomodes of definite angular momentum $J$. For each value of $J$, unstable modesappear if the horizon radius is less than a critical value that depends on thevector meson gyromagnetic ratio $g$ and the monopole magnetic charge $q/e$. Itis shown that such a critical radius exists (except in the anomalous case$q={1\over 2}$ with $0 \le g \le 2$), provided only that the vector meson massis not too close to the Planck mass. The value of the critical radius isdetermined numerically for a number of values of $J$. The instabilities foundhere imply the existence of stable solutions with nonzero vector fields(``hair'') outside the horizon; unless $q=1$ and $g>0$, these will not bespherically symmetric.
