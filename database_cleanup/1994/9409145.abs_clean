It has been shown recently that the motion of solitons at couplings around acritical coupling can be reduced to the dynamics of particles (the zeros of theHiggs field) on a curved manifold with potential. The curvature gives avelocity dependent force, and the magnitude of the potential is proportional tothe distance from a critical coupling. In this paper we apply thisapproximation to determining the equation of state of a gas of vortices in theAbelian Higgs model. We derive a virial expansion using certain known integralsof the metric, and the second virial coefficient is calculated, determining thebehaviour of the gas at low densities. A formula for determining higher ordercoefficients is given. At low densities and temperatures $T \gg \l$ theequation of state is of the Van der Waals form $(P+b\frac{N^{2}}{A^{2}})(A-aN)= NT$ with $a=4\pi$ and $b=-4.89\pi\l$ where $\l$ is a measure of the distancefrom critical coupling. It is found that there is no phase transition in a lowdensity type-II gas, but there is a transition in the type-I case between acondensed and gaseous state. We conclude with a discussion of the relation ofour results to vortex behaviour in superconductors.
