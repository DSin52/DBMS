We diagonalize the Hilbert space of some subclass of the quasifinite moduleof the \Winf algebra. States are classified according to their eigenvalues forinfinitely many commuting charges and the Young diagrams. The parameterdependence of their norms is explicitly derived. The full character formulae ofthe degenerate representations are given as summation of the bilinearcombinations of the Schur polynomials.
