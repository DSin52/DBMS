Based on our generalization of the Goulian-Li continuation in the power ofthe 2D cosmological term we construct the two and three-point correlationfunctions for Liouville exponentials with generic real coefficients. As astrong argument in favour of the procedure we prove the Liouville equation ofmotion on the level of three-point functions. The analytical structure of thecorrelation functions as well as some of its consequences for string theory arediscussed. This includes a conjecture on the mass shell condition forexcitations of noncritical strings. We also make a comment concerning thecorrelation functions of the Liouville field itself.
