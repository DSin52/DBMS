Title: Strongly homotopy Lie algebras

Comments: 17 pages

The present paper can be thought of as a continuation of the paper"Introduction to sh Lie algebras for physicists" by T. Lada and J. Stasheff(International Journal of Theoretical Physics Vol. 32, No. 7 (1993),1087--1103, appeared also as preprint hep-th/9209099) which provided anexposition of the basic ingredients of the theory of strongly homotopy Liealgebras sufficient for the underpinnings of the physically relevant examples.We demonstrate the `strong homotopy' analog of the usual relation between Lieand associative algebras and investigate the universal enveloping algebrafunctor emerging as the left adjoint of the symmetrization functor. We showthat the category of homotopy associative algebras carries a natural monoidalstructure such that the universal enveloping algebra is a unital coassociativecocommutative coalgebra with respect to this monoidal structure. The lastsection is concerned with the relation between homotopy modules and weakhomotopy maps. The present paper is complementary to what currently exists inthe literature, both physical and mathematical.
