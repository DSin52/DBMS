Black hole formation and evaporation is studied in the semiclassicalapproximation in simple 1+1-dimensional models, with emphasis on issues relatedto Hawking's information paradox. Exact semiclassical solutions are describedand questions of boundary conditions and vacuum stability are discussed. Thevalidity of the semiclassical approximation has been called into question inthe context of the information puzzle. A different approach, where black holeevolution is assumed to be unitary, is described. It requires unusual causalproperties and kinematic behavior of matter that may be realized in stringtheory. Based on lectures given at the 1994 Trieste Spring School
