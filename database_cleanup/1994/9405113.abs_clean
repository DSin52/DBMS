Unique twistor--like Lorentz harmonic formulation for all N=1 supersymmetricextended objects (super-p-branes) moving in the space--time of arbitrarydimension D (admissible for given $p$) are suggested. The equations of motionare derived, explicit form of the \kappa-symmetry transformations is presentedand the classical equivalence to the standard formulation is proved.The cases with minimal world--sheet dimensions $p=1,2$, namely of D=10heterotic string and D=11 supermembrane, are considered in details. Inparticular, the explicit form of irreducible \kappa-symmetry transformationsfor D=11 supermembrane is derived.
