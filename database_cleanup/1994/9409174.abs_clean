Title: No $Z_N$ - bubbles in hot Yang-Mills theory

Authors: A.V.Smilga

Comments: An invited talk presented on the ICHEP-94 conference. LaTeX, 9 pages

Pure Yang-Mills theory at high temperature is considered. We show that nodistinct $Z_N$- phases separated by domain walls do exist in the physicalMinkowski space. That means the absense of the spontaneous breaking of $Z_N$-symmetry in the physical meaning of this word.
