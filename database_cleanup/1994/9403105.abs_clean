An important property of a Hopf algebra is its quasitriangularity and it isuseful various applications. This property is investigated for quantum groups$sl_2$ at roots of 1. It is shown that different forms of the quantum group$sl_2$ at roots of 1 are either quasitriangular or have similar structure whichwill be called autoquasitriangularity. In the most interesting cases thisproperty means that "braiding automorphism" is a combination of some Poissontransformation and an adjoint transformation with certain element of the tensorsquare of the algebra.
