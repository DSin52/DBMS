Preliminary results concerning non-quadratic (and non-bijective)transformations that exibit a degree of parentage with the well knownLevi-Civita, Kustaanheimo-Stiefel, and Fock transformations are reported inthis article. Some of the new transformations are applied to non-relativisticquantum dynamical systems in two dimensions.
