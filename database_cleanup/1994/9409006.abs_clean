We study the various quantum aspects of the $N=2$ supersymmetric MaxwellChern-Simons vortex systems. The fermion zero modes around the vortices willgive rise the degenerate states of vortices. We analyze the angular momentum ofthese zero modes and apply the result to get the supermultiplet structures ofthe vortex. The leading quantum correction to the mass of the vortex comingfrom the mode fluctuations is also calculated using various methods dependingon the value of the coefficient of the Chern-Simons term $\kappa$ to be zero,infinite and finite, separately. The mass correction is shown to vanish for allcases. Fermion numbers of vortices are also discussed.
