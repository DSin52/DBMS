511-515In the superspace $z^M = (x^\mu,\theta_R,\theta_L)$ the global symmetries for$d$ = 10 superparticle model with kinetic terms both for Bose and Fermivariables are shown to form a superalgebra, which includes the Poincar\'esuperalgebra as a subalgebra. The subalgebra is realized in the space ofvariables of the theory by a nonstandard way. The local version of this modelwith off-shell closed Lagrangian algebra of gauge symmetries and off-shellglobal supersymmetry is presented. It is shown that the resulting model isdynamically equivalent to the Siegel superparticle.
