Title: Obstructions to Gauging WZ Terms

Authors: J.M. Figueroa-O'Farrill

Comments: 7 pages, plain TeX

This is an expository talk about the relation between gauging the WZ term ofa one-dimensional sigma-model with a symplectic target and the existence of anequivariant moment mapping for symplectic group actions. The punch line is thatthe obstructions for gauging coincide with the obstructions for the existenceof the moment mapping. This paper can be thought of a "prequel" ofhep-th/9407149.
