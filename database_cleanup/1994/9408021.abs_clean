Title: On Quantum Jumps, Events and Spontaneous Localization Models

Comments: 20 pages

We propose a definite meaning to the concepts of "experiment","measurement" and "event" in the event-enhanced formalism of quantumtheory. A minimal piecewise deterministic process is given that can beused for a computer simulation of real time series of experiments onsingle quantum objects. As an example a generalized cloud chamber isdescribed, including multiparticle case. Relation to the GRWspontaneous localization model is discussed. The second revised versionof the paper contains references to papers by other authors thatin such a way that it will provide stochastic description ofevents triggered by individual quantum systems.
