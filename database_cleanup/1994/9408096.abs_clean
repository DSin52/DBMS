It is known that there exist an infinite number of inequivalent quantizationson a topologically nontrivial manifold even if it is a finite-dimensionalmanifold. In this paper we consider the abelian sigma model in (1+1) dimensionsto explore a system having infinite degrees of freedom. The model has a fieldrespecting the topological aspect of this model. A central extension of thealgebra is also introduced. It is shown that there exist an infinite number ofunitary inequivalent representations, which are characterized by a centralextension and a continuous parameter $ \alpha $ $ ( 0 \le \alpha < 1 ) $. Whenthe central extension exists, the winding operator and the zero-mode momentumobey a nontrivial commutator.
