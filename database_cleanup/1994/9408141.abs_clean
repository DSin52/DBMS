Title: Mathematical remarks on the cohomology of gauge groups and anomalies

Authors: A.L. Carey and M.K. Murray

Comments: 13 pp. (Revised version corrected some lines longer than 80 columns -

content is unchanged.)Anomalies can be viewed as arising from the cohomology of the Lie algebra ofthe group of gauge transformations and also from the topological cohomology ofthe group of connections modulo gauge transformations. We show how these twoapproaches are unified by the transgression map. We discuss the geometry behindthe current commutator anomaly and the Faddeev- Mickelsson anomaly using therecent notion of a gerbe. Some anomalies (notably 3-cocycles) do not have sucha geometric origin. We discuss one example and a conjecture on how these may berelated to geometric anomalies.
