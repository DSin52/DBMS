A calculational framework for determining masses of low lying hadrons usinglight front quantization is discussed. The method is based upon foursuccessful in 1+1 dimensional models, a projector Monte Carlo method to extractlow lying state data with 2 additional transverse dimensions, the transversespatial lattice Hamiltonian of QCD, and exact form factors of the SU(3) x SU(3)1+1 dimensional non-linear sigma model (NLSM). How these tools are to be puttogether to provide a description of hadrons is the main topic of this lecture.I also focus on the NLSM form factors, which are given new physical relevancevia this picture of QCD. (Based on a lecture given at the ``Theory of Hadronsand Light-front QCD'' workshop in Zakopane, Poland, August 1994.)
