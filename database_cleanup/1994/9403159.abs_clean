Title: Spectra of RSOS Soliton Theories

Authors: Doron Gepner

Comments: Caltech preprint, March 1994

We study here the spectrum of soliton scattering theories based oninteraction round the face lattice models. We take for the admissibilitycondition the fusion rules of each of the simple Lie algebras. It is found thatthe mass spectrum is given by that of the corresponding Toda theory, or, thatthe mass ratios of the different kinks in the model are described by thePerron--Frobenius vector of the Cartan matrix. The scalar part of the solitonamplitude is shown to be identical with the minimal part of the correspondingToda amplitude.
