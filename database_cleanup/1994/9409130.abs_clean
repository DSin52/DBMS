We propose an expression for the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix for the$U_q(B_n)$-invariant open quantum spin chain associated with the fundamentalrepresentation of $A^{(2)}_{2n}$. By assumption, the Bethe Ansatz equations are``doubled'' with respect to those of the corresponding closed chain withperiodic boundary conditions. We verify that the transfer matrix eigenvalueshave the correct analyticity properties and asymptotic behavior. We alsobriefly discuss the structure of the eigenstates of the transfer matrix.
