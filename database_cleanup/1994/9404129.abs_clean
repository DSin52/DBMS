Oscillators, Cocoyoc, Mexico, March 23-25, 1994)The harmonic oscillator with dissipation is studied within the framework ofthe Lindblad theory for open quantum systems. By using the Wang-Uhlenbeckmethod, the Fokker-Planck equation, obtained from the master equation for thedensity operator, is solved for the Wigner distribution function, subject toeither the Gaussian type or the $\delta$-function type of initial conditions.The obtained Wigner functions are two-dimensional Gaussians with differentwidths. Then a closed expression for the density operator is extracted. Theentropy of the system is subsequently calculated and its temporal behaviourshows that this quantity relaxes to its equilibrium value.
