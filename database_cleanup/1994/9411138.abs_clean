It is shown that the algebraic--geometrical (or quasiperiodic) solutions ofthe Conformal Affine $sl(2)$ Toda model are generated from the vacuum viadressing transformations. This result generalizes the result of Babelon andBernard which states that the $N$--soliton solutions are generated from thevacuum by dressing transformations.
