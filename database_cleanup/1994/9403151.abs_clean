Authors: Cumrun Vafa

Comments: 22 pages

Some aspects of Mirror symmetry are reviewed, with an emphasis on more recentresults extending mirror transform to higher genus Riemann surfaces and itsrelation to the Kodaira-Spencer theory of gravity (talk given in the Geometryand Topology Conference, April 93, Harvard, in honor of Raoul Bott)
