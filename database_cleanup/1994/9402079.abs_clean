We give new formulations of the solutions of the field equations of theaffine Toda and conformal affine Toda theories on a cylinder andtwo-dimensional Minkowski space-time. These solutions are parameterised interms of initial data and the resulting covariant phase spaces arediffeomorphic to the Hamiltonian ones. We derive the fundamental Poissonbrackets of the parameters of the solutions and give the general staticsolutions for the affine theory.
