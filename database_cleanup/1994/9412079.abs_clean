String effective theories with N=1 supersymmetry in four dimensions aresubject of the discussion. Gaugino condensation in the chiral representation ofthe dilaton is reviewed in the truncated formalism in the$U_{K}(1)$-superspace. Using the supersymmetric duality of the dilaton the sameinvestigation is made in the linear representation of the dilaton. We show thatfor the simple case of one gaugino condensate the results concerningsupersymmtry breaking are independent of the representation of the dilaton.
