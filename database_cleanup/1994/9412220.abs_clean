We consider a four-dimensional space-time supplemented by two discrete pointsassigned to a $Z_2$ algebraic structure and develop the formalism ofnoncommutative geometry. By setting up a generalised vielbein, we study themetric structure. Metric compatible torsion free connection defines a uniquefinite field content in the model and leads to a discretized version ofKaluza-Klein theory. We study some special cases of this model that illustratethe rich and complex structure with massive modes and the possible presence ofa cosmological constant.
