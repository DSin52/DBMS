The scattering process of two particles at Planck energies or beyond iscalculated using the gravitational shock wave metric for a massive black hole.Then, the scattering between a heavy mass particle and a small mass one is dealwith. The cross section contains an extra new term of $\sigma \propto G^3$ asthe correction term of the leading term derived by 't Hooft. Theultrarelativistic limit of the Lorentz boosted Reissner--Norstrom black hole isalso calculated.
