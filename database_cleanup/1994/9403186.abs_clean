Conformal field theories corresponding to two-dimensional electricallycharged black holes and to two-dimensional anti-de Sitter space with acovariantly constant electric field are simply constructed as $SL(2,R)/Z$ WZWcoset models. The two-dimensional electrically charged black holes are relatedby Kaluza-Klein reduction to the 2+1-dimensional rotating black hole ofBanados, Teitelboim and Zanelli, and our construction is correspondinglyrelated to its realization as a WZW model. Four-dimensional spacetime solutionsare obtained by tensoring these two-dimensional theories with $SU(2)/Z(m)$coset models. These describe a family of dyonic black holes and theBertotti--Robinson universe.
