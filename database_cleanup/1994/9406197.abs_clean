Perturbations of $WD_n$ and $W_3$ conformal theories which generalize the$(1,2)$ perturbations of conformal minimal models are shown to be integrable bycounting argument. $A_{2n-1,q}^{(2)}$ and $D_{4,q}^ {(3)}$ symmetries ofcorresponding S-matrices are conjectured and proved by explicit construction ofconserved nonlocal charges in the $WD_3$ case with the proper quantum group ofsymmetry.
