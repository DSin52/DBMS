Title: On Classification of Deformations of the Gardner Bracket Over Local

Infinitesimal TransformationsAuthors: V.L.Vereschagin

Comments: 3 pp, Latex

The Lie algebra specified by space of local functionals with commutatordetermined by the Gardner bracket was under survey. Problem of classificationof deformations of this bracket over local infinitesimal transformations offunctionals was interpreted as a problem of computing the appropriatecohomology group of order 2. The most interesting class of deformations wasinvestigated.
