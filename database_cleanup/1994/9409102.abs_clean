In the present article we analyze the bound states of an electron in aCoulomb field when an Aharonov-Bohm field as well as a magnetic Dirac monopoleare present. We solve, via separation of variables, the Schr\"odinger equationin spherical coordinates and we show how the Hydrogen energy spectrum dependson the Aharonov-Bohm and the magnetic monopole strengths. In passing, theKlein-Gordon equation is solved.
