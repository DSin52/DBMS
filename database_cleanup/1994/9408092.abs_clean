We study the conserved charges of affine Toda field theories by making use ofthe conformally invariant extension of these theories. We compute the values ofall charges for the single soliton solutions, and show that these are relatedto eigenvectors of the Cartan matrix of the finite-dimensional Lie algebraunderlying the theory.
