We construct a new class of exact and stable superstring solutions based on$N=4$ superconformal world-sheet symmetry. In a subclass of these, the fullspectrum of string excitations is derived in a modular-invariant way. In theweak curvature limit, our solutions describe a target space with non-trivialmetric and topology, and generalize the previously known (semi) wormhole. Theeffective field theory limit is identified in certain cases, with solutions ofthe $N=4$ and $N=8$ extended gauged supergravities, in which the number ofspace-time supersymmetries is reduced by a factor of 2 because of the presenceof non-trivial dilaton, gravitational and/or gauge backgrounds. In the contextof string theory, our solutions correspond to stable non-critical superstringsin the strong coupling region; the super-Liouville field couples to a unitarymatter system with central charge $5\le{\hat c}_M\le 9$.
