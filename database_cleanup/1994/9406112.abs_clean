The applications of parabosons by Schmutz (1980) and of supersymmetry byJarvis {\em et al.} (1984) in Jahn-Teller systems are compared and contrasted.Although a parasupersymmetric Jahn-Teller system has not yet been identified,the method of Schmutz is used here to show that the $E \times \epsilon $supersymmetric Jahn-Teller Hamiltonian can be written in terms of parabosonoperators.
