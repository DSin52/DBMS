Title: Topics in Hidden Symmetries

Authors: Denis Juriev

Comments: 11 pages AMSTEX, amsppt style

These three topics are an attempt to explicate some curiosities of theinverse problem of representation theory (i.e. having a set of operators todescribe the "correct" algebraic object, which is represented by them) onsimple examples related to the Lie algebra sl(2,C). Such consideration mayberegarded as toy one for analogous infinite dimensional problems in the modernquantum field theory (conformal field theory, integrable models, field theoryin non-trivial backgrounds). Some constructions inspired by these topics andrelated to infinite dimensional hidden symmetries, which are produced by vertexoperator fields, will be discussed in the forthcoming article.
