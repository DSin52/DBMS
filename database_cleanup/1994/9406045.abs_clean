The elliptic genus for arbitrary two dimensional $N=2$ Landau-Ginzburgorbifolds is computed. This is used to search for possible mirror pairs of suchmodels. An important aspect of this work is that there is no restriction totheories for which the conformal anomaly is $\hat c\in\ZZ$, nor are the resultsonly valid at the conformal fixed point.
