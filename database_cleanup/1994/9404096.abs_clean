The behaviour of the master field in ``induced QCD" near the edge of itssupport is studied. An extended scaling domain, where the shape of the masterfield is a universal function, is found. This function is determined explicitlyfor the case of dimensions, close to one, and the $D-1$-expansion isconstructed. The problem of the meson spectrum corresponding to this solutionis analyzed. As a byproduct of these calculations, a new, explicit equation forthe meson spectrum in ``induced QCD" with a general potential is derived.
