It is known that classical electromagnetic radiation at a frequency inresonance with energy splittings of atoms in a dielectric medium can bedescribed using the classical sine-Gordon equation. In this paper we quantizethe electromagnetic field and compute quantum corrections to the classicalresults by using known results from the sine-Gordon quantum field theory.
