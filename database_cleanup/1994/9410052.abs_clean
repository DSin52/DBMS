This paper is devoted to the construction of a family of linear sigma modelswith $(0,4)$ supersymmetry which should flow in the infrared to the stringyversion of Yang-Mills instantons on ${\bf R}^4$. The family depends on the fullset of expected parameters and is obtained by using the data that appear in theADHM construction of instantons.
