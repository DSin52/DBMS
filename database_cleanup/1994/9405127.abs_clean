The quark loop contribution to the reggeon-reggeon-gluon vertex is calculatedin QCD, where the reggeon is the reggeized gluon. Compared with the vertex inthe Born approximation, this contribution exhibits a new spin structure as wellas the gluon loop one. A remarkable but not complete cancellation between gluonand quark contributions to this new spin structure takes place for the case ofthree massless quark flavours.
