We introduce a new construction of bilinear invariant forms on Lie algebras,based on the method of graded contractions. The general method is described andthe $\Bbb Z_2$-, $\Bbb Z_3$-, and $\Bbb Z_2\otimes\Bbb Z_2$-contractions arefound. The results can be applied to all Lie algebras and superalgebras (finiteor infinite dimensional) which admit the chosen gradings. We consider someand we briefly discuss the limit to new WZW actions.
