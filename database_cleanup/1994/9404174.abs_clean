We study a model in which p independent Ising spins are coupled to 2d quantumgravity (in the form of dynamical planar phi-cubed graphs). Consideration isgiven to the p tends to infinity limit in which the partition function becomesdominated by certain graphs; we identify most of these graphs. A truncatedmodel is solved exactly providing information about the behaviour of the fullmodel in the limit of small beta. Finally, we derive a bound for the criticalvalue of the coupling constant, beta_c and examine the magnetization transitionin the limit p tends to zero.
