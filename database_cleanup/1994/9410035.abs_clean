We present a derivation of abelian and non-abelian bosonization in a pathintegral setting by expressing the generating functional for current-currentcorrelation functions as a product of a $G/G$-coset model, which is dynamicallytrivial, and a bosonic part which contains the dynamics. A BRST symmetry can beidentified which leads to smooth bosonization in both the abelian andnon-abelian cases.
