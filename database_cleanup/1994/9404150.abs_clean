Irreversibility of RG flows in two dimensions is shown using conserved vectorcurrents. Out of a conserved vector current, a quantity decreasing along the RGflow is built up such that it is stationary at fixed points where it coincideswith the constant coefficient of the two current correlation function. ForWess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten models this constant coefficient is the level oftheir associated affine Lie algebra. Extensions to higher dimensions using thespectral decomposition of the two current correlation function are studied.
