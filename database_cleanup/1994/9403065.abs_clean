The question as to whether helicity conservation in spin one-half AharonovBohm scattering is sufficient in itself to determine uniquely the form of thespinor wave function near the origin is examined. Although it is found that aone parameter family of solutions is compatible with this conservation law,there must nonetheless be singular solutions which break the symmetry $\alpha\rightarrow \alpha +1$ required for an anyon interpretation. Thus the freeparameter which occurs does not allow one to eliminate the singular solutionseven though it does in principle mean that they can be transferred at willbetween the spin up and spin down configurations.
