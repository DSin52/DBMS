Title: String theory and classical integrable systems

Authors: A.Marshakov

Comments: lecture given at III Baltic Rim student seminar, Helsinki, September

1993} 33pp, latexWe discuss different formulations and approaches to string theory and $ 2d$quantum gravity. The generic idea to get a unique description of {\it many}different string vacua altogether is demonstrated on the examples in $ 2d$conformal, topological and matrix formulations. The last one naturally bringsus to the appearance of classical integrable systems in string theory. Physicalmeaning of the appearing structures is discussed and some attempts to finddirections of possible generalizations to ``higher-dimensional" models aremade. We also speculate on the possible appearence of quantum integrablestructures in string theory.
