author under requestThe light-cone approach is reviewed. This method allows to find theunderlying quantum field theory for any integrable lattice model in its gaplessregime. The relativistic spectrum and S-matrix follows straightforwardly inthis way through the Bethe Ansatz. We show here how to derive the infinitenumber of local commuting and non-local and non-commuting conserved charges inintegrable QFT, taking the massive Thirring model (sine-Gordon) as an example.They are generated by quantum monodromy operators and provide a representationof $q-$deformed affine Lie algebras $U_q({\hat\G})$. Based on lecturesdelivered at the $XXX_q$ Karpacz Winter School, Poland, February 14-26, 1994.
