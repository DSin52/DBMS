In this paper, we examine the coupling of matter fields to gravity within theframework of the Standard Model of particle physics. The coupling is describedin terms of Weyl fermions of a definite chirality, and employs only(anti)self-dual or left-handed spin connection fields. It is known from thework of Ashtekar and others that such fields can furnish a complete descriptionof gravity without matter. We show that conditions ensuring the cancellation ofperturbative chiral gauge anomalies are not disturbed. We also explore a globalanomaly associated with the theory, and argue that its removal requires thatthe number of fundamental fermions in the theory must be multiples of 16. Inaddition, we investigate the behavior of the theory under discretetransformations P, C and T; and discuss possible violations of these discretesymmetries, including CPT, in the presence of instantons and theAdler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly.
