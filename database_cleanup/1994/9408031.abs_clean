A  review of the multiparametric linear quantum groupGL_qr(N), its real forms, its dual algebra U(gl_qr(N)) and itsbicovariant differential calculus is given in thefirst part of the paper.We then construct the (multiparametric) linearinhomogeneous quantum group IGL_qr(N) as a projection fromGL_qr(N+1), or equivalently, as a quotient of GL_qr(N+1) withrespect to a suitable Hopf algebra ideal.A bicovariant differential calculus on IGL_qr(N) is explicitlyobtained as a projection from the one on GL_qr(N+1).Our procedure unifies in a single structure the quantumplane coordinates and the q-group matrix elements T^a_b,and allows to deduce without effort the differentialcalculus on the q-plane IGL_qr(N) / GL_qr(N).The general theory is illustrated on the example of IGL_qr(2).
