corrections)The central structure in various versions of noncommutative geometry is adifferential calculus on an associative algebra. This is an analogue of thecalculus of differential forms on a manifold. In this short review we collectexamples of differential calculi on commutative algebras (which can be regardedas algebras of functions on some topological space). We explain how these arerelated to relevant structures in physics.
