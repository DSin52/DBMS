Lattice gauge theory with gauge group $Z_{P}$ is reconsidered in fourdimensions on a simplicial complex $K$. One finds that the dual theory,formulated on the dual block complex $\hat{K}$, contains topological modeswhich are in correspondence with the cohomology group $H^{2}(\hat{K},Z_{P})$,in addition to the usual dynamical link variables. This is a general phenomenonin all models with single plaquette based actions; the action of the dualtheory becomes twisted with a field representing the above cohomology class. Asimilar observation is made about the dual version of the three dimensionalIsing model. The importance of distinct topological sectors is confirmednumerically in the two dimensional Ising model where they are parameterized by$H^{1}(\hat{K},Z_{2})$.
