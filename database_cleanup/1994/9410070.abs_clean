We present the exact solution of the $Osp(1|2)$ invariant magnet by the Betheansatz approach. The associated Bethe ansatz equation exhibit a new feature bypresenting an explicit and distinct phase behaviour in even and odd sectors ofthe theory. The ground state, the low-lying excitations and the criticalproperties are discussed by exploiting the Bethe ansatz solution.
