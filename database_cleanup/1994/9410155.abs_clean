By analytically continuing the time variable in a black hole background, andrequiring unitary evolution, it is found that quantum mechanical states at thehorizon develop a thermal factor under suitable identification of the physicaltime. The thermal factor is found to be determined exactly by the Hawking'stemperature. This can be interpreted as the Hawking's radiation and offers analternative understanding to the process and the information loss puzzle.
