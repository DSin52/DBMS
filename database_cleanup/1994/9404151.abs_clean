Press, Cambridge, 1997, pp. 703-716The moduli space of N=(4,4) string theories with a K3 target space isdetermined, establishing in particular that the discrete symmetry group is thefull integral orthogonal group of an even unimodular lattice of signature(4,20). The method combines an analysis of the classical theory of K3 modulispaces with mirror symmetry. A description of the moduli space is alsopresented from the viewpoint of quantum geometry, and consequences are drawnconcerning mirror symmetry for algebraic K3 surfaces.
