In the past ten years, the ideas of supersymmetry have been profitablyapplied to many nonrelativistic quantum mechanical problems. In particular,there is now a much deeper understanding of why certain potentials areanalytically solvable and an array of powerful new approximation methods forhandling potentials which are not exactly solvable. In this report, we reviewthe theoretical formulation of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and discussmany applications. Exactly solvable potentials can be understood in terms of afew basic ideas which include supersymmetric partner potentials, shapeinvariance and operator transformations. Familiar solvable potentials all havethe property of shape invariance. We describe new exactly solvable shapeinvariant potentials which include the recently discovered self-similarpotentials as a special case. The connection between inverse scattering,isospectral potentials and supersymmetric quantum mechanics is discussed andmulti-soliton solutions of the KdV equation are constructed. Approximationmethods are also discussed within the framework of supersymmetric quantummechanics and in particular it is shown that a supersymmetry inspired WKBapproximation is exact for a class of shape invariant potentials. Supersymmetryideas give particularly nice results for the tunneling rate in a double wellpotential and for improving large $N$ expansions. We also discuss the problemof a charged Dirac particle in an external magnetic field and other potentialsin terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Finally, we discuss structuresmore general than supersymmetric quantum mechanics such as parasupersymmetricquantum mechanics in which there is a symmetry between a boson and apara-fermion of order $p$.
