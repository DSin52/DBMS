Title: The Light-Cone Field Theory Paradigm for Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking

Authors: Stephen Pinsky

Comments: 17 pages Talk given at Hadron Structure '93, Banska Strianvnica

Slovakia, September 5-10, 1993 based on Notes by Oliver Schnetz and KlausLucke, Institut f\"ur theoretische Physik III, Erlangen of lectures presentedto the Graduiertenkoleg Erlangen-Regensburg on May 26, 1993In the first part of this lecture I will give an introduction to light-conefield theory, focussing on the ``zero mode problem''. In the second part Idiscuss $\phi^4$-theory in 1+1 dimensions. I will show how the dynamics of thezero modes can give rise to spontaneous symmetry breaking in spite of thetrivial vacuum structure on the light-cone.
