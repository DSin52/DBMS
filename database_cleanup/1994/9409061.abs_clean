(Revised version has referencescorrected and minor corrections to formulae.)A description is given of how to construct $(0,2)$ supersymmetric conformalfield theories as coset models. These models may be used as non--trivialbackgrounds for Heterotic String Theory. They are realised as a combination ofan anomalously gauged Wess--Zumino--Witten model, right--moving supersymmetricfermions, and left--moving current algebra fermions. Requiring the sum of thegauge anomalies from the bosonic and fermionic sectors to cancel yields thefinal model. Applications discussed include exact models of extremalfour--dimensional charged black holes and Taub--NUT solutions of string theory.These coset models may also be used to construct important families of $(0,2)$supersymmetric Heterotic String compactifications. The Kazama--Suzuki modelsare the left--right symmetric special case of these models.
