\noindent{\large\bf Abstract.} We develop a general formalism to study therenormalization group (RG) improved effective potential for renormalizablegauge theories ---including matter-$R^2$-gravity--- in curved spacetime. Theresult is given up to quadratic terms in curvature, and one-loop effectivepotentials may be easiliy obtained from it. As an example, we consider scalarQED, where dimensional transmutation in curved space and the phase structure ofthe potential (in particular, curvature-induced phase trnasitions), arediscussed. For scalar QED with higher-derivative quantum gravity (QG), weexamine the influence of QG on dimensional transmutation and calculate QGcorrections to the scalar-to-vector mass ratio. The phase structure of theRG-improved effective potential is also studied in this case, and the values ofthe induced Newton and cosmological coupling constants at the critical pointare estimated. Stability of the running scalar coupling in the Yukawa theorywith conformally invariant higher-derivative QG, and in the Standard Model withthe same addition, is numerically analyzed. We show that, in these models, QGtends to make the scalar sector less unstable.
