We consider the large-N Calogero model in the \h\ collective-field approachbased on the $1/N$ expansion. The Bogomol'nyi limit appears and thecorresponding equation for the semiclassical configuration gives the correctground-state energy. Using the method of the orthogonal polynomial we find theexcitation spectrum of density fluctuations around the semiclassical solutionfor any value of the statistical parametar $\l$. The wave functions of theexcited states are explicitly constructed as a product of Hermite polynomialsin terms of the collective modes.The two-point correlation function iscalculated as a series expansion in $1/\rho$ for any intermediate statistics.
