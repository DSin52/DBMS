Starting from Laughlin type wave functions with generalized periodic boundaryconditions describing the degenerate groundstate of a quantum Hall system weexplictly construct $r$ dimensional vector bundles. It turns out that thefilling factor $\nu$ is given by the topological quantity $c_1 \over r$ where$c_1$ is the first chern number of these vector bundles. In addition, wemanaged to proof that under physical natural assumptions the stable vectorbundles correspond to the experimentally dominating series of measuredfractional filling factors $\nu = {n \over 2pn\pm 1}$. Most remarkably, due tothe very special form of the Laughlin wave functions the fluctuations of thecurvature of these vector bundles converge to zero in the limit of infinitelymany particles which shows a new mathematical property. Physically, this meansthat in this limit the Hall conductivity is independent of the boundaryconditions which is very important for the observabilty of the effect. Finallywe discuss the relation of this result to a theorem of Donaldson.
