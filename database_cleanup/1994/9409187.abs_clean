A new pseudoclassical model to describe Weyl particles is proposed. Differentways of its quantization are presented. They all lead to the theory of Weylparticle; namely, the massless Dirac equation and the Weyl condition arereproduced. In contrast with models discussed previously, this one admits boththe Dirac quantization and quasicanonical quantization, with the fixation ofalmost all gauge freedom on the classical level.
