Laymen and sometimes even physicists think of natural sciences, in particularof theoretical and mathematical physics often as subjects, which unfoldaccording to an intrinsic logical pattern, with the limitations being set onlyby the conceptual and (in case of mathematical physics) mathematicaldevelopments of the times. This view certainly cannot be maintained in view ofthe present stagnation and crisis which in particular affects QFT, an areawhich in the past has been most innovating and fruitful, also in relation toother important areas of theoretical physics.
