The fusion rules and modular matrix of a rational conformal field theory obeya list of properties. We use these properties to classify rational conformalfield theories with not more than six primary fields and small values of thefusion coefficients. We give a catalogue of fusion rings which can arise forthese field theories. It is shown that all such fusion rules can be realized bycurrent algebras. Our results support the conjecture that all rationalconformal field theories are related to current algebras.
