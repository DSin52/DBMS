In theories of closed oriented superstrings, the one loop amplitude is givenby a single diagram, with the topology of a torus. Its interpretation hadremained obscure, because it was formally real, converged only for purelyimaginary values of the Mandelstam variables, and had to account for thesingularities of both the box graph and the one particle reducible graphs infield theories. We present in detail an analytic continuation method whichresolves all these difficulties. It is based on a reduction to certain minimalamplitudes which can themselves be expressed in terms of double and singledispersion relations, with explicit spectral densities. The minimal amplitudescorrespond formally to an infinite superposition of box graphs on $\phi ^3$like field theories, whose divergence is responsible for the poles in thestring amplitudes. This paper is a considerable simplification andgeneralization of our earlier proposal published in Phys. Rev. Lett. 70 (1993)p 3692.
