An attempt is made to understand the root spaces of Kac Moody algebras ofhyperbolic type, and in particular $E_{10}$, in terms of a DDF constructionappropriate to a subcritical compactified bosonic string. While the level-oneroot spaces can be completely characterized in terms of transversal DDF states(the level-zero elements just span the affine subalgebra), longitudinal DDFstates are shown to appear beyond level one. In contrast to previous treatmentsof such algebras, we find it necessary to make use of a rational extension ofthe self-dual root lattice as an auxiliary device, and to admit non-summableoperators (in the sense of the vertex algebra formalism). We demonstrate theutility of the method by completely analyzing a non-trivial level-two rootspace, obtaining an explicit and comparatively simple representation for it. Wealso emphasize the occurrence of several Virasoro algebras, whose interrelationis expected to be crucial for a better understanding of the complete structureof the Kac Moody algebra.
