We develop a rigorous framework for constructing Fock representations ofquantum fields obeying generalized statistics associated with certain solutionsof the spectral quantum Yang-Baxter equation. The main features of theserepresentations are investigated. Various aspects of the underlyingmathematical structure are illustrated by means of explicit examples.
