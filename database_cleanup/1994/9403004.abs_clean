Kadomtsev-Petviashvili HierarchyAuthors: A. Yu. Orlov and P. Winternitz

Comments: 16 pages, CRM-1936

The relation between the $\widehat\gl(\infty)$ symmetry of theKadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchy and the Kac-Moody-Virasoro Lie pointsymmetries of the individual equations is established. The Lie point symmetriesare shown to be the only local ones.
