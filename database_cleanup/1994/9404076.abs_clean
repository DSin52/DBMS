This article is based on a talk given at the IInd International Colloquium onModern Quantum Field Theory, Bombay 1994. The Ernst solution of dilaton gravitydescribes charged black holes undergoing uniform accleration in a backgroundmagnetic field. By analytically continuing the Ernst solution one obtainsinstantons that describe the pair production of black holes in the backgroundfield. We review various aspects of these solutions paying special attention tothe Einstein-Maxwell, low-energy string and $d=5$ Kaluza-Klein theories. It isbased on work done in collaboration with {}F. Dowker, S. Giddings, G. Horowitz,D. Kastor and J. Traschen \refs{\DGKT,\DGGH}.
