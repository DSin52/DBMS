A gauge invariant notion of a strong connection is presented andcharacterized. It is then used to justify the way in which a global curvatureform is defined. Strong connections are interpreted as those that are inducedfrom the base space of a quantum bundle. Examples of both strong and non-strongconnections are provided. In particular, such connections are constructed on aquantum deformation of the fibration $S^2 -> RP^2$. A certain class of strong$U_q(2)$-connections on a trivial quantum principal bundle is shown to beequivalent to the class of connections on a free module that are compatiblewith the q-dependent hermitian metric. A particular form of the Yang-Millsaction on a trivial $U\sb q(2)$-bundle is investigated. It is proved tocoincide with the Yang-Mills action constructed by A.Connes and M.Rieffel.Furthermore, it is shown that the moduli space of critical points of thisaction functional is independent of q.
