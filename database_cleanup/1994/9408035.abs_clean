For any two arbitrary positive integers `$n$' and `$m$', using the $m$--thKdV hierarchy and the $(n+m)$--th KdV hierarchy as building blocks, we are ableto construct another integrable hierarchy (referred to as the $(n,m)$--th KdVhierarchy). The $W$--algebra associated to the \shs\, of the $(n,m)$--th KdVhierarchy (called $W(n,m)$ algebra) is isomorphic via a Miura map to the directsum of $W_m$--algebra, $W_{n+m}$--algebra and an additional $U(1)$ currentalgebra. In turn, from the latter, we can always construct a representation of$W_\infty$--algebra.
