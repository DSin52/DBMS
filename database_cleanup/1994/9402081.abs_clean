We obtain nonperturbative results in the framework of continuous Liouvilletheory. In particular, we express the specific heat ${\cal Z}$ of pure gravityin terms of an expansion of integrals on moduli spaces of punctured Riemannspheres. The integrands are written in terms of the Liouville action. We showthat ${\cal Z}$ satisfies the Painlev\'e I.
