We apply the concepts of superanalysis to present an intrinsicallysupersymmetric formulation of the Chern character in entire cyclic cohomology.We show that the cocycle condition is closely related to the invariance undersupertranslations. Using the formalism of superfields, we find a path integralrepresentation of the index of the generalized Dirac operator.
