In this note we consider some consequences of quantum gravity on the processof black hole evaporation. In particular, we will explain the suggestion by 'tHooft that quantum gravitational interactions effectively exclude simultaneousmeasurements of the Hawking radiation and of the matter falling into the blackhole. The complementarity of these measurements is supported by the fact thatthe commutators between the corresponding observables can be shown to growuncontrollably large. The only assumption that is needed to obtain this resultis that the creation and annihilation modes of the in-falling and out-goingmatter act in the same Hilbert space. We further illustrate this phenomenon inthe context of two-dimensional dilaton gravity.
