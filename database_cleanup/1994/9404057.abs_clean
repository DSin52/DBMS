Classification of finite dimensional representations of the q-deformedHeisenberg algebra $H_q(3)$ is made by the help of Clifford algebra ofpolynomials and generalized Grassmann algebra. Special attention is paid when$q$ is a primitive $n$ root of unity. As a further application we obtain finitedimensional representations of $ sl(2)_q$ using its embedding into $H_q(3)$.
