We study quantum strings in strong gravitational fields. The relevant smallparameter is $g=R_c{\sqrt T_0}$, where $R_c$ is the curvature of the spacetimeand $T_0$ is the string tension. Within our systematic expansion we obtain tozeroth order the null string (string with zero tension), while the first ordercorrection incorporates the string dynamics. We apply our formalism to quantumnull strings in de Sitter spacetime. After a reparametrization of theworld-sheet coordinates, the equations of motion are simplified. The quantumalgebra generated by the constraints is considered, ordering the momentumoperators to the right of the coordinate operators. No critical dimensionappears. It is anticipated however that the conformal anomaly will appear whenthe first order corrections proportional to $T_0$, are introduced.
