Title: Induced modules for vertex operator algebras

Authors: Chongying Dong and Zongzhu Lin

Comments: 30 pages, latex

For a vertex operator algebra $V$ and a vertex operator subalgebra $V'$ whichis invarinant under an automorphism $g$ of $V$ of finite order, we introduce a$g$-twisted induction functor from the category of $g$-twisted $V'$-modules tothe category of $g$-twisted $V$-modules. This functor satisfies the Frobeniusreciprocity and transitivity. The results are illustrated with $V$ being simpleor with $V'$ being $g$-rational.
