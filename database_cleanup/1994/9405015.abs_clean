We determine the canonical structure of two-dimensional black-hole solutionsarising in $2D$ dilaton gravity. By choosing the Cauchy surface appropriatelywe find that the canonically conjugate variable to the black hole mass is givenby the difference of local (Schwarzschild) time translations at right and leftspatial infinities. This can be regarded as a generalization of Birkhoff'stheorem.
