Holomorphy of the superpotential and of the coefficient of the gauge kineticterms in supersymmetric theories lead to powerful results. They are theunderlying conceptual reason for the important non-renormalization theorems.They also enable us to study the exact non-perturbative dynamics of thesetheories. We find explicit realizations of known phenomena as well as new onesin four dimensional strongly coupled field theories. These shed new light onconfinement and chiral symmetry breaking. This note is based on a talkdelivered at the PASCOS (94) meeting at Syracuse University.
