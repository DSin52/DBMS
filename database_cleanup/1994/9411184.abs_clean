Italian Congress of General Relativity and Gravitation (SISSA, Trieste)Montpellier PM/94-38We discuss geometrical aspects of Toda Fields generalizing the links betweenLiouville gravity and uniformization of Riemann surfaces of genus greater thanone. The framework is the interplay between the hermitian and the holomorphicgeometry of vector bundles on such Riemann surfaces. Pointing out how Todafields can be considered as equivalent to Higgs systems, we show how the theoryof Variations of Hodge Structures enters the game inducing local holomorphicembeddings of Riemann surfaces into homogeneous spaces. The relations of suchconstructions with previous realizations of $W_n$--geometries are brieflydiscussed.
