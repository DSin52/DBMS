There is a standard way to define two symplectic (hamiltonian) structures,the first and second Gelfand-Dikii brackets, on the space of ordinary lineardifferential operators of order $m$, $L = -d^m + U_1 d^{m-1} + U_2 d^{m-2} +\ldots + U_m$. In this paper, I consider in detail the case where the $U_k$ are$n\times n$-matrix-valued functions, with particular emphasis on the (moreinteresting) second Gelfand-Dikii bracket. Of particular interest is thereduction to the symplectic submanifold $U_1=0$. This reduction gives rise tomatrix generalizations of (the classical version of) the {\it non-linear}$W_m$-algebras, called $V_{m,n}$-algebras. The non-commutativity of thematrices leads to {\it non-local} terms in these $V_{m,n}$-algebras. I showthat these algebras contain a conformal Virasoro subalgebra and thatcombinations $W_k$ of the $U_k$ can be formed that are $n\times n$-matrices ofconformally primary fields of spin $k$, in analogy with the scalar case $n=1$.In general however, the $V_{m,n}$-algebras have a much richer structure thanthe $W_m$-algebras as can be seen on the examples of the {\it non-linear} and{\it non-local} Poisson brackets of any two matrix elements of $U_2$ or $W_3$which I work out explicitly for all $m$ and $n$. A matrix Miura transformationis derived, mapping these complicated second Gelfand-Dikii brackets of the$U_k$ to a set of much simpler Poisson brackets, providing the analogue of thefree-field realization of the $W_m$-algebras.
