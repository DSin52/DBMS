We search for alternatives to the trivial $\phi^4$ field theory by includingarbitrary powers of the self-coupling. Such theories are renormalizable whenthe natural cutoff dependencies of the coupling constants are taken intoaccount. We find a continuum of fixed points, which includes the well-knownGaussian fixed point. The fixed point density has a maximum at a locationcorresponding to a theory with a Higgs mass of approximately 2700 GeV. TheGaussian fixed point is UV stable in some directions in the extended parameterspace. Along such directions we obtain non-trivial asymptotically freetheories.
