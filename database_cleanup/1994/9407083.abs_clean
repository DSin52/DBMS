The relation between discrete topological field theories on triangulations oftwo-dimensional manifolds and associative algebras was worked out recently. Thestarting point for this development was the graphical interpretation of theassociativity as flip of triangles. We show that there is a more generalrelation between flip-moves with two $n$-gons and $Z_{n-2}$-graded associativealgebras. A detailed examination shows that flip-invariant models on a latticeof $n$-gons can be constructed {}from $Z_{2}$- or $Z_{1}$-graded algebras,reducing in the second case to triangulations of the two-dimensional manifolds.Related problems occure naturally in three-dimensional topological latticetheories.
