misprint corrected in eq.11Two dimensional classical string theory is solved in any curved spacetime.The complete spacetime required to describe the classical string motions turnsout to be larger than the global space required by complete particle geodesics.The solutions are fully classified by their behavior in the asymptotically flatregion of spacetime. When the curvature is smooth, the string solutions aredeformed folded string solutions as compared to flat spacetime folded stringsthat were known for 19 years. However, surprizing new stringy behavior becomesevident at curvature singularities such as black holes. The global propertiesof the classical string theory require that the ``bare singularity region'' ofthe black hole be included along with the usual black hole spacetime. Themathematical structure needed to describe the solutions include a recursionrelation that is analogous to the transfer matrix of lattice theories. Thisencodes lattice-like properties on the worldsheet on the one hand and thegeometry of spacetime on the other hand. A case is made for the presence offolded strings in the quantum theory of non-critical strings for $d\geq 2$.
