It was shown by Garriga and Vilenkin that the circular shape of nucleatedcosmic strings, of zero loop-energy in de Sitter space, is stable in the sensethat the ratio of the mean fluctuation amplitude to the loop radius isconstant. This result can be generalized to all expanding strings (of non-zeroloop-energy) in de Sitter space. In other curved spacetimes the situation,however, may be different.In this paper we develop a general formalism treating fluctuations aroundcircular strings embedded in arbitrary spatially flat FRW spacetimes. Asexamples we consider Minkowski space, de Sitter space and power law expandinguniverses. In the special case of power law inflation we find that in certaincases the fluctuations grow much slower that the radius of the underlyingunperturbed circular string. The inflation of the universe thus tends to washout the fluctuations and to stabilize these strings.
