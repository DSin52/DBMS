Title: Light-front Quantized Scalar Field Theory and Phase Transition

Comments: pages, Plain-tex. Expanded version of hep-th/9412205

The light-front Hamiltonian formulation for the scalar field theory containsa new ingredient in the form of a constraint equation. Renormalization of thetwo dimensional $\phi^{4}$ theory, described in the continuum, is discussed.The mass renormalization condition and the renormalized constraint equationcontain all the information to describe the phase transition in the theory,which is found to be of the second order. We argue that the same result wouldalso be obtained in the conventional equal-time formulation.
