We describe a topological string theory which reproduces many aspects of the1/N expansion of SU(N) Yang-Mills theory in two spacetime dimensions in thezero coupling (A=0) limit. The string theory is a modified version oftopological gravity coupled to a topological sigma model with spacetime astarget. The derivation of the string theory relies on a new interpretation ofGross and Taylor's ``\Omega^{-1} points.'' We describe how inclusion of thearea, coupling of chiral sectors, and Wilson loop expectation values can beincorporated in the topological string approach.
