We study the cohomology of the critical $W_4$ string using the $W_4$ BRSTcharge in a special basis in which it contains three separately nilpotent BRSTcharges. This allows us to obtain the physical operators in three steps. In thefirst step we obtain the cohomology associated to a spin-four constraint only,and it contains operators of the $c={4\over5}$ $W_3$ minimal model. In the nextstep, where the spin-three constraint is added, these operators get dressed tooperators of the $c={7\over10}$ Virasoro minimal model. Finally, the Virasoroconstraint is added to obtain the cohomology of the critical $W_4$ string. Wedescribe the structure of the complete cohomology and compare with otherresults.
