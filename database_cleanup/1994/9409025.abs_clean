We study in detail the structure of the Yangian Y(gl(N)) and of some newYangian-type algebras called twisted Yangians. The algebra Y(gl(N)) is a`quantum' deformation of the universal enveloping algebra U(gl(N)[x]), wheregl(N)[x] is the Lie algebra of gl(N)-valued polynomial functions. The twistedYangians are quantized enveloping algebras of certain twisted Lie algebras ofpolynomial functions which are naturally associated to the B, C, and D seriesof the classical Lie algebras.
