We construct five independent screening currents associated with the$U_q(\widehat{sl(3)})$ quantum current algebra. The screening currents areexpressed as exponentials of the eight basic deformed bosonic fields that arerequired in the quantum analogue of the Wakimoto realization of the currentalgebra. Four of the screening currents are `simple', in that each one is givenas a single exponential field. The fifth is expressed as an infinite sum ofexponential fields. For reasons we discuss, we expect that the structure of thescreening currents for a general quantum affine algebra will be similar to the$U_q(\widehat{sl(3)})$ case.
