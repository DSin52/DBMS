Title: Sp(2) Covariant Quantisation of General Gauge Theories

Comments: 8 pages. Tex file

This letter studies the Sp(2) covariant quantisation of gauge theories. Thegeometrical interpretation of gauge theories in terms of quasi principal fibrebundles $Q(M_S, G_S)$ is reviewed. It is then described the Sp(2) algebra ofordinary Yang-Mills theory. A consistent formulation of covariant lagrangianquantisation for general gauge theories based on Sp(2) BRST symmetry isestablished. The original N=1, ten dimensional superparticle is considered asan example of infinitely reducible gauge algebras, and given explicitly itsSp(2) BRST invariant action.
