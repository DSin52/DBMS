Title: Conjugacy classes of involutive automorphisms of the $C_{\ell}^{(1)}$

affine Kac-Moody algebrasComments: 27 pages. Accepted for publication in Journal of Group Theory in

PhysicsThe conjugacy classes of the involutive automorphisms of the affine Kac-Moodyalgebras \Cli\ for $\ell\geq 2$ are determined using the matrix formulation ofautomorphisms of an affine Kac-Moody algebra.
