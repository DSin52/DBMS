Title: Tachyonic neutrinos?

Comments: 8 pp., RevTeX (AmSsymb removed, due to reported troubles with

processing)It is shown that tachyons are associated with unitary representations ofPoincare mappings induced from SO(2) little group instead of SO(2,1) one. Thisallows us to treat more seriously possibility that neutrinos are fermionictachyons according to the present experimental data.
