We calculate the quantum corrections to the entropy of a very large blackhole, coming from the theory of a $D$-dimensional, non-critical bosonic string.We show that, for $D >2$, as a result of modular invariance the entropy isultraviolet finite, although it diverges in the infrared (while for $D=2$ theentropy contains both ultraviolet and infrared divergences). The issue ofmodular invariance in field theory, in connection with black-hole entropy, isalso investigated.
