We give the general analytic solutions derived from the low energy stringeffective action for four dimensional Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models withdilaton and antisymmetric tensor field, considering both long and shortwavelength modes of the $H$-field. The presence of a homogeneous $H$-fieldsignificantly modifies the evolution of the scale factor and dilaton. Inparticular it places a lower bound on the allowed value of the dilaton. Thescale factor also has a lower bound but our solutions remain singular as theyall contain regions where the spacetime curvature diverges signalling abreakdown in the validity of the effective action. We extend our results to thesimplest Bianchi I metric in higher dimensions with only two scale factors. Weagain give the general analytic solutions for long and short wavelength modesfor the $H$ field restricted to the three dimensional space, which produces ananisotropic expansion. In the case of $H$ field radiation (wavelengths withinthe Hubble length) we obtain the usual four dimensional radiation dominated FRWmodel as the unique late time attractor.
