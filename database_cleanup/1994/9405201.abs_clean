We introduce fusion $U_q(G^{(1)}_2)$ vertex models related to fundamentalrepresentations. The eigenvalues of their row to row transfer matrices arederived through analytic Bethe ans{\"a}tze. By combining these results with ourprevious studies on functional relations among transfer matrices(the$T$-system), we conjecture explicit eigenvalues for a wide class of fusionmodels. These results can be neatly expressed in terms of a Yangian analogue ofthe Young tableaux.
