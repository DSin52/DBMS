We describe the bound state and scattering properties of a quantum mechanicalparticle in a scalar $N$-prong potential. Such a study is of special interestsince these situations are intermediate between one and two dimensions. Theenergy levels for the special case of $N$ identical prongs exhibit analternating pattern of non-degeneracy and $(N-1)$ fold degeneracy. It is shownthat the techniques of supersymmetric quantum mechanics can be used to generatenew solutions. Solutions for prongs of arbitrary lengths are developed.Discussions of tunneling in $N$-well potentials and of scattering for piecewiseconstant potentials are given. Since our treatment is for general values of$N$, the results can be studied in the large $N$ limit. A somewhat surprisingresult is that a free particle incident on an $N$-prong vertex undergoescontinuously increased backscattering as the number of prongs is increased.
