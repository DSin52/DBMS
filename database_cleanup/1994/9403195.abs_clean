By exploiting standard facts about $N=1$ and $N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Millstheory, the Donaldson invariants of four-manifolds that admit a Kahler metriccan be computed. The results are in agreement with available mathematicalcomputations, and provide a powerful check on the standard claims aboutsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.
