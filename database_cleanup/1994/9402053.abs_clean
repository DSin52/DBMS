We determine the excitations and $S$ matrix of an integrable isotropicantiferromagnetic quantum spin chain of alternating spin 1/2 and spin 1. There(``spinor'') kink, and a new spin 0 (``scalar'') kink. Remarkably, thescalar-spinor scattering is nontrivial, yet the spinor-spinor scattering is thesame as if the scalar kinks were absent. Moreover, there is no scalar-scalarscattering.
