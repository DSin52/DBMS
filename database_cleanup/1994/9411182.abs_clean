Canonical quantization of the Wess-Zumino (WZ) model including chiralinteraction with gauge field is considered for the case of a degenerate action.The two-dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills model and the four-dimensional SU(3)chiral gauge model proposed in the paper \cite{fss} are studied in details.Gauge invariance of the quantum theory is established at the formal level.
