Pairs $\aa \subset \bb$ of local quantum field theories are studied, where$\aa$ is a chiral conformal \qft and $\bb$ is a local extension, either chiralor two-dimensional. The local correlation functions of fields from $\bb$ havean expansion with respect to $\aa$ into \cfb s, which are non-local in general.Two methods of computing characteristic invariant ratios of structure constantsthe braid group in the space of solutions of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikovdifferential equation, and $(b)$ by an analysis of the local subfactorsassociated with the extension with methods from operator algebra (Jones theory)and algebraic quantum field theory. Both approaches apply also to the reverseextensions of a given theory.
