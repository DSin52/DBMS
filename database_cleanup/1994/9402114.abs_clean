Calculating the (a,c) ring of the maximal phase orbifold for `invertible'Landau--Ginzburg models, we show that the Berglund--H"ubsch construction worksfor all potentials of the relevant type. The map that sends a monomial in theoriginal model to a twisted state in the orbifold representation of the mirroris constructed explicitly. Via this map, the OP selection rules of the chiralring exactly correspond to the twist selection rules for the orbifold. Thisshows that we indeed arrive at the correct point in moduli space, and that themirror map can be extended to arbitrary orbifolds, including non-abelian twistsand discrete torsion, by modding out the appropriate quantum symmetries.
