In this paper we show that there exists a new class of topological fieldtheories, whose correlators are intersection numbers of cohomology classes in aconstrained moduli space. Our specific example is a formulation of 2Dtopological gravity. The constrained moduli-space is the Poincare' dual of thetop Chern-class of the bundle $E_\rightarrow {\cal M}_g$, whose sections arethe holomorphic differentials. Its complex dimension is $2g-3$, rather then$3g-3$. We derive our model by performing the A-topological twist of N=2supergravity, that we identify with N=2 Liouville theory, whose rheonomicconstruction is also presented. The peculiar field theoretical mechanism,rooted in BRST cohomology, that is responsible for the constraint on modulispace is discussed, the key point being the fact that the graviphoton becomes aLagrange multiplier after twist. The relation with conformal field theories isalso explored. Our formulation of N=2 Liouville theory leads to arepresentation of the N=2 superconformal algebra with $c=6$, instead of thevalue $c=9$ that is obtained by untwisting the Verlinde and Verlindeformulation of topological gravity. The reduced central charge is the shadow,in conformal field theory, of the constraint on moduli space.
