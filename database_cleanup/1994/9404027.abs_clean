A new general Lie-algebraic approach is proposed to solving evolution tasksin some nonlinear problems of quantum physics with polynomially deformed Liealgebras $su_{pd}(2)$ as their dynamic symmetry algebras.The method makes use of an expansion of the evolution operators by powerseries in the $su_{pd}(2)$ shift operators and a (recursive) reduction offinding coefficient functions to solving auxiliary exactly solvable $su(2)$problems with quadratic Hamiltonians.
