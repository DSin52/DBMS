Title: Many Q-Particles from One

Comments: 16 pp., latex file

We propose a nonstandard approach to solving the apparent incompatibilitybetween the coalgebra structure of some inhomogeneous quantum groups and theirnatural complex conjugation. In this work we sketch the general idea anddevelop the method in detail on a toy-model; the latter is a q-deformation ofthe Hopf algebra of 1-dim translations + dilatations. We show how to get allHilbert space representations of the latter from tensor products of thefundamental ones; physically, this corresponds to constructing compositesystems of many free distinct q-particles in terms of the basic one-particleones. The spectrum of the total momentum turns out to be the same as that of aone-particle momentum, i.e. of the form $\{\mu q^n\}_{n\in\zn}$.
