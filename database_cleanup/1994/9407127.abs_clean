Title: New Link Invariants and Yang-Baxter Equation

Comments: 22 pages

We have new solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation, from which we haveconstructed new link invariants containing more than two arbitrary parameters.This may be regarded as a generalization of the Jones' polynomial. We have alsofound another simpler invariant which discriminates only the linking structureof knots with each other, but not details of individual knot.
