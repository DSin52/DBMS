We prove that a large class of leading order string solutions whichgeneralize both the plane-wave and fundamental string backgrounds are, in fact,exact solutions to all orders in \alpha'. These include, in particular, thetraveling waves along the fundamental string. The key features of thesesolutions are a null symmetry and a chiral coupling of the string to thebackground. Using dimensional reduction, one finds that the extremal electricdilatonic black holes and their recently discovered generalizations with NUTcharge and rotation are also exact solutions. We show that our bosonicsolutions are also exact solutions of the heterotic string theory with no extragauge field background.
