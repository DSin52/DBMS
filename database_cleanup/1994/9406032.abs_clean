The Kahler moduli space of a particular non-simply-connected Calabi-Yaumanifold is mapped out using mirror symmetry. It is found that, for the modelconsidered, the chiral ring may be identical for different associated conformalfield theories. This ambiguity is explained in terms of both A-model andB-model language. It also provides an apparent counterexample to the globalTorelli problem for Calabi-Yau threefolds.
