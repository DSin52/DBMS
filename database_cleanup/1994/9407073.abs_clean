The Feigenbaum constants $\alpha$ and $\delta$ for the three-siteantiferromagnetic Ising spin model on Husimi tree are calculated. It is shownthat the numerical values of these constants for this real physical systemcoincide with the famous universal Feigenbaum constants with high accuracy. Thequantitative description from ordering to chaos is also obtained.
