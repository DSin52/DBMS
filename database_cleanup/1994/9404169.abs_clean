We analyze the quantization of dynamical systems that do not involve anybackground notion of space and time. We give a set of conditions for theintroduction of an intrinsic time in quantum mechanics. We show that theseconditions are a generalization of the usual procedure of deparametrization ofrelational theories with hamiltonian constraint that allow to include systemswith an evolving Hilbert Space. We apply our quantization procedure to theparametrized free particle and to some explicit examples of dynamical systemwith an evolving Hilbert space. Finally, we conclude with some considerationsconcerning the quantum gravity case.
