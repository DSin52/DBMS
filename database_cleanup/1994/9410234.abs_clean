Based on the scaling relation for the dynamics at the early time, a newmethod is proposed to measure both the static and dynamic critical exponents.The method is applied to the two dimensional Ising model. The results are ingood agreement with the existing results. Since the measurement is carried outin the initial stage of the relaxation process starting from independentinitial configurations, our method is efficient.
