Structure constants of minimal conformal theories are reconsidered. It isshown that {\it ratios} of structure constants of spin zero fields of anon-diagonal theory over the same evaluated in the diagonal theory are given bya simple expression in terms of the components of the eigenvectors of theadjacency matrix of the corresponding Dynkin diagram. This is proved byinspection, which leads us to carefully determine the {\it signs} of thestructure constants that had not all appeared in the former works on thesubject. We also present a proof relying on the consideration of latticecorrelation functions and speculate on the extension of these identities tomore complicated theories.
