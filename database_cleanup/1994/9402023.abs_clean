A canonical basis of global Dirac's observables for Yang-Mills theory withfermions are obtained in a functional space in which Gribov ambiguity is absentand Gauss' laws can be solved exactly. In terms of these observables, one canexpress the Lagrangian, the Hamiltonian, non-Abelian and topological charges.The problem of the covariantization of these non-local and non-polynomialquantities is solved. From a relativistic presymplectic approach to thelocalization of the relativistic center-of-mass of the field configuration, aultraviolet cutoff is deduced.
