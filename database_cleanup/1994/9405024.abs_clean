In four-dimensional compactifications of the heterotic superstring theory theK\"ahler potential has a form which generically induces a superpotential massterm for Higgs particles once supersymmetry is broken at low energies. This``$\mu$-term'' is analyzed in a model-independent way at the tree level and inthe one-loop approximation, and explicit expressions are obtained for orbifoldcompactifications. Additional contributions which arise in the case ofsupersymmetry breaking induced by gaugino condensation are also discussed.
