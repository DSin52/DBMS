Based on the formulation of Drinfel'd, Chari, and Pressley, a technique toanalyze the structure of tensor products of the Yangian algebra representationsis presented. We then apply the results to the $S$-matrix theory of the$G\tensor G$-invariant nonlinear $\sigma$-model ($G$-principal chiral model) byOgievetsky, Reshetikhin, and Wiegmann. We show how the physical data such asmass formula, fusion angle, and the spins of integrals of motion can beextracted from the Yangian highest weight representations.
