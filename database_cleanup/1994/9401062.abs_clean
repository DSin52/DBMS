We study two-dimensional gauge theories with fundamental fermions and ageneral first order gauge-field Lagrangian. For the case of U(1) we show howstandard bosonization of the Schwinger model generalizes to give mesonsinteracting through a general Landau-Ginzburg potential. We then show how for asubclass of SU(N) theories, 't Hooft's solution of large N two-dimensional QCDcan be generalized in a consistent and natural manner. We finally point out thepossible relevance of studying these theories to the string formulation oftwo-dimensional QCD as well as to understanding QCD in higher dimensions.
