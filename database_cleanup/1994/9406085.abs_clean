Entropy arises in strong interactions by a dynamical separation of``partons'' from unobservable ``environment'' modes due to confinement. Forinteracting scalar fields we calculate the statistical entropy of theobservable subsystem. Diagonalizing its functional density matrix yields fieldpointer states and their probabilities in terms of Wightman functions. It alsoindicates how to calculate a finite geometric entropy proportional to a surfacearea.
