The lattice model of principal chiral field interacting with the gaugefields, which have no kinetic term, is considered. This model can be regardedas a strong coupling limit of lattice gauge theory at finite temperature. Thecomplete set of equations for collective field variables is derived in thelarge N limit and the phase structure of the model is studied.
