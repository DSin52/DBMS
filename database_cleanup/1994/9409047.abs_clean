By calculating the response function, we study the Hawking radiation ofmassless Dirac fields in the (2+1)-dimensional black hole geometry. We findthat the response function has Planck distributions, with the temperature thatagrees with the previous results obtained for the scalar field cases. We alsofind the Green's functions in (2+1)-dimensional Einstein static universe andanti de-Sitter space.
