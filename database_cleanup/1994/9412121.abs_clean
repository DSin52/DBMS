Theory, Zvenigorod, Russia, 14-19 September 1994; LaTeX, 5 pagesDefinition of Feynman integrals as solutions of some well defined systems ofdifferential equations is proposed. This definition is equivalent to usual onebut needs no regularization and application of $R$-operation. It is argued thatproposed renormalization scheme maintains all symmetries that can be maintainedin perturbative quantum field theory, and also is convenient for practicalcalculations.
