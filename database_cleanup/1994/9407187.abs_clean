It is known that certain properties of charged dilaton black holes depend ona free parameter $\beta$ which controls the strength of the coupling of thedilaton to the Maxwell field. We obtain the energy associated with staticspherically symmetric charged dilaton black holes for arbitrary value of thecoupling parameter and find that the energy distribution depends on the valueof $\beta$. With increasing radial distance, the energy in a sphere increasesfor $\beta = 0$ as well as for $\beta < 1$, decreases for $\beta > 1$, andremains constant for $\beta = 1$. However, the total energy turns out to be thesame for all values of $\beta$.
