Title: On a non-CP-violating electric dipole moment of elementary particles

Authors: J. Giesen

Comments: 7 pages, LATEX, JG11/94

A description of elementary particles should be based on irreduciblerepresentations of the Poincar\'e group. In the theory of massiverepresentations of the full Poincar\'e group there are essentially fourdifferent cases. One of them corresponds to the ordinary Dirac theory. Theextension of Dirac theory to the remaining three cases makes it possible todescribe an anomalous electric dipole moment of elementary particles withoutbreaking the reflections.
