We present a non-perturbative solution of large $N$ matrix models modified byterms of the form $ g(\Tr\Phi^4)^2$, which add microscopic wormholes to therandom surface geometry. For $g<g_t$ the sum over surfaces is in the sameuniversality class as the $g=0$ theory, and the string susceptibility exponentis reproduced by the conventional Liouville interaction $\sim e^{\alpha_+\phi}$. For $g=g_t$ we find a different universality class, and the stringsusceptibility exponent agrees for any genus with Liouville theory where theinteraction term is dressed by the other branch, $e^{\alpha_- \phi}$. Thisallows us to define a double-scaling limit of the $g=g_t$ theory. We alsoconsider matrix models modified by terms of the form $g O^2$, where $O$ is ascaling operator. A fine-tuning of $g$ produces a change in this operator'sgravitational dimension which is, again, in accord with the change in thebranch of the Liouville dressing.
