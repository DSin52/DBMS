The $\XXZ$ spin chain with a boundary magnetic field $h$ is considered, usingthe vertex operator approach to diagonalize the Hamiltonian. We find explicitbosonic formulas for the two vacuum vectors with zero particle content. Thereare three distinct regions when $h\geq0$, in which the structure of the vacuumstates is different. Excited states are given by the action of vertex operatorson the vacuum states. We derive the boundary $S$-matrix and present an integralformula for the correlation functions. The boundary magnetization exhibitsboundary hysteresis. We also discuss the rational limit, the $\XXX$ model.
