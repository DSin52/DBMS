A new construction using finite dimensional dual grassmannians is developedto study rational and soliton solutions of the KP hierarchy. In the rationalcase, properties of the tau function which are equivalent to bispectrality ofthe associated wave function are identified. In particular, it is shown thatthere exists a bound on the degree of all time variables in tau if and only ifthe wave function is rank one and bispectral. The action of the bispectralinvolution, beta, in the generic rational case is determined explicitly interms of dual grassmannian parameters. Using the correspondence betweenrational solutions and particle systems, it is demonstrated that beta is alinearizing map of the Calogero-Moser particle system and is essentially themap sigma introduced by Airault, McKean and Moser in 1977.
