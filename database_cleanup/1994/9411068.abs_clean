The general structure of trace anomaly, suggested recently by Deser andShwimmer, is argued to be the consequence of the Wess-Zumino consistencycondition. The response of partition function on a finite Weyl transformation,which is connected with the cocycles of the Weyl group in $d=2k$ dimensions isconsidered, and explicit answers for $d=4,6$ are obtained. Particularly, it isshown, that addition of the special combination of the local counterterms leadsto the simple form of that cocycle, quadratic over Weyl field $\sigma$, i.e.the form, similar to the two-dimensional Lioville action. This form alsoestablishes the connection of the cocycles with conformal-invariant operatorsof order $d$ and zero weight. Beside that, the general rule for transformationof that cocycles into the cocycles of diffeomorphisms group is presented.
