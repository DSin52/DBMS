In this letter a new gauge invariant, metric independent action is introducedfrom which Witten's Topological Quantum Field Theory may be obtained aftergauge fixing using standard BRST techniques. In our model the BRST algebra oftransformations, under which the effective action is invariant, close off-shellin distintion with what occurs in the one proposed by Labastida and Pernici.Our approach provides the geometrical principle for the quantum theory. We alsocompare our results with an alternative formulation presented by Baulieu andSinger.
