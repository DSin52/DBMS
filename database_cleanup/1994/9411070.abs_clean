Title: Deformation of infinite dimensional differential graded Lie algebras

Comments: 11 pages; AMS-TeX; no figures. A non-correct example was erased

We introduce a notion  of elliptic differential graded Lie algebra.The class of elliptic algebras contains such examples as the algebraof differential forms with values in endomorphisms of a flat vectorbundle over a compact manifold, etc.For elliptic differential graded algebra we construct a complete set ofdeformations.We show that for several deformation problems the existence of a formalpower series solution guarantees the existence of an analytic solution.
