We introduce the notion of locally trivial quantum principal bundles. Thebase space and total space are compact quantum spaces (unital$C^{\star}$-algebras), the structure group is a compact matrix quantum group.We prove that a quantum bundle admits sections if and only if it is trivial.Using a quantum version of \v{C}ech cocycles, we obtain a reconstructiontheorem for quantum principal bundles. The classification of bundles over agiven quantum space as a base space is reduced to the corresponding problem,but with an ordinary classical group playing the role of structure group. Someexplicit examples are considered.
