We derive an $su(1,1)$ coherent state path integral formula for a system oftwo one-dimensional anyons in a harmonic potential. By a change of variables wetransform this integral into a coherent states path integral for a harmonicoscillator with a shifted energy. The shift is the same as the one obtained foranyons by other methods. We justify the procedure by showing that the change ofvariables corresponds to a $su(1,1)$ version of the Holstein-Primakofftransformation.
