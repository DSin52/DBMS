We examine a simple heuristic test of integrability for quantum chains. Thistest is applied to a variety of systems, including a generic isotropic spin-1model with nearest-neighbor interactions and a multiparameter family ofspin-1/2 models generalizing the XYZ chain, with next-to-nearest neighborinteractions and bond alternation. Within the latter family we determine allthe integrable models with an o(2) symmetry.
