We consider light-cone quantized ${\rm{QCD}}_{1+1}$ on a `cylinder' withperiodic boundary conditions on the gluon fields. This is the framework ofdiscretized light-cone quantization. We review the argument that the light-conegauge $A^+=0$ is not attainable. The zero mode is a dynamical and gaugeinvariant field. The attainable gauge has a Gribov ambiguity. We exactly solvethe problem of pure glue theory coupled to some zero mode external sources. Weverify the identity of the front and the more familiar instant form approaches.We obtain a discrete spectrum of vacuum states and their wavefunctions.
