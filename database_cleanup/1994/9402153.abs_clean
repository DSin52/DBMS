Title: Towards a classification of rational Hopf algebras

Comments: 35 pages

Rational Hopf algebras (certain quasitriangular weak quasi-Hopf$^*$-algebras) are expected to describe the quantum symmetry of rational fieldtheories. In this paper methods are developped which allow for a classificationof all rational Hopf algebras that are compatible with some prescribed set offusion rules. The algebras are parametrized by the solutions of the square,pentagon and hexagon identities. As examples, we classify all solutions forfusion rules with two or three sectors, and for the level three affine $A_1$fusion rules. We also establish several general properties of rational Hopfalgebras, and we present a graphical description of the coassociator in termsof labelled tetrahedra which allows to make contact with conformal field theoryfusing matrices and with invariants of three-manifolds and topological latticefield theory.
