The renormalization-group improved effective potential ---to leading-log andin the linear curvature approximation--- is constructed for ``finite'' theoriesin curved spacetime. It is not trivial and displays a quite interesting,exponential-like structure ---in contrast with the case of flat spacetime whereit coincides with the classical potential. Several possible cosmologicalapplications, as curvature-induced phase transitions and modifications of thevalues of the gravitational and cosmological constants, are briefly discussed.
