We construct the chiral Wess-Zumino term as a solution for theBatalin-Vilkovisky master equation for anomalous two-dimensional gaugetheories, working in an extended field-antifield space, where the gauge groupelements are introduced as additional degrees of freedom.We analyze the Abelian and the non-Abelian cases, calculating in both casesthe BRST generator in order to show the physical equivalence between thischiral solution for the master equation and the usual (non-chiral) one.
