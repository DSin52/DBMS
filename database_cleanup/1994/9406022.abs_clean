We demonstrate in detail how the space of two-dimensional quantum fieldtheories can be parametrized by off-shell states of a free closed string movingin a flat background. The dynamic equation corresponding to the condition ofconformal invariance includes an infinite number of higher order terms, and wegive an explicit procedure for their calculation. The symmetries correspondingto equivalence relations of theories are described. In this framework we showhow to perform nonperturbative analysis in the low-energy limit and prove thatit corresponds to the Brans-Dicke theory of gravity interacting with a skewsymmetric tensor field.
