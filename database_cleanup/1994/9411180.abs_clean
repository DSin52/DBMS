A new local and gauge invariant quantum vortex operator is constructed inthree-dimensional gauge field theories. The correlation functions of thisoperator are evaluated exactly in pure Maxwell theory and by means of a loopexpansion in the Abelian Higgs model. In the broken symmetry phase of thelatter an explicit expression for the mass of the quantum vortices is obtainedfrom the long distance exponential decay of the two-point function.
