We re-examine three-dimensional gauge theory with a Chern-Simons term inwhich the Lorentz invariance is spontaneously broken by dynamical generation ofa magnetic field. A non-vanishing magnetic field leads, through theNambu-Goldstone theorem, to the decrease of zero-point energies of photons,which accounts for a major part of the mechanism. The asymmetric spectral flowplays an important role. The instability in pure Chern-Simons theory is alsonoted.
