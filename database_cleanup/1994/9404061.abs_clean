Extensions of standard one-dimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics arediscussed. Supercharges involving higher order derivatives are introducedleading to an algebra which incorporates a higher order polynomial in theHamiltonian. We study scattering amplitudes for that problem. We also study therole of a dilatation of the spatial coordinate leading to a q-deformedsupersymmetric algebra. An explicit model for the scattering amplitude isconstructed in terms of a hypergeometric function which corresponds to areflectionless potential with infinitely many bound states.
