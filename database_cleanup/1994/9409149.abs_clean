Hilbert Space DimensionsAuthors: Daniel I. Fivel

It is shown that the algebraic structure of finite Heisenberg groupsassociated with the tensor product of two Hilbert spaces leads to a simpledemonstration valid in all Hilbert space dimensions of the impossibility ofnon-contextual hidden variables.
