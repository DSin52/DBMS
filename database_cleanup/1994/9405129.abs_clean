We construct all instantons for the \nlsig\ on a cylinder, known not to existon a finite time interval. We show that the widest instantons go throughsphalerons. A re-interpretation of moduli-space transforms the scale parameter$\rho$ to a boundary condition in time. This may give a handle on the$\rho\rightarrow0$ divergent instanton gas.
