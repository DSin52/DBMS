In a recent publication we have investigated the spectrum of anomalousdimensions for arbitrary composite operators in the critical N-vector model in4-epsilon dimensions. We could establish properties like upper and lower boundsfor the anomalous dimensions in one-loop order. In this paper we extend theseresults and explicitly derive parts of the one-loop spectrum of anomalousdimensions. This analysis becomes possible by an explicit representation of theconformal symmetry group on the operator algebra. Still the structure of thespectrum of anomalous dimensions is quite complicated and does generally notresemble the algebraic structures familiar from two dimensional conformal fieldtheories.
