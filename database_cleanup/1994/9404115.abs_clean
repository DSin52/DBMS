Topological models involving matter couplings to Donaldson-Witten theory arepresented. The construction is carried using both, the topological algebra andits central extension, which arise from the twisting of $N=2$ supersymmetry infour dimensions. The framework in which the construction is based isconstituted by the superspace associated to these algebras. The models show newfeatures of topological quantum field theories which could provide either amechanism for topological symmetry breaking, or the analog of two-dimensionalmirror symmetry in four dimensions.
