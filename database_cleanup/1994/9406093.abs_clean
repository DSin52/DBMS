Memorial volumeWe study the gravitational waves in the 10-dimensional target space of thesuperstring theory. Some of these waves have unbroken supersymmetries. Theyconsist of Brinkmann metric and of a 2-form field. Sigma-model duality isapplied to such waves. The corresponding solutions we call dual partners ofgravitational waves, or dual waves. Some of these dual waves upon Kaluza-Kleindimensional reduction to 4 dimensions become equivalent to theconformo-stationary solutions of axion-dilaton gravity. Such solutions includedilaton extreme black holes, axion-dilaton Israel-Werner-Perjes-type spacetimesand extreme charged axion-dilaton Taub-Nut solutions. The unbrokensupersymmetry of the gravitational waves transfers to the unbrokensupersymmetry of axion-dilaton IWP solutions. More general supersymmetric4-dimensional configurations derivable from 10-dimensional waves are described.
