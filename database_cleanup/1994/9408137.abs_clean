SLAC--PUB--6640We investigate quantum corrections for a cosmological solution of the stringeffective action. Starting point is a classical solution containing anantisymmetric tensor field, a dilaton and a modulus field which hassingularities in the scalar fields. As a first step we quantize the scalarfields near the singularity with the result that the singularities disappearand that in general non-perturbative quantum corrections form a potential inthe scalar fields.
