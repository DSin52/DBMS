It is shown that if the momenta belong to an integral lattice, then everyphysical state of string theory leads to a symmetry of the scatteringamplitudes. We discuss the role of this symmetry when the momenta are thoseprovided by the usual D.D.F construction and show that the string compactifiedon the torus associated with the self-dual Lorentzian lattice, $\Pi^{25,1}$possess the Fake Monster Lie algebra as a symmetry.
