We consider an (N-2)-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold which is defined as thezero locus of the polynomial of degree N (of Fermat type) in CP^{N-1} and itsmirror manifold. We introduce the (N-2)-point correlation function (generalizedYukawa coupling) and evaluate it both by solving the Picard-Fuchs equation forperiod integrals in the mirror manifold and also by explicitly calculating thecontribution of holomorphic maps of degree 1 to the Yukawa coupling in theCalabi-Yau manifold using the method of Algebraic geometry...
