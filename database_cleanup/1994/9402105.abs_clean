In this note we present an explicit procedure for the regularization of treelevel amplitudes involving discrete states, using open string field theory. Weshow that there is a natural correspondence between the discrete states andoff--shell states, later acting as a regularized version of the former. Ageneral off-shell state corresponds to several physical states. In order toobtain the well--defined $S$ matrix elements one has to choose representativesclose but not equal to the desired values of external momenta. The procedurerenders finite all $4$-point amplitudes with an even number of (naively)divergent channels even after the regularization is removed. The rest of theamplitudes can be defined by means of such regularization.
