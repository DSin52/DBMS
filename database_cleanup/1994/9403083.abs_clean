We prove that the distributions defined on the Gelfand-Shilov spaces, andhence more singular than hyperfunctions, retain the angular localizabilityproperty. Specifically, they have uniquely determined support cones. Thisresult enables one to develop a distribution-theoretic techniques suitable forthe consistent treatment of quantum fields with arbitrarily singularultraviolet and infrared behavior. The proofs covering the most general caseare based on the use of the theory of plurisubharmonic functions andHormander's estimates.
