We extend the discussion of mirror symmetry, Picard-Fuchs equations,instanton-corrected Yukawa couplings, and the topological one-loop partitionfunction to the case of complete intersections with higher-dimensional modulispaces. We will develop a new method of obtaining the instanton-correctedYukawa couplings through a close study of the solutions of the Picard-Fuchsequations. This leads to closed formulas for the prepotential for the K\"ahlermoduli fields induced from the ambient space for all complete intersections innon singular weighted projective spaces. As examples we treat part of themoduli space of the phenomenologically interesting three-generation models thatare found in this class. We also apply our method to solve the simplest modelin which a topology change was observed and discuss examples of completeintersections in singular ambient spaces.
