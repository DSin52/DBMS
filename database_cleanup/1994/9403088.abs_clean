We discuss questions arising from the work of Schellekens. After introducingthe concept of complementary representations, we examine $Z_2$-orbifoldconstructions in general, and propose a technique for identifying the orbifoldtheory without knowledge of its explicit construction. This technique is thengeneralised to twists of order 3, 5 and 7, and we proceed to apply ourconsiderations to the FKS constructions $H(\Lambda)$ ($\Lambda$ an evenself-dual lattice) and the reflection-twisted orbifold theories $\widetildeH(\Lambda)$, which together remain the only $c=24$ theories which have so farbeen proven to exist. We also make, in the course of our arguments, somecomments on the automorphism groups of the theories $H(\Lambda)$ and$\widetilde H(\Lambda)$, and of meromorphic theories in general, introducingthe concept of deterministic theories.
