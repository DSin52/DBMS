We discuss solutions of the spherically symmetric wave equation and KleinGordon equation in an arbitrary number of spatial and temporal dimensions.Starting from a given solution, we present various procedures to generatefuther solutions in the same or in different dimensions. The transition fromodd to even or non integer dimensions can be performed by fractional derivationor integration. The dimensional shift, however, can also be interpreted simplyas a modification of the dynamics. We also discuss the analytic continuation toarbitrary real powers of the D'Alembert operator. There, particularpeculiarities in the pole structure show up when $p$ and $q$ are both even.Finally we give operators which transform a time into a space coordinate andv.v. and comment on their possible relation to black holes. In this context, wedescribe a few aspects of the extension of our discussion to a curved metrics.
