We discuss the nonlinear extension of $N=2$ superconformal algebra bygeneralizing Sugawara construction and coset construction built from $N=2$currents based on Kazama-Suzuki $N=2$ coset model $\frac{SU(3)}{SU(2) \timesU(1)}$ in $N=2$ superspace. For the generic unitary minimal series $c =6(1-\frac{3}{k+3})$ where $k$ is the level of $SU(3)$ supersymmetricWess-Zumino-Witten model, this algebra reproduces exactly $N=2$ $W_3$ algebrawhich has been worked out by Romans in component formalism.
