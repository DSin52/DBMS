Title: Noncommutative symmetric functions

ThibonComments: 111 pages

This paper presents a noncommutative theory of symmetric functions, based onthe notion of quasi-determinant. We begin with a formal theory, correspondingto the case of symmetric functions in an infinite number of independentvariables. This allows us to endow the resulting algebra with a Hopf structure,which leads to a new method for computing in descent algebras. It also givesunified reinterpretation of a number of classical constructions. Next, we studythe noncommutative analogs of symmetric polynomials. One arrives at differentconstructions, according to the particular kind of application underconsideration. For example, when a polynomial with noncommutative coefficientsin one central variable is decomposed as a product of linear factors, the rootsof these factors differ from those of the expanded polynomial. Thus, accordingto whether one is interested in the construction of a polynomial with givenroots or in the expansion of a product of linear factors, one has to considertwo distinct specializations of the formal symmetric functions. A third typeappears when one looks for a noncommutative generalization of applicationsrelated to the notion of characteristic polynomial of a matrix. Thisconstruction can be applied, for instance, to the noncommutative matricesformed by the generators of the universal enveloping algebra $U(gl_n)$ or of
