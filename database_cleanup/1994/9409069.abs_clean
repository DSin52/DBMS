We investigate how specific free-field realizations of twisted N=2supersymmetric coset models give rise to natural extensions of the ``matter''Hilbert spaces in such a manner as to incorporate the various gravitationalexcitations. In particular, we show that adopting a particular screeningprescription is equivalent to imposing the requisite equivariance condition oncohomology. We find a simple algebraic characterization of the$W_n$-gravitational ground ring spectra of these theories in terms ofaffine-$SU(n)$ highest weights..
