The recursion relations of 2D quantum gravity coupled to the Ising modeldiscussed by the author previously are reexamined. We study the case in whichthe matter sector satisfies the fusion rules and only the primary operatorsinside the Kac table contribute. The theory involves unregularized divergencesin some of correlators. We obtain the recursion relations which form a closedset among well-defined correlators on sphere, but they do not have a beautifulstructure that the bosonized theory has and also give an inconsistent resultwhen they include an ill-defined correlator with the divergence. We solve themand compute the several normalization independent ratios of the well-definedcorrelators, which agree with the matrix model results.
