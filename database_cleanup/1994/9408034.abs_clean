It is shown that the master equation of the affine-Virasoro construction onthe unitary affine algebra naturally emerges in the fusion algebra of thenonunitary level $k$ WZNW model. Operators corresponding to solutions of themaster equation are suitable for performing one-parametrical renormalizableperturbation around the given conformal nonunitary WZNW model. In the large$|k|$ limit, the infrared fixed point of the renormalization group betafunction is found. There are as many infrared conformal points as$\frac{1}{2}N(N+1)$, where $N$ is the total number of solutions of the masterequation.
