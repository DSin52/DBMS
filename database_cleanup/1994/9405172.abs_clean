Title: Event Symmetric Open String Field Theory

Authors: P. E. Gibbs

Comments: 7 pages, TeX, PEG-02-94

Field Theory on Event Symmetric space-time is constructed using the gaugegroup of discrete open strings. Models with invariant actions can be viewed asnatural extensions of Matrix Models. The objective is to find a fundamentalnon-perturbative pre-theory for superstrings.
