We review the classical boson-fermion correspondence in the context of the$\widehat{sl(2)}$ current algebra at level 2. This particular algebra is idealto exhibit this correspondence because it can be realized either in terms ofthree real bosonic fields or in terms of one real and one complex fermionicfields. We also derive a fermionic realization of the quantum current algebra$U_q(\widehat{sl(2)})$ at level 2 and by comparing this realization with theexisting bosonic one we extend the classical correspondence to the quantumcase.
