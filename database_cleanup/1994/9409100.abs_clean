We propose a contraction of the de Sitter quantum group leading to thequantum Poincare group in any dimensions. The method relies on the coaction ofthe de Sitter quantum group on a non--commutative space, and the deformationparameter $q$ is sent to one. The bicrossproduct structure of the quantumPoincar\'e group is exhibited and shown to be dual to the one of the$\kappa$--Poincar\'e Hopf algebra, at least in two dimensions.
