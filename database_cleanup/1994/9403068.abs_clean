There are investigated several objects of an INFINITE DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRYappearing from the second quantization of a free string. The paper contains 2fundamental and $\Pi$-spaces for Virasoro-Bott group and its nonassociativedeformation defined by Gelfand-Fuchs 3-cocycle (Gelfand-Fuchs loop) as well asof infinite-dimensional non-Euclidean symplectic grassmannian, to theconstructions of Verma modules, their models and skladens over Virasoroalgebra; an infinite dimensional geometry of the configuration space for thesecond quantized free string in flat and curved backgrounds as well as authorversion of Bowick- Rajeev formalism of the separation of internal and externaldegrees of freedom of a closed string are described in 2nd chapter. In the 1stchapter the main objects are infinite dimensional Lie algebras, groups andloops, homogeneous, K\"ahler, Finsler, contact and symmetric spaces, complex,real and CR-manifolds, determinant sheaves, manifolds with subsymmetries,polarizations and Fock spaces, bibundles and objects of integral geometry,nonholonomic spaces, deformations of geometric structures and moduli spaces. Inthe 2nd chapter they are gauge fields, Faddeev-Popov ghosts, Gauss-Maninconnections, Kostant-Blattner-Sternberg pairings, BRST-operators.
