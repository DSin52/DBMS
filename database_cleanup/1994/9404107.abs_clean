We study a relativistic anyon model with a spin-$j$ matter field minimallycoupled to a statistical gauge potential governed by the Chern-Simons dynamicswith a statistical parameter $\alpha$. A spin and statistics transmutation isshown in terms of a continuous random walk method. An integer orodd-half-integer part of $\alpha$ can be reabsorbed by change of $j$. Wediscuss the equivalence of a large class of (infinite number) Chern-Simonsmatter models for given $j$ and $\alpha$.
