Title: Some Concepts of Modern Algebraic Geometry

HomomorphismComments: 36 pages. This is a write-up of lectures given at the ``Kleine

Herbstschule 93'' of the Graduiertenkolleg ``Mathematik im Bereich IhrerWechselwirkungen mit der Physik'' at the Ludwig-Maximilians-UniversitaetMuenchenStarting from classical algebraic geometry over the complex numbers (as itcan be found for example in Griffiths and Harris it was the goal of theselectures to introduce some concepts of the modern point of view in algebraicgeometry. Of course, it was quite impossible even to give an introduction tothe whole subject in such a limited time. For this reason the lectures and nowthe write-up concentrate on the substitution of the concept of classical pointsby the notion of ideals and homomorphisms of algebras.
