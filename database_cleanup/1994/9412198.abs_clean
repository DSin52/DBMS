We show that the BRST structure of the topological string is encoded in the``small'' $N=4$ superconformal algebra, enabling us to obtain, in a non-trivialway, the string theory from hamiltonian reduction of $A(1|1)$. This leads tothe important conclusion that not only ordinary string theories, buttopological strings as well, can be obtained, or even defined, by hamiltonianreduction from WZW models. Using two different gradations, we find either thestandard $N=2$ minimal models coupled to topological gravity, or an embeddingof the bosonic string into the topological string. We also comment briefly onthe generalization to super Lie algebras $A(n|n)$.
