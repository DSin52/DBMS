A construction is proposed for linear connections on non-commutativealgebras. The construction relies on a generalisation of the Leibnitz rules ofcommutative geometry and uses the bimodule structure of $\Omega^1$. A specialrole is played by the extension to the framework of non-commutative geometry ofthe permutation of two copies of $\Omega^1$. The construction of the linearconnection as well as the definition of torsion and curvature is first proposedin the setting of the derivations based differential calculus of Dubois-Violette and then a generalisation to the framework proposed by Connes as wellas other non-commutative differential calculi is suggested. The covariantderivative obtained admits an extension to the tensor product of several copiesof $\Omega^1$. These constructions are illustrated with the example of thealgebra of $ n \times n$ matrices.
