The solutions of Einstein's equations admitting one non-null Killing vectorfield are best studied with the projection formalism of Geroch. When theKilling vector is lightlike, the projection onto the orbit space still existsand one expects a covariant theory with degenerate contravariant metric toappear, its geometry is presented here. Despite the complications ofindecomposable representations of the local Euclidean subgroup, one obtains anabsolute time and a canonical, Galilean and so-called Newtonian, torsionlessconnection. The quasi-Maxwell field (Kaluza Klein one-form) that appears in thedimensional reduction is a non-separable part of this affine connection, incontrast to the reduction with a non-null Killing vector. One may define theKaluza Klein scalar (dilaton) together with the absolute time coordinate afterhaving imposed one of the equations of motion in order to prevent the emergenceof torsion. We present a detailed analysis of the dimensional reduction usingmoving frames, we derive the complete equations of motion and propose an actionwhose variation gives rise to all but one of them. Hidden symmetries are shownto act on the space of solutions.
