We present the technical tools needed to compute any one-loop amplitudeinvolving external spacetime fermions in a four-dimensional heterotic stringmodel a` la Kawai-Lewellen-Tye. As an example, we compute the one-loopthree-point amplitude with one "photon" and two external massive fermions("electrons"). As a check of our computation, we verify that the one-loopcontribution to the Anomalous Magnetic Moment vanishes if the model hasspacetime supersymmetry, as required by the supersymmetric sum rules.
