Title: Gravitationally Dressed Conformal Field Theory and Emergence of

Logarithmic OperatorsAuthors: Adel Bilal and Ian I. Kogan

Comments: 7 pages, Princeton University preprint PUPT-1482

We study correlation functions in two-dimensional conformal field theorycoupled to induced gravity in the light-cone gauge. Focussing on the fermionfour-point function, we display an unexpected non-perturbative singularity$(x_1-x_2)^{-1}(x_3-x_4)^{-1}$ singularity into a logarithmic one plus anon-singular piece. We argue that this is related to the appearence of newlogarithmic operators in the gravitationally dressed operator productexpansions. We also show some evidence that non-conformal but integrable modelsmay remain integrable when coupled to gravity.
