Journal-ref: Alg.Anal. 6 (1994) 252

The non-commutative differential calculus on quantum groups can be extendedby introducing, in analogy with the classical case, inner product operators andLie derivatives. For the case of $\GL$ we show how this extended calculusinduces by coaction a similar extended calculus, covariant under $\GL$, on thequantum plane. In this way, inner product operators and Lie derivatives can beintroduced on the plane as well. The situation with other quantum groups andquantum spaces is briefly discussed. Explicit formulas are given for the twodimensional quantum plane.
