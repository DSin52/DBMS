A general overview of the history and present status of inflationarycosmology is given. Recent developments discussed in this paper include thehybrid inflation scenario, the theory of reheating, and the theory of inflatingtolopogical defects. We also discuss the theory of a stationaryself-reproducing inflationary universe, and its possible implications forevaluating the most probable values of the gravitational and cosmologicalconstants. Finally, we discuss some preliminary results concerning possiblenonperturbative large-scale deviations of density from the critical density ininflationary universe.
