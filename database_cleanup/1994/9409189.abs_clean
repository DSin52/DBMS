The standard formalism of quantum theory is enhanced and definite meaning isgiven to the concepts of experiment, measurement and event. Within thisapproach one obtains a uniquely defined piecewise deterministic algorithmgenerating quantum jumps, classical events and histories of single quantumobjects. The wave-function Monte Carlo method of Quantum Optics is generalizedand promoted to the level of a fundamental process generating all the realevents in Nature. The already worked out applications include SQUID-tank modeland generalized cloud chamber model with GRW spontaneous localization as aparticular case. Differences between the present approach and quantummeasurement theories based on environment induced master equations areare addressed. Possible applications of the new approach are suggested, amongthem connection between the stochastic commutative geometry andConnes'noncommutative formulation of the Standard Model, as well as potentialapplications to the theory and practice of quantum computers.
