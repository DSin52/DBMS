Several aspects of (0,2) Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds are investigated.Especially the elliptic genera are computed in general and, for a class ofmodels recently invented by Distler and Kachru, they are compared with the onesfrom (0,2) sigma models. Our formalism gives an easy way to calculate thegeneration numbers for lots of Distler-Kachru models even if they are based onsingular Calabi-Yau spaces. We also make some general remarks on theBorn-Oppenheimer calculation of the ground states elucidating its mathematicalmeaning in the untwisted sector. For Distler-Kachru models based onnon-singular Calabi-Yau spaces we show that there exist `residue' type formulasof the elliptic genera as well.
