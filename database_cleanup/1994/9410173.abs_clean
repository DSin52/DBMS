A $q$-deformed free spinning relativistic particle is discussed in theframework of the Lagrangian formalism. Three equivalent Lagrangians areobtained for this system which are endowed with $q$-deformed local (super)gaugesymmetries and reparametrization invariance. It is demonstrated that thesesymmetries are on-shell equivalent only for $ q = \pm1 $ under particularidentification of the transformation parameters. The same condition ($ q=\pm1$) emerges due to the requirement that the $q$-commutator of two supersymmetricgauge transformations should generate a reparametrization plus a supersymmetricgauge transformation. For a specific gauge choice, the solutions for equationsof motion respect $GL_{\surd q}(1|1)$ and $GL_{q}(2)$ invariances for anyarbitrary value of the evolution parameter characterizing the quantum superworld-line.
