We consider WZW models based on the non-semi-simple algebras that they wererecently constructed as contractions of corresponding algebras for semi-simplegroups. We give the explicit expression for the action of these models, as wellas for a generalization of them, and discuss their general properties.Furthermore we consider gauged WZW models based on these non-semi-simplealgebras and we show that there are equivalent to non-abelian dualitytransformations on WZW actions. We also show that a general non-abelian dualitytransformation can be thought of as a limiting case of the non-abelian quotienttheory of the direct product of the original action and the WZW action for thesymmetry gauge group $H$. In this action there is no Lagrange multiplier termthat constrains the gauge field strength to vanish. A particular result is thatthe gauged WZW action for the coset $(G_k \otimes H_l)/H_{k+l}$ is equivalent,in the limit $l\to \infty$, to the dualized WZW action for $G_k$ with respectto the subgroup $H$.
