Starting from a detailed analysis of the structure of pathspaces of the${\cal A}$-fusion graphs and the corresponding irreducible Virasoro algebraquotients $V(c,h)$ for the ($2,q$ odd) models, we introduce the notion of anadmissible pathspace representation. The pathspaces ${\cal P_A}$ over the${\cal A}$-Graphs are isomorphic to the pathspaces over Coxeter $A$-graphs thatappear in FB models. We give explicit construction algorithms for admissiblerepresentations. From the finitedimensional results of these algorithms wederive a decomposition of $V(c,h)$ into its positive and negative definitesubspaces w.r.t. the Shapovalov form and the corresponding signaturecharacters. Finally, we treat the Virasoro operation on the lattice induced byadmissible representations adopting a particle point of view. We use thisanalysis to decompose the Virasoro algebra generators themselves. Thisdecomposition also takes the nonunitarity of the ($2,q$) models into account.
