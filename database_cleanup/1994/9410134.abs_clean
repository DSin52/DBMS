It is shown that the Topological Massive and ``Self-dual'' theories, whichare known to provide locally equivalent descriptions of spin 1 theories in 2+1dimensions, have different global properties when formulated over topologicallynon-trivial regions of space-time. The partition function of these theories,when constructed on an arbitrary Riemannian manifold, differ by a topologicalfactor, which is equal to the partition function of the pure Chern-Simonstheory. This factor is related to the space of solutions of the field equationsof the Topological Massive Theory for which the connection is asymptoticallyflat but not gauge equivalent to zero. A new covariant, first order, gaugeaction,which generalize the ``Self-dual'' action, is then proposed. It isobtained by sewing local self-dual theories. Its global equivalence to theTopological Massive gauge theory is shown.
