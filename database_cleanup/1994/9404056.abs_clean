The Toda lattice hierarchy is discussed in connection with the topologicaldescription of the $c=1$ string theory compactified at the self-dual radius. Itis shown that when special constraints are imposed on the Toda hierarchy, itreproduces known results of the $c=1$ string theory, in particular the$W_{1+\infty}$ relations among tachyon correlation functions. These constraintsare the analogues of string equations in the topological minimal theories. Wealso point out that at $c=1$ the Landau-Ginzburg superpotential becomes simplya $U(1)$ current operator.
