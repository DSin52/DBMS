Title: Fundamental S-matrix for vector perturbed WD_n minimal models

Authors: A.Babichenko

Comments: Latex file. 10 pages. (reference was corrected)

Kink-kink S-matrix for integrable vector perturbed$WD_{n}^{(k)}$ minimalmodels is constructed from the Boltzmann weights of $A_{2n-1}^{(2)}$RSOS model and checked in two limit cases  $k=1$ and $k\rightarrow\infty$
