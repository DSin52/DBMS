A new class of two dimensional integrable field theories, based on themathematical notion of Poisson manifolds, and containing gravity-Yang-Millssystems as well as the G/G gauged Wess-Zumino Witten-model, are presented. Thelocal solutions of the classical equations of motions as well as a scheme forthe quantization in a Hamiltonian formulation is presented for the generalmodel. Partial results of a calculation of the partition function on arbitraryRiemann surfaces via path integral techniques are given.
