Using duality and topological theory of well behaved Hopf algebras (asdefined in [2]) we construct star-product models of non compact quantum groupsfrom Drinfeld and Reshetikhin standard deformations of enveloping Hopf algebrasof simple Lie algebras. Our star-products act not only on coefficient functionsof finite-dimensional representations, but actually on all $C^\infty$functions, and they exist even for non linear (semi-simple) Lie groups.
