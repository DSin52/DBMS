We construct the theoretical base for the search of the possible experimentalmanifestations of the torsion field at low energies. The weakrelativisticapproximation to the Dirac equation in an external torsion field is considered.For the sake of generality we introduce the external electromagnetic field inparallel. The generalized (due to torsion dependent terms) Pauly equationcontains new terms which have the different structure if compared with standardelectromagnetic ones. Just the same takes place for the weakrelativisticequations for spin $\frac{1}{2}$ particle in an external torsion andelectromagnetic field. It is given the brief description of the possibleexperiments.
