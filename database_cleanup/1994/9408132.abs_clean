We explore the Coleman-Weinberg phase transition in regions outside thevalidity of perturbation theory. For this purpose we study a Euclidean fieldtheory with two scalars and discrete symmetry in four dimensions. The phasediagram is established by a numerical solution of a suitable truncation ofexact non-perturbative flow equations. We find regions in parameter space wherethe phase transition (in dependence on the mass term) is of the second or thefirst order, separated by a triple point. Our quantitative results for thefirst order phase transition compare well to the standard perturbativeColeman-Weinberg calculation of the effective potential.
