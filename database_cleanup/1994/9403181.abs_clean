In $D=3,4,6$ and 10 space--time dimensions considered is a string modelinvariant under transformations of $N=1$ space--time supersymmetry and $n=D-2$local worldsheet supersymmetry with the both Virasoro constraints solved in thetwistor form. The twistor solution survives in a modified form even in thepresence of the heterotic fermions.
