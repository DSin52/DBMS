performed on pre- and post-selected quantum systems and the coupling to themeasuring device is weakened. The outcomes of weak measurements, ``weakvalues'' are very different for the eigenvalues of the measured operators. Theweak values yield novel rich structure of the quantum world. Weak values helpexplaining peculiar quantum phenomena and finding new effects which might havepractical applications.
