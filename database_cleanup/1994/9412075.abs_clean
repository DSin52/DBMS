We derive the large k asymptotics of the surgery formula for SU(2) Witten'sinvariants of general Seifert manifolds. The contributions of connectedcomponents of the moduli space of flat connections are identified. Thecontributions of irreducible connections are presented in a residue form. Thisform is similar to the one used by A. Szenes, L. Jeffrey and F. Kirwan. Thissimilarity allows us to express the contributions of irreducible connections interms of intersection numbers on their moduli spaces.
