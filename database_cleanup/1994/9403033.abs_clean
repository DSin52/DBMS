We realize the Hopf algebra $U_{q^{-1}}(so(N))$ as an algebra of differentialoperators on the quantum Euclidean space ${\bf R}_q^N$. The generators aresuitable q-deformed analogs of the angular momentum components on ordinary${\bf R}^N$. The algebra $Fun({\bf R}_q^N)$ of functions on ${\bf R}_q^N$splits into a direct sum of irreducible vector representations of$U_{q^{-1}}(so(N))$; the latter are explicitly constructed as highestweight representations.
