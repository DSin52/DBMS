Title: Light-Front Dynamics of Chern-Simons Systems

Comments: 15 pages, Plain-tex

Chern-Simons theory coupled to complex scalars is quantized on the light-front in the local light-cone gauge by constructing the self-consistenthamiltonian theory. It is shown that no inconsistency arises on using two localgauge-fixing conditions in the Dirac procedure. The light-front Hamiltonianturns out to be simple and the framework may be useful to constructrenormalized field theory of particles with fractional statistics ({\itanyons}). The theory is shown to be relativistic and the extra term in thetransformation of the matter field under space rotations, interpreted inprevious works as anomaly, is argued to be gauge artefact.
