We study the quasi-particle spectrum of the integrable three-state chiralPotts chain in the massive phase by combining a numerical study of the zeroesof associated transfer matrix eigenvalues with the exact results of theferromagnetic three-state Potts chain and the three-state superintegrablechiral Potts model. We find that the spectrum is described in terms ofquasi-particles with momenta restricted only to segments of the Brillouin zone$0\leq P \leq 2\pi$ where the boundaries of the segments depend on the chiralangles of the model.
