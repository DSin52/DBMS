Recently the scaling function of the dilute non-contractible self-avoiding 2Dpolymer loop on a cylinder was related to the Painleve III transcendent. Usingthe perturbation theory, the thermidynamic Bethe ansatz and numericalcalculations we argue a similar relation for the contractible self-avoidingloop.
