A method to construct Hamiltonian theories for systems of both ordinary andpartial differential equations is presented. The knowledge of a Lagrangian isnot at all necessary to achieve the result. The only ingredients required forthe construction are one solution of the symmetry (perturbation) equation andone constant of the motion of the original system. It turns out that thePoisson bracket structure for the dynamical variables is far from beinguniquely determined by the differential equations of motion. Examples inclassical mechanics as well as in field theory are presented.
