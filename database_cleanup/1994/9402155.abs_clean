The two-dimensional inhomogeneous zeta-function series (with homogeneous part(am^2+bmn+cn^2+q)^{-s}, \] is analytically continued in the variable $s$ byusing zeta-function techniques. A simple formula is obtained, which extends theChowla-Selberg formula to inhomogeneous Epstein zeta-functions. The newexpression is then applied to solve the problem of computing the determinant ofthe basic differential operator that appears in an attempt at quantizinggravity by using the Wheeler-De Witt equation in 2+1 dimensional spacetime withthe torus topology.
