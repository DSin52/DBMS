Title: The Hamiltonian Formulation of Higher Order Dynamical Systems

Comments: 17 pages. Revised

Using Dirac's approach to constrained dynamics, the Hamiltonian formulationof regular higher order Lagrangians is developed. The conventional descriptionof such systems due to Ostrogradsky is recovered. However, unlike the latter,the present analysis yields in a transparent manner the local structure of theassociated phase space and its local sympletic geometry, and is of directapplication to {\em constrained\/} higher order Lagrangian systems which arebeyond the scope of Ostrogradsky's approach.
