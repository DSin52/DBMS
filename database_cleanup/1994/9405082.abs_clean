Title: Exact Solutions of G-Invariant Chiral Equations

Authors: Tonatiuh Matos

Comments: 8 TeX pages. Seminar presented at the First Mexican-Russian Meeting

on Mathematical Physics, Mexico city, 1993We give a methodology for solving the chiral equations $(\alpha g_{,z}g^{-1})_{,\overline z} + (\alpha g_{,\overline z} g^{-1})_{,z} \ = \ 0 $ where$g$ belongs to some Lie group $G$. The solutions are writing in terms ofHarmonic maps. The method could be used even for some infinite Lie groups.(Preprint CIEA-gr-94/06)
