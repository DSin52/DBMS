Title: On the Universality of Nonperturbative effects in Stabilized 2D Quantum

GravityAuthors: Oscar Diego

Comments: 11 pages, latex, two figures ( 1 reference added )

In this letter I study the universality of the nonperturbative effects andthe vacua structure of the stochastic stabilization of the matrix models whichdefines Pure 2D Quantum Gravity. I show also that there is not tunneling, inthe continuum limit, between the one-arc and three-arc solutions of thesimplest matrix model which defines the flow between Pure Gravity and theLee-Yang model.
