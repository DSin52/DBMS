We show that any BRST invariant quantum action with open or closed gaugealgebra has a corresponding local background gauge invariance. If the BRSTsymmetry is anomalous, but the anomaly can be removed in the antifieldformalism, then the effective action possesses a local background gaugeinvariance. The presence of antifields (BRST sources) is necessary. As anexample we analyze chiral $W_3$ gravity.
