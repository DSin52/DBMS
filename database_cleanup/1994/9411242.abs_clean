We have calculated the first-order beta-functions for a sigma-model ( withdilaton) dualized with respect to an arbitrary Lie group that acts withoutisotropy. We find that non-abelian duality preserves conformal invariance forsemi-simple groups, but in general there is an extra contribution to thebeta-function proportional to the trace of the structure constants, whichcannot be absorbed into an additional dilaton shift. Two particular examples, aBianchi V cosmological background and the G \otimes G WZW model, are discussed.
