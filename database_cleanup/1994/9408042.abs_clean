In the present note we give an explicit integration of sometwo--dimensionalised Lotka--Volterra type equations associated with simple Liealgebras, other than the familiar $A_n$ case, possessing a representationwithout branching. This allows us, in particular, to treat the firstfundamental representations of $A_r$, $B_r$, $C_r$, and $G_2$ on the samefooting.
