We diagonalize the transfer matrix of the inhomogeneous vertex models of the6-vertex type in the anti-ferroelectric regime intoducing new types of q-vertexoperators. The special cases of those models were used to diagonalize the s-dexchange model\cite{W,A,FW1}. New vertex operators are constructed from thelevel one vertex operators by the fusion procedure and have the description bybosons. In order to clarify the particle structure we estabish new isomorphismsof crystals. The results are very simple and figure out representationtheoretically the ground state degenerations.
