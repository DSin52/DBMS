We discuss charged string solutions of the effective equations of D=4heterotic string theory with non-constant dilaton and modulus fields. Theeffective action contains a generic moduli-dependent coupling function in thegauge field kinetic term and a non-perturbative scalar potential. This is areview of hep-th/9307123 by M.
