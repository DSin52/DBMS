It is shown that the N-extended super $w_n$\ string can be obtained as aspecial class of vacua of both the N-extended super $w_{n+1}$\ string and the(N+1)-extended super $w_n$\ string. This hierarchy of super $w$\ stringtheories includes as subhierarchies both the superstring hierarchy given byBastianelli, Ohta and Petersen and the $w$\ string hierarchy given by theauthors.
