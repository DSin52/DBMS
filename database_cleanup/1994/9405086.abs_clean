Because of the existence of rigid Calabi--Yau manifolds, mirror symmetrycannot be understood as an operation on the space of manifolds with vanishingfirst Chern class. In this article I continue to investigate a particular typeof K\"ahler manifolds with positive first Chern class which generalizeCalabi--Yau manifolds in a natural way and which provide a framework formirrors of rigid string vacua. This class is comprised of a special type ofFano manifolds which encode crucial information about ground states of thesuperstring. It is shown in particular that the massless spectra of$(2,2)$--supersymmetric vacua of central charge $\hat{c}=D_{crit}$ can bederived from special Fano varieties of complex dimension $(D_{crit}+2(Q-1))$,$Q>1$, and that in certain circumstances it is even possible to embedCalabi--Yau manifolds into such higher dimensional spaces. The constructionsdescribed here lead to new insight into the relation between exactly solvablemodels and their mean field theories on the one hand and their correspondingCalabi--Yau manifolds on the other. It is furthermore shown that Witten'sformulation of the Landau--Ginzburg/Calabi--Yau relation can be applied to thepresent framework as well.
