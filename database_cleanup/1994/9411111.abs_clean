We investigate the distribution of energy density in a stationaryself-reproducing inflationary universe. We show that the main fraction ofvolume of the universe in a state with a given density $\rho$ at any givenmoment of time $t$ in synchronous coordinates is concentrated near the centersof deep exponentially wide spherically symmetric holes in the densitydistribution. A possible interpretation of this result is that a typicalobserver should see himself living in the center of the world. Validity of thisinterpretation depends on the choice of measure in quantum cosmology. Ourinvestigation suggests that unexpected (from the point of view of inflation)observational data, such as possible local deviations from $\Omega = 1$, orpossible dependence of the Hubble constant on the length scale, may tell ussomething important about quantum cosmology and particle physics at nearlyPlanckian densities.
