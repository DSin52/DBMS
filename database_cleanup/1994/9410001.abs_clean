We study the possible stationary persistent supercurrents flowing on acylindrical sample supporting a two-dimensional charged fluid. The internaldynamics of the fluid is obtained by means of an effective theory in which thefluid self-interacts through a $U(1)$ gauge field. We find that the presence ofpersistent supercurrents depends on what kind of gauge field it is. Inparticular the current is zero if it is a Maxwell gauge field, and it ismaximal if it is a Chern-Simons gauge field. There is an intermediate behaviourin presence of both Maxwell and Chern-Simons term. Therefore it appears thatpersistent supercurrents are possible only if the fluid is chiral.
