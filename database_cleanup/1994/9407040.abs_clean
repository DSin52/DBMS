Title: Strong Phase Correlations of Solitons of Nonlinear Schr\"odinger

EquationAuthors: A. G. Litvak, V. A. Mironov, and A. P. Protogenov

We discuss the possibility to suppress the collapse in the nonlinear 2+1 DSchr\"odinger equation by using the gauge theory of strong phase correlations.It is shown that invariance relative to $q$-deformed Hopf algebra withdeformation parameter $q$ being the fourth root of unity makes the values ofthe Chern-Simons term coefficient, $k=2$, and of the coupling constant,$g=1/2$, fixed; no collapsing solutions are present at those values.
