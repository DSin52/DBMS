We calculate the density of states with given mass and spin in string theoryand obtain asymptotic formulas. We also compute the tree-level gyromagneticcouplings for arbitrary physical states in the heterotic string theory. Theseresults are then applied to study whether fundamental strings can consistentlydescribe the microphysics of the black hole horizon in the case of a generalclassical solution characterized by mass, charge and angular momentum.
