The familiar generating functionals in quantum field theory fail to be truemeasures and, so they make the sense only in the framework of the perturbationtheory. In our approach, generating functionals are defined strictly as theFourier transforms of Gaussian measures in nuclear spaces of multimomentumcanonical variables when field momenta correspond to derivatives of fields withrespect to all world coordinates, not only to time.
