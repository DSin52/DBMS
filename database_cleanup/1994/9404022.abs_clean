(2+1) dimensional gravity is equivalent to an exactly soluble non-AbelianChern-Simons gauge field theory (E Witten 1988). Regarding this as thetopological phase of quantum gravity in (2+1)d, we suggest a topologicalsymmetry breaking by introducing a mass term for the gauge fields, whichcarries a space-time metric and local dynamical degrees of freedom. We considerthe finite temperature behavior of the symmetry broken phase, and claim arestoration of the topological invariance at some critical temperature. Thephase transition is shown of the zeroth order.
