corrected, references added, the assertion of quantum-mechanical equivalencefor composite particles is related to the statistical gauge field generatingsingular unitary and similarity transformations)We consider non-unitary similarity transformation, interconnecting the$W_{1+\infty}$ algebra representations for the fractional $\nu=\frac{1}{2p+1}$and integer $\nu=1$ filling fractions. This transformation corresponds to theintroduction of the complex abelian Chern-Simons gauge potentials, in terms ofwhich the field-theoretic description of FQHE can be developed. The Jain'scomposite fermion approach and Lopez-Fradkin equivalence assertion areconsidered from the point of view of unitary and similarity transformations. Asan application the second-quantized form of Laughlin function is derived.
