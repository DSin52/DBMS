We investigate the possibility that stringy nonperturbative effects appear asholes in the world-sheet. We focus on the case of Dirichlet string theory,which we argue should be formulated differently than in previous work, and wefind that the effects of boundaries are naturally weighted by $e^{-O(1/g_{\rmst})}$.
