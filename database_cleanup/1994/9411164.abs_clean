Gauge theories on manifolds with spatial boundaries are studied. It is shownthat observables localized at the boundaries (edge observables) can occur insuch models irrespective of the dimensionality of spacetime. The intimateconnection of these observables to charge fractionation, vertex operators andtopological field theories is described. The edge observables, however, may ormay not exist as well-defined operators in a fully quantized theory dependingon the boundary conditions imposed on the fields and their momenta. The latterare obtained by requiring the Hamiltonian of the theory to be self-adjoint andpositive definite. We show that these boundary conditions can also have nicephysical interpretations in terms of certain experimental parameters such asthe penetration depth of the electromagnetic field in a surroundingsuperconducting medium. The dependence of the spectrum on one such parameter isexplicitly exhibited for the Higgs model on a spatial disc in its London limit.It should be possible to test such dependences experimentally, the above Higgsmodel for example being a model for a superconductor. Boundary conditions forthe 3+1 dimensional $BF$ system confined to a spatial ball are studied. Theirphysical meaning is clarified and their influence on the edge states of thissystem (known to exist under certain conditions) is discussed. It is pointedout that edge states occur for topological solitons of gauge theories such asthe 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles.
