We study the conformal field theory of a free massless scalar field living onthe half line with interactions introduced via a periodic potential at theboundary. An $SU(2)$ current algebra underlies this system and the interactingboundary state is given by a global $SU(2)$ rotation of the left-moving fieldsin the zero-potential (Neumann) boundary state. As the potential strengthvaries from zero to infinity, the boundary state interpolates between theNeumann and the Dirichlet values. The full S-matrix for scattering from theboundary, with arbitrary particle production, is explicitly computed. Tomaintain unitarity, it is necessary to attribute a hidden discrete ``soliton''degree of freedom to the boundary. The same unitarity puzzle occurs in theKondo problem, and we anticipate a similar solution.
