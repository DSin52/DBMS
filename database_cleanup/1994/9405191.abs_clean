Electromagnetism would be a ``more unified'' theory if there were elementarymagnetic monopoles and/or particles with both electric and magnetic charges(dyons). I discuss the simplest possibilities for the addition of theseentities onto the Standard Model, and their empirical consequences. Lowerlimits on the masses of monopoles and dyons stemming from their quantum effectson current observables turn out to be much stronger than the existing limitsfrom direct searches. Anomalies in the three-photon decay of the $Z$ constitutegood specific signatures for monopoles or dyons. $T$-odd observables in the$e^+e^-\!\rightarrow\! W^+W^-$ process are signatures for dyons, but they areseverely constrained by existing data. The subjects of monopolium, monopolecosmology and non-elementary monopoles are also discussed.
