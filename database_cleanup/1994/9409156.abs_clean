Title: Unitarity of Quantum Theory and Closed Time-Like Curves

Comments: 13 pages, LaTeX. Final revised paper to be published in Phys Rev D.

Some changes are made to expand our discussion of Anderson's Proposal forrestoring unitarityJournal-ref: Phys.Rev. D52 (1995) 5773-5782

Interacting quantum fields on spacetimes containing regions of closedtimelike curves (CTCs) are subject to a non-unitary evolution $X$. Recently, aprescription has been proposed, which restores unitarity of the evolution bymodifying the inner product on the final Hilbert space. We give a rigorousdescription of this proposal and note an operational problem which arises whenone considers the composition of two or more non-unitary evolutions. We proposean alternative method by which unitarity of the evolution may be regained, byextending $X$ to a unitary evolution on a larger (possibly indefinite) innerproduct space. The proposal removes the ambiguity noted by Jacobson inassigning expectation values to observables localised in regions spacelikeseparated from the CTC region. We comment on the physical significance of thepossible indefiniteness of the inner product introduced in our proposal.
