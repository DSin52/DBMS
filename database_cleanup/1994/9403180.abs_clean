The multilevel field-antifield formalism is constructed in a geometricallycovariant way without imposing the unimodularity conditions on the hypergaugefunctions. Thus the previously given version [1,2] is extended to cover themost general case of Lagrangian surface bases. It is shown that the extrameasure factors, required to enter the gauge-independent functional integrals,can be included naturally into the multilevel scheme by modifying the boundaryconditions to the quantum master equation.
