We relate the Teichmuller spaces obtained by Hitchin to the Teichmullerspaces of $WA_{n}$-gravity. The relationship of this space to $W$-gravity isobtained by identifying the flat $PSL(n+1,{\BR})$ connections of Hitchin togeneralised vielbeins and connections. This is explicitly demonstrated for$WA_2=W_3$ gravity. We show how $W$-diffeomorphisms are obtained in thisformulation. We find that particular combinations of the generalised connectionplay the role of projective connections. We thus obtain $W$-diffeomorphisms ina geometric fashion without invoking the presence of matter fields. Thisdescription in terms of vielbeins naturally provides the measure for thegravity sector in the Polyakov path integral for $W$-strings.
