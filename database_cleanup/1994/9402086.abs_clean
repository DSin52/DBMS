Possible experimental manifestations of the contribution of heavyKaluza-Klein particles, within a simple scalar model in six dimensions withspherical compactification, are studied. The approach is based on theassumption that the inverse radius $L^{-1}$ of the space of extra dimensions isof the order of the scale of the supersymmetry breaking $M_{SUSY} \sim 1 \div10$ TeV. The total cross section of the scattering of two light particles iscalculated to one loop order and the effect of the Kaluza-Klein tower is shownto be noticeable for energies $\sqrt{s} \geq 1.4 L^{-1}$.
