Title: Information Loss in Black Holes and/or Conscious Beings?

Comments: 10 pages. LaTeX

In 1976 Stephen Hawking proposed that information may be lost from ouruniverse as a pure quantum state collapses gravitationally into a black hole,which then evaporates completely into a mixed state of thermal radiation.Although this proposal is controversial, it is tempting to consider analogousprocesses that might occur in certain theories of consciousness. For example,one might postulate that independent degrees of freedom be ascribed to themental world to help explain the feeling of a correlation between one's desiresand one's choice of actions. If so, one might ask whether information in thephysical world can be lost to such postulated degrees of freedom in the mentalworld. Or, one might hypothesize that the mental world can affect the physicalworld by modifying the quantum action for the physical world in acoordinate-invariant way (analogous to the alpha parameters in wormholetheory).
