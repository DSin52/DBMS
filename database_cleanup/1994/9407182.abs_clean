We discuss bosonization in three dimensions by establishing a connectionbetween the massive Thirring model and the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. Weshow, to lowest order in inverse fermion mass, the identity between thecorresponding partition functions; from this, a bosonization identity for thefermion current, valid for length scales long compared with the Comptonwavelength of the fermion, is inferred. We present a non-local operator in theThirring model which exhibits fractional statistics.
