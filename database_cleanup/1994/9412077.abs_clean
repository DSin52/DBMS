In Calabi--Yau compactifications of the heterotic string there existquantities which are universal in the sense that they are present in everyCalabi--Yau string vacuum. It is shown that such universal characteristicsprovide numerical information, in the form of scaling exponents, about thespace of ground states in string theory. The focus is on two physicalquantities. The first is the Yukawa coupling of a particular antigeneration,induced in four dimensions by virtue of supersymmetry. The second is thepartition function of the topological sector of the theory, evaluated on thegenus one worldsheet, a quantity relevant for quantum mirror symmetry andthreshold corrections. It is shown that both these quantities exhibit scalingbehavior with respect to a new scaling variable and that a scaling relationexists between them as well.
