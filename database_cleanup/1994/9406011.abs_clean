In this note, we extend the string theoretic calculation of the black holeentropy, first performed by Susskind and Uglum, away from the infinite masslimit. It is shown that the result agrees with that obtained from the classicalaction of string theory, using the Noether charge method developed by Wald.Also shown in the process is the equivalence of two general techniques forfinding black hole entropies-the Noether charge method, and the method ofconical singularities.
