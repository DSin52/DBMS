Title: (1,0) superparticle in a curved background and the full set of (1,0)

supergravity constraintsAuthors: A.A. Deriglazov and A.V. Galajinsky

Comments: 9 pages, TEX, report2

The classical (1,0) superparticle in a curved superspace is considered. Theminimal set of constraints to be imposed on the background for correctinclusion of interaction is found. The most general form of Siegel-type localfermionic symmetry is presented. Local algebra of the theory is shown to beclosed off-shell and nontrivially deformed as compared to the flat one. Therequirements leading to the full set of (1,0) supergravity constraints arepresented.
