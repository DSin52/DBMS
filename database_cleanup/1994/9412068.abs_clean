We present a study of the decay of metastable states of a scalar field viathermal activation, in the presence of a finite density of fermions. Theprocess we consider is the nucleation of ``{\it droplets}'' of true vacuuminside the false one. We analyze a one-dimensional system of interacting bosonsand fermions, considering the latter at finite temperature and with a givenchemical potential. As a consequence of a non-equilibrium formalism previouslydeveloped, we obtain time-dependent decay rates.
