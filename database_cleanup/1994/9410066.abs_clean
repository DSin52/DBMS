The transfer matrix of the 6-vertex model of two-dimensional statisticalphysics commutes with many (more complicated) transfer matrices, but theselatter, generally, do not commute between each other. The studying of theiraction in the eigenspaces of the 6-vertex model transfer matrix becomespossible due to a ``multiplicative property'' of the {\em vacuum curves\/} of$\cal L$-operators from which transfer matrices are built. This approachallowed, in particular, to discover for the first time the fact that thedimensions of abovementioned eigenspaces must be multiples of (big enough)degrees of the number 2.
