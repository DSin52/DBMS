We present a new form of the multi-boson reduction of KP hierarchy with Laxoperator written in terms of boson fields abelianizing the second Hamiltonianstructure. This extends the classical Miura transformation and theKupershmidt-Wilson theorem from the (m)KdV to the KP case. A remarkablerelationship is uncovered between the higher Hamiltonian structures and thecorresponding Miura transformations of KP hierarchy, on one hand, and thediscrete integrable models living on {\em refinements} of the original latticeconnected with the underlying multi-matrix models, on the other hand. For thesecond KP Hamiltonian structure, worked out in details, this amounts to findinga series of representations of the nonlinear $\hWinf$ algebra in terms ofarbitrary finite number of canonical pairs of free fields.
