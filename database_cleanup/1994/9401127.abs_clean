Title: Poisson-Lie structures on the external algebra of $SL(2)$ and their

quantizationComments: 17 pages. Latex errors corrected and references added

All possible graded Poisson-Lie structures on the external algebra of $SL(2)$are described. We prove that differential Poisson-Lie structures prolonging theSklyanin brackets do not exist on $SL(2)$. There are two and only two gradedPoisson-Lie structures on $SL (2)$ and neither of them can be obtained by areduction of graded Poisson-Lie structures on the external algebra of $GL(2)$.Both of them can be quantized and as a result we get a new graded algebra ofquantum right-invariant forms on $SL_q(2)$ with three generators.
