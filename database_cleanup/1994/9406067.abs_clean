We construct two new classes of exact solutions to string theory which arenot of the standard plane wave or gauged WZW type. Many of these solutions havecurvature singularities. The first class includes the fundamental stringsolution, for which the string coupling vanishes near the singularity. Thissuggests that the singularity may not be removed by quantum corrections. Thesecond class consists of hybrids of plane wave and gauged WZW solutions. Wediscuss a four dimensional example in detail.
