In a class of three-dimensional abelian gauge theory the Lorentz invarianceis spontaneously broken by dynamical generation of a magnetic field. Anoriginally topologically massive photon becomes gapless, i.e. p_0=0 at {\vecp}=0. Indeed, the photon is the Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with thespontaneous breaking of the Lorentz invariance. Although symmetry generated bytwo Lorentz boost generators is broken, there seems to appear only one physicalNambu-Goldstone boson, namely a photon. We argue that the Ward identities inthe Nambu-Goldstone theorem are saturated by the photon pole.
