Title: Cluster Estimates and Analytic Wavefunctions

Authors: D. R. Davidson

Comments: 12 pages, LaTeX

The Tomita-Takesaki modular theory is used to establish a cluster estimateextending and modifying that of Thomas and Wichmann, so as to extend it toregions within which the relevant observables are not necessarily spacelikeseparated. This sort of estimate is then applied to the case of a massive freefield, to show that wavefunctions localized in a certain sense are analyticfunctions of momentum.
