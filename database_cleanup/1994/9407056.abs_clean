"Hadron Physics 94," Proceedings, Gramado, Brazil (World Scientific, 1995)Light-front coordinates offer a scenario in which a constituent picture ofhadron structure can emerge from QCD, after several difficulties are addressed.Field theoretic difficulties force us to introduce cutoffs that violate Lorentzcovariance and gauge invariance, and a new renormalization group formalismbased on a similarity transformation is used with coupling coherence to fixcuonterterms that restore these symmetries. The counterterms contain functionsof longitudinal momentum fractions that severely complicate renormalization,but they also offer possible resolutions of apparent contradictions between theconstituent picture and QCD. The similarity transformation and couplingcoherence are applied to QED; and it is shown that the resultant Hamiltonianleads to standard lowest order bound state results, with the Coulombinteraction emerging naturally. The same techniques are applied to QCD and withphysically motivated assumptions it is shown that a simple confinementmechanism appears.
