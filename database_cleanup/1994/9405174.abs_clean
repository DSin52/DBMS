We derive a model of constrained topological gravity, a theory recentlyintroduced by us through the twist of N=2 Liouville theory, starting from thegeneral BRST algebra and imposing the moduli space constraint as a gaugefixing. To do this, it is necessary to introduce a formalism that allows acareful treatment of the global and the local degrees of freedom of the fields.Surprisingly, the moduli space constraint arises from the simplest and mostnatural gauge-fermion ({\sl antighost} $\times$ {\sl Lagrange multiplier}),confirming the previous results. The simplified technical set-up provides adeeper understanding for constrained topological gravity and a convenientframework for future investigations, like the matter coupling and the analysisof the effects of the constraint on the holomorphic anomaly.
