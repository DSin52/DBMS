Dominant weight multiplicities of simple Lie groups are expressed in terms ofthe modular matrices of Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theories, andrelated objects. Symmetries of the modular matrices give rise to new relationsamong multiplicities. At least for some Lie groups, these new relations arestrong enough to completely fix all multiplicities.
