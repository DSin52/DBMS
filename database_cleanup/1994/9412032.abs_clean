Title: Manifest supersymmetry and the ADHM construction of instantons

Authors: A. Galperin, E. Sokatchev

Comments: minor changes in the text; also an Appendix on off-shell structure of

chiral fermion multiplets in (0,4) supersymmetry, and references addedJournal-ref: Nucl. Phys. B452 (1995) 431

We present the (0,4) superspace version of Witten's sigma model constructionfor ADHM instantons. We use the harmonic superspace formalism, which exploitsthe three complex structures common to both (0,4) supersymmetry and self-dualYang-Mills theory. A novel feature of the superspace formulation is themanifest interplay between the ADHM construction and its twistor counterpart.
