We give an example of topological theory whose Hilbert space containsmoving in D-dimensional space-time equals the Lagrangian of a topological sigmamodel in a (D+2)-dimensional target. The equivalence is valid for a curvedspace-time. As an application, we calculate the deviation of spin-one particlesin a Schwarzschild background (gravitational Stern-Gerlach effect).
