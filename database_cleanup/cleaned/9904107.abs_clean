We use the earlier results on the correlations of axial gauge Green'sfunctions and the Lorentz gauge Green's functions obtained via finitefield-dependent BRS transformations to study the question of the correcttreatment of 1/(eta\cdot k)^p- type singularities in the axial gauge bosonpropagator. We show how the known treatment of the 1/(k^2)^n-type singularityin the Lorentz-type gauges can be used to write down the axial propagator viafield transformation. We examine the singularity structure of the latter andfind that the axial propagator so constructed has $no$ spurious poles, but acomplex structure near $\eta\cdot k=0$.
