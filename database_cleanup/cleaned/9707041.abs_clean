It is well known that spherically symmetric reduction of General Relativity(SSG) leads to non-minimally coupled scalar matter. We generalize (and correct)recent results to Hawking radiation for a class of dilaton models which sharewith the Schwarzschild black hole non-minimal coupling of scalar fields and thebasic global structure. An inherent ambiguity of such models (if they differfrom SSG) is discussed. However, for SSG we obtain the rather disquietingresult of a negative Hawking flux at infinity, if the usual recipe for suchcalculations is applied.
