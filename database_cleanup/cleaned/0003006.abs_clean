We give a survey of selected topics in noncommutative geometry, with someemphasis on those directly related to physics, including our recent work withDirk Kreimer on renormalization and the Riemann-Hilbert problem. We discuss atlength two issues. The first is the relevance of the paradigm of geometricspace, based on spectral considerations, which is central in the theory. As asimple illustration of the spectral formulation of geometry in the ordinarycommutative case, we give a polynomial equation for geometries on the fourdimensional sphere with fixed volume. The equation involves an idempotent e,playing the role of the instanton, and the Dirac operator D. It expresses thegamma five matrix as the pairing between the operator theoretic cherncharacters of e and D. It is of degree five in the idempotent and four in theDirac operator which only appears through its commutant with the idempotent. Itdetermines both the sphere and all its metrics with fixed volume form.We also show using the noncommutative analogue of the Polyakov action, how toobtain the noncommutative metric (in spectral form) on the noncommutative torifrom the formal naive metric. We conclude on some questions related to stringtheory.
