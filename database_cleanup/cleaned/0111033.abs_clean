The ``Laughlin'' picture of the Fractional Quantum Hall effect can be derivedusing the ``exotic'' model based on the two-fold centrally-extended planarGalilei group. When coupled to a planar magnetic field of critical strengthdetermined by the extension parameters, the system becomes singular, and``Faddeev-Jackiw'' reduction yields the ``Chern-Simons'' mechanics of Dunne,Jackiw, and Trugenberger. The reduced system moves according to the Hall law.
