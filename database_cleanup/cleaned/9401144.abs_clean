An effective sigma model describing behavior of the 3d rigid string with a$\theta$-term at $\theta=\pi$ is proposed. It contains non-perturbativecorrections resulting from summation over different genera of the 2d surfaces.The effective theory is the $SU(2)$ WZW model coupled to the Nambu-Goto action.RG analysis shows the existence of a IR fixed point at which the normal to thesurface has long range correlations. A similar model can describe criticalbehaviour of the 3d Y-M fields or the Ising model.
