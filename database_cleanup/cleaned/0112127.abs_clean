We study the behavior of the photon two point function, in non-commutativeQED, in a general covariant gauge and in arbitrary space-time dimensions. Weshow, to all orders, that the photon self-energy is transverse. Using anappropriate extension of the dimensional regularization method, we evaluate theone-loop corrections, which show that the theory is renormalizable. We alsoprove, to all orders, that the poles of the photon propagator are gaugeindependent and briefly discuss some other related aspects.
