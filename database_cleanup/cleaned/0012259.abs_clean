We study solutions at the minima of scalar field potentials for Moyal spacesand torii in the large non-commutativity and interprete these solitons in termsof non-BPS D-branes of string theory. We derive a mass spectrum formula linkingdifferent D-branes together on quantum torii and suggest that it describesgeneral systems of D-brane bound states extending the D2-D0 one. Then wepropose a shape for the effective potential approaching these quasi-stablebound states. We give the gauge symmetries of these systems of branes and showthat they depend on the quantum torii representations.
