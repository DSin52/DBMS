We construct unstable classical solutions of Yang-Mills theories and theirdual unstable states of type IIB on AdS_5. An example is the unstable D0-braneof type IIB located at the center of AdS. This has a field theory dual which isa sphaleron in gauge theories on S^3 x R. We argue that the two are dualbecause both are sphalerons associated to the topology of theinstanton/D-instanton. This agreement provides a non-supersymmetric test of theAdS/CFT duality. As an illustration, many aspects of Sen's hypothesis regardingthe unstable branes can be seen easily in the weakly coupled dual field theorydescription. In Euclidean AdS the D0-branes are dual to gauge theory merons.This implies that the two ends of a D0-brane world-line carry half the chargeof a D-instanton. Other examples involve unstable strings in the Coulomb phase.
