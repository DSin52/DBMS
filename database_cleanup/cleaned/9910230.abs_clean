Title: Anomalies for Nonlocal Dirac Operators

Authors: E. Ruiz Arriola and L. L. Salcedo

Comments: (LaTeX) 10 pages, 1 figure. Talk given by E. R. A. at the

International Workshop on Hadron Physics (Effective Theories of Low EnergyQCD), Coimbra (Portugal), 10-15 September 1999. (To appear in theproceedings)The anomalies of a very general class of non local Dirac operators arecomputed using the $\zeta$-function definition of the fermionic determinant andan asymmetric version of the Wigner transformation. For the axial anomaly allnew terms introduced by the non locality can be brought to the standard minimalBardeen's form. Some extensions of the present techniques are also commented.
