We consider open strings attached to a moving D$_p$-brane with motion alongitself, in the presence of the backgrounds $B_{\mu \nu}$-field and a U(1) gaugefield $A_{\alpha}$. The effects of the motion of the brane on the open stringpropagator and on the open string variables are studied. We observe that somefree parameters appear in the open string variables and in the propagator ofit.
