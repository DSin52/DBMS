Title: New Spacetime-Supersymmetric Methods for the Superstring

Comments: Talk at Strings '95 conference, 12 pages tex

In this talk, the new spacetime-supersymmetric description of the superstringis reviewed and some of its applications are described. These applicationsinclude the manifestly spacetime-supersymmetric calculation of scatteringamplitudes, the construction of a super-Poincar\'e invariant open superstringfield theory, and the beta-function calculation of low-energy equations ofmotion in superspace. Parts of this work have been done in collaboration withdeBoer, van Nieuwenhuizen, Ro\v{c}ek, Sezgin, Skenderis, Stelle, andespecially, Siegel and Vafa.
