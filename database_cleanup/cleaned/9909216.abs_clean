The g-function was introduced by Affleck and Ludwig as a measure of theground state degeneracy of a conformal boundary condition. We consider thisfunction for perturbations of the conformal Yang-Lee model by bulk and boundaryfields using conformal perturbation theory, the truncated conformal spaceapproach and the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA). We find that the TBAequations derived by LeClair et al describe the massless boundary flows, up toan overall constant, but are incorrect when one considers a simultaneous bulkperturbation; however the TBA equations do correctly give the `non-universal'linear term in the massive case, and the ratio of g-functions for differentboundary conditions is also correctly produced. This ratio is related to theY-system of the Yang-Lee model and by comparing the perturbative expansions ofthe Y-system and of the g-functions we obtain the exact relation between the UVand IR parameters of the massless perturbed boundary model.
