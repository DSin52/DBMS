It is generally admitted that gravitational interactions become large at aninvariant distance of order $1$ from the black hole horizon. We show that dueto the ``atmosphere'' of high angular particles near the horizon stronggravitational interactions already occur at an invariant distance of the orderof $\sqrt[3]{M}$. The implications of these results for the origin of blackhole radiation, the meaning of black hole entropy and the information puzzleare discussed.
