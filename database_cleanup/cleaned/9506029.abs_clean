In a superspace formulation of Yang-Mills theory previously proposed, we showhow gauge-invariant operators and scalars can be incorporated keeping intactthe (broken) $Osp(3,1|2)$ symmetry of the superspace action. We show in bothcases, that the WT identities can be cast in a simple form$\frac{\partial\bar{W}}{\partial\theta}=0$.
