The full U-duality symmetry of toroidally compactified M-theory can only bedisplayed by allowing non-rectangular tori with expectation values of the gaugefields. We construct an E_d(Z) U-duality invariant mass formula incorporatingnon-vanishing gauge backgrounds of the M-theory three-form C. We interpret thismass formula from the point of view of the Matrix gauge theory, and identifythe coupling of the three-form to the gauge theory as a topological theta term,in agreement with earlier conjectures. We give a derivation of this fact fromD-brane analysis, and obtain the Matrix gauge theory description of other gaugebackgrounds allowed by the Discrete Light-Cone Quantization. We further showthat the conjectured extended U-duality symmetry of Matrix theory on T^d in theDiscrete Light-Cone Quantization has an implementation as an action ofE_{d+1}(Z) on the BPS spectrum. Some implications for the proper interpretationof the rank N of the Matrix gauge theory are discussed.
