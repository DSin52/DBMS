The infinite matrices in Witten's vertex are easy to diagonalize. It justrequires some SL(2,R) lore plus a Watson-Sommerfeld transformation. Wecalculate the eigenvalues of all Neumann matrices for all scale dimensions s,both for matter and ghosts, including fractional s which we use to regulate thedifficult s=0 limit. We find that s=1 eigenfunctions just acquire a p term, andx gets replaced by the midpoint position.
