We review recent progress in 2D gravity coupled to $d<1$ conformal matter,based on a representation of discrete gravity in terms of random matrices. Wediscuss the saddle point approximation for these models, including a class ofrelated $O(n)$ matrix models. For $d<1$ matter, the matrix problem can becompletely solved in many cases by the introduction of suitable orthogonalpolynomials. Alternatively, in the continuum limit the orthogonal polynomialmethod can be shown to be equivalent to the construction of representations ofthe canonical commutation relations in terms of differential operators. In thecase of pure gravity or discrete Ising--like matter, the sum over topologies isreduced to the solution of non-linear differential equations (the Painlev\'eequation in the pure gravity case) which can be shown to follow from an actionprinciple. In the case of pure gravity and more generally all unitary models,the perturbation theory is not Borel summable and therefore alone does notdefine a unique solution. In the non-Borel summable case, the matrix model doesnot define the sum over topologies beyond perturbation theory. We also reviewthe computation of correlation functions directly in the continuum formulationof matter coupled to 2D gravity, and compare with the matrix model results.Finally, we review the relation between matrix models and topological gravity,and as well the relation to intersection theory of the moduli space ofpunctured Riemann surfaces.
