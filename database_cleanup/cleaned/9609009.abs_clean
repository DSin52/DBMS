An unusual four-dimensional generally covariant and supersymmetric SU(2)gauge theory is described. The theory has propagating degrees of freedom, andis invariant under a local (left-handed) chiral supersymmetry, which is halfthe supersymmetry of supergravity. The Hamiltonian 3+1 decomposition of thetheory reveals the remarkable feature that the local supersymmetry is aconsequence of Yang-Mills symmetry, in a manner reminiscent of how generalcoordinate invariance in Chern-Simons theory is a consequence of Yang-Millssymmetry. It is possible to write down an infinite number of conservedcurrents, which strongly suggests that the theory is classically integrable. Apossible scheme for non-perturbative quantization is outlined. This utilizesideas that have been developed and applied recently to the problem ofquantizing gravity.
