Title: Constraints on Higher Derivative Operators in Maximally Supersymmetric

Gauge TheoryAuthors: David A. Lowe and Rikard von Unge

Comments: 6 pages, harvmac. Note added. (Only a subset of the leading

irrelevant operators have been shown to be one-loop exact.)Journal-ref: JHEP 9811 (1998) 014

Following the work of Dine and Seiberg for SU(2), we study the leadingirrelevant operators on the moduli space of N=4 supersymmetric SU(N) gaugetheory. These operators are argued to be one-loop exact, and are explicitlycomputed.
