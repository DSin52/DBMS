We evaluate the one-loop fermion self-energy for the gauged Thirring model in(2+1) dimensions, with one massive fermion flavor, in the framework of thecausal perturbation theory. In contrast to QED$_3$, the corresponding two-pointfunction turns out to be infrared finite on the mass shell. Then, by means of aWard identity, we derive the on-shell vertex correction and discuss the roleplayed by causality for nonrenormalizable theories.
