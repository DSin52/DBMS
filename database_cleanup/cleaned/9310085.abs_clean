The partition function and the order parameter for the chiral symmetrybreaking are computed for a family of 2-dimensional interacting theoriescontaining the gauged Thirring model. In particular we derive non-perturbativeexpressions for the dependence of the chiral condensate on the temperature andthe curvature. Both, high temperature and high curvature supress the condensateexponentially and we can associate an effective temperature to the curvature.
