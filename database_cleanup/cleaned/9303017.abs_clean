We derive the moduli dependent threshold corrections to gauge couplings intoroidal orbifold compactifications. The underlying six dimensional toruslattice of the heterotic string theory is not assumed ---as in previouscalculations--- to decompose into a direct sum of a four--dimensional and atwo--dimensional sublattice, with the latter lying in a plane left fixed by aset of orbifold twists. In this more general case the threshold corrections areno longer automorphic functions of the modular group, but of certain congruencesubgroups of the modular group. These groups can also be obtained by studyingthe massless spectrum; moreover they have larger classes of automorphicfunctions. As a consequence the threshold corrections cannot be uniquelydetermined by symmetry considerations and certain boundary conditions atspecial points in the moduli space, as was claimed in previous publications.
