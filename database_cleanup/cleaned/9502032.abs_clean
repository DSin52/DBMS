We investigate the non-perturbative structure of two planar $Z_p \times Z_p$lattice gauge models and discuss their relevance to two-dimensional condensedmatter systems and Josephson junction arrays. Both models involve two compact$U(1)$ gauge fields with Chern-Simons interactions, which break the symmetrydown to $Z_p \times Z_p$. By identifying the relevant topological excitations(instantons) and their interactions we determine the phase structure of themodels. Our results match observed quantum phase transitions in Josephsonjunction arrays and suggest also the possibility of {\it oblique confiningground states} corresponding to quantum Hall regimes for either charges orvortices.
