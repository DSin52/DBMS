We show that the presence of finite-size monopoles can lead to a number ofinteresting physical processes involving quantum entanglement of charges.Taking as a model the classical solution of the N=2 SU(2) Yang-Mills theory, westudy interaction between dyons and scalar particles in the adjoint andfundamental representation. We find that there are bound states of scalars anddyons, which, remarkably, are always an entangled configuration of the form|\psi > =|dyon+> |scalar-> +/- |dyon->|scalar+>. We determine the energy levelsand the wave functions and also discuss their stability.
