We obtain the exact Dirac algebra obeyed by the conserved non-local chargesin bosonic non-linear sigma models. Part of the computation is specialized fora symmetry group $O(N)$. As it turns out the algebra corresponds to a cubicdeformation of the Kac-Moody algebra. The non-linear terms are computed inclosed form. In each Dirac bracket we only find highest order terms (asexplained in the paper), defining a saturated algebra. We generalize theresults for the presence of a Wess-Zumino term. The algebra is very similar tothe previous one, containing now a calculable correction of order one unitlower.
