Journal-ref: Lett.Math.Phys. 32 (1994) 173-182

We express the defining relations of the $q$-deformed Minkowski space algebraas well as that of the corresponding derivatives and differentials in the formof reflection equations. This formulation encompasses the covariance propertieswith respect the quantum Lorentz group action in a straightforward way.
