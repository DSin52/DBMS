We compute string scattering amplitudes in an orbifold of Minkowski space bya boost, and show how certain divergences in the four point function areassociated with graviton exchange near the singularity. These divergencesreflect large tree-level backreaction of the gravitational field. Near thesingularity, all excitations behave like massless fields on a 1+1 dimensionalcylinder. For excitations that are chiral near the singularity, we show thatdivergences are avoided and that the backreaction is milder. We discuss theimplications of this for some cosmological spacetimes. Finally, in order togain some intuition about what happens when backreaction is taken into account,we study an open string rolling tachyon background as a toy model that sharessome features with R^{1,1}/Z.
