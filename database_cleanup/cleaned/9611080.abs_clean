Based on the generalized gauge theory on $M^4\times Z_2\times Z_3$, wereconstructed the realistic SU(5) Grand Unified model by a suitableassignment of fermion fields. The action of group elements $Z_2$ on fermionfields is the charge conjugation while the action of $Z_3$ elements representgeneration translation. We find that to fit the spontaneous symmetry breakingand gauge hierarchy of SU(5) model a linear term of curvature has to beintroduced. A new mass relation is obtained in our reconstructed model.
