The stability conditions for coordinate gauge independent perturbations ofbrane-worlds are analyzed. It is shown that, these conditions lead to theEinstein-Hilbert dynamics and to a confined gauge potential, independently ofmodels and metric ansatzes. The size of the extra dimensions are estimatedwithout assuming a fixed topology. The quantum modes corresponding to highfrequency gravitational waves are defined through a canonical structure.
