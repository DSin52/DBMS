Title: Massless 3-brane in M-theory

Authors: M. Cvetic, H. Lu and C.N. Pope

Comments: This corrects a previous version in which it was mistakenly claimed

that the M3-brane solutions are pseudo-supersymmetric rather thansupersymmetricJournal-ref: Nucl.Phys. B613 (2001) 167-188

We construct supersymmetric M3-brane solutions in D=11 supergravity. They canbe viewed as deformations of backgrounds taking the form of a direct product offour-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and a non-compact Ricci-flat manifold ofG_2 holonomy. Although the 4-form field strength is turned on it carries nocharge, and the 3-branes are correspondingly massless. We also obtain 3-branesof a different type, arising as M5-branes wrapped over S^2.
