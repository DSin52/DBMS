We investigate the CGHS model through numerical calculation. The behavior ofthe mass function, which we introduced in our previous work as a ``localmass'', is examined. We found that the mass function takes negative values,which means that the amount of Hawking radiation becomes greater than theinitial mass of the black hole as in the case of the RST model.
