We consider a Yang--Mills theory in loop space whose gauge group is aKac--Moody group with the central extension. From this theory, we derive alocal field theory constructed of Yang--Mills fields and abelian antisymmetricand symmetric tensor fields of the second rank. The Chapline--Manton coupling,that is, coupling of Yang--Mills fields and a second-rank antisymmetric tensorfield via the Chern--Simons 3-form is obtained in a systematic manner.
