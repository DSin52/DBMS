Non-extreme black hole solutions of four dimensional, N=2 supergravitytheories with Calabi-Yau prepotentials are presented, which generalize certainknown double-extreme and extreme solutions. The boost parameters characterizingthe nonextreme solutions must satisfy certain constraints, which effectivelylimit the functional independence of the moduli scalars. A necessary conditionfor being able to take certain boost parameters independent is found to beblock diagonality of the gauge coupling matrix. We present a number of examplesaimed at developing an understanding of this situation and speculate about theexistence of more general solutions.
