We compute the cosmological perturbations generated in the colliding bubblebraneworld universe in which bubbles filled with five-dimensional anti-deSitter space (AdS5)expanding within a five dimensional de Sitter space (dS5) orMinkowski space (M5) collide to form a (3+1) dimensional local brane on whichthe cosmology is virtually identical to that of the Randall-Sundrum model. Theperturbation calculation presented here is valid to linear order but treats thefluctuations of the expanding bubbles as (3+1) dimensional fields localized onthe bubble wall. We find that for bubbles expanding in dS5 the dominantcontribution to the power spectrum is `red' but very small except in certaincases where the fifth dimension is not large or the bubbles have expanded tofar beyond the dS5 apparent horizon length. This paper supersedes a previousversion titled "Exactly Scale-Invariant Cosmological Perturbations From aColliding Bubble Braneworld Universe" in which we erroneously claimed that ascale-invariant spectrum results for the case of bubbles expanding in M5. Thispresent paper corrects the errors of the previous version and extends theanalysis to the more interesting and general case of bubbles expanding in dS5.
