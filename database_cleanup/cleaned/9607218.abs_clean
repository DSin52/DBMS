We discuss a T-duality transformation for the c=1/2 matrix model for thepurpose of studying duality transformations in a possible toy example ofnonperturbative frameworks of string theory. Our approach is to firstinvestigate the scaling limit of the Schwinger-Dyson equations and thestochastic Hamiltonian in terms of the dual variables and then compare theresults with those using the original spin variables. It is shown that thec=1/2 model in the scaling limit is T-duality symmetric in the sphereapproximation. The duality symmetry is however violated when the higher-genuseffects are taken into account, owing to the existence of global Z_2 vectorfields corresponding to nontrivial homology cycles. Some universal propertiesof the stochastic Hamiltonians which play an important role in discussing thescaling limit and have been discussed in a previous work by the last twoauthors are refined in both the original and dual formulations. We also reporta number of new explicit results for various amplitudes containing macroscopicloop operators.
