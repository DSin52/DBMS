The 2-dimensional space-time sine-Gordon field theory is extendedalgebraically within the n-dimensional space of extended complex numbers. Thisfield theory is constructed in terms of an adapted extension of standard vertexoperators. A whole set of non-local conserved charges is constructed andstudied in this framework. Thereby, an algebraic non-perturbative descriptionis possible for this n-1 parameters family of quantum field theories. Knownresults are obtained for specific values of the parameters, especially inrelation to affine Toda field theories. Different (dual)-models can then bedescribed in this formalism.
