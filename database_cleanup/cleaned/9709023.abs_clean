We describe the breaking of supersymmetry in M-theory by coordinate dependent(Scherk-Schwarz) compactification of the eleventh dimension. Supersymmetry isspontaneously broken in the gravitational and moduli sector and communicated tothe observable sector, living at the end-point of the semicircle, by radiativegravitational interactions. This mechanism shares the generic features ofnon-perturbative supersymmetry breaking by gaugino condensation, in thepresence of a constant antisymmetric field strength, in the weakly coupledregime of the heterotic string, which suggests that both mechanisms could berelated by duality. In particular an analysis of supersymmetric transformationsin the infinite-radius limit reveals the presence of a discontinuity in thespinorial parameter, which coincides with the result found in the presence ofgaugino condensation, while the condensate is identified with the quantizedparameter entering the boundary conditions
