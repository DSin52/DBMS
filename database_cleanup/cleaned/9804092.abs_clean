We consider six and four dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric orientifoldsof Type IIB compactified on orbifolds. We give the conditions under which theperturbative world-sheet orientifold approach is adequate, and list the fourdimensional ${\cal N}=1$ orientifolds (which are rather constrained) thatsatisfy these conditions. We argue that in most cases orientifolds containnon-perturbative sectors that are missing in the world-sheet approach. Thesenon-perturbative sectors can be thought of as arising from D-branes wrappingvarious collapsed 2-cycles in the orbifold. Using these observations, weexplain certain ``puzzles'' in the literature on four dimensional orientifolds.In particular, in some four dimensional orientifolds the ``naive'' tadpolecancellation conditions have no solution. However, these tadpole cancellationconditions are derived using the world-sheet approach which we argue to beinadequate in these cases due to appearance of additional non-perturbativesectors. The main tools in our analyses are the map between F-theory andorientifold vacua and Type I-heterotic duality. Utilizing the consistencyconditions we have found in this paper, we discuss consistent four dimensionalchiral ${\cal N}=1$ Type I vacua which are non-perturbative from the heteroticviewpoint.
