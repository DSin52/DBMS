Title: Nonequilibrium Quantum Scalar Fields in Cosmology

Kunsan, Korea)Comments: 10 pages of Latex file to appear in the Proceedings of the Fourth

International Workshop on Thermal Field Theories and Their Applications,Dalian China, 1995We elaborate further the functional Schr\"{o}dinger-picture approach to thequantum field in curved spacetimes using the generalized invariant method andconstruct explicitly the Fock space, which we relate with the thermal fieldtheory. We apply the method to a free massive scalar field in the de Sitterspacetime, and find the exact quantum states, construct the Fock space, andevaluate the two-point function and correlation function.
