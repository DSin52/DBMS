It has been shown that (2+1)-dimensional N=8 super Yang-Mills (SYM) theorywith electric flux is related to (2+1)- dimensional noncommutative open string(NCOS) theory by `2-11' flip. This implies that the instanton process in SYMtheory, which corresponds to D0-brane exchange (M-momentum transfer) betweenD2-branes, is dual to the KK momentum exchange in NCOS theory, which isperturbative process in nature. In order to confirm this, we obtain theeffective action of probe M2-brane on the background of tilted M2-branes, whichwould correspond to the one-loop effective action of SYM theory withnon-perturbative instanton corrections. Then we consider the dual process inNCOS theory, which is the scattering amplitude of the wound graviton off theD2-F1 bound state involving KK-momentum transfer in x^2-direction. Both of themgive the same interaction terms. Remarkably they also have the same behavior onthe nontrivial velocity dependence. All these strongly support the dualitybetween those two theories with completely different nature.
