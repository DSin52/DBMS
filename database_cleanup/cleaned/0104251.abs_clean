AdS dynamics for massive scalar field is studied both by solving exactly theequation of motion and by constructing bulk-boundary propagator. ARobertson-Walker-like metric is deduced from the familiar SO(2,n) invariantmetric. The metric allows us to present a time-like Killing vector, which isnot only invariant under space-like transformations but also invariant underthe isometric transformations of SO(2,n) in certain sense. A horizon appears inthis coordinate system. Singularities of field variables at boundary aredemonstrated explicitly. It is shown that there is a one-to-one correspondenceamong the exact solutions and the bulk fields obtained by using thebulk-boundary propagator.
