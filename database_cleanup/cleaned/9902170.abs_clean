We compute the properties of a class of charged black holes in anti-de Sitterspace-time, in diverse dimensions. These black holes are solutions ofconsistent Einstein-Maxwell truncations of gauged supergravities, which areshown to arise from the inclusion of rotation in the transverse space. Weuncover rich thermodynamic phase structures for these systems, which displayclassic critical phenomena, including structures isomorphic to the van derWaals-Maxwell liquid-gas system. In that case, the phases are controlled by theuniversal `cusp' and `swallowtail' shapes familiar from catastrophe theory. Allof the thermodynamics is consistent with field theory interpretations viaholography, where the dual field theories can sometimes be found on the worldvolumes of coincident rotating branes.
