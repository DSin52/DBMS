We construct a new class of exact string solutions with a four dimensionaltarget space metric of signature ($-,+,+,+$) by gauging the independent leftand right nilpotent subgroups with `null' generators of WZNW models for rank 2non-compact groups $G$. The `null' property of the generators (${\rm Tr }(N_nN_m)=0$) implies the consistency of the gauging and the absence of$\a'$-corrections to the semiclassical backgrounds obtained from the gaugedWZNW models. In the case of the maximally non-compact groups ($G= SL(3),SO(2,2), SO(2,3), G_2$) the construction corresponds to gauging some of thesubgroups generated by the nilpotent `step' operators in the Gaussdecomposition. The rank 2 case is a particular example of a generalconstruction leading to conformal backgrounds with one time-like direction. Theconformal theories obtained by integrating out the gauge field can beconsidered as sigma model analogs of Toda models (their classical equations ofmotion are equivalent to Toda model equations). The procedure of `null gauging'applies also to other non-compact groups.
