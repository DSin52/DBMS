Title: A brief history of hidden quantum symmetries in Conformal Field Theories

Authors: Cesar Gomez and German Sierra

Comments: 20 pages, Latex, IMAFF-92

We review briefly a stream of ideas concerning the role of quantum groups ashidden symmetries in conformal field theories, paying particular attention tothe field theoretical representations of quantum groups based on Coulomb gasmethods. An extensive bibliography is also included.
