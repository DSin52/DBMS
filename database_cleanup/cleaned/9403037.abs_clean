We study the condition for the appearance of space-time supercharges intwisted sectors of asymmetric orbifold models. We present a list of theasymmetric $Z_N$-orbifold models which satisfy a simple condition necessary forthe appearance of space-time supercharges in twisted sectors. We investigatewhether or not such asymmetric orbifold models possess $N=1$ space-timesupersymmetry and obtain a new class of $N=1$ asymmetric orbifold models. It ispointed out that the result of space-time supersymmetry does not depend on anychoice of a shift if the order of the left-moving degrees of freedom ispreserved.
