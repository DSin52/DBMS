We use a phase space description to (re)derive a first order form of theBorn-Infeld action for D-branes. This derivation also makes it possible toconsider the limit where the tension of the D-brane goes to zero. We find thatin this limit, which can be considered to be the strong coupling limit of thefundamental string theory, the world-volume of the D-brane generically splitsinto a collection of tensile strings.
