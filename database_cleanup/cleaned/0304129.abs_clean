Authors: Dongsu Bak, Michael Gutperle and Shinji Hirano

Comments: 19 pages, 8 figures

We find a nonsupersymmetric dilatonic deformation of $AdS_5$ geometry as anexact nonsingular solution of the type IIB supergravity. The dual gauge theoryhas a different Yang-Mills coupling in each of the two halves of the boundaryspacetime divided by a codimension one defect. We discuss the geometry of oursolution in detail, emphasizing the structure of the boundary, and also studythe string configurations corresponding to Wilson loops. We also show that thatthe background is stable under small scalar perturbations.
