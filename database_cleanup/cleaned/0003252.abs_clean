We investigate the dynamics of Q-balls in one, two and three spacedimensions, using numerical simulations of the full nonlinear equations ofmotion. We find that the dynamics of Q-balls is extremely complex, involvingprocesses such as charge transfer and Q-ball fission. We present results ofsimulations which illustrate the salient features of 2-Q-ball interactions andgive qualitative arguments to explain them in terms of the evolution of thetime-dependent phases.
