The Poincare algebra of classical electrodynamics in one spatial dimension isstudied using light-cone coordinates and ordinary Minkowski coordinates. Weshow that it is possible to quantize the theory by a canonical quantizationprocedure in a Poincare invariant manner on the light-cone. We also show thatthis is not possible when using ordinary coordinates. The physical reason ofthis anomaly is analysed.
