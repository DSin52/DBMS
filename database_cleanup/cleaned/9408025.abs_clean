We investigate the coupled system of gravity and a scalar with exponentialpotential. The energy momentum tensor of the scalar field induces atime-dependent cosmological ``constant''. This adjusts itself dynamically tobecome in the ``late'' universe (including today) proportional to the energydensity of matter and radiation. Possible consequences for the presentcosmology are shortly discussed. We also address the question of naturalness ofthe cosmon model.
