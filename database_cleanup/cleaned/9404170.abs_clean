We reformulate the BRST quantisation of chiral Virasoro and $W_3$ worldsheetgravities. Our approach follows directly the classic BRST formulation ofYang-Mills theory in employing a derivative gauge condition instead of theconventional conformal gauge condition, supplemented by an introduction ofmomenta in order to put the ghost action back into first-order form. Theconsequence of these simple changes is a considerable simplification of theBRST formulation, the evaluation of anomalies and the expression of Wess-Zuminoconsistency conditions. In particular, the transformation rules of all fieldsnow constitute a canonical transformation generated by the BRST operator $Q$,and we obtain in this reformulation a new result that the anomaly in the BRSTWard identity is obtained by application of the anomalous operator $Q^2$,calculated using operator products, to the gauge fermion.
