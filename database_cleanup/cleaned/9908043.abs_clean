The non-perturbative renormalization group equation for the Wilsonianeffective potential is given in a certain simple approximation scheme in orderto study chiral symmetry breaking phenomena dynamically induced by strong gaugeinteractions. The evolving effective potential is found to be non-analytic ininfrared, which indicates spontaneous generation of the fermion mass. It isalso shown that the renormalization group equation gives the identicaleffective fermion mass with that obtained by solving the Schwinger-Dysonequation in the (improved) ladder approximation. Moreover introduction of thecollective field corresponding to the fermion composite into the theory spaceis found to offer an efficient method to evaluate the order parameters; thedynamical mass and the chiral condensate. The relation between therenormalization group equation incorporating the collective field and theSchwinger-Dyson equation is also clarified.
