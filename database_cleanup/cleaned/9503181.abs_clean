By regularizing the singularities appearing in the two dimensional Reggecalculus by means of a segment of a sphere or pseudo-sphere and then taking theregulator to zero, we obtain a simple formula for the gauge volume whichappears in the functional integral. Such a formula is an analytic function ofthe opening of the conic singularity in the interval from $\pi$ to $4\pi$ andin the continuum limit it goes over to the correct result.
