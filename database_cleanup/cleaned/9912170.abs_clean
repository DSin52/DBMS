We give a new formula for the antipode of the algebra of rooted trees,directly in terms of the bialgebra structure. The equivalence, proved in thispaper, among the three available formulae for the antipode, reflects theequivalence among the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp, Zimmermann, and Dyson-Salamrenormalization schemes.
