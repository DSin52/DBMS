2231We discuss the equivalence of two dual scalar field theories in 2 dimensions.The models are derived though the elimination of different fields in the sameFreedman--Townsend model. It is shown that tree $S$-matrices of these models donot coincide. The 2-loop counterterms are calculated. It turns out that whileone of these models is single-charged, the other theory is multi-charged. Thusthe dual models considered are non-equivalent on classical and quantum levels.It indicates the possibility of the anomaly leading to non-equivalence of dualmodels.
