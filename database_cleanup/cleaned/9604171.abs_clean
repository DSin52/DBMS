Title: Self-Dual Superstring in Six Dimensions

Comments: 6 pages, latex, no figures

A free superstring with chiral N=2 supersymmetry in six dimensions isproposed. It couples to a two-form gauge field with a self-dual field strength.Compactification to four dimensions on a two-torus gives a strongly coupled N=4four-dimensional gauge theory with SL(2, Z) duality and an infinite tower ofdyons. Various authors have suggested that this string theory should be alsothe world-volume theory of M theory five-branes. Accepting this proposal, wefind a puzzling factor of two in the application to black-hole entropycomputations.
