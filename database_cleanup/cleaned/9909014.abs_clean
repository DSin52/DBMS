In the framework of a gauge invariant continuous and non-perturbativeregularization scheme based on the smearing of point like interactions by meansof cutoff functions, we show that the axial anomaly, though cutoff independent,depends on the shape of the cutoff functions. The standard value for thestrength of the axial anomaly is recovered if we assume that the regularizedgauge invariant axial current is in addition local.
