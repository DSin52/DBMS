In the Matrix theories compactified on the $d$ dimensional torus with $d = 5,6, 7$ which are described by the theories of D$d$-branes in the type IIA or IIBtheory on the $d$ dimensional dual torus we analyze the BPS bound states of thebackground D$d$-brane with other objects by taking the matrix theory limit.Through the Nahm duality transformation the flux and the momentum multipletsfor these BPS states are shown to be associated with the black holes and theblack strings respectively from the viewpoint of the weakly coupled type IIAstring theory compactified on the $d-1$ dimensional torus.
