Reduced phase space formulation of CGHS model of 2d dilaton gravity isstudied in en extrinsic time gauge. The corresponding Hamiltonian can bepromoted into a Hermitian operator acting in the physical Hilbert space,implying a unitary evolution for the system. Consequences for the black holephysics are discussed. In particular, this manifestly unitary theory rules outthe Hawking scenario for the endpoint of the black hole evaporation process.
