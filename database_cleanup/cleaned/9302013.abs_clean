Title: Wave-type Solutions in the Nonlinear $\sigma$-model with the Dilaton

Authors: Eugene Tyurin

Comments: 7 pages LaTeX, preprint ITP-SB-93-08 [[ one very important reference

added ]]We study a class of classical dilaton vacua in string theory that depend onthe light-cone variable $z=t\pm x$ and, thus, have wavelike behavior. One ofthe interesting results is the existence of a solution subclass with perfectlyregular space-time geometry, where the string coupling constant can be madearbitrarily small.
