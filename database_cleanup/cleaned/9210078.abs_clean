Connes.These $2$-dimensional tilings are obtained by application of the strip methodto the root lattice of an $ADE$-Coxeter group.The plane along which the strip is constructed is determined by the canonicalCoxeter element leading to the result that a $2$-dimensional tiling decomposesinto a cartesian product of two $1$-dimensional tilings.The properties of the tilings are investigated, including selfsimilarity, andthe determination of the relevant algebraic invariant is considered, namely theordered $K_0$-group of an algebra naturally assigned to the quantum space.The result also yields an application of the $2$-dimensional abstract gaplabelling theorem.
