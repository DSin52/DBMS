Comments: 6 pages, OKHEP-93-05

The connection between a Taylor series and a continued-fraction involves anonlinear relation between the Taylor coefficients $\{ a_n \}$ and thecontinued-fraction coefficients $\{ b_n \}$. In many instances it turns outthat this nonlinear relation transforms a complicated sequence $\{a_n \}$ intoa very simple one $\{ b_n \}$. We illustrate this simplification in the contextof graph combinatorics.
