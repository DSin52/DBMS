Spectrum of elementary string states in type II string theory containsultra-short multiplets that are marginally stable. $U$-duality transformationconverts these states into bound states at threshold of $p$-branes carryingRamond-Ramond charges, and wrapped around $p$-cycles of a torus. We propose atest for the existence of these marginally stable bound states. Using therecent results of Polchinski and of Witten, we argue that the spectrum of boundstates of $p$-branes is in agreement with the prediction of $U$-duality.
