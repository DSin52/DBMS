Superconformal sigma models with Calabi--Yau target spaces described ascomplete intersection subvarieties in toric varieties can be obtained as thelow-energy limit of certain abelian gauge theories in two dimensions. Weformulate mirror symmetry for this class of Calabi--Yau spaces as a duality inthe abelian gauge theory, giving the explicit mapping relating the twoLagrangians. The duality relates inequivalent theories which lead to isomorphictheories in the low-energy limit. This formulation suggests that mirrorsymmetry could be derived using abelian duality. The application of duality inthis context is complicated by the presence of nontrivial dynamics and theabsence of a global symmetry. We propose a way to overcome these obstacles,leading to a more symmetric Lagrangian. The argument, however, fails to producea derivation of the conjecture.
