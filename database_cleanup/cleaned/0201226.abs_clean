Free arbitrary spin massless and self-dual massive fields propagating in$AdS_5$ are investigated. We study totally symmetric and mixed symmetry fieldson an equal footing. Light-cone gauge action for such fields is constructed. Asan example of application of light-cone formalism we discuss $AdS/CFT$correspondence for massless arbitrary spin $AdS$ fields and correspondingboundary operators at the level of two point function.
