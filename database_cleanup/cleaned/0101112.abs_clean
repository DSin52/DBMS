A functional partial differential equation is set for the proper graphsgenerating functional of QED in external electromagnetic fields. This equationleads to the evolution of the proper graphs with the external field amplitudeand the external field gauge dependence of the complete fermion propagator andvertex is derived non-perturbativally.
