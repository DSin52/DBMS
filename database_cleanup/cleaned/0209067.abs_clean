We review the formalism of holographic renormalization. We start bydiscussing mathematical results on asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes. Wethen outline the general method of holographic renormalization. The method ison anti-de Sitter spacetime. The discussion includes the derivation of theon-shell renormalized action, of holographic Ward identities, anomalies and RGequations, and the computation of renormalized one-, two- and four-pointfunctions. We then discuss the application of the method to holographic RGflows. We also show that the results of the near-boundary analysis ofasymptotically AdS spacetimes can be analytically continued to apply toasymptotically de Sitter spacetimes. In particular, it is shown that theBrown-York stress energy tensor of de Sitter spacetime is equal, up to adimension dependent sign, to the Brown-York stress energy tensor of anassociated AdS spacetime.
