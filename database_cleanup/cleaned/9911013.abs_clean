The effective p-brane action approach is generalized for arbitrary scalarfield and applied for the Liouville theory near a particle-like solution. Itwas established that this theory has the remarkable features discriminating itfrom the theories studied earlier. Removing zero modes we obtain the effectiveaction describing the solution as a point particle with curvature, quantize itas the theory with higher derivatives and calculate the quantum corrections tomass.
