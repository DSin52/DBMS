We address the problem of the continuum limit for a system of Hausdorfflattices (namely lattices of isolated points) approximating a topological space$M$. The correct framework is that of projective systems. The projective limitis a universal space from which $M$ can be recovered as a quotient. We dualizethe construction to approximate the algebra ${\cal C}(M)$ of continuousfunctions on $M$. In a companion paper we shall extend this analysis to systemsof noncommutative lattices (non Hausdorff lattices).
