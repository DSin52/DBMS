The genesis of Feynman's original approach to QED is reviewed. The main ideasof his original presentation at the Pocono Conference are discussed andcompared with the ones involved in his action-at-distance formulation ofclassical electrodynamics. The role of the de Sitter group in Feynman'svisualization of space-time processes is pointed out.
