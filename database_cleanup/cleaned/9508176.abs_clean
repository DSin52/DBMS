We use the large $N$ self consistency method to compute the criticalexponents of the fields and coupling of the supersymmetric CP(N) sigma model atleading order in $1/N$ in various dimensions. We verify that the correction tothe critical beta-function slope vanishes at O(1/N) which is consistent withsupersymmetry. The three dimensional model is investigated explicitly when aChern Simons term is included supersymmetrically. We determine the modificationthat this has on the gauge independent quantity \beta^\prime(g_c) as a functionof the Chern Simons coupling, \vartheta. For an N = 2 supersymmetric ChernSimons term the exponent is independent of \vartheta at O(1/N), whilst it isinvariant under \vartheta \rightarrow 1/\vartheta when an N = 1 supersymmetricChern Simons term is included.
