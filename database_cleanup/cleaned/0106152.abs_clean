We study a scale invariant two measures theory where a dilaton field \phi hasno explicit potentials. The scale transformations include a shift\phi\to\phi+const. The theory demonstrates a new mechanism for generation ofscale invariance, the theory develops the exponential potential and, ingeneral, non-linear kinetic term is generated as well. The possibility ofquintessence and of halo dark matter solutions are shown. The regime where thefermionic matter dominates (as compared to the dilatonic contribution) isanalyzed. There it is found that starting from a single fermionic field weobtain exactly three different types of spin 1/2 particles in CEF that appearsto suggest a new approach to the family problem of particle physics. It isautomatically achieved that for two of them, fermion masses are constants,gravitational equations are canonical and the "fifth force" is absent. For thethird type of particles, four fermionic interaction appears from SSB of scaleinvariance.
