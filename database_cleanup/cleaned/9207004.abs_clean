The BRST invariance condition in a highest-weight representation of thetopological ($\equiv$ twisted $N=2$) algebra captures the `invariant' contentof two-dimensional gravity coupled to matter. The standard DDK formulation isrecovered by splitting the topological generators into $c=-26$reparametrization ghosts+matter +`Liouville', while a similar splittinginvolving $c=-2$ ghosts gives rise to the matter dressed in exactly the wayrequired in order that the theory be equivalent to Virasoro constraints on theKP hierarchy. The two dressings of matter with the `Liouville' differ also bytheir `ghost numbers', which is similar to the existence of representatives ofBRST cohomologies with different ghost numbers. The topological central charge$\ctop\neq3$ provides a two-fold covering of the allowed region $d\leq1\cupd\geq25$ of the matter central charge $d$ via $d=(\ctop+1)(\ctop+6)/(\ctop-3)$.The `Liouville' field is identified as the ghost-free part of the topological$U(1)$ current. The construction thus allows one to establish a direct relation(presumably an equivalence) between the Virasoro-constrained KP hierarchies,minimal models, and the BRST invariance condition for highest-weight states ofthe topological algebra.
