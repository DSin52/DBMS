Title: Notes on Bundles on K3s

Authors: E. Sharpe

Comments: 10 pages, LaTeX

In this technical note we describe a new (to the physics literature)construction of bundles on Calabi-Yaus. We primarily study this construction inthe special case of K3 surfaces, for which interesting results can be obtained.For example, we use this construction to give plausibility arguments for arelationship between spaces of solutions of Hitchin's equations and modulispaces of bundles on K3s. Also, in a recent paper it was proposed by C. Vafathat the mirror to a bundle on a Calabi-Yau n-fold is, in a particular sense, asupersymmetric n-cycle on the mirror Calabi-Yau. We use this new constructionto observe that for the special case of K3s, Vafa's mirror data also specifiesa bundle directly on the mirror K3, and so we potentially have a dualitybetween bundles on any one K3 and other bundles on the mirror K3.
