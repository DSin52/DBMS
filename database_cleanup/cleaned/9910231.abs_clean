We presented the proof of the positive mass theorem for black holes inEinstein-Maxwell axion-dilaton gravity being the low-energy limit of theheterotic string theory. We show that the total mass of a spacetime containinga black hole is greater or equal to the square root of the sum of squares ofthe adequate dilaton-electric and dilaton-axion charges.
