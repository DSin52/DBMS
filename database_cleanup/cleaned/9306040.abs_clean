stylistic corrections, enlarged bibliographyA formalism describing the dynamics of classical and quantum systems from agroup theoretical point of view is presented. We apply it to the simple exampleof the classical free particle. The Galileo group $G$ is the symmetry group ofthe free equations of motion. Consideration of the free particle Lagrangiansemi-invariance under $G$ leads to a larger symmetry group, which is a centralextension of the Galileo group by the real numbers. We study the dynamicsassociated with this group, and characterize quantities like Noether invariantsand evolution equations in terms of group geometric objects. An extension ofthe Galileo group by $U(1)$ leads to quantum mechanics.
