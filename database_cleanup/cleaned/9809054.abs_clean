Title: Spinor representation of the general Lorentz group for spin 1/2

particles and CPTAuthors: Recai Erdem

Comments: 11 pages, Revtex, misprints are corrected, some clarifications are

done, some references are addedWe show that the attempt to introduce all of the discrete space-timetransformations into the spinor representation of the Lorentz group as whollyindependent transformations (as in the vectorial representation) leads to an8-component spinor representation in general. The first indications seem toimply that CPT can be violated in this formulation without going outside offield theory. However one needs further study to reach a final conclusion.
