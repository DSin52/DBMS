Title: String Theory, Large Dimensions and Supersymmetry

Comments: Talk presented at 30 Years of Supersymmetry, Minneapolis, October,

2000. Latex, 9 pages. References to some relevant work addedWith our current level of understanding, the problem of making string theorypredictions is not one of "solving" the theory, but rather of trying todetermine whether there are any generic expectations. Within this context, wediscuss what it would mean to predict low energy supersymmetry, and considerstring prediction, and others.
