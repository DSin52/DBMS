We propose a naive unification of Electromagnetism and General Relativitybased on enlarging the gauge group of Ashtekar's new variables. We constructthe connection and loop representations and analyze the space of states. In theloop representation, the wavefunctions depend on two loops, each of themcarrying information about both gravitation and electromagnetism. We find thatthe Chern-Simons form and the Jones Polynomial play a role in the model.
