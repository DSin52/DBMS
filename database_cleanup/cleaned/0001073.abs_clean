addedWe consider static U(1) monopole in non-commutative space. Up to the secondorder in the non-commutativity scale $\theta$, we find no non-trivialcorrections to the Dirac solution, the monopole mass remains infinite. We arguethe same holds for any arbitrary higher order. Some speculation about thenature of non-commutative spacetime and its relation to the cosmologicalconstant is made.
