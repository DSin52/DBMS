The model of D4 open string with non-Grassmann spinning variables isconsidered. The non-linear gauge, which is invariant both Poincar\'e and scaletransformations of the space-time, is used for subsequent studies. It is shownthat the reduction of the canonical Poisson structure from the original phasespace to the surface of constraints and gauge conditions gives the degeneratedPoisson brackets. Moreover it is shown that such reduction is non-unique. Theconseption of the adjunct phase space is introduced. The consequences forsubsequent quantization are discussed. Deduced dependence of spin $J$ from thesquare of mass $\mu^2$ of the string generalizes the ''Regge spectrum`` forconventional theory.
