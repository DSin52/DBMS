We analyze the Coulomb branch of Matrix string theory in the presence ofNS5-branes. If we regard the components of U(1) gauge fields as the dualizedlongitudinal coordinates, we obtain the symmetric product of AdS_3 x S^3 x R^4as the geometry of Coulomb branch. We observe that the absence or presence ofthe nonzero electric flux determines whether the string propagates in bulk asan ordinary closed string or is forced to live near the boundary.We further discuss the issues of the physical spectrum from the viewpoint ofMatrix string theory. We show that the twisted sectors of CFT on the symmetricorbifold, which correspond to glued strings, turn out to yield many chiralprimaries that were hitherto considered to be missing. We also comment on thethreshold energy in Liouville sector where continuous spectrum begins.
