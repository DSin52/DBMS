Title: Comment on "Dynamical Chern-Simons term generation at finite density"

and "Chern-Simons term at finite density"Comments: 2 pages, LaTeX

We comment on the calculation of the Chern-Simons coefficient in(2+1)-dimensional gauge theories at finite chemical potential made byA.N.Sissakian, O.Yu.Shevchenko and S.B.Solganik (hep-th/9608159 andhep-th/9612140).
