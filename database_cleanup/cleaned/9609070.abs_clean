We study five-dimensional supersymmetric field theories with one-dimensionalCoulomb branch. We extend a previous analysis which led to non-trivial fixedpoints with $E_n$ symmetry ($E_8$, $E_7$, $E_6$, $E_5=Spin(10)$, $E_4=SU(5)$,$E_3=SU(3)\times SU(2)$, $E_2=SU(2)\times U(1)$ and $E_1=SU(2)$) by finding twolatter is a non-trivial theory with no relevant operators preserving thesuper-Poincar\'e symmetry. In terms of string theory these new field theoriesenable us to describe compactifications of the type I' theory on$S^1/Z_2$ with 16, 17 or 18 background D8-branes. These theories also playa crucial role in compactifications of M-theory on Calabi--Yau spaces,providing physical models for the contractions of del Pezzo surfaces to points(thereby completing the classification of singularities which can occur atcodimension one in K\"ahler moduli). The structure of the Higgs branch yields aprediction which unifies the known mathematical facts about del Pezzotransitions in a quite remarkable way.
