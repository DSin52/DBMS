We present a formalism to explicitly construct non-Abelian gauge theories onnoncommutative spaces (induced via a star product with aconstant Poissontensor) from a consistency relation. This results in an expansion of the gaugeparameter, the noncommutative gauge potential and fields in the fundamentalrepresentation, in powers of a parameter of the noncommutativity. This allowsthe explicit construction of actions for these gauge theories.
