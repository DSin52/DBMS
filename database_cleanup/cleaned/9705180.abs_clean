We study the N -> 0 limit of the O(N) Gross-Neveu model in the framework ofthe massless form-factor approach. This model is related to the continuum limitof the Ising model with random bonds via the replica method. We discuss howthis method may be useful in calculating correlation functions of physicaloperators. The identification of non-perturbative fixed points of the O(N)Gross-Neveu model is pursued by its mapping to a WZW model.
