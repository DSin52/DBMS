We point out certain unexpected features of the planar QCD3 confiningpotential, as computed from a classical worldsheet action in an AdS metric viathe Maldacena conjecture. We show that there is no Luscher c/R term in thestatic-quark potential, which is contrary to both the prediction of variouseffective string models, and the results of some recent lattice Monte Carlostudies. It is also noted that the glueball masses extracted from classicalsupergravity tend to finite, coupling-independent constants in the strongcoupling limit, even as the string tension tends to infinity in the same limit;this is a counter-intuitive result.
