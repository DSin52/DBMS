We study the Landau-Ginzburg models which correspond to Calabi-Yaufour-folds. We construct the index of the typical states which correspond totoric divisors. This index shows that whether a corresponding divisor cangenerate a non-perturbative superpotential. For an application, we consider thephase transition in terms of the orbifold construction. We obtain the simplemethod by which the divisor, which can not generate a superpotential in theoriginal theory, can generate a superpotential after orbifoldization.
