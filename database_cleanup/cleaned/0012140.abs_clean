Title: 2D black holes and effective actions

Authors: R. Balbinot and A. Fabbri

Comments: 15 pages, latex

We compare the canonical quantization and the effective action method toderive expectation values of the stress energy tensor for scalar fieldsconformally coupled to a 2D Schwarzschild black hole spacetime. Disagreement ofthe results may be reconduced to the incomplete knowledge of the effectiveaction. Appropriate ``phenomenological'' modification of this latter mayreconcile the two procedures.
