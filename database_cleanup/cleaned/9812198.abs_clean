A generic ansatz is introduced which provides families of exact solutions tothe equations of motion and constraints for null-strings in Bianchi type Icosmological models. This is achieved irrespective of the form of the metric.Within classes of dilaton cosmologies a backreaction mapping relation isestablished where the null string leads to more or less anisotropic members ofthe family. The equations of motion and constraints for the generic model arecasted in their first order form and integrated both analytically andnumerically.
