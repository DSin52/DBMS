In the 1920's, Madelung noticed that if the complex Schroedinger wavefunctionis expressed in polar form, then its modulus squared and the gradient of itsphase may be interpreted as the hydrodynamic density and velocity,respectively, of a compressible fluid. In this paper, we generalize Madelung'stransformation to the quaternionic Schroedinger equation. The non-abeliannature of the full SU(2) gauge group of this equation leads to a richer, moreintricate set of fluid equations than those arising from complex quantummechanics. We begin by describing the quaternionic version of Madelung'stransformation, and identifying its ``hydrodynamic'' variables. In order tofind Hamiltonian equations of motion for these, we first develop the canonicalPoisson bracket and Hamiltonian for the quaternionic Schroedinger equation, andthen apply Madelung's transformation to derive non-canonical Poisson bracketsyielding the desired equations of motion. These are a particularly natural setof equations for a non-abelian fluid, and differ from those obtained byBistrovic et al. only by a global gauge transformation. Because we haveobtained these equations by a transformation of the quaternionic Schroedingerequation, and because many techniques for simulating complex quantum mechanicsgeneralize straightforwardly to the quaternionic case, our observation leads tosimple algorithms for the computer simulation of non-abelian fluids.
