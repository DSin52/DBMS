We compute quantum corrections to soliton masses in affine Toda theories withimaginary exponentials based on the nonsimply-laced Lie algebras $c_n^{(1)}$.We find that the soliton mass ratios renormalize nontrivially, in the samemanner as those of the fundamental particles of the theories with realexponentials based on the nonsimply-laced algebras $b_n^{(1)}$. This givesevidence that the conjectured relation between solitons in one Toda theory andfundamental particles in a dual Toda theory holds also at the quantum level.This duality can be seen as a toy model for S-duality.
