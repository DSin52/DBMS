We show that while the zero temperature induced fermion number in a chiralsigma model background depends only on the asymptotic values of the chiralfield, at finite temperature the induced fermion number depends also on thedetailed shape of the chiral background. We resum the leading low temperatureterms to all orders in the derivative expansion, producing a simple result thatcan be interpreted physically as the different effect of the chiral backgroundon virtual pairs of the Dirac sea and on the real particles of the thermalplasma. By contrast, for a kink background, not of sigma model form, the finitetemperature induced fermion number is temperature dependent but topological.
