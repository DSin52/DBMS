We apply the coadjoint orbit technique to the group of area preservingdiffeomorphisms (APD) of a 2D manifold, particularly to the APD of thesemi-infinite cylinder which is identified with $w_{\infty}$.  The geometricalaction obtained is relevant to both $w$ gravity and 2D turbulence. For thelatter we describe the hamiltonian, which appears to be given by the Schwingermass term, and discuss some possible developments within our approach. Next weshow that the set of highest weight orbits of $w_{\infty}$ splits into subsets,each of which consists of highest weight orbits of $\bar{w}_N$ for a givenN. We specify the general APD geometric action to an orbit of $\bar{w}_N$ anddescribe an appropriate set of observables, thus getting an action andobservables for $\bar{w}_N$ gravity. We compute also the Ricci form on the$\bar{w}_N$ orbits, what gives us the critical central charge of the$\bar{w}_N$ string, which appears to be the same as the one of the $W_N$string.
