The tau-function formalism for a class of generalized ``zero-curvature''integrable hierarchies of partial differential equations, is constructed. Theclass includes the Drinfel'd-Sokolov hierarchies. A direct relation between thevariables of the zero-curvature formalism and the tau-functions is established.The formalism also clarifies the connection between the zero-curvaturehierarchies and the Hirota-type hierarchies of Kac and Wakimoto.
