The issue related to the so-called dimensional reduction procedure isrevisited within the Euclidean formalism. First, it is shown that for symmetricspaces, the local exact heat-kernel density is equal to the reduced one, oncethe harmonic sum has been succesfully performed. In the general case, due tothe impossibility to deal with exact results, the short time heat-kernelasymptotics is considered. It is found that the exact heat-kernel and thedimensionally reduced one coincide up to two non trivial leading contributionsin the short time expansion. Implications of these results with regard todimensional-reduction anomaly are discussed.
