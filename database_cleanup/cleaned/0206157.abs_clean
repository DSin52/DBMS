We investigate how the matrix representation of SU(N) algebra approaches thatof the Poisson algebra in the large N limit. In the adjoint representation, the(N^2-1) times (N^2-1) matrices of the SU(N) generators go to those of thePoisson algebra in the large N limit. However, it is not the case for the Ntimes N matrices in the fundamental representation.
