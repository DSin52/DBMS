We complete the construction of the Moyal star formulation of bosonic openstring field theory (MSFT) by providing a detailed study of the fermionic ghostsector. In particular, as in the case of the matter sector, (1) we construct amap from Witten's star product to the Moyal product, (2) we propose aregularization scheme which is consistent with the matter sector and (3) as acheck of the formalism, we derive the ghost Neumann coefficients algebraicallydirectly from the Moyal product. The latter satisfy the Gross-Jevicki nonlinearrelations even in the presence of the regulator, and when the regulator isremoved they coincide numerically with the expression derived from conformalfield theory. After this basic construction, we derive a regularized action ofstring field theory in the Siegel gauge and define the Feynman rules. We giveexplicitly the analytic expression of the off-shell four point function fortachyons, including the ghost contribution. Some of the results in this paperhave already been used in our previous publications. This paper provides thetechnical details of the computations which were omitted there.
