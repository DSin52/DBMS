We show how any integrable 2D QFT enjoys the existence of infinitely manynon--abelian {\it conserved} charges satisfying a Yang--Baxter symmetryalgebra. These charges are generated by quantum monodromy operators and providea representation of $q-$deformed affine Lie algebras. We review and generalizethe work of de Vega, Eichenherr and Maillet on the bootstrap construction ofthe quantum monodromy operators to the sine--Gordon (or massive Thirring)model, where such operators do not possess a classical analogue. Within thelight--cone approach to the mT model, we explicitly compute the eigenvalues ofthe six--vertex alternating transfer matrix $\tau(\l)$ on a generic physicalstate, through algebraic Bethe ansatz. In the thermodynamic limit $\tau(\l)$turns out to be a two--valued periodic function. One determination generatesthe local abelian charges, including energy and momentum, while the otheryields the abelian subalgebra of the (non--local) YB algebra. In particular,the bootstrap results coincide with the ratio between the two determinations ofthe lattice transfer matrix.
