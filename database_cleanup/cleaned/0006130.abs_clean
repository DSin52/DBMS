Classical and Quantum Gravitational ImplicationsAuthors: Carlos Pinheiro (UFES, Brazil), J.A. Helayel-Neto (CBPF & UCP,

At first, we discuss parallels electric and magnetic fields solutions in agravitational background. Then, considering eletromagnetic and gravitationalwaves symmetries we show a particular solution for stationary gravitationalwaves. Finally we consider gravitation as a gauge theory (effectivegravitational theory), evaluate the propagators of the model, analyze thecorresponding quantum excitations and verify (confirm) the tree-level unitarityat many places of the model.
