Fixed angle scattering at high energy in a string theory with boundariessatisfying Dirichlet conditions (Dirichlet strings) in $D=4$ is shown to havelogarithmic dependence on energy, in addition to the power-like behavior knownbefore. High temperature free energy also depends logarithmically ontemperature. Such a result could provide a matching mechanism between stringsat long distance and asymptotic freedom at short distance, which is necessaryfor the reformulation of large-$N$ QCD as a string theory.
