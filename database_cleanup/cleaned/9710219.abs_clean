Title: Matrix Models and String World Sheet Duality

Authors: S. P. de Alwis

Comments: The analyticity assumption underlying the argument in the previous

version is clarified and its possible breakdown discussed; other minorchanges. 9 pages, latex, no figuresJournal-ref: Phys.Lett. B423 (1998) 59-63

The scaling limit used recently to derive matrix models, and a certainanalyticity assumption, are invoked to argue that the agreement between somematrix model calculations and supergravity is a consequence of string worldsheet duality.
