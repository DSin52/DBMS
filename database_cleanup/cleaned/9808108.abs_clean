It is proposed to make formulation of second quantizing a bosonic theory bygeneralizing the method of filling the Dirac negative energy sea for fermions.We interpret that the correct vacuum for the bosonic theory is obtained byadding minus one boson to each single particle negative energy states while thepositive energy states are empty. The boson states are divided into two sectors; the usual positive sector with positive and zero numbers of bosons and thenegative sector with negative numbers of bosons. Once it comes into thenegative sector it cannot return to the usual positive sector by ordinaryinteraction due to a barrier. It is suggested to use as a playround models inwhich the filling of empty fermion Dirac sea and the removal of boson from thenegative energy states are not yet performed. We put forward such a naivevacuum world and propose a CPT-like theorem for it.We study it in detail andgive a proof for $\lambda/4 (\phi^+\phi)^2$ theory. The CPT-like theoremis a strong reflection, but does not include inversion of operator order whichis involved in the ordinary CPT theorem. Instead it needs certain analyticcontinuation of the multiple wave function when the state is formulated as afinite number of particles present.
