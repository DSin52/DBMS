To construct a quantum group gauge theory one needs an algebra which isinvariant under gauge transformations. The existence of this invariant algebrais closely related with the existence of a differential algebra $\delta _{{\calH}} G_{q}$ compatible with the Hopf algebra structure. It is shown that $\delta_{{\cal H}} G_{q}$ exists only for the quantum group $U_{q}(N)$ and that thequantum group $SU_q(N)$ as a quantum gauge group is not allowed. Therepresentations of the algebra $\delta _{{\cal H}} G_{q}$ are con- structed.The operators corresponding to the differentials are realized via derivationson the space of all irreducible *-representations of $U_q(2)$. With the help ofthis construction infinitesimal gauge transformations in two-dimensionalclassical space-time are described.
