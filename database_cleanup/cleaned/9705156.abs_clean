The system of N scalar particles with Grassmann-valued color charges plus thecolor SU(3) Yang-Mills field is reformulated on spacelike hypersurfaces. TheDirac observables are found and the physical invariant mass of the system inthe Wigner-covariant rest-frame instant form of dynamics (covariant Coulombgauge) is given. From the reduced Hamilton equations we extract the secondorder equations of motion both for the reduced transverse color field and theparticles. Then, we study this relativistic scalar quark model, deduced fromthe classical QCD Lagrangian and with the color field present, in the N=2(meson) case. A special form of the requirement of having only color singlets,suited for a field-independent quark model, produces a ``pseudoclassicalasymptotic freedom" and a regularization of the quark self-energy.
