We discuss the off-shell renormalization properties of the abelian Higgsmodel in the unitary gauge. The model is not renormalizable according to theusual power counting rules. In this paper, however, we show that with a properchoice of interpolating fields for the massive photon and the Higgs particle,their off-shell Green functions can be renormalized. An analysis of the natureof the extra singularities in the unitary gauge is given, and a recipe for theoff-shell renormalization is provided.
