By dimensional reduction, Einstein-Hermitian equations of n + 1 dimensionalclosed Kahler manifolds lead to vortex equations of n dimensional closed Kahlermanifolds. A Yang-Mills-Higgs functional to unitary bundles over closed Kahlermanifolds has topological invariance by adding the additional terms which haveghost fields.Henceforth we achieve the matter (Higgs field) coupled topological fieldtheories in higher dimension.
