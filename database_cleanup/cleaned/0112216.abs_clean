Title: Mass scale effects for the Sudakov form factors in theories with the

broken gauge symmetryAuthors: A. Barroso and B.I. Ermolaev

Comments: 16 pages, 5 figures

The off-shell and the on-shell Sudakov form factors in theories with brokengauge symmetry are calculated in the double-logarithmic approximation. We haveused different infrared cut-offs, i.e. different mass scales, for virtualphotons and weak gauge bosons.
