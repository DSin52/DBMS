A calculational scheme of quantum-gravitational effects on the physicalquantities is proposed. The calculations are performed in 4-$\epsilon$dimension with $1/N$-expansion scheme, where the Einstein gravity isrenormalizable and it has an ultraviolet fixed-point within the 1/N-expansion.In order to perform a consistent perturbation in $4-\epsilon$ dimension,spin-3/2 fields should be adopted as the N matter-fields whose loop-correctionsare included in the effective action. After calculating the physical quantitiesat $4-\epsilon$ dimension, the four-dimensional aspects of them can be seen bytaking the limit of $\epsilon=0$. In taking this limit, any higher derivativeterms are not introduced as the counter terms since no divergence appears at$\epsilon=0$ in our scheme. According to this approach, we have examined theeffective potential of a scalar field to see the possibility of the spontaneoussymmetry breaking due to the gravitational loop corrections.
