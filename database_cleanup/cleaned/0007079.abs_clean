We examine the problem of gauge-field localization in higher-dimensionalgauge theories. In particular, we study a five-dimensional U(1) by latticetechniques and we find that gauge fields can indeed be localized. Two modelsare considered. The first one has anisotropic couplings independent of eachother and of the coordinates. It can be realized on a homogeneous butanisotropic flat Euclidean space. The second model has couplings depending onthe extra transverse fifth direction. This model can be realized by a U(1)gauge theory on the Randall-Sundrum background. We find that in both models anew phase exists, the layer phase, in which a massless photon is localized onthe four-dimensional layers. We find that this phase is separated from thestrong coupling phase by a second order phase transition.
