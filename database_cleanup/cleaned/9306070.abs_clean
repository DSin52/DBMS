We apply CGHS-type dilaton gravity model to (1+1)-dimensional cosmologicalsituations.First the behavior of a compact 1-dimensional universe (i.e. like a closedstring) is classified on the assumption of homogeneity of universe.Several interesting solutions are found, which include a Misner-type universehaving closed time-like curves, and an asymptotically de Sitter universe firstpointed out by Yoshimura.In the second half of this talk, we discuss the modification of the classicalhomogeneous solutions, considering inhomogeneity of classical conformal mattersand also quantum back-reaction respectively.(An expanded version of the talk presented by T. Mishima at Yukawa Instituteof Theoretical Physics workshop `Quantum Gravity' 24-27, November 1992.)
