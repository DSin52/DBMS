In this paper a set of canonical collective variables is defined for aclassical Klein-Gordon field and the problem of the definition of a set ofcanonical relative variables is discussed. This last point is approached bymeans of a harmonic analysis is momentum space. This analysis shows that therelative variables can be defined if certain conditions are fulfilled by thefield configurations. These conditions are expressed by the vanishing of a setof conserved quantities, referred to as supertranslations since as canonicalobservables they generate a set of canonical transformations whose algebra isthe same as that which arises in the study of the asymptotic behaviour of themetric of an isolated system in General Relativity.
