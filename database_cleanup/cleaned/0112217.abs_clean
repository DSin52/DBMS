We search for static solitons stabilized by heavy fermions in a 3+1dimensional Yukawa model. We compute the renormalized energy functional,including the exact one-loop quantum corrections, and perform a variationalsearch for configurations that minimize the energy for a fixed fermion number.We compute the quantum corrections using a phase shift parameterization, inwhich we renormalize by identifying orders of the Born series withcorresponding Feynman diagrams. For higher-order terms in the Born series, wedevelop a simplified calculational method. When applicable, we use thederivative expansion to check our results. We observe marginally boundconfigurations at large Yukawa coupling, and discuss their interpretation assoliton solutions subject to general limitations of the model.
