A systematic approach to the study of semiclassical fluctuations of stringsin AdS_5 x S^5 based on the Green-Schwarz formalism is developed. We show thatthe string partition function is well defined and finite. Issues related todifferent gauge choices are clarified. We consider explicitly several cases ofclassical string solutions with the world surface ending on a line, on a circleor on two lines on the boundary of AdS. The first example is a BPS object andthe partition function is one. In the third example the determinants we deriveshould give the first corrections to the Wilson loop expectation value in thestrong coupling expansion of the n=4 SYM theory at large N.
