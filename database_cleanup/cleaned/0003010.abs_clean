We introduce "chain by chain" method for constructing the constraintstructure of a system possessing both first and second class constraints. Weshow that the whole constraints can be classified into completely irreduciblefirst or second class chains. We found appropriate redefinition of second classconstraints to obtain a symplectic algebra among them.
