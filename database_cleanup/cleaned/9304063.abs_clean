The level spacing distributions which arise when one rescales the Laguerre orJacobi ensembles of hermitian matrices is studied. These distributions areexpressible in terms of a Fredholm determinant of an integral operator whosekernel is expressible in terms of Bessel functions of order $\alpha$. We derivea system of partial differential equations associated with the logarithmicderivative of this Fredholm determinant when the underlying domain is a unionof intervals. In the case of a single interval this Fredholm determinant is aPainleve tau function.
