We show how the spin 3/2 gravitino field can be localized on a brane in ageneral framework of supergravity theory. Provided that a scalar field coupledto the Rarita-Schwinger field develops an vacuum expectation value (VEV) whosephase depends on the 'radial' coordinate in extra internal space, the gravitinois localized on a brane with the exponentially decreasing warp factor byselecting an appropriate value of the VEV.
