correctedWe generalize, to any space-time dimension, the unitarity bounds of highestweight UIR's of the conformal groups with Lie algebras $so(2,d)$. We classifygauge theories invariant under $so(2,d)$, both integral and half-integralspins. A similar analysis is carried out for the algebras $so^*(2n)$. We studynew unitary modules of the conformal algebra in $d>4$, that have no analoguefor $d\leq 4$ as they cannot be obtained by "squaring" singletons. This maysuggest the interpretation of higher dimensional non-trivial conformal fieldtheories as theories of "tensionless" $p$-branes of which tensionless stringsin $d=6$ are just particular examples.
