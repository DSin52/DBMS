Superfields in 2-dimensional (2,2)-superspacetime which are independent of(some) half of the fermionic coordinates are discussed in a hopefully bothcomprehensive and comprehensible manner. An embarrassing abundance of thesesimplest `building blocks' makes it utterly impossible to write down the `mostgeneral Lagrangian'. With some ad hoc but perhaps plausible restrictions, arather general Lagrangian is found, which exhibits many of the phenomena thathave been studied recently, and harbors many more. In particular, it becomespatently obvious that the (2,2)-supersymmetric 2-dimensional field theorytarget space geometries (many of which are suitable for (super)stringpropagation) are far more general than Kahler manifolds with holomorphicbundles.
