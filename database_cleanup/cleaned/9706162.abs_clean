Title: Variational Perturbation Approach to Resonance-State Wave Functions

Comments: 10 pages, RevTeX, 4 ps figures. There were some calculational

mistakes in the previous manuscript. The correct results obtained by ourmethod show excellent agreement with the exact solutionsThe variational perturbation theory for wave functions, which has been shownto work well for bound states of the anharmonic oscillator, is applied toresonance states of the anharmonic oscillator with negative coupling constant.We obtain uniformly accurate wave functions starting from the bound states.
