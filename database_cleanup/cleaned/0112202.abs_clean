Title: A Note on the Tachyon State in Vacuum String Field Theory

Authors: R Rashkov and K S Viswanathan

Comments: 10 pages

We re-examine the recent proposal of Rastelli, Sen and Zwiebach on thetachyon fluctuation of the vacuum string field theory representing a D25 brane,originally considered by Hata and Kawano. We show that the tachyon statesatisfies the linearized equations of motion on-shell in the strong sensethereby allowing us to calculate the ratio of energy density to the tension ofthe D-brane to be $E_c/T_{25}\simeq \pi^2/3[1/16(ln2)^3]\simeq 0.62$. Our proofrelies on a careful handling of the limits ($n\to\infty$) involved in theconformal theory description of the sliver and tachyon states. We conjecturethat the sliver state represents a single D25 brane.
