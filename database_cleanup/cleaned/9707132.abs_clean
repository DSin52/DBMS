We analyse the velocity-dependent potentials seen by D0 and D4-brane probesmoving in Type I' background for head-on scattering off the fixed planes. Wefind that at short distances (compared to string length) the D0-brane probe hasa nontrivial moduli space metric, in agreement with the prediction of Type I'matrix model; however, at large distances it is modified by massive openstrings to a flat metric, which is consistent with the spacetime equations ofmotion of Type I' theory. We discuss the implication of this result for thematrix model proposal for M-theory. We also find that the nontrivial metric atshort distances in the moduli space action of the D0-brane probe is reflectedin the coefficient of the higher dimensional v^4 term in the D4-brane probeaction.
