We analyze the allowed spectrum of electric and magnetic charges carried bydyons in (toroidally compactified) heterotic string theory in four dimensionsat arbitrary values of the string coupling constant and $\theta$ angle. Thespectrum is shown to be invariant under electric-magnetic dualitytransformation, thereby providing support to the conjecture that this is anexact symmetry in string theory.
