We discuss the problem of noncommutative SO(N) gauge field theories from thestring one-loop point of view. To this end we propose an expression for thestring propagator on the boundary of the Moebius strip in the presence of aconstant B field. We discuss in detail the problems related to its derivation.Then we use it to compute the one-loop corrections to two-, three- andfour-gluon amplitudes in an open string theory with orthogonal Chan-Patonfactors. We show that these corrections in the field theory limit in 4D arecompatible with the one-loop corrections of a renormalizable noncommutativeSO(N) gauge field theory.
