Title: Effective Lagrangian for 3d N=4 SYM theories for any gauge group and

monopole moduli spacesComments: 17 pages LaTeX

We construct low energy effective Lagrangians for 3d N=4 supersymmetricYang-Mills theory with any gauge group. They represent supersymmetric sigmamodels at hyper-Kahlerian manifolds of dimension 4r (r is the rang of thegroup). In the asymptotic region, perturbatively exact explicit expression forthe metric are written. We establish the relationship of this metric with theTAUB-NUT metric describing the perturbatively exact effective Lagrangians forlatter by a proper hyper-Kahlerian reduction. We describe in details thereduction procedure for SO/Sp/G_2 gauge groups, where it can also be given anatural interpretation in D-brane language. We conjecture that the exactnonperturbative metrics can be obtained by a similar hyper-Kahlerian reductionfrom the corresponding multidimensional Atiyah-Hitchin metrics.
