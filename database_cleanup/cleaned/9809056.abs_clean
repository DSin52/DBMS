In a new approach to the theory of integration over Wess-Zuminosupermanifolds, we suggest that a fundamental principle is their consistencywith an ``Ethereal Conjecture'' that asserts the topology of the supermanifoldmust be generated essentially from its bosonic submanifold. This naturallyleads to a theory of ``ectoplasmic'' integration based on super p-forms. Oneconsequence of this approach is that the derivation of ``density projectionoperators'' becomes trivial in a number of supergravity theories.
