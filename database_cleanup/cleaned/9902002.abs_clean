We evaluate the fermionic determinant for massless QED_2 at finitetemperature, in the imaginary time formalism. By using a decouplingtransformation of the fermionic fields, we show that the determinant factorizesinto the usual, temperature independent expression, times an extra factor whichdepends on the temperature and on the constant component of the gauge field.
