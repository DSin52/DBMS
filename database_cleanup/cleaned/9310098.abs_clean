We apply the recently proposed transfer matrix formalism to 2-dimensionalquantum gravity coupled to $(2, 2k-1)$ minimal models. We find that thepropagation of a parent universe in geodesic (Euclidean) time is accompanied bycontinual emission of baby universes and derive a distribution functiondescribing their sizes. The $k\to \infty~ (c\to -\infty)$ limit is generallythought to correspond to classical geometry, and we indeed find a classicalpeak in the universe distribution function. However, we also observe dramaticquantum effects associated with baby universes at finite length scales.
