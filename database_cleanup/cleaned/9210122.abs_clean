We solve the Kac-Moody branching equation to obtain explicit formulae for thecharacters of coset conformal field theories and then apply these to specificexamples to determine the integer shift of the conformal weights of primaryfields. We also present an example of coset conformal field theory which cannotbe described by the identification current method.
