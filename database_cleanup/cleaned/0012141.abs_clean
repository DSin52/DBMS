(11pt) fontsBy exploiting the BV quantization of topological bosonic open membrane, weargue that flat 3-form C-field leads to deformations of the algebras ofmulti-vectors on the Dirichlet-brane world-volume as 2-algebras. This wouldshed some new light on geometry of M-theory 5-brane and associated decoupledtheories. We show that, in general, topological open p-brane theory has astructure of (p+1)-algebra in the bulk, while a structure of p-algebra in theboundary. The bulk/boundary correspondences are exactly as the generalizedDeligne conjecture (a theorem of Kontsevich) in the algebraic world ofp-algebras. It also imply that the algebras of quantum observables of(p-1)-brane are ``close to'' the algebras of its classical observables asp-algebras. We interpret above as deformation quantization of (p-1)-brane,generalizing the p=1 case. We argue that there is such quantization based onthe direct relation between BV master equation and Ward identity of the bulktopological theory. The path integral of the theory will lead to the explicitformula. We also discuss some applications to topological strings andconjecture that the homological mirror symmetry has further generalizations tothe categories of p-algebras.
