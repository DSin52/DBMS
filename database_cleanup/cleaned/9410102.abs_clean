We consider travelling periodical and quasiperiodical waves in single modefibres, with weak birefringence and under the action of cross-phase modulation.quartic potential. A general approach for finding elliptic solutions is given.New solutions which are associated with two-gap Treibich-Verdier potentials arefound. General quasiperiodic solutions are given in terms of two dimensionaltheta functions with explicit expressions for frequencies in terms of thetaconstants. The reduction of quasiperiodic solutions to elliptic functions isdiscussed.
