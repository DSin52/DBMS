We consider the generalization of Haldane's state-counting procedure todescribe all possible types of exclusion statistics which are linear in thedeformation parameter $g$. The statistics are parametrized by elements of thesymmetric group of the particles in question. For several specific cases wedetermine the form of the distribution functions which generalizes resultsobtained by Wu. Using them we analyze the low-temperature behavior andthermodynamic properties of these systems and compare our results with previousstudies of the thermodynamics of a gas of $g$-ons. Various possible physicalapplications of these constructions are discussed.
