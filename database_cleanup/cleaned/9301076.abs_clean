The Hamiltonian structure of the monodromy preserving deformation equationsof Jimbo {\it et al } is explained in terms of parameter dependent pairs ofmoment maps from a symplectic vector space to the dual spaces of two differentloop algebras. The nonautonomous Hamiltonian systems generating thedeformations are obtained by pulling back spectral invariants on Poissonsubspaces consisting of elements that are rational in the loop parameter andidentifying the deformation parameters with those determining the moment maps.This construction is shown to lead to ``dual'' pairs of matrix differentialoperators whose monodromy is preserved under the same family of deformations.As illustrative examples, involving discrete and continuous reductions, ahigher rank generalization of the Hamiltonian equations governing thecorrelation functions for an impenetrable Bose gas is obtained, as well as dualpairs of isomonodromy representations for the equations of the Painlevetranscendents $P_{V}$ and $P_{VI}$.
