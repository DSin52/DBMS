We describe a way in which spin of quarks can enter a consistent QCD stringtheory. We show that the spin factor of the 4d massless, spin 1/2 fermions isrelated to the self-intersection number of a 2d surfaces immersed in the 4dspace. We argue that the latter quantity should appear in a consistentdescription of the QCD string. We also calculate the chiral anomaly and showthat the self-intersection number corresponds to the topological charge$F{\tilde F}$ of QCD.
