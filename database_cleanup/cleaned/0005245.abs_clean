A simple criterion to optimise coarse-grainings for exact renormalisationgroup equations is given. It is aimed at improving the convergence ofapproximate solutions of flow equations. The optimisation criterion is generic,as it refers only to the coarse-grained propagator at vanishing field. Inphysical terms, it is understood as an optimisation condition for amplitudeexpansions. Alternatively, it can be interpreted as the requirement to movepoles of threshold functions away from the physical region. The link toexpansions in field amplitudes is discussed as well. Optimal parameters aregiven explicitly for a variety of different coarse-grainings. As a by-productit is found that the sharp cut-off regulator does not belong to the class ofsuch optimal coarse-grainings, which explains the poor convergence of amplitudeexpansions based on it.
