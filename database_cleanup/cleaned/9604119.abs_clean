A geometrical formulation of the T-duality rules for type II superstringRamond--Ramond fields is presented. This is used to derive the Wess-Zuminoterms in superstring D-brane actions, including terms proportional to the massparameter of the IIA theory, thereby completing partial results in theliterature. For non-abelian world-volume gauge groups the massive type IIAD-brane actions contain non-abelian Chern--Simons terms for the Born--Infeldgauge potential, implying a quantization of the IIA cosmological constant.
