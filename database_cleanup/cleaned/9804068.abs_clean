We consider strongly coupled supersymmetric gauge theories softly broken bythe addition of gaugino masses $m_\lambda$ and (non-holomorphic) scalar masses$m^2$, taken to be small relative to the dynamical scale $\Lambda$. Fortheories with a weakly coupled dual description in the infrared, we computeexactly the leading soft masses for the "magnetic" degrees of freedom, withuncalculable corrections suppressed by powers of $(m_{\lambda}/\Lambda),(m/\Lambda)$. The exact relations hold between the infrared fixed point"magnetic" soft masses and the ultraviolet fixed point "electric" soft masses,and correspond to a duality mapping for soft terms. We briefly discussimplications of these results for the vacuum structure of these theories.
