This model also known as chiral null model is a generalization of thegravitational wave and fundamental string background and is exact in the $\a'$expansion. The reduction to 4 dimensions yields a stationary IWP solution whichcouples to 7 gauge fields (one gravi-photon and 6 matter gauge fields) and 4scalars. Special cases are the Taub-NUT geometry and rotating black holes.These solutions possess a T-self-dual point where the black hole becomesmassless. Discussing the S-duality we show that the Taub-NUT geometry allows anS-self-dual point and that the electric black hole corresponds to a magneticblack hole or an H-monopole. We could identify the massless black hole as$N_L=0$ and confirm the H-monopole as an $N_L=1$ string states.
