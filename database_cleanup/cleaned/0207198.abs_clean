A nonlocal quantum gravity theory is presented which is finite and unitary toall orders of perturbation theory. Vertex form factors in Feynman diagramsinvolving gravitons suppress graviton and matter vacuum fluctuation loops byintroducing a low-energy gravitational scale, Lambda_{Gvac} < 2.4 X 10^{-3} eV.Gravitons coupled to non-vacuum matter loops and matter tree graphs arecontrolled by a vertex form factor with the energy scale, Lambda_{GM} < 1-10TeV. A satellite Eotvos experiment is proposed to test a violation of theequivalence principle for coupling of gravitons to pure vacuum energy comparedto matter.
