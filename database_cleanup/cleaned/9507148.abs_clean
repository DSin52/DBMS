We consider finite approximations of a topological space $M$ bynoncommutative lattices of points. These lattices are structure spaces ofnoncommutative $C^*$-algebras which in turn approximate the algebra $\cc(M)$ ofcontinuous functions on $M$. We show how to recover the space $M$ and thealgebra $\cc(M)$ from a projective system of noncommutative lattices and aninductive system of noncommutative $C^*$-algebras, respectively.
