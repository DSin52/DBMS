In this paper we extend our previously discovered exact solution for an SU(2)gauge theory coupled to a massless, non-interacting scalar field, to thegeneral group SU(N+1). Using the first-order formalism of Bogomolny, an exact,spherically symmetric solution for the gauge and scalar fields is found. Thissolution is similiar to the Schwarzschild solution of general relativity, inthat the gauge and scalar fields become infinite at a radius, $r_0 = K$, fromthe origin. It is speculated that this may be the confinement mechanism thathas long been sought for in non-Abelian gauge theories, since any particlewhich carries the SU(N+1) charge would become permanently trapped once itentered the region $r < r_0$. The energy of the field configuration of thissolution is calculated.
