Title: D-brane Inflation

Authors: G. Dvali, Q. Shafi and S. Solganik

Comments: Talk given by Q.S. at the workshop in Heidelberg (April 4-7, 2001),

and at the EURESCO conference in Le Londe (France) May 11-16, 2001. 12ppWe discuss a calculable version of brane inflation, in which a set ofparallel D-brane and anti-D-brane worlds, initially displaced in extradimension, slowly attract each other. In the effective four-dimensional theorythis slow motion of branes translates into a slow-roll of a scalar field(proportional to their separation) with a flat potential that drives inflation.The number of possible e-foldings is severely constrained. The scalar spectralindex is found to be 0.97, while the effective compactification scale is oforder $10^{12}$ GeV. Reheating of the Universe is provided by collision andsubsequent annihilation of branes.
