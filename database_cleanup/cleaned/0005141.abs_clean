Journal-ref: J.Phys. A33 (2000) 7109-7122

A general method based on the polynomial deformations of the Lie algebrasl(2,R) is proposed in order to exhibit the quasi-exactly solvability ofspecific Hamiltonians implied by quantum physical models. This method using thefinite-dimensional representations and differential realizations of suchdeformations is illustrated on the sextic oscillator as well as on the secondharmonic generation.
