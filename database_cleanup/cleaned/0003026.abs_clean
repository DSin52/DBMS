Title: Correlation functions of chiral primary operators in perturbative {\cal

N}=4 SYMAuthors: S. Penati, A. Santambrogio and D. Zanon

Comments: LaTex, 8 pages. Contribution to the TMR meeting "Quantum aspects of

gauge theories, supersymmetry and unification". Paris, 1-7 September 1999We discuss recent results on two-point functions of chiral primary operatorsin {\cal N}=4 SU(N) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Our results give furthersupport to the belief that such correlators are not renormalized to all ordersin g and to all orders in N.
