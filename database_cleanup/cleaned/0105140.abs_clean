Sine-Gordon ModelAuthors: Shao-shiung Lin, Shi-shyr Roan

Comments: 27 pages, Latex; Some reorganizations and improvement of

presentations, and other minor changesGeometry; Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems; Statistical MechanicsUsing the Baxter's T-Q relation derived from the transfer matrix technique,we consider the diagonalization problem of discrete quantum pendulum anddiscrete quantum sine-Gordon Hamiltonian from the algebraic geometry aspect.For a finite chain system of the size L, when the spectral curve degeneratesinto rational curves, we have reduced Baxter's T-Q relation into a polynomialequation; the connection of T-Q polynomial equation with the algebraic BetheAnsatz is clearly established . In particular, for L=4 it is the case ofrational spectral curves for the discrete quantum pendulum and discretesine-Gordon model. To these Baxter's T-Q polynomial equations, we have obtainedthe complete and explicit solutions with a detailed understanding of theirquantitative and qualitative structure. In general the model possesses aspectral curve with a generic parameter. We have conducted certain qualitativestudy on the algebraic geometry of this high-genus Riemann surfaceincorporating Baxter's T-Q relation.
