We present a general method to bosonize systems of Fermions with infinitelymany degrees of freedom, in particular systems of non-relativistic electrons atpositive density, by expressing the quantized conserved electric charge- andcurrent density in terms of a bosonic antisymmetric tensorfield of a rank d--1,where d is the dimension of space. This enables us to make concepts and toolsfrom gauge theory available for the purpose of analyzing electronic structureof non-relativistic matter. We apply our bosonization identities and conceptsfrom gauge theory, such as Wegner -'t Hooft duality, to a variety of systems ofsuperconductors, etc.. Among our results are an exact formula for the plasmongap in a metal, a simple derivation of the Anderson-Higgs mechanism insuperconductors, and an analysis of the orthogonality catastrophe for staticsources.
