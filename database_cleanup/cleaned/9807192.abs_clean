The transition amplitude is obtained for a free massive particle of arbitraryspin by calculating the path integral in the index-spinor formulation withinthe BFV-BRST approach. None renormalizations of the path integral measure wereapplied. The calculation has given the Weinberg propagator written in theindex-free form with the use of index spinor. The choice of boundary conditionson the index spinor determines holomorphic or antiholomorphic representationfor the canonical description of particle/antiparticle spin.
