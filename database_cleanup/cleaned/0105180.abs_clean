We study behavior of bulk gauge field in the bigravity model in which twopositive tension $AdS_4$ branes in $AdS_5$ bulk are included. We solve theequations of motions for Kaluza-Klein modes and determine the mass spectrum. Itis shown that unlike the case of graviton, we find no ultralight Kaluza-Kleinmodes in the spectrum.
