Non-supersymmetric brane world scenarios in string theory displayperturbative instabilities that usually involve run-away potentials for scalarmoduli fields. We investigate in the framework of intersecting brane worldswhether the leading order scalar potential for the closed string moduli allowsto satisfy the slow-rolling conditions required for applications ininflationary cosmology. Adopting a particular choice of basis in field spaceand assuming mechanisms to stabilize some of the scalars, we find thatslow-rolling conditions can be met very generically. In intersecting braneworlds inflation can end nearly instantaneously like in the hybrid inflationscenario due to the appearance of open string tachyons localized at theintersection of two branes, which signal a corresponding phase transition inthe gauge theory via the condensation of a Higgs field.
