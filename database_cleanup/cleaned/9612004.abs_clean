Title: Wrapped Supermembrane

Comments: 6 pages, Latex

The Hamiltonian of the wrapping and KK modes of the supermembrane isidentified with the SL(2, Z) symmetric axion-dilaton black hole mass formula.It means that the supermembrane with KK modes wrapped $m$ times around thespace-time torus of compactified dimensions induces the superpotential breakingspontaneously N=2 down to N=1 SUSY. The supersymmetry breaking parameter Lambdais inversely proportional to the area A of the space-time torus around whichthe supermembrane wraps. The restoration of supersymmetry as well asdecompactification of higher dimensions of space-time are forbidden by therequirement of stability of the wrapped supermembrane. This may be an ultimatereason why supersymmetry is broken in the real world.
