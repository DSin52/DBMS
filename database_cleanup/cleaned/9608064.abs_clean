We consider the classical self-dual Yang-Mills equation in 3+1-dimensionalMinkowski space. We have found an exact solution, which describes scattering of$n$ plane waves. In order to write the solution in a compact form, it isconvenient to introduce a scattering operator $\hat{T}$. It acts in the direct2) $n$-dimensional vector space and 3) space of functions defined on the unitinterval.
