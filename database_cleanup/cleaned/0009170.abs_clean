Title: Quantum Cauchy problem in cosmology

Authors: A.O.Barvinsky, D.V.Nesterov

Comments: Talk at the E.S. Fradkin Memorial Conference (Moscow, June 2000); 10

pages, LaTeXWe develop a general framework for effective equations of expectation valuesin quantum cosmology and pose for them the quantum Cauchy problem withno-boundary and tunneling wavefunctions. We apply this framework in the modelwith a big negative non-minimal coupling, which incorporates a recentlyproposed low energy (GUT scale) mechanism of the quantum origin of theinflationary Universe and study the effects of the quantum inflaton mode.
