We study the Renormalization Group (RG) flow of critical bosonic backgroundfields in the framework of the RG approach to string theory. In this approachquantum field theory beta-functions are the extra inputs in solving the stringtheory sigma-model equations. We study two different situations, the first oneis the Yang-Mills theory where the coupling constant diverges in the infraredlimit. The second case corresponds to a type of theories where thebeta-function has a pole in the infrared limit and it changes sign through thepole (as in N=1 super-Yang-Mills theory). For this case in the strong couplingbranch, in the infrared, there is an interval of values of the coupling inwhich the theory only leads to confinement. We have obtained this range. Wealso mention the theories with conformal-fixed points and their relation totheories with a pole in the beta-functions. We calculate the Wilson loops inthese theories.
