The left hand side of Einstein's equations G=-T is defined as the tensor ofenergy-momentum of gravitational field. Here the energy of gravitation isnegative, the full energy of the system matter+gravitation is equal to zero andappeared a new process - the annihilation of matter and gravitation. As result,the cosmological constant is vanished, singularities not exist and black holesannihilated during the collaps. It is shown, that in field theories not need inmass renormalization because of automatical compensation of infinities by theirown gravitational energy. The main surprise is the renormalizability of quantumgravity with negative energy of gravitational background.
