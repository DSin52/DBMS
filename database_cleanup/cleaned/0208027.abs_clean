Vortices resulting from breakdown of gauge symmetry lose their topologicalstability after they intersect to form closed loops. However, if they trapzero-energy modes of fermions, and in the process acquire non-integer fermioniccharge, they get stabilised. In the case of majorana fermions a finite spectrumof negative values of the fermion number occurs at zero-energy. We determinethe parities of these states and prove a superselection rule. The decay of suchobjects in isolation or by scattering with ordinary particles is thus ruledout.
