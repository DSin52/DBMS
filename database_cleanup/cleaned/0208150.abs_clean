Title: On the Large N Limit of Conformal Field Theory

Authors: M.B.Halpern

Comments: 50 pages, fixed typos and added references

Following recent advances in large N matrix mechanics, I discuss here thefree (Cuntz) algebraic formulation of the large N limit of two-dimensionalconformal field theories of chiral adjoint fermions and bosons. One of thecentral results is a new {\it affine free algebra} which describes a large Nlimit of su(N) affine Lie algebra. Other results include the associated {\itfree-algebraic partition functions and characters}, a free-algebraic cosetconstruction, free- algebraic construction of osp(1|2), {\it free-algebraicvertex operator constructions} in the large N Bose systems and a provocativenew free-algebraic factorization of the ordinary Koba-Nielsen factor.
