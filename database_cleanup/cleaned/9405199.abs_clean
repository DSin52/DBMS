We review the insights into black hole entropy that arise from theformulation of gravitation theory in terms of dimensional continuation. Therole of the horizon area and the deficit angle of a conical singularity at thehorizon as canonically conjugate dynamical variables is analyzed. The pathintegral and the extension of the Wheeler-De Witt equation for black holes arediscussed.
