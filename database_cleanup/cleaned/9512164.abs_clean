We examine the quantum energy levels of rectangular billiards with apointlike scatterer in one and two dimensions. By varying the location and thestrength of the scatterer, we systematically find diabolical degeneracies amongvarious levels. The associated Berry phase is illustrated, and the existence oflocalized wave functions is pointed out. In one dimension, even the groundstate is shown to display the sign reversal with a mechanism to circumvent theSturm-Liouville theorem.
