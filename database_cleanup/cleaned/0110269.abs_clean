2001 International Europhysics Conference on HEP, Budapest, July 12-18, 2001We investigate spacetimes in which the speed of light along flat 4D sectionsvaries over the extra dimensions due to different warp factors for the spaceand the time coordinates (``asymmetrically warped'' spacetimes). The mainproperty of such spaces is that while the induced metric is flat, implyingLorentz invariant particle physics on a brane, bulk gravitational effects willcause apparent violations of Lorentz invariance and of causality from the braneobserver's point of view. An important experimentally verifiable consequence ofthis is that gravitational waves may travel with a speed different from thespeed of light on the brane, and possibly even faster. We find the most generalspacetimes of this sort, which are given by certain types of black holespacetimes characterized by the mass and the charge of the black hole. We showhow to satisfy the junction conditions and analyze the properties of thesespace-times.
