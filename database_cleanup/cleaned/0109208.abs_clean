Within the covariant formulation of Light-Front Dynamics, in a scalar modelwith the interaction Hamiltonian $H=-g\psi^{2}(x)\phi(x)$, we calculatenonperturbatively the renormalized state vector of a scalar "nucleon" in atruncated Fock space containing the $N$, $N\pi$ and $N\pi\pi$ sectors. Themodel gives a simple example of non-perturbative renormalization which iscarried out numerically. Though the mass renormalization $\delta m^2$ divergeslogarithmically with the cutoff $L$, the Fock components of the "physical"nucleon are stable when $L\to\infty$.
