Anyonic oscillators with fractional statistics are built on a two-dimensionalsquare lattice by means of a generalized Jordan-Wigner construction, and theirdeformed commutation relations are thoroughly discussed. Such anyonicoscillators, which are non-local objects that must not be confused with$q$-oscillators, are then combined \`a la Schwinger to construct the generatorsof the quantum group $SU(2)_q$ with $q=\exp({\rm i}\pi\nu)$, where $\nu$ is theanyonic statistical parameter.
