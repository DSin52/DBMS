We compute the one loop partition function of type IIB string in plane waveR-R 5-form background $F^5$ using both path integral and operator formalismsand show that the two results agree perfectly. The result turns out to be equalto the partition function in the flat background. We also study the Tadpolecancellation for the unoriented closed and open string model in plane wave R-R5-form background studied in hep-th/0203249 and find that the cancellation ofthe Tadpole requires the gauge group to be SO(8).
