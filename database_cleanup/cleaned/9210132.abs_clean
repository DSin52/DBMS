Title: The Search for Zoo-Perparticles

Comments: 24pp

This paper reviews the covariant formalism of N=1, D=10 classicalsuperparticle models. It discusses the local invariances of a number ofsuperparticle actions and highlights the problem of finding a covariantquantization scenario. Covariant quantization has proved problematic, but ithas motivated in seeking alternative approaches that avoids those found inearlier models. It also shows new covariant superparticle theories formulatedin extended spaces that preserve certain canonical form in phase-space, andeasy to quantize by using the Batalin-Vilkovisky procedure, as the gaugealgebra of their constraints only closes on-shell. The mechanics actionsdescribe particles moving in a superspace consisting of the usual $N=1$superspace, together with an extra spinor or vector coordinate. A light-coneanalysis shows that all these new superparticle models reproduce the physicalspectrum of the N=1 super-Yang-Mills theory.
