We show that the physical requirement of flux conservation can substitute forthe usual matching conditions in point interactions. The study covers anarbitrary superposition of $\delta$ and $\delta'$ potentials on the real lineand can be easily applied to higher dimensions. Our procedure can be seen as aphysical interpretation of the deficiency index of some symmetric, but notself-adjoint operators.
