Title: Chiral Symmetry Breaking in an External Field

Comments: RevTeX; talk presented at the 2nd Latin American Symposium on High

Energy Physics, San Juan, Puerto Rico, April 1998The effects of an external field on the dynamics of chiral symmetry breakingare studied using quenched, ladder QED as our model gauge field theory. It isfound that a uniform external magnetic field enables the chiral symmetry to bespontaneously broken at weak gauge couplings, in contrast with the situationwhen no external field is present. The broken chiral symmetry is restored athigh temperatures as well as at high chemical potentials. The nature of the twocontinuous one whereas the phase transition at high chemical potentials isdiscontinuous.
