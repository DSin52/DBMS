We consider the ordinary and noncommutative Dirac-Born-Infeld theories withinthe open string sigma-model. First, we propose a renormalization scheme, hybridpoint splitting regularization, that leads directly to the Seiberg-Wittendescription including their two-form. We also show how such a form appearswithin the standard renormalization scheme just by some freedom in changingvariables. Second, we propose a Wilson factor which has the noncommutativegauge invariance on the classical level and then compute the sigma-modelpartition function within one of the known renormalization scheme thatpreserves the noncommutative gauge invariance. As a result, we find thenoncommutative Yang-Mills action.
