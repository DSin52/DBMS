We study the stringy genus one partition function of $N=2$ SCFT's. It isshown how to compute this using an anomaly in decoupling of BRST trivial statesfrom the partition function. A particular limit of this partition functionyields the partition function of topological theory coupled to topologicalgravity. As an application we compute the number of holomorphic elliptic curvesover certain Calabi-Yau manifolds including the quintic threefold. This may beviewed as the first application of mirror symmetry at the string quantum level.
