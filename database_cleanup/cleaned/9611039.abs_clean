We discuss general features of the $\beta$-function equations for spatiallyflat, $(d+1)$-dimensional cosmological backgrounds at lowest order in thestring-loop expansion, but to all orders in $\alpha'$. In the special case ofconstant curvature and a linear dilaton these equations reduce to $(d+1)$algebraic equations in $(d+1)$ unknowns, whose solutions can act as late-timeregularizing attractors for the singular lowest-order pre-big bang solutions.We illustrate the phenomenon in a first order example, thus providing anexplicit realization of the previously conjectured transition from the dilatonto the string phase in the weak coupling regime of string cosmology. Thecomplementary role of $\alpha'$ corrections and string loops for completing thetransition to the standard cosmological scenario is also briefly discussed.
