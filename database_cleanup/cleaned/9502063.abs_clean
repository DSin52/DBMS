integrable equationsComments: 22 pages, LaTeX

its special cases, e.g., AKNS. The ZS comprises all integrable systems having aform of zero-curvature equations with rational dependence of matrices on aspectral parameter. The notion of a $\tau$-function is introduced here in themost general case along with formulas linking $\tau$-functions with wave Bakerfunctions. The method originally invented by Sato et al. for the KP hierarchyis used. This method goes immediately from definitions and does not require anyassumption about the character of a solution, being the most general. Appliedto the matrix hierarchies, it involves considerable sophistication. The paperis self-contained and does not expect any special prerequisite from a reader.
