We compute the intrinsic Hausdorff dimension of spacetime at the infraredfixed point of the quantum conformal factor in 4D gravity. The fractaldimension is defined by the appropriate covariant diffusion equation in fourdimensions and is determined by the coefficient of the Gauss-Bonnet term in thetrace anomaly to be generally greater than 4. In addition to being testable insimplicial simulations, this scaling behavior suggests a physical mechanism forthe screening of the effective cosmological `constant' and inverse Newtoniancoupling at very large distance scales, which has implications for the darkmatter content and large scale structure of the universe.
