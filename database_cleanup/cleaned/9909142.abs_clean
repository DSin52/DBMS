The periodic bounce configurations responsible for quantum tunneling areobtained explicitly and are extended to the finite energy case forminisuperspace models of the Universe. As a common feature of the tunnelingmodels at finite energy considered here we observe that the period of thebounce increases with energy monotonically. The periodic bounces do not havebifurcations and make no contribution to the nucleation rate except the onewith zero energy. The sharp first order phase transition from quantum tunnelingto thermal activation is verified with the general criterions.
