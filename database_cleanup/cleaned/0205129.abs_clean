We use the anti-de Sitter (AdS) conformal field theory correspondence tocalculate the conserved charges and the Euclidean actions of the chargedrotating black string in four dimensions both in the canonical and thegrand-canonical ensemble. The four-dimensional solution of the Einstein-Maxwellequations with a positive cosmological constant is introduced, and itsconserved quantities and actions for fixed charge and fixed electric potentialare calculated. We also study the thermodynamics of the asymptotically AdSblack strings and perform a stability analysis both in the canonical and thegrand-canonical ensembles. We find that the asymptotically AdS black string inthe canonical ensemble is locally stable, while in the grand-canonical ensembleit is stable only for a part of the phase space.
