Title: Some remarks on Whitham equations

Comments: Latex, 26 pages. Some typos corrected and clarification provided

A number of formulas are displayed concerning Whitham theory for a simpleexample of pure N=2 susy YM with gauge group SU(2). In particular this servesto illuminate the role of Lambda and T derivatives and the interaction withprepotentials F based on Seiberg-Witten and Whitham theory.
