The Euclidean analogues of the sine-Gordon solitons are used as sources ofthe heterotic fivebrane solutions in the ten-dimensional heterotic stringtheory. Some properties of these soliton solutions are discussed. Thesesolitons in principle can appear as string-like objects in 4-dimensionalspace-time after proper compactifications.
