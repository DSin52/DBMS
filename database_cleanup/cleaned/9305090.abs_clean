Title: Localization in GWZW and Verlinde formula

Gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten theory for compact groups is considered. It isshown that this theory has fermionic BRST-like symmetry and may be exactlysolved using localization approach. As an example we calculate functionalintegral for the case of SU(2) group on the arbitrary Riemann surface. Theanswer is the particular case of Verlinde formula for the number of conformalblocks.
