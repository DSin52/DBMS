The Liouville field theory on Z_N-Riemann surfaces is studied and it is shownthat it decomposes into a Liouville field theory on the sphere and N-1 freeboson theories. Also, the partition function of the Liouville field theory onthe Z_N-Riemann surfaces is expressed as a product of the correlation functionfor the Liouville vertex operators on the sphere and a number of twistedfields.
