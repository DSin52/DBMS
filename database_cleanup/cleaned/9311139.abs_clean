A similarity transformation, which brings a particular class of the $N=1$string to the $N=0$ one, is explicitly constructed. It enables us to give asimple proof for the argument recently proposed by Berkovits and Vafa. The$N=1$ BRST operator is turned into the direct sum of the corresponding $N=0$BRST operator and that for an additional topological sector. As a result, thephysical spectrum of these $N=1$ vacua is shown to be isomorphic to the tensorproduct of the $N=0$ spectrum and the topological sector which consists of onlythe vacuum. This transformation manifestly keeps the operator algebra.
