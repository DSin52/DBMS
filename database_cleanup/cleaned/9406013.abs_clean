A general definition of Chern-Simons actions in non-commutative geometry isproposed and illustrated in several examples. These are based on``space-times'' which are products of even-dimensional, Riemannian spinmanifolds by a discrete (two-point) set. If the *algebras of operatorsdescribing the non-commutative spaces are generated by functions over such``space-times'' with values in certain Clifford algebras the Chern-Simonsactions turn out to be the actions of topological gravity on theeven-dimensional spin manifolds. By contrasting the space of fieldconfigurations in these examples in an appropriate manner one is able toextract dynamical actions from Chern-Simons actions.
