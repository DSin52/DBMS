Certain spontaneously broken gauge theories contain massless magneticmonopoles. These are realized classically as clouds of non-Abelian fieldssurrounding one or more massive monopoles. In order to gain a betterunderstanding of these clouds, we study BPS solutions with four massive and sixmassless monopoles in an SU(6) gauge theory. We develop an algebraic procedure,based on the Nahm construction, that relates these solutions to previouslyknown examples. Explicit implementation of this procedure for a number oflimiting cases reveals that the six massless monopoles condense into fourdistinct clouds, of two different types. By analyzing these limiting solutions,we clarify the correspondence between clouds and massless monopoles, and infera set of rules that describe the conditions under which a finite size cloud canbe formed. Finally, we identify the parameters entering the general solutionand describe their physical significance.
