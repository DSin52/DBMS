We study the logarithmic conformal field theories in which conformal weightsare continuous subset of real numbers. A general relation between thecorrelators consisting of logarithmic fields and those consisting of ordinaryconformal fields is investigated. As an example the correlators of theCoulomb-gas model are explicitly studied.
