We reexamine the external field problem for $N\times N$ hermitian one-matrixmodels. We prove an equivalence of the models with the potentials$\tr{({1/over2N}X^2 + \log X - \Lambda X)}$ and $\sum_{k=1}^\infty t_k\tr{X^k}$providing the matrix $\Lambda$ is related to $\{t_k\}$ by $t_k=\fr 1k\tr{\Lambda^{-k}}-\frac N2 \delta_{k2}$. Based on this equivalence we formulatea method for calculating the partition function by solving the Schwinger--Dysonequations order by order of genus expansion. Explicit calculations of thepartition function and of correlators of conformal operators with the punctureoperator are presented in genus one. These results support the conjecture thatour models are associated with the $c=1$ case in the same sense as theKontsevich model describes $c=0$.
