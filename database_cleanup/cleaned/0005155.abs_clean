Title: Equivalence Theorem for Lagrangians in Different Dimensions

Authors: L. M. Baker (University of Durham)

Comments: 7 pages, LaTeX, no figures

A proof is given for the observation that the equations of motion for thecompanion Lagrangian without a square root, subject to some constraints, justreduce to the equations of motion for the companion Lagrangian with a squareroot in one less dimension. The companion Lagrangian is just an extension ofthe Klein-Gordon Lagrangian to more fields in order to provide a fielddescription for strings and branes.
