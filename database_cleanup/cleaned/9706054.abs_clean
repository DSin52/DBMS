The Lie algebraic structures of the S-matrices for the affine Toda fieldtheories based on the dual pairs (X_N^{(1)}, Y_M^{(l)}) are discussed. For thenon-simply-laced horizontal subalgebra X_N and the simply-laced horizontalsubalgebra Y_M, we introduce a ``q-deformation'' of a Coxeter element and a``p-deformation'' of a twisted Coxeter element respectively. Using thesedeformed objects, expressions for the generating function of the multiplicitiesof the building block of the S-matrices are obtained. The relation between thedeformed version of Dorey's rule and generalized Dorey's rule due to Chari andPressley are discussed.
