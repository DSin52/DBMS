The running coupling constants (in particular, the gravitational one) arestudied in asymptotically free GUTs and in finite GUTs in curved spacetime,with explicit examples. The running gravitational coupling is used to calculatethe leading quantum GUT corrections to the Newtonian potential, which turn outto be of logarithmic form in asymptotically free GUTs. A comparison with theeffective theory for the conformal factor ---where leading quantum correctionsto the Newtonian potential are again logarithmic--- is made. A totallyasymptotically free $O(N)$ GUT with quantum higher derivative gravity is thenconstructed, using the technique of introducing renormalization group (RG)potentials in the space of couplings. RG equations for the cosmological andgravitational couplings in this theory are derived, and solved numerically,showing the influence of higher-derivative quantum gravity on the Newtonianpotential. The RG-improved effective gravitational Lagrangian forasymptotically free massive GUTs is calculated in the strong (almost constant)curvature regime, and the non-singular De Sitter solution to the quantumcorrected gravitational equations is subsequently discussed. Finally, possibleextensions of the results here obtained are briefly outlined.
