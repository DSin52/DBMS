We analyze the symplectic structure of two-dimensional dilaton gravity byevaluating the symplectic form on the space of classical solutions. The casewhen the spatial manifold is compact is studied in detail. When the matter isabsent we find that the reduced phase space is a two-dimensional cotangentbundle and determine the Hilbert space of the quantum theory. In thenon-compact case the symplectic form is not well defined due to an unresolvedambiguity in the choice of the boundary terms.
