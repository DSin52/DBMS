We study the order $\alpha'$ correction to the string black hole found byGarfinkle, Horowitz, and Strominger. We include all operators of dimension upto four in the Lagrangian, and use the field redefinition technique whichfacilitates the analysis. A mass correction, which is implied by the work ofGiddings, Polchinski, and Strominger, is found for the extremal GHS black hole.
