We seek to clarify some of the physical aspects of the Ruijsenaars-Schneidermodels. This important class of models was presented as a relativisticgeneralisation of the Calogero-Moser models but, as we shall argue, thisdescription is misleading. It is far better to simply view the models as aone-parameter generalisation of Calogero-Moser models. By viewing the models asdescribing certain eigenvalue motions we can appreciate the generic nature ofthe models.
