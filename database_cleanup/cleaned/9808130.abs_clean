Title: Integrals of motion, supersymmetric quantum mechanics and dynamical

supersymmetryComments: 6 pages, LaTeX. Based on invited talk given at the International

Seminar "Supersymmetries and Quantum Symmetries" dedicated to the memory ofVictor I. Ogievetsky (Dubna, July 22-26, 1997); to be published inProceedingsSuperconductivityThe class of relativistic spin particle models reveals the `quantization' ofparameters already at the classical level. The special parameter values emergeif one requires the maximality of classical global continuous symmetries. Thesame requirement applied to a non-relativistic particle with odd degrees offreedom gives rise to supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Coupling classicalnon-relativistic superparticle to a `U(1) gauge field', one can arrive at thequantum dynamical supersymmetry. This consists in supersymmetry appearing atspecial values of the coupling constant characterizing interaction of a systemof boson and fermion but disappearing in a free case. Possible relevance ofthis phenomenon to high-temperature superconductivity is speculated.
