We argue that supersymmetric higher-dimension operators in the effectiveactions of M-theory and IIB string theory do not affect the maximally$adS_5\times S^5$ in IIB string theory. All these vacua are described insuperspace by a fixed point with all components of supertorsion andsupercurvature being supercovariantly constant. This follows from 32 unbrokensupersymmetries and allows us to prove that such vacua are exact.
