Unstable particles, together with their stable decay products, constituteprobability collectives which are defined as Hilbert spaces with dimensionhigher than one, nondecomposable in a particle basis. Their structure isconsidered in the framework of Birkhoff-von Neumann's Hilbert subspacelattices. Bases with particle states are related to bases with a diagonalscalar product by a Hilbert-bein involving the characteristic decay parameters(in some analogy to the $n$-bein structures of metrical manifolds). Probabilitypredictions as expectation values, involving unstable particles, have to takeinto account all members of the higher dimensional collective. E.g., theunitarity structure of the $S$-matrix for an unstable particle collective canbe established by a transformation with its Hilbert-bein.
