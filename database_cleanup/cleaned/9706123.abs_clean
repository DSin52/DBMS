The second alternative conformal limit of the recently proposed generalhigher derivative dilaton quantum theory in curved spacetime is explored. Inthis version of the theory the dilaton is transformed, along with the metric,to provide the conformal invariance of the classical action. We find thecorresponding quantum theory to be renormalizable at one loop, and therenormalization constants for the dimensionless parameters are explicitly shownto be universal for an arbitrary parametrization of the quantum field. Therenormalization group equations indicate an asymptotic freedom in the IR limit.In this respect the theory is similar to the well-known model based on theanomaly-induced effective action.
