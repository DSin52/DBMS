We consider the superparticle models invariant under the supersymmetries withtensorial central charges, which were not included in D=4Haag-Lopuszanski-Sohnius (HLS) supersymmetry scheme. We present firstly ageneralization of D=4 Ferber-Shirafuji (FS) model with fundamental bosonicspinors and tensorial central charge coordinates. The model contains fourfermionic coordinates and possesses three kappa- symmetries thus providing theBPS configuration preserving 3/4 of the target space supersymmetries. We showthat the physical degrees of freedom (8 real bosonic and 1 real Grassmannvariable) of our model can be described by OSp(8|1) supertwistor. Then wepropose a higher dimensional generalization of our model with one realfundamental bosonic spinor. D=10 model describes massless superparticle withcomposite tensorial central charges and in D=11 we obtain 0-superbrane modelwith nonvanishing mass which is generated dynamically. The introduction of D=11Lorentz harmonics provides the possibility to construct massless D=11superparticle model which can be formulated in a way preserving 1/2, 17/32,18/32,..., 31/32 supersymmetries. In a special case we obtain the twistor-likeformulation of the usual massless D=11 superparticle proposed recently byBergshoeff and Townsend.
