In this paper we study the N=1 supersymmetric field theories realized on theworld-volume of type IIB D3-branes sitting at orientifolds of non-orbifoldsingularities (conifold and generalizations). Several chiral models belong tothis family of theories. These field theories have a T-dual realization interms of type IIA configurations of relatively rotated NS fivebranes, D4-branesand orientifold six-planes, with a compact $x^6$ direction, along which theD4-branes have finite extent. We compute the spectrum on the D3-branes directlyin the type IIB picture and match the resulting field theories with thoseobtained in the type IIA setup, thus providing a non-trivial check of thisT-duality. Since the usual techniques to compute the spectrum of the model andcheck the cancellation of tadpoles, cannot be applied to the case orientifoldsof non-orbifold singularities, we use a different approach, and construct themodels by partially blowing-up orientifolds of C^3/(Z_2 x Z_2) and C^3/(Z_2 xZ_3) orbifolds.
