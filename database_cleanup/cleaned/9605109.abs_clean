Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton theory possesses sequences of neutral staticspherically symmetric black hole solutions. The solutions depend on the dilatoncoupling constant $\gamma$ and on the horizon. The SU(2) solutions are labelledby the number of nodes $n$ of the single gauge field function, whereas theSO(3) solutions are labelled by the nodes $(n_1,n_2)$ of both gauge fieldfunctions. The SO(3) solutions form sequences characterized by the nodestructure $(j,j+n)$, where $j$ is fixed. The sequences of magnetically neutralsolutions tend to magnetically charged limiting solutions. For finite $j$ theSO(3) sequences tend to magnetically charged Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilatonsolutions with $j$ nodes and charge $P=\sqrt{3}$. For $j=0$ and $j \rightarrow\infty$ the SO(3) sequences tend to Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton solutions withmagnetic charges $P=\sqrt{3}$ and $P=2$, respectively. The latter alsorepresent the scaled limiting solutions of the SU(2) sequence. The convergenceof the global properties of the black hole solutions, such as mass, dilatoncharge and Hawking temperature, is exponential. The degree of convergence ofthe matter and metric functions of the black hole solutions is related to therelative location of the horizon to the nodes of the corresponding regularsolutions.
