We study classical solutions (ic-instantons) in N=4 SYM in 4D which, in thestrong coupling limit, correspond to complex two-dimensional manifolds.Asymptotically in time the latter have boundaries represented by compact realthree-manifolds. Therefore they lend themselves to an interpretation in termsof 3-brane scattering. We suggest that these solutions may represent scatteringof D3-branes of type IIB theory in 10D. In particular we show that theworld-volume theory on complex two-dimensional manifolds is the correct one forD3-branes.
