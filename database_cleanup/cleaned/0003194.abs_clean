Supersymmetric ground state wave functions of a model of supersymmetricquantum mechanics on $S^1$ (supersymmetric simple pendulum) are studied.Supersymmetry can be broken due to the existence of an undetermined parameter,which is interpreted as a gauge field and appears as a firm consequence ofquantization on a space with a nontrivial topology such as $S^1$. The breakingdoes not depend on the leading term of the superpotential, contrary to theusual case. The mechanism of supersymmetry breaking is similar to that throughboundary conditions of fields in supersymmetric quantum field theory oncompactified space. The supersymmetric harmonic oscillator is realized in thelimit of the infinite radius of $S^1$ with the strength of the oscillator beingconstant.
