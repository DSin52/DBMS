We consider a bosonic string propagating in 4--dim Minkowski space. We showthat in the orthonormal gauge the classical system exhibits a hidden$W_{\infty}$ chiral symmetry, arising from the equivalence of its transversemodes with the $SU(2)/U(1)$ coset model defined on the string world--sheet.Generalizations to other string backgrounds are proposed. We also define aLiouville--like transformation that maps solutions of the $SU(2)/U(1)$ cosetmodel into the solution space of two decoupled Liouville theories. Invertingthis transformation, however, remains an open problem.
