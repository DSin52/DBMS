We introduce a class of higher-order derivative models in (2,1) space-timedimensions. The models are described by a vector field, and contain aProca-like mass term which prevents gauge invariance. We use the gaugeembedding procedure to generate another class of higher-order derivativemodels, gauge-invariant and dual to the former class. We show that the resultsare valid in arbitrary (d,1) space-time dimensions when one discards theChern-Simons and Chern-Simons-like terms. We also show that the gauge embeddingapproach works appropriately when the vector field couples with fermionicmatter.
