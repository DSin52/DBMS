O(delta/I_i), where i = perp or parallel, are calculatedWe evaluate the evolution operator Z_Reg(R_2,R_1) introduced by Diakonov andPetrov for the definition of the Wilson loop in terms of a path integral overgauge degrees of freedom. We use the procedure suggested by Diakonov and Petrov(Phys. Lett. B224 (1989) 131) and show that the evolution operator vanishes.
