We study the stochastic quantization of the system with first classconstraints in phase space. Though the Langevin equations of the canonicalvariables are defined without ordinary gauge fixing procedure, gauge fixingconditions are automatically selected and introduced by imposing stochasticconsistency conditions upon the first class constraints. Then the equilibriumsolution of the Fokker-Planck equation is identical with corresponding pathintegral distribution.
