We use path-\-integral methods to derive the ground state wave functions of anumber of two-\-dimensional fermion field theories and related systems inone-\-dimensional many body physics. We derive the exact wave function for theThirring/Luttinger and Coset fermion models and apply our results to derive theuniversal behavior of the wave functions of the Heisenberg antiferromagnets andof the Sutherland model. We find explicit forms for the wave functions in thedensity and in the Grassmann representations. We show that these wave functionsalways have the Jastrow factorized form and calculated the exponent. Ourresults agree with the exponents derived from the Bethe Ansatz for theSutherland model and the Haldane-\-Shastri spin chain but apply to all thesystems in the same universality class.
