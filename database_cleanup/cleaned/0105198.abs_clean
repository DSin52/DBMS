We calculate a one loop effective action of SU(2) QCD in the presence of themonopole background, and find a possible connection between the resulting QCDeffective action and a generalized Skyrme-Faddeev action of the non-linearsigma model. The result is obtained using the gauge-independent decomposotionof the gauge potential into the topological degrees which describes thenon-Abelian monopoles and the local dynamical degrees of the potential, andintegrating out all the dynamical degrees of QCD.
