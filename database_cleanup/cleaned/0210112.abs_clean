IOP Publishing House, Bristol, 2002We describe the supersymmetrization of two formulations of freenoncommutative planar particles -- in coordinate space with higher orderLagrangian [1] and in the framework of Faddeev and Jackiw [2,3], with firstorder action. In nonsupersymmetric case the first formulation after imposingsubsidiary condition eliminating internal degrees of freedom provides thesecond formulation. In supersymmetric case one can also introduce the splitinto ``external'' and ``internal'' degrees of freedom both describingsupersymmetric models.
