This paper presents a 6d world-volume action that describes the dynamics ofthe M theory five-brane in a flat 11d space-time background. The world-volumeaction has global 11d super-Poincare invariance, as well as 6d generalcoordinate invariance and kappa symmetry, which are realized as localsymmetries. The paper mostly considers a formulation in which generalcoordinate invariance is not manifest in one direction. However, it alsodescribes briefly an alternative formulation, due to Pasti, Sorokin, and Tonin,in which general coordinate invariance is manifest. The latter approachrequires auxiliary fields and new gauge invariances.
