We investigate the NBI matrix model with the potential$X\Lambda+X^{-1}+(2\eta+1)\log X$ recently proposed to describe IIBsuperstrings. With the proper normalization, using Virasoro constraints, weprove the equivalence of this model and the Kontsevich matrix model for$\eta\ne0$ and find the explicit transformation between the two models.
