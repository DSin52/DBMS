A higher dimensional analogue of the KP hierarchy is presented. Fundamentalconstituents of the theory are pseudo-differential operators with Moyalalgebraic coefficients. The new hierarchy can be interpreted as large-$N$ limitof multi-component ($\gl(N)$ symmetric) KP hierarchies. Actually, two differenthierarchies are constructed. The first hierarchy consists of commuting flowsand may be thought of as a straightforward extension of the ordinary andmulti-component KP hierarchies. The second one is a hierarchy of noncommutingflows, and related to Moyal algebraic deformations of selfdual gravity. Bothhierarchies turn out to possess quasi-classical limit, replacing Moyalalgebraic structures by Poisson algebraic structures. The language ofW-infinity algebras provides a unified point of view to these results.
