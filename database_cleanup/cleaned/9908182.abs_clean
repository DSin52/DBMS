their Bound StatesComments: 35 pages, Latex, added references, proper interpretation of dipole

moment solutions added, generalized harmonic function superposition rules forthe case of the solutions with non-zero external magnetic field addedJournal-ref: Nucl.Phys. B573 (2000) 223-256

We obtain various solutions for D=4 dipoles and their bound states whose U(1)fields originate from various form fields in the effective string theories. Weoxidize such dipole solutions to D=10 to obtain delocalized supergravitysolutions for the brane/anti-brane pairs and their bound states. We speculateon generalized harmonic superposition rules for supergravity solutions for(intersecting) brane/anti-brane pairs.
