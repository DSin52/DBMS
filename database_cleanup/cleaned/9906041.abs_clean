A supersymmetric action functional describing the interaction of thefundamental superstring with the D=10, type IIB Dirichlet super-9-brane ispresented. A set of supersymmetric equations for the coupled system is obtainedfrom the action principle. It is found that the interaction of the stringendpoints with the super-D9-brane gauge field requires some restrictions forthe image of the gauge field strength. When those restrictions are not imposed,the equations imply the absence of the endpoints, and the equations coincideeither with the ones of the free super-D9-brane or with the ones for the freeclosed type IIB superstring. Different phases of the coupled system aredescribed. A generalization to an arbitrary system of intersecting branes isdiscussed.
