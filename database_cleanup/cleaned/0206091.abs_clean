We describe a large class of exact string backgrounds with a null Killingvector arising, via a limiting \`a la Penrose procedure, from stringbackgrounds corresponding to coset conformal field theories for compact groupsG_N/H_N times a free time-like boson U(1)_{-N}. In this way a class of novellogarithmic conformal field theories (LCFT) emerges, that includes the oneconstructed recently as an N\to \infty limit of the SU(2)_N/U(1) X U(1)_{-N}theory. We explicitly give the exact operator algebra for the basic chiralfields as well as their representation in terms of free bosons, even thoughthese are not known in general at finite N. We also compute four-pointfunctions of various operators in the theory. For the cases of the four- andfive-dimensional models, corresponding to a limit of the theory SO(D+1)_N/SO(D)X U(1)_{-N} for D=3 and 4, we also present the explicit expressions for thebackground fields.
