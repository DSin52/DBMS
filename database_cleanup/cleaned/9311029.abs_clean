Title: Quantum Principal Bundles

Authors: Mico Durdevic

Comments: 10 pages, LaTex

A noncommutative-geometric generalization of the theory of principal bundlesis sketched. A differential calculus over corresponding quantum principalbundles is analysed. The formalism of connections is presented. In particular,operators of covariant derivative and horizontal projection are described andanalysed. Quantum counterparts for the Bianchi identity and the Weil'shomomorphism are found. Illustrative examples are considered.
