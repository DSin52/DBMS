After elimination of the redundant variables, gauge theories may stillexhibit symmetries associated with the gauge fields. The role of these residualgauge symmetries is discussed within the Abelian Higgs model and theGeorgi-Glashow model. In the different phases of these models, these symmetriesare realized differently. The characteristics of emergence and disappearance ofthe symmetries are studied in detail and the implications for the dynamics inCoulomb, Higgs, and confining phases are discussed.
