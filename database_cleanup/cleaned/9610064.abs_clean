We reformulate, using super worldline formalism, the pinched gluon vertexoperator proposed by Strassler. The pinched vertex operator turns out to be theproduct of two gluon vertex operators with the insertion of $\delta$-functionwhich makes the super distances between them zero. Thus the pinch proceduresturn out to be nothing but the insertions of $\delta$-function. Applying ourformulation to two-loop diagrams which are the QED correction to gluonscatterings via a single spinor loop, with the QED charge e being replaced bythe strong coupling g, we show various formulae on pinched N-pointfunctions.
