Magnetic monopoles having non-Abelian charges have been found recently toplay a crucial role in the infrared in a class of supersymmetric gaugetheories. We argue that these "dual quarks" can naturally be identified withthe non-Abelian magnetic monopoles of the type first discussed by Goddard,Nuyts and Olive. Our argument is based on a few simple observations as regardsto their charge structure, flavor quantum numbers, and some general propertiesof electromagnetic duality.
