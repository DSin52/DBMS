Techniques based upon the string organisation of amplitudes may be used tosimplify field theory calculations. We apply these techniques to perturbativegravity and calculate all one-loop amplitudes for four-graviton scattering witharbitrary internal particle content. Decomposing the amplitudes intocontributions arising from supersymmetric multiplets greatly simplifies thesecalculations. We also discuss how unitarity may be used to constrain theamplitudes.
