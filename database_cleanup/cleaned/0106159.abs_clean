We define a non-commutative product for arbitrary gauge and B-fieldbackgrounds in terms of correlation functions of open strings. While off-shellcorrelations are, of course, not conformally invariant, it turns out that, atleast to first derivative order, our product has the trace property and isassociative up to surface terms if the background fields are put on-shell. Noon-shell conditions for the inserted functions are needed, but it is essentialto include the full contribution of the Born-Infeld measure. We work with aderivative expansion and avoid any topological limit, which would effectivelyconstrain $H$.
