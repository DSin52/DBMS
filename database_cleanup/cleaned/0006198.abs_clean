Authors: Alfredo Iorio

Comments: 135 pages, 3 figures, PhD thesis

A reliable method to construct Supersymmetric Noether currents is presented.As the most important application the central charge of the N=2 SupersymmetricYang-Mills effective theory, known as Seiberg-Witten (SW) theory, is computed.The analisys is carried out in the SW low energy U(1) effective Sector, as wellas in the SW high energy SU(2) effective Sector.
