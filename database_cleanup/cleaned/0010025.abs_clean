One of the important consequences of the no-force condition for BPS states isthe existence of stable static multi-center solutions, at least in ungaugedsupergravities. This observation has been at the heart of many developments inbrane physics, including the construction of intersecting branes and reducedsymmetry D-brane configurations corresponding to the Coulomb branch of thegauge theory. However the search for multi-center solutions to gaugedsupergravities has proven rather elusive. Because of the background curvature,it appears such solutions cannot be static. Nevertheless even allowing for timedependence, general multi-center solutions to gauged supergravity have yet tobe constructed. In this letter we investigate the construction of suchsolutions for the case of D=5, N=2 gauged supergravity coupled to an arbitrarynumber of vector multiplets. Formally, we find a family of time dependentmulti-center black hole solutions which are easily generalized to the case ofAdS supergravities in general dimensions. While these are not true solutions,as they have a complex metric and gauge potential, they may be related to aWick rotated theory or to a theory where the coupling is taken to be imaginary.These solutions thus provide a partial realization of true multi-centerblack-holes in gauged supergravities.
