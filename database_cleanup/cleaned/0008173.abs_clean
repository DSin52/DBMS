We discuss compact four-dimensional Z_N x Z_M type IIB orientifolds. We takea systematic approach to classify the possible models and construct themexplicitely. The supersymmetric orientifolds of this type have already beenconstructed some time ago. We find that there exist several consistentorientifolds for each of the discrete groups Z_2 x Z_2, Z_2 x Z_4, Z_4 x Z_4,Z_2 x Z_6, Z_2 x Z_6' and Z_6 x Z_6 if anti-D5-branes are introduced.Supersymmetry is broken by the open strings ending on antibranes. The rank ofthe gauge group is reduced by a factor two if the underlying orbifold space hasdiscrete torsion.
