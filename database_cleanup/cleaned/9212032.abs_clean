A three dimensional string model is analyzed in the strong coupling regime.The contribution of surfaces with different topology to the partition functionis essential. A set of corresponding models is discovered. Their criticalindices, which depend on two integers (m,n), are calculated analyticaly. Thecritical indices of the three dimensioal Ising model should belong to this set.A possible connection with the chain of three dimensional lattice Pott's modelsis pointed out.
