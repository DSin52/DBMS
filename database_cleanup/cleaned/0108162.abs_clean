Title: Exact Brane Solutions in Curved Backgrounds

Comments: 12 pages, LaTeX, no figures. Talk at the Third International

Conference on Geometry, Integrability, and Quantization, June 14-23, 2001,Varna, Bulgaria. To be published in the proceedingsWe consider the classical null p-brane dynamics in D-dimensional curvedbackgrounds and apply the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky approach for BRSTquantization of general gauge theories. Then we develop a method for solvingthe tensionless $p$-brane equations of motion and constraints. This is possiblewhenever there exists at least one Killing vector for the background metric. Itis shown that the same method can be also applied for the tensile 1-branes.Finally, we give two examples of explicit exact solutions in four dimensions.
