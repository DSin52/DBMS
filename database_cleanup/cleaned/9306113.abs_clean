Title: The St\"uckelberg formalism is a field-enlarging transformation

Authors: J. Sladkowski

Comments: 16 pages, LaTeX-file

It is shown that the St\"uckelberg formalism can be regarded as afield-enlarging transformation that introduces an additional gauge symmetry tothe considered model. The appropriate BRST charge can be defined. The physicalstate condition, demanding that that a physical state is to be anihilated bythe BRST charge, is shown to be equivalent to the St\"uckelberg condition.Several applications of the new approach to the formalism are presented. Thecomparison with the BFV procedure is given. (The author field has beencorrected.)
