A seven parameter family of five-dimensional black hole solutions dependingon mass, two angular momenta, three charges and the asymptotic value of ascalar field is constructed. The entropy is computed as a function of theseparameters both from the Bekenstein-Hawking formula and from the degeneraciesof the corresponding D-brane states in string theory. The expressions agree atand to leading order away from extremality.
