Title: A New Approach to Superstring Field Theory

Comments: 9 pages latex, talk given at 32nd Ahrenshoop Symposium

Journal-ref: Fortsch.Phys. 48 (2000) 31-36

I review the construction of an action for open superstring field theorywhich does not suffer from the contact term problems of other approaches. Ialso discuss a possible generalization of this action for closed superstringfield theory.
