We discuss in detail how to consistently impose boundary conditions inquantum string cosmology. Since a classical time parameter is absent in quantumgravity, such conditions must be imposed with respect to intrinsic variables.Constructing wave packets for minisuperspace models from different tree-levelstring effective actions, we explain in particular the meaning of a transitionbetween ``pre-big-bang" and ``post-big-bang" branches. This leads to a scenariodifferent from previous considerations.
