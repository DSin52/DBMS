We show in a precise way, either in the fermionic or its bosonized version,that Bose symmetry provides a systematic way to carry out the chiraldecomposition of the two dimensional fermionic determinant. Interpretedproperly, we show that there is no obstruction of this decomposition to gaugeinvariance, as is usually claimed. Finally, a new way of interpreting thePolyakov-Wiegman identity is proposed.
