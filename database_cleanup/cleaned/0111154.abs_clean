We study condensation of closed string tachyons living on defects, such asorbifold fixed planes and Neveu-Schwarz fivebranes. We argue that the highenergy density of localized states decreases in the process of condensation ofsuch tachyons. In some cases this means that $c_{eff}$ decreases along theflow; in others, $c_{eff}$ remains constant and the decreasing quantity is aclosed string analog, $g_{cl}$, of the ``boundary entropy'' of D-branes. Wediscuss the non-supersymmetric orbifolds $C/Z_n$ and $C^2/Z_n$. In the firstcase tachyon condensation decreases $n$ and in some cases connects type II andtype 0 vacua. In the second case non-singular orbifolds are related by tachyoncondensation to both singular and non-singular ones. We verify that $g_{cl}$decreases in flows between non-singular orbifolds. The main tools in theanalysis are the structure of the chiral ring of the perturbed theory, thegeometry of the resolved orbifold singularities, and the throat description ofsingular conformal field theories.
