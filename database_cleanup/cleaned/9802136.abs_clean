The effective action for local composite operators in $QED_3$ is considered.The effective potential is calculated in leading order in $1/N_f$ ($N_f$ is thenumber of fermion flavors) and used to describe the features of the phasetransition at $N_f=N_{\rm cr}$, $3<N_{\rm cr}<5$. It is shown that thiscontinuous phase transition satisfies the criteria of the conformal phasetransition, considered recently in the literature. In particular, there is anabrupt change of the spectrum of light excitations at the critical point,although the phase transition is continuous, and the structure of the equationfor the divergence of the dilatation current is essentially different in thesymmetric and nonsymmetric phases. The connection of this dynamics with thedynamics in $QCD_4$ is briefly discussed.
