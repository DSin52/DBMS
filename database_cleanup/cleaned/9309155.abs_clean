Title: Axial Monopoles, Quantization of Electric Charge and Dynamical

Discreteness of Space-TimeAuthors: M.C. Nemes and Saulo C.S. Silva

Comments: 6 pages

In the present contribution we show that the introduction of axial currentsin electrodynamics can explain the quantization of electric charge andintroduces a dynamical discreteness of space-time, justifying thus theregularization of Feymman's integrals.
