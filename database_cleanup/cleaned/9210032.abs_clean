The notion of $q$-deformed lattice gauge theory is introduced. If thedeformation parameter is a root of unity, the weak coupling limit of a 3-$d$partition function gives a topological invariant for a corresponding3-manifold. It enables us to define the generalized Turaev-Viro invariant forcell complexes. It is shown that this invariant is determined by an action of afundamental group on a universal covering of a complex. A connection withinvariants of framed links in a manifold is also explored. A model giving agenerating function of all simplicial complexes weighted with the invariant isinvestigated.
