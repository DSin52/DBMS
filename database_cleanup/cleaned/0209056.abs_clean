Possible short and semi-short representations for $\N=2$ and $\N=4$superconformal symmetry in four dimensions are discussed. For $\N=4$ the wellknown short supermultiplets whose lowest dimension conformal primary operatorscorrespond to $\half$-BPS or ${1\over 4}$-BPS states and are scalar fieldsbelonging to the $SU(4)_r$ symmetry representations $[0,p,0]$ and $[q,p,q]$ andhaving scale dimension $\Delta =p$ and $\Delta = 2q+p$ respectively arerecovered. The representation content of semi-short multiplets, which arise atthe unitarity threshold for long multiplets, is discussed. It is shown how, atthe unitarity threshold, a long multiplet can be decomposed into foursemi-short multiplets. If the conformal primary state is spinless one of thesebecomes a short multiplet. For $\N=4$ a ${1\over 4}$-BPS multiplet need nothave a protected dimension unless the primary state belongs to a $[1,p,1]$representation.
