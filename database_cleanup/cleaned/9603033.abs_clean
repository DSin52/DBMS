We present an ansatz which enables us to construct heterotic/M-theory dualpairs in four dimensions. It is checked that this ansatz reproduces previousresults and that the massless spectra of the proposed dual pairs agree. The newdual pairs consist of M-theory compactifications on Joyce manifolds of $G_2$holonomy and Calabi-Yau compactifications of heterotic strings. These resultsare further evidence that M-theory is consistent on orbifolds. Finally, weinterpret these results in terms of M-theory geometries which are K3 fibrationsand heterotic geometries which are conjectured to be $T^3$ fibrations. Eventhough the new dual pairs are constructed as non-freely acting orbifolds ofexisting dual pairs, the adiabatic argument is apparently not violated.
