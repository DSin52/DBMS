We present the quantization of the Liouville model defined in light-conecoordinates in (1,1) signature space. We take advantage of the representationof the Liouville field by the free field of the Backl\"{u}nd transformation andadapt the approch by Braaten, Curtright and Thorn.Quantum operators of the Liouville field $\partial_{+}\phi$,$\partial_{-}\phi$, $e^{g\phi}$, $e^{2g\phi}$ are constructed consistently interms of the free field. The Liouville model field theory space is found to berestricted to the sector with field momentum $P_{+}=-P_{-}$, $P_{+}> 0$ , whichis a closed subspace for the Liouville theory operator algebra.
