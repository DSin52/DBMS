We consider quantized Yang-Mills theories in the framework of causalperturbation theory which goes back to Epstein and Glaser. In this approachgauge invariance is expressed by a simple commutator relation for the S-matrix.The most general coupling which is gauge invariant in first order contains atwo-parametric ambiguity in the ghost sector - a divergence- and acoboundary-coupling may be added. We prove (not completely) that the higherorders with these two additional couplings are gauge invariant, too. Moreoverwe show that the ambiguities of the n-point distributions restricted to thephysical subspace are only a sum of divergences (in the sense of vectoranalysis). It turns out that the theory without divergence- andcoboundary-coupling is the most simple one in a quite technical sense. Theproofs for the n-point distributions containing coboundary-couplings are givenup to third or fourth order only, whereas the statements about thedivergence-coupling are proven in all orders.
