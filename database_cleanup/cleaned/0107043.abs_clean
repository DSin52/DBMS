In this paper we review how to reconstruct scalar field theories in twodimensional spacetime starting from solvable Schrodinger equations. Threedifferent Schrodinger potentials are analyzed. We obtained two new modelsstarting from the Morse and Scarf II hyperbolic potentials, {\it i.e}, the$U(\phi)=\phi^2\ln^2(\phi^2)$ model and $U(\phi)=\phi^2\cos^2(\ln(\phi^2))$model respectively.
