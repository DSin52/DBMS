The spin-1/2 Aharonov-Bohm problem is examined in the Galilean limit for thecase in which a Coulomb potential is included. It is found that the applicationof the self-adjoint extension method to this system yields singular solutionsonly for one-half the full range of flux parameter which is allowed in thelimit of vanishing Coulomb potential. Thus one has a remarkable example of acase in which the condition of normalizability is necessary but not sufficientfor the occurrence of singular solutions. Expressions for the bound stateenergies are derived. Also the conditions for the occurrence of singularsolutions are obtained when the non-gauge potential is $\xi/r^p (0\leq p<2)$.
