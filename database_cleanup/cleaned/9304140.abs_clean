Title: Form Factors in Affine Toda Field Theories

Authors: A. Fring

Comments: 12.p, USP-IFQSC/TH/93-07

I briefly review the properties of classical affine Toda field theories andindicate how some of this features survive in the quantum theory on-shell. Idemonstrate how this knowledge can be extended off-shell, i.e. how to computecorrelation functions for completely integrable models via the form factorapproach. For the latter I present an axiomatic system and two explicitcomputation (the Sinh-Gordon theory and the Bullough-Dodd model) which providea consistent solution of it.
