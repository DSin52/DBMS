Title: Open String Plane-Wave Light-Cone Superstring Field Theory

Authors: B. Stefanski Jr

We construct the cubic interaction vertex and dynamically generatedsupercharges in light-cone superstring field theory for a large classhalf-supersymmetric D-branes in the plane-wave background. We show that thesesatisfy the plane-wave superalgebra at first order in string coupling. Thecubic interaction vertex and dynamical supercharges presented here are givenexplicitly in terms of oscilators and can be used to compute three-pointfunctions of open strings with endpoints on half-supersymmetric D-branes.
