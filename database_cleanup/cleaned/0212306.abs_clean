The bulk gauge fields on 5d AdS black hole are discussed. We construct thebulk (and the corresponding brane) gauge propagator when black hole has largeradius. The properties of gauge and ghost propagators are studied in both,minkowski or euclidean signature. In euclidean formulation the propagatorstructure corresponds to the one of theory at finite temperature (which dependson coordinates). The decoupling of KK modes and localization of gauge fields onflat brane is demonstrated. We show that with such a bulk there is no naturalsolution of hierarchy problem.
