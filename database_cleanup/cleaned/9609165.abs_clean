Comments: 7 pages, latex;Contribution to the proceedings of the Conference in

Imperial College, London, 5-10 July 1996 and the e--proceedings of theConference in Argonne, IL, 27 June - 12 July 1996Journal-ref: Gauge Theories, Applied Supersymmetry and Quantum Gravity II,

Imperial College Press, 1997, p.370-377String propagation on a curved background defines an embedding problem ofsurfaces in differential geometry. Using this, we show that in a wide class ofbackgrounds the classical dynamics of the physical degrees of freedom of thestring involves 2-dim sigma-models corresponding to coset conformal fieldtheories.
