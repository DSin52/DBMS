Form factor bootstrap approach is applied for diagonal scattering theories.We consider the ADE theories and determine the functional equations satisfiedby the minimal two-particle form factors. We also determine theparameterization of the singularities in two particle form factors. For$A^{(1)}_{2}$ Affine Toda field theory which is the simplest non-self conjugatetheory, form factors are derived up to four-body and identification of operatoris done. Generalizing this identification to the $A^{(1)}_N$ Affine Toda cases,we fix the two particle form factors. We also determine the additional polestructure of form factors which comes from the double pole of the $S$-matricesof the $A^{(1)}_N$ theory. For $A_N$ theories, existence of the conserved ${\bfZ}_{N+1}$ charge leads to the division of the set of form factors into $N+1$decoupled sectors.
