We present fermionic sum representations of the characters$\chi^{(p,p')}_{r,s}$ of the minimal $M(p,p')$ models for all relatively primeintegers $p'>p$ for some allowed values of $r$ and $s$. Our starting point isbinomial (q-binomial) identities derived from a truncation of the statecounting equations of the XXZ spin ${1\over 2}$ chain of anisotropy$-\Delta=-\cos(\pi{p\over p'})$. We use the Takahashi-Suzuki method to expressthe allowed values of $r$ (and $s$) in terms of the continued fractiondecomposition of $\{{p'\over p}\}$ (and ${p\over p'}$) where $\{x\}$ stands forthe fractional part of $x.$ These values are, in fact, the dimensions of thehermitian irreducible representations of $SU_{q_{-}}(2)$ (and $SU_{q_{+}}(2)$)with $q_{-}=\exp (i \pi \{{p'\over p}\})$ (and $q_{+}=\exp ( i \pi {p\overp'})).$ We also establish the duality relation $M(p,p')\leftrightarrowM(p'-p,p')$ and discuss the action of the Andrews-Bailey transformation in thespace of minimal models. Many new identities of the Rogers-Ramanujan type arepresented.
