Title: Charges, Monopoles and Gauge Invariance

Authors: R Horan, A Khvedelidze, M Lavelle and D McMullan

Comments: Talk presented at the Nato Advanced Research Workshop on

"Confinement, Topology, and Other Non-Perturbative Aspects of QCD," StaraLesna,Slovakia, January 21-27, 2002. 8 pages (Revision corrects typo in anauthor's name)A systematic approach to the description of gauge invariant charges ispresented and applied to the construction of both the static colour chargeconfiguration in QCD and the monopole solution in pure SU(2). The gaugeinvariant non-abelian monopole offers a new style of order parameter formonopole condensation.
