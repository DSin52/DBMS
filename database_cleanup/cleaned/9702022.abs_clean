Using the Schwinger-Keldysh technique we discuss how to derive the transportequations for the system of massless quantum fields. We analyse the scalarfield models with quartic and cubic interaction terms. In the $\phi^4$ modelthe massive quasiparticles appear due to the self-interaction of massless barefields. Therefore, the derivation of the transport equations strongly resemblesthat one of the massive fields, but the subset of diagrams which provide thequasiparticle mass has to be resummed. The kinetic equation for the finitewidth quasiparticles is found, where, except the mean-field and collisionterms, there are terms which are absent in the standard Boltzmann equation. Thestructure of these terms is discussed. In the massless $\phi^3$ model themassive quasiparticles do not emerge and presumably there is no transporttheory corresponding to this model. It is not surprising since the $\phi^3$model is anyhow ill defined.
