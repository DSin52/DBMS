We raise the issue whether gauge theories, that are not renormalizable in theusual power-counting sense, are nevertheless renormalizable in the modern sensethat all divergences can be cancelled by renormalization of the infinite numberof terms in the bare action. We find that a theory is renormalizable in thissense if the {\em a priori} constraints that we impose on the form of the bareaction correspond to the cohomology of the BRST transformations generated bythe action. Recent cohomology theorems of Barnich, Brandt, and Henneaux areused to show that conventionally nonrenormalizable theories of Yang-Millsfields (such as quantum chromodynamics with heavy quarks integrated out) and/orgravitation are renormalizable in the modern sense.
