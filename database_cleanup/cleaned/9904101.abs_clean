Exponential regularization of orthogonal and Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space ispresented based on noncommutative geometry. We show that an adequately adoptednoncommutative deformation of geometry makes the holography of higherdimensional quantum theory of gravity and low dimensional theory possible.Detail counting for observable degrees of freedom of quantum system of gravityin the bulk of noncommutative space SO_q(3) and the classical limit of itsboundary surface S^2 is discussed. Taking noncommutivity effect into account,we get the desired form of entropy for our world, which is consistent with thephysical phenomena associated with gravitational collapse. Conformallyinvariant symmetry is obtained for the equivalent theory of the qunatum gravityliving on the classical limit of boundary of the noncommutative AdS space. Thisis the basis of the AdS/CFT correspondence in string theory.
