We compute the finite temperature induced fermion number for fermions coupledto a static nonlinear sigma model background in (2+1) dimensions, in thederivative expansion limit. While the zero temperature induced fermion numberis well known to be topological (it is the winding number of the background),at finite temperature there is a temperature dependent correction that isnontopological -- this finite T correction is sensitive to the detailed shapeof the background. At low temperature we resum the derivative expansion to allorders, and we consider explicit forms of the background as a CP^1 instanton oras a baby skyrmion.
