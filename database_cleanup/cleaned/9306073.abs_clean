We construct a lattice model of compact (2+1)-dimensional Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory, starting from its formulation in terms of gauge invariantquantities proposed by Deser and Jackiw. We thereby identify the topologicalexcitations and their interactions. These consist of monopolo- antimonopolepairs bounded by strings carrying both magnetic flux and electric charge. Theelectric charge renders the Dirac strings observable and endows them with afinite energy per unit length, which results in a linearly confining stringtension. Additionally, the strings interact via an imaginary, topological termmeasuring the (self-) linking number of closed strings.
