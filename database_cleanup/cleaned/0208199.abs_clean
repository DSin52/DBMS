Title: Exact Wavefunction in a Noncommutative Dipole Field Theory

Authors: Wung-Hong Huang

Comments: Latex 8 pages, typos correction, discuss the formulation of the

quantum mechanics with noncommutative dipoleThe nonrelativistic case of noncommutative scalar dipole field theory withquartic interaction on a two-dimensional spacetime is analyzed. As there aretwo parameters in the general quartic interaction we try a way to find theirrelation. To do this we first investigate the formulation of the quantummechanics for a particle carrying the noncommutative dipole. We point out aproblem therein and propose a possible method to solve it. We use thisprescription to determined the quartic interaction term in the field theoryonce the noncommutative dipole is turned on. The two particle Schr\"odingerequation is then solved and the exact wavefunction of the bound state andassociated spectrum are found. It is seen that the wavefunction has threecenter positions in the relative coordinates and the separation of the centeris equal to the dipole length $L$ of the dipole field, exhibiting the nature ofthe noncommutative dipole field.
