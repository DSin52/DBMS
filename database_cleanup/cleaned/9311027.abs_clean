An algebraic approach to integrable quantum field theory with a boundary (ahalf line) is presented and interesting algebraic equations, Reflectionequations (RE) and Reflection Bootstrap equations (RBE) are discussed. TheReflection equations are a consistent generalisation of Yang-Baxter equationsfor factorisable scatterings on a half line (or with a reflecting boundary).They determine the so-called reflection matrices. However, for Toda fieldtheory and/or other theories with diagonal S-matrices, the Reflection-Bootstrapequations proposed by Fring and K\"oberle determine the reflection matrices,since the reflection equations and the Yang-Baxter equations become trivial inthese cases. The explicit forms of the reflection matrices together with theirsymmetry properties are given for various Toda field theories, simply laced andnon-simply laced.
