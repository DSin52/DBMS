The equations of motion of anomaly-free supergravity are shown to fulfil (toall orders in $\alpha'$) a differential condition corresponding to the onerelating the Weyl anomaly coefficients for a non-linear sigma modelrepresenting a (heterotic) string propagating in a non-trivial background. Thissupports the possibility that anomaly-free supergravity could provide thecomplete massless effective theory for the heterotic string.
