We describe a classical configuration of conformal matter forming a nakedsingularity and discuss its subsequent Hawking evaporation within the contextof two dimensional dilaton gravity. The one loop analysis is credible for alarge mass naked singularity and suggests the existence of a weak cosmologicalcensorship that would cause it to explode into radiation upon forming.(Hardcopies of figures available on request)
