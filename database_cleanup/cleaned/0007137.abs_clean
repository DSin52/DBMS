We develop the noncommutative harmonic space (NHS) analysis to study theproblem of solving the non-linear constraint eqs of noncommutative Yang-Millsself-duality in four-dimensions. We show that this space, denoted also asNHS($\eta,\theta$), has two SU(2) isovector deformations $\eta^{(ij)}$ and$\theta^{(ij)}$ parametrising respectively two noncommutative harmonicsubspaces NHS($\eta,0$) and NHS($0,\theta$) used to study the self-dual andanti self-dual noncommutative Yang-Mills solutions. We formulate the Yang-Millsself-dual constraint eqs on NHS($\eta,0$) by extending the idea of harmonicanalyticity to linearize them. Then we give a perturbative self-dual solutionrecovering the ordinary one. Finally we present the explicit computation of anexact self-dual solution.
