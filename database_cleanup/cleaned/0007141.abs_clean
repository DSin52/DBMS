We construct the boundary state for the D-brane in the SU(2) group manifolddirectly in terms of the group variables. We propose a matching condition forthe left- and the right-moving sectors including the zero modes that describesa D-brane of the Neumann-type. The free field realization of the WZW model isused to obtain the boundary state subject to the matching condition. We showthat the resulting state coincides with Cardy's state. The structure of theBRST cohomology is realized by imposing the invariance of the state under theWeyl group of the current algebra.
