In non-diagonal conformal models, the boundary fields are not directlyrelated to the bulk spectrum. We illustrate some of their features bycompleting previous work of Lewellen on sewing constraints for conformaltheories in the presence of boundaries. As a result, we include additional opensectors in the descendants of $D_{odd}$ $SU(2)$ WZW models. A new phenomenonemerges, the appearance of multiplicities and fixed-point ambiguities in theboundary algebra not inherited from the closed sector. We conclude by derivinga set of polynomial equations, similar to those satisfied by the fusion-rulecoefficients $N_{ij}^k$, for a new tensor $A_{a b}^i$ that determines the openspectrum.
