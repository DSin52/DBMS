The possibility of neutral, brane-like solutions in a higher dimensionalsetting is discussed. In particular, we describe a supersymmetric solution insix dimensions which can be interpreted as a "three-brane" with a non-compacttransverse space of finite volume. The construction can be generalized ton+4-dimensions and the result is a n+3-brane compactified on a n-1-dimensionalEinstein manifold with a non-compact extra dimension. We find that there alwaysexists a massless graviton trapped in four-dimensions while a bulk abeliangauge field gives rise to a unique four-dimensional massless photon. Moreover,all massless modes are accompanied by massive KK states and we show that it ispossible in such a scenario the masses of the KK states to be at the TeV scalewithout hierarchically large extra dimensions.
