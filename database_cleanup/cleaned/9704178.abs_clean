We study U-duality symmetries of toroidally compactified M theory from themembrane worldvolume point of view. This is done taking the most general set ofbosonic background fields into account. Upon restriction to pure modulibackgrounds, we are able to find the correct U-duality groups and moduli cosetparameterizations for dimensions D>6 as symmetries of the membrane worldvolumetheory. In particular, we derive the D=8 U-duality group SL(2)xSL(3). Forgeneral background fields, we concentrate on the case D=8. Though the SL(2)part of the symmetry appears to be obstructed by certain terms in the equationsof motion, we are able to read off the transformation properties for thebackground fields. These transformations are verified by comparison with11-dimensional supergravity dimensionally reduced to D=8.
