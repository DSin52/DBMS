We construct D0-branes in SO(32)$\times$SO(32) open type 0 string theoryusing the same method as the one used to construct non-BPS D0-brane in type Istring theory. It has been proposed that this theory is S-dual to bosonicstring theory compactified on SO(32) lattice, which has SO(32)$\times$SO(32)spinor states as excited states of fundamental string. One of these statesseems to correspond to the D0-brane, and by the requirement that other stateswhich do not have corresponding states must be removed, we can determine theway of truncation of the spectrum. This result supports the conjecture.
