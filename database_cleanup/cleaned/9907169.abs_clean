We derive the superconformal transformation properties of the supercurrentfor N=1 supersymmetric QED in four dimensions within the superfield formalism.Superconformal Ward identities for Green functions involving insertions of thesupercurrent are conveniently derived by coupling the supercurrent to theappropriate prepotential of a classical curved superspace background, and bycombining superdiffeomorphisms and super Weyl transformations. We determine allsuperconformal anomalies of SQED on curved superspace within an all-orderperturbative approach and derive a local Callan-Symanzik equation. Particularimportance is given to the issue of gauge invariance.
