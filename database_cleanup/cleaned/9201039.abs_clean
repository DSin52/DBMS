We show that Witten's two-dimensional string black hole metric is exactlyconformally invariant in the supersymmetric case. We also demonstrate that thismetric, together with a recently proposed exact metric for the bosonic case,are respectively consistent with the supersymmetric and bosonic $\sigma$-modelconformal invariance conditions up to four-loop order.
