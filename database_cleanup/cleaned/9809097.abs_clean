The classification of rational conformal field theories is reconsidered fromthe standpoint of boundary conditions. Solving Cardy's equation expressing theconsistency condition on a cylinder is equivalent to finding integer valuedrepresentations of the fusion algebra. A complete solution not only yields theadmissible boundary conditions but also gives valuable information on the bulkproperties.
