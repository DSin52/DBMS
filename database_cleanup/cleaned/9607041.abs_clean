An orientifold of Type-IIB theory on a $K3$ realized as a $Z_2$ orbifold isconstructed which corresponds to F-theory compactification on a Calabi-Yauorbifold with Hodge numbers $(51, 3)$. The T-dual of this model is analogous toan orbifold with discrete torsion in that the action of orientation reversalhas an additional phase on the twisted sectors, and both 9-branes and 5-branescarry orthogonal gauge groups. An orientifold of the $Z_3$ orbifold and itsrelation to F-theory is briefly discussed.
