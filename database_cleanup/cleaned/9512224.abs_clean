The loop variable approach used earlier to obtain free equations of motionfor the massive modes of the open string, is generalized to include interactionterms. These terms, which are polynomial, involve only modes of strictly lowermass. Considerations based on operator product expansions suggest that theseequations are particular truncations of the full string equations. The methodinvolves broadening the loop to a band of finite thickness that describes allthe different interacting strings. Interestingly, in terms of these variables,the theory appears non-interacting.
