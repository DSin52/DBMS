The conformal symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian for massless quarks is brokenboth by renormalization effects and the gauge fixing procedure. Renormalizedprimitive divergent amplitudes have the property that their form away from theoverall coincident point singularity is fully determined by the bareLagrangian, and scale dependence is restricted to $\delta$-functions at thesingularity. If gauge fixing could be ignored, one would expect theseamplitudes to be conformal invariant for non-coincident points. We find thatthe one-loop three-gluon vertex function $\Gamma_{\mu\nu\rho}(x,y,z)$ isconformal invariant in this sense, if calculated in the background fieldformalism using the Feynman gauge for internal gluons. It is not yet clear whythe expected breaking due to gauge fixing is absent. The conformal propertyimplies that the gluon, ghost and quark loop contributions to$\Gamma_{\mu\nu\rho}$ are each purely numerical combinations of two universalconformal tensors $D_{\mu\nu\rho}(x,y,z)$ and $C_{\mu\nu\rho}(x,y,z)$ whoseexplicit form is given in the text. Only $D_{\mu\nu\rho}$ has an ultravioletdivergence, although $C_{\mu\nu\rho}$ requires a careful definition to resolvethe expected ambiguity of a formally linearly divergent quantity.Regularization is straightforward and leads to a renormalized vertex functionwhich satisfies the required Ward identity, and from which the beta-function iseasily obtained. Exact conformal invariance is broken in higher-loop orders,but we outline a speculative scenario in which the perturbative structure ofthe vertex function is determined from a conformal invariant primitive core byinterplay of the renormalization group equation and Ward identities.
