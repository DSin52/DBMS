In this paper, we construct gauge bundles on a noncommutative toroidalorbifold $T^4_\theta/Z_2$. First, we explicitly construct a bundle withconstant curvature connections on a noncommutative $T^4_\theta$ followingRieffel's method. Then, applying the appropriate quotient conditions for its$Z_2$ orbifold, we find a Connes-Douglas-Schwarz type solution of matrix theorycompactified on $T^4_\theta/Z_2$. When we consider two copies of a bundle on$T^4_\theta$ invariant under the $Z_2$ action, the resulting Higgs branchmoduli space of equivariant constant curvature connections becomes an ordinarytoroidal orbifold $T^4/Z_2$.
