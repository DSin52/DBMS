The concept of perturbative gauge invariance formulated exclusively by meansof asymptotic fields is used to construct massive gauge theories. We considerthe interactions of $r$ massive and $s$ massless gauge fields together with$(r+s)$ fermionic ghost and anti-ghost fields. First order gauge invariancerequires the introduction of unphysical scalars (Goldstone bosons) and fixestheir trilinear couplings. At second order additional physical scalars (Higgsfields) are necessary, their coupling is further restricted at third order. Incase of one physical scalar all couplings are determined by gauge invariance,including the Higgs potential. For three massive and one massless gauge fieldthe $SU(2)\times U(1)$ electroweak theory comes out as the unique solution.
