We discuss aspects of the algebraic geometry of compact non-commutativeCalabi-Yau manifolds. In this setting, it is appropriate to consider localholomorphic algebras which can be glued together into a compact Calabi-Yauorbifold of the quintic in CP_4, each with discrete torsion. Thenon-commutative geometry tools are enough to describe various properties of theorbifolds. First, one describes correctly the fractionation of branes atsingularities. Secondly, for the first example we show that one can recoverexplicitly a large slice of the moduli space of complex structures which deformthe orbifold. For this example we also show that we get the correct counting ofcomplex structure deformations at the orbifold point by using traces ofnon-commutative differential forms (cyclic homology).
