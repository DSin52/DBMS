Dynamical systems, described by Lagrangians with first- and second-classconstraints, are investigated. In the Dirac approach to the generalizedHamiltonian formalism, the classification and separation of the first- andsecond-class constraints are presented with the help of passing to anequivalent canonical set of constraints. The general structure of second-classconstraints is clarified. The method of constructing the generator of symmetrytransformations in the second Noether theorem is given. It is proved thatsecond-class constraints do not contribute to the transformation law of thelocal symmetry which entirely is entirely stipulated by all the first-classconstraints.
