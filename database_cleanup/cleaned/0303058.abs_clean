Title: Interaction Between Kink and Radiation in $\phi^4$ Model

Authors: Tomasz Romanczukiewicz

Comments: 20 pages, 14 figures

Formation and SolitonsThe radiation from oscillating kink in (1+1) dimensional relativistic$\phi^4$ model is considered. Both analytical and numerical approaches arepresented and the comparison between these methods is discussed. Accelerationof the kink in external radiation is calculated and numerical results are alsopresented.
