Title: Hamiltonian Constraints and Dirac's Observables

Particles towards Field Theory and General Relativity.Comments: Plain TEX, 15 pages, Talk given at the Workshop "Geometry of

Constrained Dynamical Systems", June 15-18, 1994, Cambridge, UK.A review is given of the presymplectic approach to relativistic physicalsystems and of the determination of their Dirac's observables. Afterrelativistic mechanics and Nambu string, the Dirac's observables of Yang-Millstheory with fermions are given for the case of massless vector bosons (like inQED). A Dirac-Yukawa-like intrinsic ultraviolet cut-off is identified from thestudy of the covariantization of Hamiltonian classical field theory in theDirac-Tomonaga-Schwinger sens. The implications fo the solution of theconstraints of tetrad gravity are shown.
