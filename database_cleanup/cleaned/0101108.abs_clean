In this talk the gauge symmetry for Wilsonian flows in pure Yang-Millstheories is discussed. The background field formalism is used for theconstruction of a gauge invariant effective action. The symmetries of theeffective action under gauge transformations for both the gauge field and theauxiliary background field are separately evaluated. Modified Ward-Takahashiand background field identities are used in my study. Finally it is shown howthe symmetry properties of the full theory are restored in the limit where thecut-off is removed.
