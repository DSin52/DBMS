Title: Wavefunctions for Non-Abelian Vortices

Authors: Kai-Ming Lee and Hoi-Kwong Lo

Comments: Reference added

We construct exact wavefunctions of two vortices on a plane, a single vortexon the cylinder and a vortex on the torus. In each case, the physics is shownto be equivalent to a particle moving in a covering space, something simple tosolve in those examples. We describe how our solutions fit into the generaltheory of quantum mechanics of $N$ particles on a two-dimensional space andattribute our success to the fact that the fundamental groups are Abelian inthose simple cases that we are considering.
