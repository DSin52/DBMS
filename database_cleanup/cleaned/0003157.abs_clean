Title: Supersymmetric black hole solutions with $R^2$-interactions

Authors: G. L. Cardoso, B. de Wit, J. K\"appeli and T. Mohaupt

Comments: Latex, 6 pages, JHEP, Proceedings of TMR workshop "Quantum aspects of

gauge theories, supersymmetry and unification"We present a class of static supersymmetric multi-center black hole solutionsarising in four-dimensional N=2 supergravity theories with terms quadratic inthe Weyl tensor. We also comment on possible corrections to the metric on themoduli space of these black holes solutions.
