We construct the $N=2$ super $W_4$ algebra as a certain reduction of thesecond Gel'fand-Dikii bracket on the dual of the Lie superalgebra of $N=1$super pseudo-differential operators. The algebra is put in manifestly $N=2$supersymmetric form in terms of three $N=2$ superfields $\Phi_i(X)$, with$\Phi_1$ being the $N=2$ energy momentum tensor and $\Phi_2$ and $\Phi_3$ beingconformal spin $2$ and $3$ superfields respectively. A search for integrablehierarchies of the generalized KdV variety with this algebra as Hamiltonianstructure gives three solutions, exactly the same number as for the $W_2$(super KdV) and $W_3$ (super Boussinesq) cases.
