Recently obtained results for two and three point functions for quasi-primaryoperators in conformally invariant theories in arbitrary dimensions {\absit d}are described. As a consequence the three point function for the energymomentum tensor has three linearly independent forms for general {\absit d}compatible with conformal invariance. The corresponding coefficients may beregarded as possible generalisations of the Virasoro central charge to {\absitd} larger than 2. Ward identities which link two linear combinations of thecoefficients to terms appearing in the energy momentum tensor trace anomaly oncurved space are discussed. The requirement of positivity for expectationvalues of the energy density is also shown to lead to positivity conditionswhich are simple for a particular choice of the three coefficients.Renormalisation group like equations which express the constraints of brokenconformal invariance for quantum field theories away from critical points arepostulated and applied to two point functions.\hfill\break Talk presented atthe XXVII Ahrenshoop International Symposium.
