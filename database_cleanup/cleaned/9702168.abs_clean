We present subleading corrections to the N=2 supersymmetric black holeentropy. These subleading contributions correspond to instanton corrections ofthe Type II string theory. In particular we consider an axion free black holesolution of low-energy effective Type II string theory. We present a procedureto include successively all instanton corrections. Expanding these correctionsat particular points in moduli space yields polynomial and logarithmicinstanton corrections to the classical black hole entropy. We comment on amicroscopic interpretation of these instanton corrections and find that thelogarithmic corrections correspond to subleading terms in the degeneracy of thespectrum of an underlying quantum theory.
