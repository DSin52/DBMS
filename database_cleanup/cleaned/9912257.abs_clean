We discuss gauge theories on D3 branes embedded in special non-tachyonicorientifolds of the 0B string theory. In general, they correspond tonon-supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theories with scalars in the adjointrepresentation and spinors in the (anti-)symmetric representation. We studythese theories via the AdS/CFT correspondence and present evidence of theirrelation to N=4 SYM in the planar limit. We also discuss finite N properties,focusing in particular on the renormalization group flow. Up to two loops, thelogarithmic running of the gauge coupling is described by the dilaton tadpoleand the cosmological constant that naturally emerge on the string theory side.
