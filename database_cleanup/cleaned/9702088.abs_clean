We show how the spectral flow between the Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sectors ofN=2 superconformal field theories can be described in three dimensions in termsof the propagation of charged particles coupled to a a Chern-Simons gaugetheory. Quantum mechanical mixing between the degenerate Chern-Simons vacuainterpolates between the different boundary conditions of the two sectors andso provides a dynamical picture for the GSO-projection.
