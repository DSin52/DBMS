We study $T^2$ compactification of massive type IIA supergravity in presenceof possible Ramond-Ramond (RR) background fluxes. The resulting theory in D=8is shown to possess full $SL(2,R)\times SL(2,R)$ T-duality symmetry similar tothe massless case. It is shown that elements of duality symmetry interpolatebetween massive type IIA compactified on $T^2$ and ordinary type IIAcompactified on $T^2$ with RR 2-form flux. We also discuss relationship betweenM-theory vacua and massive type IIA vacua. The D8-brane is found to correspondto M-theory `pure gravity' solution which is a direct product of 7-dimensionalMinkowski space and a 4-dimensional instanton. We also construct D6-D8 boundstate which preserves 1/2 supersymmetries. We then discuss massive IIAcompactification on $T^4$ and point out that when all possible RR fluxes on$T^4$ are turned on the six-dimensional theory appears to assume a nice SO(4,4)invariant form.
