Title: A canonical approach to S-duality in Abelian gauge theory

Authors: A.A. Kehagias

Comments: latex, 10 pages

We examine the electric-magnetic duality for a U(1) gauge theory on a general4-manifold. The partition function for such a theory transforms as a modularform of specific weight. However, in the canonical approach, we show thatS-duality, like T-duality, is generated by a canonical transformation leadingto a modular invariant partition function.
