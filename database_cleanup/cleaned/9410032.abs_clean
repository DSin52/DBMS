We consider the non-local energy-momentum tensor of quantum scalar and spinorfields in $2 w$-dimensional curved spaces. Working to lowest order in thecurvature we show that, while the non-local terms proportional to $\Box {\calR}$, $\Box \Box{\cal R}$, $\ldots, \Box^{w-2} {\cal R}$ are fully determined bythe early-time behaviour of the heat kernel, the terms proportional to ${\calR}$ depend on the asymptotic late-time behaviour. This fact explains adiscrepancy between the running of the Newton constant dictated by the RGequations and the quantum corrections to the Newtonian potential.
