We show that the fully covariant equations of motion for the M-theoryfivebrane can be interpreted as charge conservation equations. The associatedcharges induce `shift'-symmetries of the scalar, spinor and gauge-fields of thefivebrane, so allowing an interpretation of all these fields as Goldstonefields. We also find that the fivebrane possesses a new symmetry that is partof the GL(32) automorphism group of the eleven dimensional supersymmetryalgebra.
