Gauge theories of conformal spacetime symmetries are presented which mergefeatures of Yang-Mills theory and general relativity in a new way. The modelsare local but nonpolynomial in the gauge fields, with a nonpolynomial structurethat can be elegantly written in terms of a metric (or vielbein) composed ofthe gauge fields. General relativity itself emerges from the construction as agauge theory of spacetime translations. The role of the models within a generalclassification of consistent interactions of gauge fields is discussed as well.
