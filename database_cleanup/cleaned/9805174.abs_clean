In the given work we study an interaction of second massive state of an openboson string with the constant electromagnetic field. This state containsmassive fields with spins 3 and 1. Using the method of an open string BRSTquantization, we receive gauge-invariant lagrangian, describing theelectromagnetic interaction of these fields. From the explicit view oftransformations and lagrangian it follows that the presence of externalconstant e/m field leads to the mixing of the given level states. Most likelythat the presence of the external field will lead to the mixing of the statesat other mass string levels as well.
