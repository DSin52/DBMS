We suggest a method of bosonizing any D=2 theory. We demonstrate how it workswith the examples of the Thirring and the Schwinger models, known results arereproduced. This method, being applied to the Gross-Neveu model, yieldsnonlinear boson WZW-type theory with additional constraint in the field space.Relation to the nonlinear sigma - model is also discussed.
