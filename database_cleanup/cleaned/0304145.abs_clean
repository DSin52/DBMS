We show that the scattering amplitude of four open string scalars or tachyonson the world-volume of a D$_p$-brane in the bosonic string theory can bewritten in a universal form. The difference between this amplitude and thecorresponding amplitude in the superstring theory is in an extra tachyonicpole. We show that in an $\alpha'$ expansion and for slowly varying fields, theamplitude is consistent with the tachyonic DBI action in which the tachyonpotential is $V(T)=e^{-(\sqrt{\pi} T/\alpha)^2}$ with $\alpha=1$ for bosonictheory and $\alpha=\sqrt{2}$ for superstring theory.
