NSF, Arlington, VA, July 2001We formulate a theory of quantum processes, extend it to a generic quantumcosmology, formulate a reversible quantum logic for the Quantum Universe AsComputer, or Qunivac. Qunivac has an orthogonal group of cosmic dimensionality.It has a Clifford algebra of ``cosmonions,'' extending the quaternions to acosmological number of anticommuting units. Its qubits obey Clifford-Wilczekstatistics and are associated with unit cosmonions. This makes it relativelyeasy to program the Dirac equation on Qunivac in a Lorentz-invariant way.Qunivac accommodates a field theory and a gauge theory. Its gauge group isnecessarily a quantum group.
