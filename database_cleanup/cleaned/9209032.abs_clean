We calculate exactly the rate of pair production of open bosonic andsupersymmetric strings in a constant electric field. The rate agrees withSchwinger's classic result in the weak-field limit, but diverges when theelectric field approaches some critical value of the order of the stringtension. (Phyzzx file)
