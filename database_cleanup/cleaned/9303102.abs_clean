The spherical symmetric dyonic black hole solutions of the effective actionof heterotic string are studied perturbatively up to second order in theinverse string tension. An expression for the temperature in term of the massand the electric and magnetic charge of the black hole is derived and it isshown that its behaviour is qualitatively different in the two special caseswhere either the electric or the magnetic charge vanishes
