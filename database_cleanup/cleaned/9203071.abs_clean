We study moduli dependent threshold corrections to gravitational couplings inthe case of the heterotic string compactified on a symmetric orbifold, foruntwisted moduli, extending previous analysis on gauge couplings. Like in thegauge case, the contribution comes entirely from the spacetime $N=2$ sector. Asa byproduct, this calculation provides a simple derivation of the trace anomalycoefficients for the different fields coupled to gravity.
