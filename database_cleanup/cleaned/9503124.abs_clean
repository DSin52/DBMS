The strong coupling dynamics of string theories in dimension $d\geq 4$ arestudied. It is argued, among other things, that eleven-dimensional supergravityarises as a low energy limit of the ten-dimensional Type IIA superstring, andthat a recently conjectured duality between the heterotic string and Type IIAsuperstrings controls the strong coupling dynamics of the heterotic string infive, six, and seven dimensions and implies $S$ duality for both heterotic andType II strings.
