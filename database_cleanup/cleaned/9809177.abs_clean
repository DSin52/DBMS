In this paper, we give a simple diagrammatic identification of the uniquecombination of the causal n-point vertex functions in the real time formalismthat would coincide with the corresponding functions obtained in the imaginarytime formalism. Furthermore, we give a simple calculational method forevaluating the temperature dependent parts of the retarded vertex functions, toone loop, by identifying them with the forward scattering amplitudes ofon-shell thermal particles. As an application of the method, we calculate andshow that the temperature dependent parts of all the retarded functions vanishat one loop order for 1+1 dimensional massless QED. We further point out that,in this model, in fact, the temperature dependent parts of all the retardedvertex functions vanish to all orders in perturbation theory.
