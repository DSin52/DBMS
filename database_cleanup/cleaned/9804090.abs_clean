Title: Comment on ''Understanding the Area Proposal for Extremal Black Hole

Entropy''Comments: 5 pages, ReVTeX, no figures. Expanded from the journal version to

A. Ghosh and P. Mitra made the proposal how to explain the area law for theentropy of extreme black holes in some model calculations. I argue that theirapproach implicitly operates with strongly singular geometries and says nothingabout the contribution of regular metrics of extreme black holes into thepartition function.
