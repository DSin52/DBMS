We study one-loop, moduli-dependent corrections to gauge and gravitationalcouplings in supersymmetric vacua of the heterotic string. By exploiting theirrelation to the integrability condition for the associated CP-odd couplings, wederive general expressions for them, both for $(2,2)$ and $(2,0)$ models, interms of tree level four-point functions in the internal $N=2$ superconformaltheory. The $(2,2)$ case, in particular symmetric orbifolds, is discussed indetail.
