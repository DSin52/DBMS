We study the parity breaking effective action in 2+1 dimensions, generated,at finite temperature, by massive fermions interacting with a non-Abelian gaugebackground. We explicitly calculate, in the static limit, parity violatingamplitudes up to the seven point function, which allows us to determine thecorresponding effective actions. We derive the exact parity violating effectiveaction when $\vec{E}=0$. When $\vec{E}\neq 0$, there are families of terms thatcan be determined order by order in perturbation theory. We attempt togeneralize our results to non-static backgrounds through the use of timeordered exponentials and prove gauge invariance, both {\it small} and {\itlarge}, of the resulting effective action. We also point out some openquestions that need to be further understood.
