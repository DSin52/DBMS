Title: On Diff(S^1) Covariantization Of Pseudodifferential Operator

Comments: 20 pages

A study of diff($S^1$) covariant properties of pseudodifferential operator ofinteger degree is presented. First, it is shown that the action of diff($S^1$)defines a hamiltonian flow defined by the second Gelfand-Dickey bracket if andonly if the pseudodifferential operator transforms covariantly. Secondly, thecovariant form of a pseudodifferential operator of degree n not equal to 0, 1,particular, implies the existence of primary basis for W_{KP}^{(n)} (n notequal to 0, 1, -1).
