The string equation for the $[{\tilde P},Q]=Q$ formulation ofnon--perturbatively stable 2D quantum gravity coupled to the $(2m-1,2)$ modelsis studied. Global KdV flows between the appropriate solutions are consideredas deformations of two compatible linear problems. It is demonstrated that thenecessary conditions for such flows to exist are satisfied. A numerical studyreveals such flows between the pole--free solutions of pure gravity ($m=2$),the Lee--Yang edge model ($m=3$) and topological gravity ($m=1$). We conjecturethat this is the case for all of the $m$--critical models. As the $m=1$solution is unique these global flows define a {\sl unique} solution for each$m$--critical model.
