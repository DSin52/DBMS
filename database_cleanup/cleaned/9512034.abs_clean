Title: Superstring Extension of the Standard Model and Gravitation

Comments: plain LATEX, no figures, 22 pages

Some of the four-dimensional Superstring solutions provide a consistentframework for a Supersymmetric Unification of all interactions includinggravity. A class of them extends successfully the validity of the standardmodel up to the string scale ${\cal O}(10^{17})~GeV$. We stress the importanceof string corrections which are relevant for low energy ${\cal O}(1)~TeV$predictions of gauge and Yukawa couplings as well as the spectrum of thesupersymmetric particles after supersymmetry breaking.
