To obtain some exact results of U(1) gauge theory (QED), we construct the lowenergy effective action of N=2 supersymmetric QED with a massless matter andFayet-Iliopoulos term, assuming no confinement. The harmonic superspaceformalism for N=2 extended supersymmetry makes the construction easy. Weanalyze the vacuum structure and find no vacuum. It suggests the confinement innon-supersymmetric QED at low energies.
