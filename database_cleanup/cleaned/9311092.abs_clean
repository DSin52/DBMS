We present a solution of the problem of a free massless scalar field on thehalf line interacting through a periodic potential on the boundary. For acritical value of the period, this system is a conformal field theory with anon-trivial and explicitly calculable S-matrix for scattering from theboundary. Unlike all other exactly solvable conformal field theories, it isnon-rational ({\it i.e.} has infinitely many primary fields). It describes thecritical behavior of a number of condensed matter systems, includingdissipative quantum mechanics and of barriers in ``quantum wires''.
