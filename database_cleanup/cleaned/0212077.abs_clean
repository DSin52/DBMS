Motivated by application of current superalgebras in the study of disorderedsystems such as the random XY and Dirac models, we investigate $gl(2|2)$current superalgebra at general level $k$. We construct its free fieldrepresentation and corresponding Sugawara energy-momentum tensor in thenon-standard basis. Three screen currents of the first kind are also presented.
