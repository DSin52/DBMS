Exact solutions of heterotic string theory corresponding to four-dimensionalmagnetic black holes in $N=4$ supergravity are described. The solutionsdescribe the black holes in the throat limit, and consist of a tensor productof an $SU(2)$ WZW orbifold with the linear dilaton vacuum, supersymmetrized to$(1,0)$ world sheet SUSY. One dimension of the $SU(2)$ model is interpreted asa compactified fifth dimension, leading to a four dimensional solution with aKaluza-Klein gauge field having a magnetic monopole background; thiscorresponds to a solution in $N=4$ supergravity, since that theory is obtainedby dimensional reduction of string theory.
