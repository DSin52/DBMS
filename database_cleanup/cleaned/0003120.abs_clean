Quantum field theory on d+1-dimensional anti-deSitter space-time admits are-interpretation as a quantum field theory with conformal symmetry ond-dimensional Minkowski space-time. This conjecture originally emerged fromstring theory considerations. Here, it is proven in a general framework by anexplicit identification between the local observables of the two correspondingtheories.
