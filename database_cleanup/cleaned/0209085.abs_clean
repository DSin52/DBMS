We discuss the relation between matrix models and the Seiberg--Witten type(SW) theories, recently proposed by Dijkgraaf and Vafa. In particular, we provethat the partition function of the Hermitean one-matrix model in the planar(large $N$) limit coincides with the prepotential of the corresponding SWtheory. This partition function is the logarithm of a Whitham $\tau$-function.The corresponding Whitham hierarchy is explicitly constructed. The double-pointproblem is solved.
