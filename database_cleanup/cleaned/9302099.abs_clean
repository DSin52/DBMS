Title: Anomaly Cancellations and Open-String Theories

Authors: Augusto Sagnotti

Comments: plain TEX

In models of oriented closed strings, anomaly cancellations are deeply linkedto the {\it modular invariance} of the torus amplitude. If open and/orunoriented strings are allowed, there are no non-trivial modulartransformations in the additional genus-one amplitudes (Klein bottle, annulusand M\"obius strip). As originally recognized by Green and Schwarz, in theten-dimensional type-I superstring the anomaly cancellation results from adelicate interplay between the contributions of these additional surfaces. Inlower-dimensional models, the possible presence of a number of antisymmetrictensors yields a generalization of the Green-Schwarz mechanism. I illustratethese results by referring to some six-dimensional chiral models, and Iconclude by addressing the additional difficulties that one meets when tryingto extend the construction to chiral four-dimensional models.
