Title: Scalar Field Theory on Fuzzy S^4

Authors: Julieta Medina and Denjoe O'Connor

Comments: 16 pages, LaTeX

Scalar fields are studied on fuzzy $S^4$ and a solution is found for theelimination of the unwanted degrees of freedom that occur in the model. Theresulting theory can be interpreted as a Kaluza-Klein reduction of CP^3 to S^4in the fuzzy context.
