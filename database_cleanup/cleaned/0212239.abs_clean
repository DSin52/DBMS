A consistent gauging of maximal supergravity requires that the T-tensortransforms according to a specific representation of the duality group. Theanalysis of viable gaugings is thus amenable to group-theoretical analysis,which we explain and exploit for a large variety of gaugings. We discuss thesubtleties in four spacetime dimensions, where the ungauged Lagrangians are notunique and encoded in an E_7(7)\Sp(56,R)/GL(28) matrix. Here we define theT-tensor and derive all relevant identities in full generality. We present alarge number of examples in d=4,5 spacetime dimensions which includenon-semisimple gaugings of the type arising in (multiple) Scherk-Schwarzreductions. We also present some general background material on the latter aswell as some group-theoretical results which are necessary for using computeralgebra.
