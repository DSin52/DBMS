Title: An Observation on Finite Groups and WZW Modular Invariants

Authors: Bo Feng and Yang-Hui He

Comments: 13 pages

In this short note, inspired by much recent activity centered around attemptsto formulate various correspondences between the classification of affine SU(k)WZW modular-invariant partition functions and that of discrete finite subgroupsof SU(k), we present a small and perhaps interesting observation in this light.In particular we show how the groups generated by the permutation of the termsin the exceptional Affine SU(2)-WZW invariants encode the correspondingexceptional SU(2) subgroups.
