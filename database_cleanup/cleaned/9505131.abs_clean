Title: Double Scaling Limits, Airy Functions and Multicritical Behaviour in

O(N) Vektor Sigma ModelsComments: 14 pages, LaTex

O(N) vector sigma models possessing catastrophes in their action are studied.Coupling the limit N --> infinity with an appropriate scaling behaviour of thecoupling constants, the partition function develops a singular factor. This isa generalized Airy function in the case of spacetime dimension zero and thepartition function of a scalar field theory for positive spacetime dimension.
