Authors: I. Antoniadis and T.R. Taylor

Comments: 11 pages, CPTH-C218.0193 (Based on talks presented at the Rome

Workshop STRINGS 92, at the 7th Meeting of the American Physical Society, andWe report on the recent progress in computing the effective supergravityaction from superstring scattering amplitudes beyond the tree approximation. Wediscuss the moduli-dependent string loop corrections to gauge, gravitationaland Yukawa couplings.
