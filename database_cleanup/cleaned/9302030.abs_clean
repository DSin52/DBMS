A physical interpretation is given for some Hermitian Jordan triple systems(HJTS) that were recently discussed by Gunaydin (hep-th/9301050). QuadraticJordan algebras derived from HJTS provide a formulation of quantum mechanicsthat is a natural framework within which exceptional structures are identifiedwith physically realistic structures of a quantum field theory that includesboth the standard model and MacDowell-Mansouri gravity. The structures allowthe calculation of the relative strengths of the four forces, including thefine structure constant ALPHA = 1/137.03608.
