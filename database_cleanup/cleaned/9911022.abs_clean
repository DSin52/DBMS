lectures by H.J. Schnitzer at the Advanced School on Supersymmetry in theTheories of Fields, Strings and Branes, University of Santiago de Compostela,Spain, July 1999. Revised Version. Typos corrected and references addedMethods are reviewed for computing the instanton expansion of theprepotential for N=2 Seiberg-Witten (SW) theory with non-hyperelliptic curves.These results, if compared with the instanton expansion obtained from themicroscopic Lagrangian, will provide detailed tests of M-theory. We observegroup-theoretic regularities of the one-instanton prepotential which allow usto "reverse engineer" a SW curve for SU(N) gauge theory with twohypermultiplets in the antisymmetric representation and $N_f\leq 3$hypermultiplets in the fundamental representations, a result not yet availableby other methods. Consistency with M-theory requires a curve of infinite order,which we identify as a decompactified version of elliptic models of the typedescribed by Donagi and Witten, Uranga, and others. This leads us to a briefdiscussion of some elliptic models that relate to our work.
