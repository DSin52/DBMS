The blocked composite operators are defined in the one-component Euclideanscalar field theory, and shown to generate a linear transformation of theoperators, the operator mixing. This transformation allows us to introduce theparallel transport of the operators along the RG trajectory. The connection onthis one-dimensional manifold governs the scale evolution of the operatormixing. It is shown that the solution of the eigenvalue problem of theconnection gives the various scaling regimes and the relevant operators there.The relation to perturbative renormalization is also discussed in the frameworkof the $\phi^3$ theory in dimension $d=6$.
