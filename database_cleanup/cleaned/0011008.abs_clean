The presentation at Strings 2000 was intended to be in two main parts, butthere was only time for part one. However both parts appeared on the onlineproceedings, and are also included in this document. The first part concerns anexploration of the connection between the physics of the `enhancon' geometryarising from wrapping N D6-branes on the K3 manifold in Type IIA string theoryand that of a charge N BPS multi-monopole. This also relates to the physics of2+1 dimensional SU(N) gauge theory with eight supercharges. The main resultsgeometry of the enhancon; b) the structure of the moduli space geometry, andits characterisation in terms of generalisations of an Atiyah-Hitchin-likemanifold; c) the use of Nahm data to describe aspects of the geometry, showingthat the enhancon locus itself has a description as a fuzzy sphere. Part twodiscusses the addition of extra D2-branes into the geometry. Two probecomputations show the difference between the geometry as seen by D2-branes andthat seen by wrapped D6-branes, and the accompanying gauge theoryinterpretations are discussed.
