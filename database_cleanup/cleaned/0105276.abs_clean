We apply the formalism of holographic renormalization to domain wallsolutions of 5-dimensional supergravity which are dual to deformed conformalfield theories in 4 dimensions. We carefully compute one- and two-pointfunctions of the energy-momentum tensor and the scalar operator mixing with itin two specific holographic flows, resolving previous difficulties with thesecorrelation functions. As expected, two-point functions have a 0-mass dilatonpole for the Coulomb branch flow in which conformal symmetry is brokenspontaneously but not for the flow dual to a mass deformation in which it isbroken explicitly. A previous puzzle of the energy scale in the Coulomb branchflow is explained.
