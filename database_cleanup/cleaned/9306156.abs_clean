Title: Recent Developments in Fractional Superstrings

Authors: Keith R. Dienes

Comments: 11 pages (LaTeX) [Talk presented at the SUSY-93 Conference

(Northeastern University) and at the MRST-15 "Walifest" Meeting (SyracuseUniversity). This is a condensed summary of material presented inhep-th/9305093 and hep-th/9305094 .]Fractional superstrings experience new types of ``internal projections''which alter or deform their underlying worldsheet conformal field theories.In this talk I summarize some recent results concerning both the worldsheettheory which remains after the internal projections have acted, and thespacetime statistics properties of its various sectors.
