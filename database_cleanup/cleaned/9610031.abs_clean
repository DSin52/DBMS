Title: Higher dimensional extremal black strings

Park(Kyungnam U.)Comments: 18 pages no figure, RevTeX

We investigate the five and six-dimensional black strings withinEinstein-Maxwell theory. The extremal black strings are endowed with the nullKilling symmetry. We study the propagation of Einstein-Maxwell modes in theextremal black string background by using this symmetry. It turns out that onegraviton is a propagating mode, while both the Maxwell $F$ andthree-form $H$ fields are non-propagating modes. Further we discussthe stability and classical hair of the extremal black strings.
