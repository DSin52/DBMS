We first extend the Peierls algebra of gauge invariant functions from thespace ${\cal S}$ of classical solutions to the space ${\cal H}$ of historiesused in path integration and some studies of decoherence. We then show that itmay be generalized in a number of ways to act on gauge dependent functions on${\cal H}$. These generalizations (referred to as class I) depend on the choiceof an ``invariance breaking term," which must be chosen carefully so that thegauge dependent algebra is a Lie algebra. Another class of invariance breakingterms is also found that leads to an algebra of gauge dependent functions, butonly on the space ${\cal S}$ of solutions. By the proper choice of invariancebreaking term, we can construct a generalized Peierls algebra that agrees withany gauge dependent algebra constructed through canonical or gauge fixingmethods, as well as Feynman and Landau ``gauge." Thus, generalized Peierlsalgebras present a unified description of these techniques. We study theproperties of generalized Peierls algebras and their pull backs to spaces ofpartial solutions and find that they may posses constraints similar to thecanonical case. Such constraints are always first class, and quantization mayproceed accordingly.
