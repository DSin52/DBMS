We formulate Poisson Chern-Simons gauge theories on compact group manifolds.These describe a sector of the large representation limit of noncommutativeChern-Simons in the same way as the light-cone formulation of the membraneaction describe a sector of the large N Matrix model. While the formulation wegive is on a group manifold, only excitations that are invariant under the leftaction of the stability group of a weight are allowed.
