We consider brane solutions where the tensor degrees of freedom are excited.Explicit solutions to the full non-linear supergravity equations of motion aregiven for the M5 and D3 branes, corresponding to finite selfdual tensor orBorn-Infeld field strengths. The solutions are BPS-saturated andhalf-supersymmetric. The resulting metric space-times are analysed.
