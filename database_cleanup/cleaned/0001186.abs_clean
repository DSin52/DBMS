Supersymmetric orbifold projection of N=1 SQCD with relatively small numberof flavors (not larger than the number of colors) is considered. The purpose isto check whether orbifolding commutes with the infrared limit. On the one hand,one considers the orbifold projection of SQCD and obtains the low-energydescription of the resulting theory. On the other hand, one starts with thelow-energy effective theory of the original SQCD, and only then perfomsorbifolding. It is shown that at finite N_c the two low-energy theoriesobtained in these ways are different. However, in the case of stabilizedrun-away vacuum these two theories are shown to coincide in the large N_climit. In the case of quantum modified moduli space, topological solitonscarrying baryonic charges are present in the orbifolded low-energy theory.These solitons may restore the correspondence between the two theories providedthat the soliton mass tends to zero in the large N_c limit.
