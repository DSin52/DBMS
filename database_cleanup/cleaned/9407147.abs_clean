The absence of fermion kinetic terms in supersymmetric-BF gauge theories isestablished. We do this by means of explicit off-shell (superspace)constructions. As part of our study we give the superspace constraints for D=3,N=4 super Yang-Mills along with the D=3, N=4 superconformal algebra. The puzzlewe are interested in solving is the fact that the topological cousins, known assuper-BF gauge theories, of certain supersymmetric-BF theories have kineticterms for the twisted fermions. We show that the map which takes the latter tothe former includes a Hodge decomposition of the twisted fermions. Inconjunction with this result, we argue that it is natural to modify the naivepath integral measure of supersymmetric-BF theories to include the Ray-Singeranalytic torsion.
