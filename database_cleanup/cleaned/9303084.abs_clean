Using operator sewing techniques we construct the Reggeon vertex involvingfour external ${\bf Z}_3$-twisted complex fermionic fields. Generalizing aprocedure recently applied to the ordinary Ramond four-vertex, we deduce theclosed form of the ${\bf Z}_3$ vertex by demanding it to reproduce the resultsobtained by sewing.
