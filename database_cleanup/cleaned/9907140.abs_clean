A detailed review of recent developments in the topological classification ofD-branes in superstring theory is presented. Beginning with a thorough,self-contained introduction to the techniques and applications of topologicalK-theory, the relationships between the classic constructions of K-theory andthe recent realizations of D-branes as tachyonic solitons, coming from boundstates of higher dimensional systems of unstable branes, are described. It isshown how the K-theory formalism naturally reproduces the known spectra of BPSand non-BPS D-branes, and how it can be systematically used to predict theexistence of new states. The emphasis is placed on the new interpretations ofD-branes as conventional topological solitons in other brane worldvolumes, howthe mathematical formalism can be used to deduce the gauge field content onboth supersymmetric and non-BPS branes, and also how K-theory predicts newrelationships between the various superstring theories and their D-branespectra. The implementations of duality symmetries as natural isomorphisms ofK-groups are discussed. The relationship with the standard cohomologicalclassification is presented and used to derive an explicit formula for D-branecharges. Some string theoretical constructions of the K-theory predictions arealso briefly described.
