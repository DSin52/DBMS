Title: New nonultralocal quantum integrable models through gauge transformation

Comments: Latex, 8 pages, no figure

One of the few schemes for obtaining an integrable nonultralocal quantummodel is its possible generation from an ultralocal model by a suitable gaugetransformation. Applying this scheme we discover two new nonultralocal models,which fit well into the braided Yang-Baxter relations ensuring their quantumintegrability. Our first model is generated from a lattice Liouville-likesystem, while the second one which is an exact lattice version of thelight-cone sine-Gordon is gauge transformed from a model, which gives also thequantum mKdV for a different gauge choice.
