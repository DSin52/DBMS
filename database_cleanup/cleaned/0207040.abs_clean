to appear in Nucl. Phys. BSystems; Mathematical PhysicsWe show that the N-particle A_{N-1} and B_N rational Calogero models withoutthe harmonic interaction admit a new class of bound and scattering states.These states owe their existence to the self-adjoint extensions of thecorresponding Hamiltonians, labelled by a real parameter z. It is shown thatthe new states appear for all values of N and for specific ranges of thecoupling constants. Moreover, they are shown to exist even in the excitedsectors of the Calogero models. The self-adjoint extension generically breaksthe classical scaling symmetry, leading to quantum mechanical scaling anomaly.The scaling symmetry can however be restored for certain values of theparameter z. We also generalize these results for many particle systems withclassically scale invariant long range interactions in arbitrary dimensions.
