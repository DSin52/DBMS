We study further the r\^ole of the boundary operator $\O_B$ for macroscopicloop length in the stable definition of 2D quantum gravity provided by the$[{\tilde P},Q]=Q$ formulation. The KdV flows are supplemented by an additionalflow with respect to the boundary cosmological constant $\sigma$. Wenumerically study these flows for the $m=1$, $2$ and $3$ models, solving forthe string susceptibility in the presence of $\O_B$ for arbitrary coupling$\sigma$. The spectrum of the Hamiltonian of the loop quantum mechanics iscontinuous and bounded from below by $\sigma$. For large positive $\sigma$, thetheory is dominated by the `universal' $m=0$ topological phase present only inthe $[{\tilde P},Q]=Q$ formulation. For large negative $\sigma$, thenon--perturbative physics approaches that of the $[P,Q]=1$ definition, althoughthere is no path to the unstable solutions of the $[P,Q]=1$ $m$-even models.
