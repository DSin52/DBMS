Title: On Calculation of 1/n Expansions of Critical Exponents in the

Gross-Neveu Model with the Conformal TechniqueAuthors: S.E. Derkachov, N.A. Kivel, A.S. Stepanenko, A.N. Vasiliev

A proof of critical conformal invariance of Green's functions for a quitewide class of models possessing critical scale invariance is given. A simplemethod for establishing critical conformal invariance of a composite operator,which has a certain critical dimension, is also presented. The method isillustrated with the example of the Gross--Neveu model and the exponents \et\at order $1/n^3$, \Dl\ and $1/\nu$ at order $1/n^2$ are calculated with theconformal bootstrap method.
