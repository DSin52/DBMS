Recent astronomical observations indicate that the universe is accelerating.We argue that generic quintessence models that accommodate the present dayacceleration tend to accelerate eternally. As a consequence the resultingspacetimes exhibit event horizons. Hence, quintessence poses the same problemsfor string theory as asymptotic de Sitter spaces.
