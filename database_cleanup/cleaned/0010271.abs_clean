We study supersymmetric domain walls on S_1/Z_2 orbifolds. The supergravitysolutions in the bulk are given by the attractor equation associated withCalabi-Yau spaces and have a naked space-time singularity at some |y_s|. We arelooking for possibilities to cut off this singularity with the second wall by astringy mechanism. We use the collapse of the CY cycle at |y_c| which happensbefore and at a finite distance from the space-time singularity. In our examplewith three Kahler moduli the second wall is at the end of the moduli space at|y_c| where also the enhancement of SU(2) gauge symmetry takes place so that|y_e|=|y_c|< |y_s|. The physics of the excision of a naked singularity via theenhancon in the context of domain wall has an interpretation on the heteroticside related to R -> 1/R duality. The position of the enhancon is given by theequation R(|y_e|)=1.
