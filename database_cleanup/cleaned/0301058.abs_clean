extended, references addedWe study the four-point correlator of 1/2-BPS operators of weight 4 in N=4SYM, which are dual to massive KK modes in AdS_5 supergravity. Generalfield-theoretic arguments lead to a partially non-renormalized form of theamplitude that depends on two a priori independent functions of the conformalcross-ratios. We explicitly compute the amplitude in the large N limit at oneloop (order g^2) and in AdS_5 supergravity. Surprisingly, the one-loop resultshows that the two functions determining the amplitude coincide while in thesupergravity regime they are distinctly different. We discuss the possibleimplications of this perturbative degeneracy for the AdS/CFT correspondence.
