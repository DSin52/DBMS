The \gamma-trace anomaly of supersymmetry current in a supersymmetric gaugetheory shares a superconformal anomaly multiplet with the chiral R-symmetryanomaly and the Weyl anomaly, and its holographic reproduction is a valuabletest to the AdS/CFT correspondence conjecture. We investigate how the\gamma-trace anomaly of the supersymmetry current of N=1 four-dimensionalsupersymmetric gauge theory in an N=1 conformal supergravity background can beextracted out from the N=2$ gauged supergravity in five dimensions. It is shownthat the reproduction of this super-Weyl anomaly originates from the followingsuperconformal transformation on the boundary, which consists of N=1supersymmetry transformation and special conformal supersymmetry (orsuper-Weyl) transformation; second the supersymmetry variation of the bulkaction of five-dimensional gauged supergravity is a total derivative. Thenon-compatibility of supersymmetry and the super-Weyl transformation invarianceyields the holographic supersymmetry current anomaly. Furthermore, we speculateon that the contribution from the external gauge field to the holographicsuperconformal anomaly is dominated by the leading terms in the asymptoticexpansion of the bulk fields in terms of the radial coordinate, while externalgravitational background contribution is determined by those terms withlogarithmic function dependence on the radial coordinate.
