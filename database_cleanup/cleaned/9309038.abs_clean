Title: Higher Gel'fand-Dikii structures

Authors: B. Enriquez, A. Orlov and V. Rubtsov

We apply the procedure of Magri and Weinstein to produce an infinity ofcompatible Poisson structures on a bihamiltonian manifold, to the case of theKdV phase space. The higher Gel'fand-Dikii structures thus obtained contain nonlocal terms, which we express with the help of the r.h.s. of the KdV hierarchy.We also give a generating function for all these Poisson structues, in terms ofthe Baker-Akhiezer functions. Finally we describe the symplectic leaves ofthese Poisson structures.
