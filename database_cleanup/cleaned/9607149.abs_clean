We investigate some aspects of the spectrum of D-branes and theirinteractions with closed strings. As argued earlier, a collection of manyD-strings behaves, at large dilaton values, as a single multiply wound string.We use this result and T-duality transformations to show that a similarphenomenon occurs for effective strings produced by wrapping p-branes on asmall (p-1)-dimensional torus, for suitable coupling. To understand the decayof an excited D-string at large dilaton values, we study the decay of anelementary string at small dilaton values. A long string, multiply wound on acircle, with a small excitation energy is found to predominantly decay intoanother string with the same winding number and an unwound closed string(rather than two wound strings). This decay amplitude agrees, under duality,with the decay amplitude computed using the Born-Infeld action for theD-string. We compute the absorption cross section for the D-brane model studiedby Callan and Maldacena. The absorption cross section for the dilaton equalsthat for the scalars obtained by reduction of the graviton, and both agree withthe cross section expected from a classical hole with the same charges.
