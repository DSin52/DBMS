the conference "Mathematical Beauty of Physics", Saclay, June 1996, dedicatedto the memory of C.ItzyksonGeometryWe started from computer experiments with simple one-dimensional ergodicdynamical systems called interval exchange transformations. Correlators inthese systems decay as a power of time. In the simplest non-trivial case theexponent is equal to 1/3. We found a formula connecting characteristicexponents with explicit integrals over moduli spaces of algebraic curves withadditional structures. Moreover, these integrals can be interpreted ascorrelators in a topological string theory. Also a new analogy arose betweenergodic theory and complex algebraic geometry.
