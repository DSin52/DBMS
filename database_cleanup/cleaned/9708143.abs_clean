Title: Can Pions ``Smell'' 4D, N = 1 Supersymmetry?

Comments: 18 pages, UMDEPP 98-12, Presentation at the Second International

Conference on Quantum Field Theory and Gravity, Tomsk, Russia, July 28 -August 2, 1997We show how the usual chiral perturbation theory description ofphenomenological pion physics admits an interpretation as a low-energystring-like model associated with QCD. By naive and straightforwardgeneralization within the context of a new class of supersymmetrical models, itis shown that this string-like structure admits a 4D, N = 1 supersymmetricalextension. The presence of a WZNW term in the model implies modifications ofcertain higher order processes involving the ordinary SU(3) pion octet.
