Title: Quantum Background Independence In String Theory

Authors: Edward Witten

Comments: 20 pp

Not only in physical string theories, but also in some highly simplifiedsituations, background independence has been difficult to understand. It isargued that the ``holomorphic anomaly'' of Bershadsky, Cecotti, Ooguri, andVafa gives a fundamental explanation of some of the problems. Moreover, theiranomaly equation can be interpreted in terms of a rather peculiar quantumbackground independence does not hold order by order in perturbation theory,but the exact partition function as a function of the coupling constants has abackground independent interpretation as a state in an auxiliary quantumHilbert space. The significance of this auxiliary space is otherwise unknown.
