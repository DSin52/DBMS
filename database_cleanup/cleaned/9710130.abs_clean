Workshop "Mathematical Physics-today, Priority Technologies-for tomorrow"(in honour of the 70th anniversary of Professor Walter Thirring's birth),12-17 May, Kyiv, UkraineSingular configuration of an external static magnetic field in the form of astring polarizes vacuum in the secondly quantized theory on a plane which isorthogonal to the string axis. We consider the most general boundary conditionsat the punctured singular point, which are compatible with the self-adjointnessof the two-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian. The dependence of the induced vacuumquantum numbers on the self-adjoint extension parameter and the flux of thestring is determined.
