It is shown that quantum-induced (inflationary) brane Universe occurs in thebulk 5d AdS black hole in accordance with AdS/CFT correspondence. Brane stresstensor is induced by quantum effects of dual CFT and brane crosses the horizonof AdS black hole. Quantum-corrected Hubble constant, Hawking temperature andentropy are found on the brane (and at the horizon). The similarity between CFTentropy at the horizon and FRW equations is extended on the quantum level. Thissuggests the way to understand cosmological entropy bounds in quantum gravity.
