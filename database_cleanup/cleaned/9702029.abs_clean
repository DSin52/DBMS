We find the static vortex solutions of the model of Maxwell-Chern-Simonsgauge field coupled to a (2+1)-dimensional four-fermion theory. Especially, weelectromagnetic current and a topological current associated with theelectromagnetic current. Unlike other Chern-Simons solitons the N-solitonsolution of this theory has binding energy and the stability of the solutionsis maintained by the charge conservation laws.
