We study how to obtain a sufficiently flat inflaton potential that is naturalfrom the particle physics point of view. Supersymmetry, which is broken duringinflation, cannot protect the potential against non-renormalizable operatorsviolating slow-roll. We are therefore led to consider models based onnon-linearly realized symmetries. The basic scenario with a singlefour-dimensional pseudo Nambu Goldstone boson requires the spontaneous breakingscale to be above the Planck scale, which is beyond the range of validity ofthe field theory description, so that quantum gravity corrections are not undercontrol. A nice way to obtain consistent models with large field values is toconsider simple extensions in extra-dimensional setups. We also consider theminimal structures necessary to obtain purely four-dimensional models withspontaneous breaking scale below M_P; we show that they require an approximatesymmetry that is supplemented by either the little-Higgs mechanism orsupersymmetry to give trustworthy scenarios.
