A closed formula for the structure constants in the SL(2,C)/SU(2) WZNW modelis derived by a method previously used in Liouville theory. With the help of areflection amplitude that follows from the structure constants one obtains aproposal for the fusion rules from canonical quantization. Taken together thesepieces of information allow an unambigous definition of any genus zero n-pointfunction.
