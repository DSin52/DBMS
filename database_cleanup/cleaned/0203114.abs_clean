Unification ideas suggest an integral treatment of fermion and boson spin andgauge-group degrees of freedom. Hence, a generalized quantum field equation,based on Dirac's, is proposed and investigated which contains gauge and flavorsymmetries, determines vector gauge field and fermion solution representations,and fixes their mode of interaction. The simplest extension of the theory witha 6-dimensional Clifford algebra predicts an SU(2)_L X U(1) symmetry, which isassociated with the isospin and the hypercharge, their vector carriers,two-flavor charged and chargeless leptons, and scalar particles. A mass termproduces breaking of the symmetry to an electromagnetic U(1), and a Weinberg'sangle theta_W with sin^2(theta_W)=.25 . A more realistic 8-d extension givescoupling constants of the respective groups g=1/sqrt 2~.707 and g'=1/sqrt6~.408, with the same theta_W.
