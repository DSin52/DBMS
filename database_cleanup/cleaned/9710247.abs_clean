We give a detailed discussion of the matching of the BPS states of heterotic,type I and type I' theories in d=9 for general backgrounds. This allows us toexplicitly identify these (composite) brane states in the type I' theory thatlead to gauge symmetry enhancement at critical points in moduli space. Anexample is the enhancement of $SO(16)\times SO(16)$ to $E_8\times E_8$.
