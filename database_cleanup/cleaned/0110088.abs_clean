The most general geometrical scenario in which the brane-world program can beimplemented is investigated. The basic requirement is that it should beconsistent with the confinement of gauge interaction, the existence of quantumstates and the embedding in a bulk with arbitrary dimensions, signature andtopology.It is found that the embedding equations are compatible with a wide class ofLagrangians, starting with a modified Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian as thesimplest one, provided minimal boundaries are added to the bulk.A non-trivial canonical structure is derived, suggesting a canonicalquantization of the brane-world geometry relative to the extra dimensions,where the quantum states are set in correspondence with high frequencygravitational waves. It is shown that in the cases of at least six dimensions,there exists a confined gauge field included in the embedding structure. Thesize of extra dimensions compatible with the embedding is calculated and foundto be different from the one derived with product topology.
