Title: Dynamical Topological Phase Transition in Massless Thirring Model

Authors: Hiroshi Nohara

Comments: 9 pages

We study the topological nature of both isotropic and anisotropic SU(N)Thirring model. It is shown that in the isotropic model there exists thespecial point where the system lives in the topological phase and that in theanisotropic one which is obtained by introducing two coupling constants and hasU(1) symmetry, we present a simple mechanism of the dynamical topological phasetransition which takes place at the infinite energy scale.
