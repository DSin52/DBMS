We consider two dimensional QCD with the spatial dimension compactified to acircle. We show that the states in the theory consist of interacting stringsthat wind around the circle and derive the Hamiltonian for this theory in thelarge $N$ limit, complete with interactions. Mapping the winding states intomomentum states, we express this Hamiltonian in terms of a continuous field.For a $U(N)$ gauge group with a background source of Wilson loops, we recoverthe collective field Hamiltonian found by Das and Jevicki for the $c=1$ matrixmodel, except the spatial coordinate is on a circle. We then proceed to showthat two dimensional QCD with a $U(N)$ gauge group can be reduced to a one-dimensional unitary matrix model and is hence equivalent to a theory of $N$free nonrelativistic fermions on a circle. A similar result is true for thegroup $SU(N)$, but the fermions must be modded out by the center of masscoordinate.
