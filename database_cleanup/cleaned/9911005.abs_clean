It is shown that three-dimensional charged black holes can approach theextreme state at nonzero temperature. Unlike even dimensional cases, theentropy for the extreme three-dimensional charged black hole is uniquelydescribed by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, regardless of different treatmentsof preparing the extreme black hole, namely, Hawking's treatment andZaslavskii's treatment.
