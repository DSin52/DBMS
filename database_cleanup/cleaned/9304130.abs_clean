We investigate $N=2$ supersymmetric sigma model orbifolds of the sphere inthe large radius limit. These correspond to $N=2$ superconformal fieldtheories. Using the equations of topological-anti-topological fusion for thetopological orbifold, we compute the generalized Dynkin diagrams of thesetheories - i.e., the soliton spectrum - which was used in the classification ofmassive superconformal theories. They correspond to the extended Dynkindiagrams associated to finite subgroups of $SO(3).$
