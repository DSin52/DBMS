We explicitly show that, in a system with T-duality symmetry, theconfiguration space volume degrees of freedom may hide on the surface boundaryof the region of accessible states with energy less than a fixed value. Thismeans that, when taking the decompactification limit (big volume limit), anumber of accessible states proportional to the volume is recovered even if novolume dependence appears when energy is high enough. All this behavior iscontained in the exact way of computing sums by making integrals.
