distinction between the fields z and S made clearer in section 4.4We study the physics of N=1 super Yang-Mills theory with gauge group U(Nc)and one adjoint Higgs field, by using the recently derived exact effectivesuperpotentials. Interesting phenomena occur for some special values of theHiggs potential couplings. We find critical points with massless glueballsand/or massless monopoles, confinement without a mass gap, and tensionlessdomain walls. We describe the transitions between regimes with differentpatterns of gauge symmetry breaking, or, in the matrix model language, betweensolutions with a different number of cuts. The standard large Nc expansion issingular near the critical points, with domain walls tensions scaling as afractional power of Nc. We argue that the critical points are four dimensionalanalogues of the Kazakov critical points that are commonly found in lowdimensional matrix integrals. We define a double scaling limit that yields theexact tension of BPS two-branes in the resulting N=1, four dimensionalnon-critical string theory. D-brane states can be deformed continuously intoclosed string solitonic states and vice-versa along paths that go over regionswhere the string coupling is strong.
