5-branes of nontrivial topology are associated in theDiaconescu-Hanany-Witten-Witten (DHWW) approach with the Seiberg-Witten (SW)theory of low-energy effective actions. There are two different "pictures",related to the IIA and IIB phases of M-theory. They differ by the choice of$6d$ theory on the 5-brane world volume. In the IIB picture it is just the 6dSUSY Yang-Mills, while in the IIA picture it is a theory of SUSY self-dual2-form. These two pictures appear capable to describe the (non-abelian) Laxoperator and (abelian) low-energy effective action respectively. Thus IIB-IIAduality is related to the duality between Hitchin and Whitham integrablestructures.
