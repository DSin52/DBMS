We explore the bubble spacetimes which can be obtained from double analyticcontinuations of static and rotating black holes in anti-de Sitter space. Inparticular, we find that rotating black holes with elliptic horizon lead tobubble spacetimes only in dimension greater than five. For dimension greaterthan seven, the topology of the bubble can be non-spherical. However, a bubblespacetime is shown to arise from a rotating de Sitter black hole in fourdimensions. In all cases, the evolution of the bubble is of de Sitter type.Double analytic continuations of hyperbolic black holes and branes are alsodiscussed.
