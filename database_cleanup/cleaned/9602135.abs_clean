We consider slightly non-extremal black 3-branes of type IIB supergravity andshow that their Bekenstein-Hawking entropy agrees with the counting of statesof the Dirichlet 3-brane. The Dirichlet brane excitations are described interms of the statistical mechanics of a 3+1 dimensional gas of massless openstring states. This is essentially the classic problem of black body radiation.The black body temperature is shown to be identical with the temperature of theHawking radiation. We also construct a solution of type IIB supergravitydescribing a 3-brane with a finite density of longitudinal momentum. Forextremal momentum-carrying 3-branes the horizon area vanishes. This is inagreement with the fact that the BPS entropy of the momentum-carrying Dirichlet3-branes is not an extensive quantity.
