We give a non-static exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations (withnull fluid), which is a non-static magnetic charge generalization to theBonnor-Vaidya solution and describes the gravitational and electromagneticfields of a nonrotating massive radiating dyon. In addition, using theenergy-momentum pseudotensors of Einstein and Landau and Lifshitz we obtain theenergy, momentum, and power output of the radiating dyon and find that bothprescriptions give the same result.
