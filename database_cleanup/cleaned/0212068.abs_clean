Title: "Principle of Indistinguishability" and equations of motion for

particles with spinAuthors: Mauro Napsuciale

Comments: 23 pages, invited talk at Zacatecas Forum in Physics 2002, Zacatecas,

Mexico, May 2002. To appear in Found. of PhysicsIn this work we review the derivation of Dirac and Weinberg equations basedon a ``principle of indistinguishability'' for the (j,0) and (0,j) irreduciblerepresentations (irreps) of the Homogeneous Lorentz Group (HLG). We generalizethis principle and explore its consequences for other irreps containing spin >=1. We rederive Ahluwalia-Kirchbach equation using this principle and concludethat it yields O(p^{2j}) equations of motion for any representation containingspin j and lower spins. We also use the obtained generators of the HLG for agiven representation to explore the possibility of the existence of first orderequations for that representation. We show that, except for j=1/2, there existsno Dirac-like equation for the (j,0)\oplus (0,j) representation nor for the(1/2,1/2) representation. We rederive Kemmer-Duffin-Petieau (KDP) equation forthe (1,0)\oplus (1/2,1/2)\oplus(0,1) representation by this method and showthat the (1,1/2)\oplus (1/2,1) representation satisfies a Dirac-like equationwhich describes a multiplet of j=3/2 and j=1/2 with masses m and m/2}respectively.
