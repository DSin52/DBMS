We compare the one-loop corrections to the entropy of a black hole, fromquantum fields of spin zero, one-half, and one, to the entropy of entanglementof the fields. For fields of spin zero and one-half the black hole entropy isidentical to the entropy of entanglement. For spin one the two entropies differby a contact interaction with the horizon which appears in the black holeentropy but not in the entropy of entanglement. The contact interaction can beexpressed as a path integral over particle paths which begin and end on thehorizon; it is the field theory limit of the interaction proposed by Susskindand Uglum which couples a closed string to an open string stranded on thehorizon.
