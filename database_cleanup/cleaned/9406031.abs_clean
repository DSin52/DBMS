We analyse with the algebraic, regularisation independant, cohomologicalB.R.S. methods, the renormalisability of torsionless N=2 and N= 4supersymmetric non-linear $\si$ models built on K\"ahler spaces. Surprisinglyenough with respect to the common wisdom, in the case of N=2 supersymmetry, weobtain an anomaly candidate, at least in the compact K\"ahler Ricci-flat case.If its coefficient does differ from zero, such anomaly would imply the breakingof global N=2 supersymmetry and get into trouble some schemes of superstringcompactification as such non-linear $\si$ models offer candidates for thesuperstring vacuum state. In the compact homogeneous K\"ahler case, asexpected, the anomaly candidate disappears. The same phenomena occurs when oneof the expected all-orders renormalisability -`` in the space of metrics"- ofthe corresponding non-linear $\si$ models. PAR/LPTHE/94-11
