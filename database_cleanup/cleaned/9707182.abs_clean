The low energy effective actions which arise from string theory or M-theoryare considered in the cosmological context, where the graviton, dilaton andantisymmetric tensor field strengths depend only on time. We show that previousresults can be extended to include cosmological solutions that are related tothe E_N Toda equations. The solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation inminisuperspace are obtained for some of the simpler cosmological models byintroducing intertwining operators that generate canonical transformationswhich map the theories into free theories. We study the cosmological propertiesof these solutions, and also briefly discuss generalised Brans-Dicke models inour framework. The cosmological models are closely related to p-brane solitons,which we discuss in the context of the E_N Toda equations. We give the explicitsolutions for extremal multi-charge (D-3)-branes in the truncated systemdescribed by the D_4 =O(4,4) Toda equations.
