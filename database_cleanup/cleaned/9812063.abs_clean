Mardoyan et al., JINR Dubna Publ.DeptWe describe three ways of modifying the relativistic Heisenberg algebra -first one not linked with quantum symmetries, second and third related with theformalism of quantum groups. The third way is based on the identification ofgeneralized deformed phase space with the semidirect product of two dual Hopfalgebras describing quantum group of motions and the corresponding quantum Liealgebra. As an example the $\kappa$-deformation of relativistic Heisenbergalgebra is given, determined by $\kappa$-deformed D=4 Poincar\'{e} symmetries.
