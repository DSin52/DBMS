Title: Cosmological Background torsion limits from Lorentz violation

Comments: Latex file

Cosmological limits on Lorentz invariance breaking in Chern-Simons$(3+1)-dimensional$ electrodynamics are used to place limits on torsion.Birefrigence phenomena is discussed by using extending the propagation equationto Riemann-Cartan spacetimes instead of treating it in purely Riemannianspaces. The parameter of Lorentz violation is shown to be proportional to theaxial torsion vector which allows us to place a limit on cosmologicalbackground torsion from the Lorentz violation constraint which is given by $10^{-33} eV <|S^{\mu}| < 10^{-32} eV$ where $|S^{\mu}|$ is the axial torsionvector.
