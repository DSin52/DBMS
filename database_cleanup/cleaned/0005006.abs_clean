When unstable Dp-branes in type II string theory are placed in a B-field, theresulting tachyonic world-volume theory becomes noncommutative. We argue thatfor large noncommutativity parameter, condensation of the tachyon as anoncommutative soliton leads to new decay modes of the Dp-brane into(p-2)-brane configurations, which we interpret as suitably smeared BPSD(p-1)-branes. Some of these configurations are metastable. We discuss variousgeneralizations of this decay process.
