We formulate two-dimensional rational conformal field theory as a naturalgeneralization of two-dimensional lattice topological field theory. To this endwe lift various structures from complex vector spaces to modular tensorcategories. The central ingredient is a special Frobenius algebra object A inthe modular category that encodes the Moore-Seiberg data of the underlyingchiral CFT. Just like for lattice TFTs, this algebra is itself not anobservable quantity. Rather, Morita equivalent algebras give rise to equivalenttheories. Morita equivalence also allows for a simple understanding ofT-duality.We present a construction of correlators, based on a triangulation of theworld sheet, that generalizes the one in lattice TFTs. These correlators aremodular invariant and satisfy factorization rules. The construction works forarbitrary orientable world sheets, in particular for surfaces with boundary.Boundary conditions correspond to representations of the algebra A. Thepartition functions on the torus and on the annulus provide modular invariantsand NIM-reps of the fusion rules, respectively.
