An asymptotic expansion of the trace of the heat kernel on a cone where theheat coefficients have a delta function behavior at the apex is obtained. It isused to derive the renormalized effective action and total energy of aself-interacting quantum scalar field on the cosmic string space-time. Analogyis pointed out with quantum theory with boundaries. The surface infinities inthe effective action are shown to appear and are removed by renormalization ofthe string tension. Besides, the total renormalized energy turns out to befinite due to cancelation of the known non-integrable divergence in the energydensity of the field with a counterterm in the bare string tension.
