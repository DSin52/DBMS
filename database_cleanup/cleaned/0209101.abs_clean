We consider a dynamical membrane world in a space-time with scalar bulkmatter described by domain walls. Using the solutions to Einstein fieldequations and Israel conditions we investigate the possibility of havingshortcuts for gravitons leaving the wall and returning subsequently. As itturns out, they usually appear under mild conditions.In the comparison with photons following a geodesic inside the brane, weverify that shortcuts exist. For some Universes they are small, but there arecases where shortcuts are effective. In these cases we expect them to play asignificant role in the solution of the horizon problem.
