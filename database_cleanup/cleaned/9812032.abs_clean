Authors: Mans Henningson and Kostas Skenderis

Comments: 7 pages. Talk delivered at the 22nd Johns Hopkins Workshop in

Goteborg, Sweden, the 32nd International Symposium Ahrenshoop in Buckow,Germany, and the conference `Quantum aspects of gauge theories, supersymmetryand unification' in Corfu, Greece, to appear in the proceedingsJournal-ref: Fortsch.Phys. 48 (2000) 125-128

We review our calculation of the Weyl anomaly for d-dimensional conformalfield theories that have a description in terms of a (d + 1)-dimensionalgravity theory.
