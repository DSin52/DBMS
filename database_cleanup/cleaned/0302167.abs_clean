In order to evaluate the Feynman path integral in noncommutative quantummechanics, we consider properties of a Lagrangian related to a quadraticHamiltonian with noncommutative spatial coordinates. A quantum-mechanicalsystem with noncommutative coordinates is equivalent to another one withcommutative coordinates. We found connection between quadratic classicalLagrangians of these two systems. We also shown that there is a subclass ofquadratic Lagrangians, which includes harmonic oscillator and particle in aconstant field, whose connection between ordinary and noncommutative regimescan be expressed as a linear change of position in terms of a new position andvelocity.
