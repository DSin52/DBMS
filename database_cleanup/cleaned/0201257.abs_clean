Just as non-commutative gauge theories arise from quantising open strings ina large magnetic field, non-Abelian two-form gauge theories may conceivably beconstructed by quantising open membranes in a large three-form magneticbackground. We make some observations that arise in following this strategy,with an emphasis on the relation to the quantisation of volume-preservingdiffeomorphisms (vpd). In particular, we construct consistent non-Abelianinteractions of a two-form in 3+1 dimensions, based on gauge invariance undervpd.
