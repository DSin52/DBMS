The large momentum expansion for the inverse propagator of the auxiliaryfield $\lambda(x)$ in the conformally invariant O(N) vector model is calculatedto leading order in 1/N, in a strip-like geometry with one finite dimension oflength $L$ for $2<d<4$. Its leading terms are identified as contributions from$\lambda(x)$ itself and the energy momentum tensor, in agreement with aprevious calculation based on conformal operator product expansions. It isfound that a non-trivial cancellation takes place by virtue of the gapequation. The leading coefficient of the energy momentum tensor contribution isshown to be related to the free energy density.
