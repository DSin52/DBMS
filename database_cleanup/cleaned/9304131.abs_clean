The general $\sigma$-model-type string action including both massless andmassive higher spins background fields is suggested. Field equations forbackground fields are followed from the requirement of quantum Weyl invariance.It is shown that renormalization of the theory can be produced level by level.The detailed consideration of background fields structure and correspondingfields equations is given for the first massive level of the closed bosonicstring.
