Title: R-Symmetry, twisted N=2 Theory and the Role of the Dilaton

Comments: Proceedings of ``Susy95'', Palaiseaux, Ecole Polytechnique, May 95

LaTex, 8 pgsWe discuss R-symmetry in locally supersymmetric $N=2$ gauge theories coupledto hypermultiplets, which can be viewed as effective theories of heteroticstring models. In this type of supergravities a suitable R-symmetry exists andcan be used to topologically twist the theory. The vector multiplet of thedilaton-axion field has a different R-charge assignment with respect to theother vector multiplets.
