An inflationary brane model driven by a bulk inflaton with exponentialpotential is proposed. We find a family of exact solutions that describepower-law inflation on the brane. These solutions enable us to derive exactsolutions for metric perturbations analytically. By calculating scalar andtensor perturbations, we obtain a spectrum of primordial fluctuations at theend of the inflation. The amplitudes of scalar and tensor perturbations areenhanced in the same way if the energy scale of the inflation is sufficientlyhigher than the tension of the brane. Then the relative amplitude of scalar andtensor perturbations is not suppressed even for high-energy inflation. This isa distinguishable feature from the inflation model driven by inflaton on thebrane where tensor perturbations are suppressed for high-energy inflation. Wealso point out that massive Kaluza-Klein modes are not negligible athigh-frequencies on 3-space of our brane.
