We interpret Minkowski black holes as world-sheet {\it spikes } which arerelated by world-sheet { \it duality} to {\it vortices } that correspond toEuclidean black holes. These world-sheet defects induce defects in the gaugefields of the corresponding coset Wess-Zumino descriptions ofspherically-symmetric black holes. The low-temperature target space-time foamis a Minkowski black hole (spike) plasma with confined Euclidean black holes(vortices). The high-temperature phase is a {\it dense} vortex plasma describedby a topological gauge field theory on the world-sheet, which possessesenhanced symmetry as in the target space-time singularity at the core of ablack hole. Quantum decay via higher-genus effects induces a back-reactionwhich causes a Minkowski black hole to lose mass until it is indistinguishablefrom intrinsic fluctuations in the space-time foam.
