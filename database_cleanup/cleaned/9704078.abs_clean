We present simple diagrammatic rules to write down Euclidean n-pointfunctions at finite temperature directly in terms of 3-dimensional momentumintegrals, without ever performing a single Matsubara sum. The rules can beunderstood as describing the interaction of the external particles with thoseof the thermal bath.
