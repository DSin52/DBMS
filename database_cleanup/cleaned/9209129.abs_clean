Title: Three Dimensional Quantum Chromodynamics

Authors: G. Ferretti, S.G. Rajeev and Z. Yang

Comments: 7 pages, Plain TEX, talk presented by S.G. Rajeev at the

XXVI INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS, DALLAS TX AUG. 1992The subject of this talk was the review of our study of three ($2+1$)dimensional Quantum Chromodynamics. In our previous works, we showed theexistence of a phase where parity is unbroken and the flavor group $U(2n)$ isbroken to a subgroup $U(n)\times U(n)$. We derived the low energy effectiveaction for the theory and showed that it has solitonic excitations with Fermistatistic, to be identified with the three dimensional ``baryon''. Finally, westudied the current algebra for this effective action and we found aco-homologically non trivial generalization of Kac-Moody algebras to threedimensions.
