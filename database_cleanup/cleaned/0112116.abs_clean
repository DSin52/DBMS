The string theory on symmetric product describes the second-quantized stringtheory. The development for the bosonic open string was discussed in theprevious work. In this paper, we consider the open superstring theory on thesymmetric product and examine the nature of the second quantization. Thefermionic partition functions are obtained from the consistent fermionicextension of the twisted boundary conditions for the non-abelian orbifold, andthey can be interpreted in terms of the long string language naturally. In theclosed string sector, the boundary/cross-cap states are also constructed. Theseboundary states are classified into three types in terms of the long stringlanguage, and explain the change of the topology of the world-sheet. To obtainthe anomaly-free theory, the dilaton tadpole must be cancelled. This conditiongives SO(32) Chan-Paton group as ordinary superstring theory.
