The number state method is used to study soliton bands for three anharmonicAblowitz-Ladik system, and iii) A fermionic polaron model. Each of thesesystems is assumed to have $f$-fold translational symmetry in one spatialdimension, where $f$ is the number of freedoms (lattice points). At the secondquantum level $(n=2)$ we calculate exact eigenfunctions and energies of purequantum states, from which we determine binding energy $(E_{\rm b})$, effectivemass $(m^{*})$ and maximum group velocity $(V_{\rm m})$ of the soliton bands asfunctions of the anharmonicity in the limit $f \rightarrow \infty$. Forarbitrary values of $n$ we have asymptotic expressions for $E_{\rm b}$,$m^{*}$, and $V_{\rm m}$ as functions of the anharmonicity in the limits oflarge and small anharmonicity. Using these expressions we discuss and describewave packets of pure eigenstates that correspond to classical solitons.
