Garda Lake, 10-14 September 2002Simulations of SU(2) lattice gauge theory are used to establish a relationbetween the IR properties of Green functions and confinement. Using Landaugauge where the gauge configurations are restricted to the first Gribov regime,results on the ghost-, gluon form-factor and the running coupling constant arepresented. Finally, we discuss the behavior of the ghost form-factor of thede-confined phase at high temperatures.
