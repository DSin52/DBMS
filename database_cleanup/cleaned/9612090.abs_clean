We consider the 3-manifold invariant I(M) which is defined by means of theChern-Simons quantum field theory and which coincides with theReshetikhin-Turaev invariant. We present some arguments and numerical resultssupporting the conjecture that, for nonvanishing I(M), the absolute value| I(M) | only depends on the fundamental group \pi_1 (M) of the manifold M.For lens spaces, the conjecture is proved when the gauge group is SU(2). Inthe case in which the gauge group is SU(3), we present numerical computationsconfirming the conjecture.
