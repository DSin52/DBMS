We review work done over the last years on the macroscopic and microscopicentropy of supersymmetric black holes in fourdimensional N=2 supergravity andin N=2 compactifications of string theory and M-theory. Particular emphasis isput on the crucial role of higher curvature terms and of modifications of thearea law in obtaining agreement between the macroscopic entropy, which is ageometric property of black hole solutions and the microscopic entropy, whichis computed by state counting in Calabi-Yau compactifications of string orM-theory. We also discuss invariance properties of the entropy under stringyT-duality and S-duality transformations in N=2,4 compactifications in presenceof higher curvature terms.In order to make the paper self-contained we review the laws of black holemechanics in higher derivative gravity, the definition of entropy as a surfacecharge, the superconformal off-shell description of N=2 supergravity, specialgeometry, and N=2 compactifications of heterotic and type II string theory andof M-theory.
