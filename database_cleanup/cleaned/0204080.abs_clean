The evidence for neutrino masses in atmospheric and solar neutrinoexperiments provides further support for the embedding of the Standard Modelfermions in the chiral 16 SO(10) representation. Such an embedding is affordedby the realistic free fermionic heterotic-string models. In this paper weadvance the study of these string models toward a non-perturbative analysis bygeneralizing the work of Donagi, Pantev, Ovrut and Waldram from the case ofG=SU(2n+1) to G=SU(2n) stable holomorphic vector bundles on ellipticallyfibered Calabi-Yau manifolds with fundamental group Z2. We demonstrateexistence of G=SU(4) solutions with three generations and SO(10) observablegauge group over Hirzebruch base surface, whereas we show that certain classesof del Pezzo base surface do not admit such solutions. The SO(10) symmetry isbroken to SU(5)XU(1) by Wilson line. The overlap with the realistic freefermionic heterotic-string models is discussed.
