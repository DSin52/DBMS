This topical review deals with a multidimensional gravitational modelcontaining dilatonic scalar fields and antisymmetric forms. The manifold ischosen in the form M = M_0 x M_1 x ...x M_n, where M_i are Einstein spaces (i>0). The sigma-model approach and exact solutions in the model are reviewed andthe solutions with p-branes (e.g. Majumdar-Papapetrou-type, cosmological,spherically symmetric, black-brane and Freund-Rubin-type ones) are considered.
