The simplest (2+1)-dimensional mechanical systems associated with light-likecurves, already studied by Nersessian and Ramos, are reconsidered. The actionis linear in the curvature of the particle path and the moduli spaces ofsolutions are completely exhibited in 3-dimensional Minkowski background, evenwhen the action is not proportional to the pseudo-arc length of the trajectory.
