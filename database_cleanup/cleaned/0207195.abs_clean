We investigate the consequences of two assumptions for String (or M) Theory,observation, 2) the ``dynamics'' of compactification is determined by the``second law of thermodynamics'', i.e. the principle of entropy. We discuss howthis leads to a phenomenologically consistent scenario for our world, both atthe elementary particle's and at the cosmological level, without any finetuning or further ``ad hoc'' constraint.
