We show that the existence of algebraic forms of exactly-solvable $A-B-C-D$and $G_2, F_4$ Olshanetsky-Perelomov Hamiltonians allow to develop the {\italgebraic} perturbation theory, where corrections are computed by purealgebraic means. A classification of perturbations leading to such aperturbation theory based on representation theory of Lie algebras is given. Inparticular, this scheme admits an explicit study of anharmonic many-bodyproblems. Some examples are presented.
