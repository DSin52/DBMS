Version to bepublished in book form by Leuven University PressIn these lecture notes, an introduction to superstring theory is presented.Classical strings, covariant and light-cone quantization, supersymmetricstrings, anomaly cancelation, compactification, T-duality, supersymmetrybreaking, and threshold corrections to low-energy couplings are discussed. Abrief introduction to non-perturbative duality symmetries is also included.
