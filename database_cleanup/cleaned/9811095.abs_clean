We compute the combined effect of confinement, an external magnetic field andtemperature on the vacuum of the charged scalar field using Schwinger's formulafor the effective action in the imaginary time formalism. The final resultreproduces an effective Lagrangian similar to the Heisenberg-Euler one in thelimit of no confinement, in the case of confinement it provides the necessarycorrections to this Lagrangian at each order of magnitude of the magneticfield. The results show a finite temperature contribution to the vacumpermeability constant apart from the one due to confinement alone.
