Title: A proposal for a first class conversion formalism based on the

symmetries of the Wess-Zumino termsAuthors: J. Ananias Neto, C. Neves and W. Oliveira

Comments: Revised version. Title changed for Gauging by symmetries. To appear

in IJMPAWe propose a new procedure to embed second class systems by introducingWess-Zumino (WZ) fields in order to unveil hidden symmetries existent in themodels. This formalism is based on the direct imposition that the newHamiltonian must be invariant by gauge-symmetry transformations. Aninteresting feature in this approach is the possibility to find arepresentation for the WZ fields in a convenient way, which leads to preservethe gauge symmetry in the original phase space. Consequently, thegauge-invariant Hamiltonian can be written only in terms of the originalphase-space variables. In this situation, the WZ variables are only auxiliarytools that permit to reveal the hidden symmetries present in the originalreduced-SU(2) Skyrme model, the Chern-Simons-Proca quantum mechanics and thechiral bosons field theory. In all these systems, the gauge-invariantHamiltonians are derived in a very simple way.
