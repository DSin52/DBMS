A set of consistency conditions is derived from Einstein equations for braneworld scenarios with a spatially periodic internal space. In particular, thesum of the total tension of the flat branes and the non-negative integral ofthe gradient energy of the bulk scalars must vanish. This constraint allows usto make a simple consistency check of several models. We show that thetwo-brane Randall-Sundrum model satisfies this constraint, but it does notallow a generalization with smooth branes (domain walls), independently of theissue of supersymmetry. The Goldberger-Wise model of brane stabilization has toinclude the backreaction on the metric and the fine tuning of the cosmologicalconstant to satisfy the constraints. We check that this is achieved in theDeWolfe-Freedman-Gubser-Karch scenario. Our constraints are automaticallysatisfied in supersymmetric brane world models.
