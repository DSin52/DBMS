The BRST cohomology of the N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in fourdimensions is discussed by making use of the twisted version of the N=2algebra. By the introduction of a set of suitable constant ghosts associated tothe generators of N=2, the quantization of the model can be done by taking intoaccount both gauge invariance and supersymmetry. In particular, we show how thetwisted N=2 algebra can be used to obtain in a straightforward way the relevantcohomology classes. Moreover, we shall be able to establish a very usefulrelationship between the local gauge invariant polynomial $tr\phi^2$ and thecomplete N=2 Yang-Mills action. This important relation can be considered asthe first step towards a fully algebraic proof of the one-loop exactness of theN=2 beta function.
