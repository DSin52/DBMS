We present evidence that there is a 4D model that satisfies the conditions ofrenormalizability and diffeomorphism invariance simultaneously at the 2-looplevel. The traceless mode is treated perturbatively, while the conformal modecan be managed exactly. The two conditions constrain the theory strongly anddetermine the measure of the gravitational field uniquely. Quantum correctionsof the cosmological constant are computed in part to 3-loop diagrams. Themethod to remove the negative-metric states is also discussed from theviewpoint of diffeomorphism invariance in analogy to the $R_{\xi}$ gauge inspontaneously broken gauge theory. The model may be a candidate for a continuumversion of 4D simplicial quantum geometry realized in recent numericalsimulations.
