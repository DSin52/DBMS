It has recently been shown that the Field Antifield quantization of anomalousirreducible gauge theories with closed algebra can be represented in a BRSTsuperspace where the quantum action at one loop order, including the WessZumino term, and the anomalies show up as components of the same superfield.We show here how the Chiral Schwinger model can be represented in thisformulation.
