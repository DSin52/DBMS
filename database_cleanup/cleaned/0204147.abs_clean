We consider N=2 moose/quiver gauge theories corresponding to N_1 D3-branes ata C^2/Z_{N_2} singularity in the ``large moose'' limit where N_1 and N_2 arescaled to infinity together. In the dual holographic description, this scalinggives rise to a maximally supersymmetric pp-wave background with a compactlight-cone direction. We identify the gauge theory operators that describe theDiscrete Light-Cone Quantization (DLCQ) of the string in this background. Foreach discrete light-cone momentum and winding sector there is a separate groundstate and Fock space. The large moose/quiver diagram provides a usefulgraphical representation of the string and its excitations. This representationhas a natural explanation in a T-dual language. The dual theory is anon-relativistic type IIA string wound around the T-dual direction, and boundby a quadratic Newtonian potential. We end with some comments onD-string/D-particle states, a possible lift to M-theory and the relation todeconstruction.
