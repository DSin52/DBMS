In recent years it has been shown that many, and possibly all, integrablesystems can be obtained by dimensional reduction of self-dual Yang-Mills. Ishow how the integrable systems obtained this way naturally inheritbihamiltonian structure. I also present a simple, gauge-invariant formulationof the self-dual Yang-Mills hierarchy proposed by several authors, and Idiscuss the notion of gauge equivalence of integrable systems that arises fromthe gauge invariance of the self-duality equations (and their hierarchy); thisnotion of gauge equivalence may well be large enough to unify the many diverseexisting notions.
