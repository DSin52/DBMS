Title: Introduction to Supersymmetric Gauge Theories

Authors: Olivier Piguet

Comments: 33 pages, latex, no figures

In these lectures I present a basic introduction to supersymmetry, especiallyto N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories and their renormalization, in theWess-Zumino gauge. I also discuss the various ways supersymmetry may be brokenin order to account for the lack of exact supersymmetry in the actual world ofelementary particles.
