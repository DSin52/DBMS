Title: Partially embedding of the quantum mechanical analog of the nonlinear

sigma modelComments: 9 pages, Revtex (multicol), revised and enlarged version

We consider the quantum mechanical analog of the nonlinear sigma model. Thereare difficulties to completely embed this theory by directly using the Batalin,Fradkin, Fradkina, and Tyutin (BFFT) formalism. We show in this paper how theBFFT method can be conveniently adapted in order to achieve a gauge theory thatpartially embeds the model.
