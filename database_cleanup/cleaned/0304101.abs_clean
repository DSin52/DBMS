In this paper we recall the construction of Doubly Special Relativity (DSR)as a theory with energy-momentum space being the four dimensional de Sitterspace. Then the bases of the DSR theory can be understood as differentcoordinate systems on this space. We investigate the emerging geometricalpicture of Doubly Special Relativity by presenting the basis independentfeatures of DSR that include the non-commutative structure of space-time andthe phase space algebra. Next we investigate the relation between our geometricformulation and the one based on quantum $\kappa$-deformations of thePoincar\'e algebra. Finally we re-derive the five-dimensional differentialcalculus using the geometric method, and use it to write down the deformedKlein-Gordon equation and to analyze its plane wave solutions.
