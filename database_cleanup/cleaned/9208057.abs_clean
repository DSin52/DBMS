Title: Affine Toda Solitons and Automorphisms of Dynkin Diagrams

Comments: 21 pages

SystemsUsing Hirota's method, solitons are constructed for affine Toda fieldtheories based on the simply-laced affine algebras. By consideringautomorphisms of the simply-laced Dynkin diagrams, solutions to the remainingalgebras, twisted as well as untwisted, are deduced.
