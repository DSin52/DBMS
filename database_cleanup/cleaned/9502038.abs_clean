We consider a new 3-parameter class of exact 4-dimensional solutions inclosed string theory and solve the corresponding string model, determining thephysical spectrum and the partition function. The background fields (4-metric,antisymmetric tensor, two Kaluza-Klein vector fields, dilaton and modulus)generically describe axially symmetric stationary rotating (electro)magneticflux-tube type universes. Backgrounds of this class include both the dilatonic(a=1) and Kaluza-Klein (a=\sqrt 3) Melvin solutions and the uniform magneticfield solution, as well as some singular space-times. Solvability of the stringsigma model is related to its connection via duality to a simpler model whichis a ``twisted" product of a flat 2-space and a space dual to 2-plane. Wediscuss some physical properties of this model (tachyonic instabilities in thespectrum, gyromagnetic ratios, issue of singularities, etc.). It provides oneof the first examples of a consistent solvable conformal string model withexplicit D=4 curved space-time interpretation.
