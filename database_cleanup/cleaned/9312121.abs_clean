Using a duality between the space of particles and the space of fields, weshow how one can compute form factors directly in the space of fields. Thisintroduces the notion of vertex operators, and form factors are vacuumexpectation values of such vertex operators in the space of fields. The vertexoperators can be constructed explicitly in radial quantization. Furthermore,these vertex operators can be exactly bosonized in momentum space. We developthese ideas by studying the free-fermion point of the sine-Gordon theory, anduse this scheme to compute some form-factors of some non-free fields in thesine-Gordon theory. This work further clarifies earlier work of one of theauthors, and extends it to include the periodic sector.
