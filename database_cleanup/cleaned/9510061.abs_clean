Title: Linearization of W algebras and W superalgebras

(one extra reference added)Comments: 23 pages, LaTex

In a recent paper, the authors have shown that the secondary reduction ofW-algebras provides a natural framework for the linearization of W-algebras. Inparticular, it allows in a very simple way the calculation of the linearalgebra $W(G,H)_{\geq0}$ associated to a wide class of W(G,H) algebras, as wellas the expression of the W generators of W(G,H) in terms of the generators of$W(G,H)_{\geq0}$. In this paper, we present the extension of the abovetechnique to W-superalgebras, i.e. W-algebras containing fermions and bosons ofarbitrary (positive) spins. To be self-contained the paper recall thelinearization of W-algebras. We include also examples such as the linearizationof W_n algebras; W(sl(3|1),sl(3)) and W(osp(1|4),sp(4)) = WB_2 superalgebras.
