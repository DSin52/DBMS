Strassler's formulation of the string-derived Bern-Kosower formalism isreconsidered with particular emphasis on effective actions and form factors.Two- and three point form factors in the nonabelian effective action arecalculated and compared with those obtained in the heat kernel approach ofBarvinsky, Vilkovisky et al. We discuss the Fock-Schwinger gauge and propose amanifestly covariant calculational scheme for one-loop effective actions ingauge theory.
