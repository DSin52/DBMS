Different BPS M-brane configurations including single and two parallelM$p$-branes ($p$= even) and M5-branes are introduced as the classical solutionsof the recently proposed Static Matrix Model. Also the long range interactionsof two relatively rotated M$p$-branes (one and two angles) andM$p$-brane--anti-M$p$-brane are calculated. The results are in agreement with11 dimensional supergravity results.
