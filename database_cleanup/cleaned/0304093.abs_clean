We propose that the euclidean bilocal collective field theory of criticallarge-N vector models provides a complete definition of the proposed dualtheory of higher spin fields in anti de-Sitter spaces. We show how this bilocalfield can be decomposed into an infinite number of even spin fields in one moredimension. The collective field has a nontrivial classical solution which leadsto a O(N) thermodynamic entropy characteristic of the lower dimensional theory,as required by general considerations of holography. A subtle cancellation ofthe entropy coming from the bulk fields in one higher dimension with O(1)contributions from the classical solution ensures that the subleading terms inthermodynamic quantities are of the expected form. While the spin components ofthe collective field transform properly under dilatational, translational androtational isometries of $AdS$, special conformal transformations mix fields ofdifferent spins indicating a need for a nonlocal map between the two sets offields. We discuss the nature of the propagating degrees of freedom through ahamiltonian form of collective field theory and argue that nonsinglet stateswhich are present in an euclidean version are related to nontrivialbackgrounds.
