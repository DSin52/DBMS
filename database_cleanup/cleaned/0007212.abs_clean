Tadpole cancellation in F-theory on an elliptic Calabi-Yau fourfold $X\toB_3$ demands some spacetime-filling three-branes (points in $B_3$). If moved tothe discriminant surface, which supports the gauge group, and dissolved into afinite size instanton, the second Chern class of the corresponding bundle $E$is expected to give a compensating contribution. However the dependence ofa correction to $c_2(E)$. We show how this is reconciled by considering thetorsion sheaf $i_*E$ and discuss some integrality issues related to globalproperties of $X$ as well as the moduli space of this object.
