It is frequently useful to construct dual descriptions of theories containingantisymmetric tensor fields by introducing a new potential whose curl gives thedual field strength, thereby interchanging field equations with Bianchiidentities. We describe a general procedure for constructing actions containingboth potentials at the same time, such that the dual relationship of the fieldstrengths arises as an equation of motion. The price for doing this is thesacrifice of manifest Lorentz invariance or general coordinate invariance,though both symmetries can be realized nonetheless. There are various examplesof global symmetries that have been realized as symmetries of field equationsbut not actions. These can be elevated to symmetries of the action by ourmethod. The main example that we focus on is the low-energy effective actiondescription of the heterotic string theory compactified on a six-torus to fourdimensions. We show that the SL(2,R) symmetry, whose SL(2,Z) subgroup has beenconjectured to be an exact symmetry of the full string theory, can be realizedon the action in a way that brings out a remarkable similarity to the targetspace duality symmetry O(6,22). Our analysis indicates that SL(2,Z) symmetrymay arise naturally in a dual formulation of the theory.
