We discuss the use of derivative expansion techniques for the construction ofthermal effective potentials. We present a theory for which the thermal bubbleis analytic at the origin of the momentum-frequency space, although theinternal propagators in the loop have the same mass. This means that, for thistheory, the thermal effective potential is uniquely defined. We then examine aslightly different theory for which the thermal bubble displays the usualnon-analyticity at the origin and the thermal effective potential is notuniquely defined. For this latter theory we compare our results with those ofother works in the literature which employ the derivative expansion but find auniquely defined thermal effective potential. We raise several questionsconcerning the interchange of the order of the perturbative and the derivativeexpansions, the thermal generalization of some non-perturbative zerotemperature methods and the use of the periodicity of the external bosonicfield. Finally, we re-examine the physical interpretation given to theimaginary part of the thermal bubble in the literature.
