Quantum canonical transformations are defined algebraically outside of aHilbert space context. This generalizes the quantum canonical transformationsof Weyl and Dirac to include non-unitary transformations. The importance ofnon-unitary transformations for constructing solutions of the Schr\"odingerequation is discussed. Three elementary canonical transformations are shownboth to have quantum implementations as finite transformations and to generate,classically and infinitesimally, the full canonical algebra. A generalcanonical transformation can be realized quantum mechanically as a product ofthese transformations. Each transformation corresponds to a familiar tool usedin solving differential equations, and the procedure of solving a differentialequation is systematized by the use of the canonical transformations. Severalexamples are done to illustrate the use of the canonical transformations. [Thispaper is new material; the notation has been simplified, and further discussionhas been added to the remainder.]
