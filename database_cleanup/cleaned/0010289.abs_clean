We discuss the stability of vacua in two-dimensional gauge theory for anysimple, simply connected gauge group. Making use of the representation of avacuum in terms of a Wilson line at infinity, we determine which vacua arestable against pair production of heavy matter in the adjoint of the gaugegroup. By calculating correlators of Wilson loops, we reduce the problem to aproblem in representation theory of Lie groups, that we solve in fullgenerality.
