We analyse the noncommutative U(1) sigma model, which arises from the vacuumdynamics of the noncommutative charged tachyonic field. The sector of``spherically symmetric'' excitations of the model is equivalent to a chain ofrotators. Classical solutions for this model are found, which are static and``spherically symmetric'' in noncommutative spatial dimensions. The limit ofsmall noncommutativity reveals the presence of Polyakov vortices in the model.A generalisation of the model to q-deformed space, which may serve as aregularisation of the non-deformed model is also considered.
