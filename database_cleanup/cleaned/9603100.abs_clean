We present the most general rotating black hole solution of five-dimensionalN=4 superstring vacua that conforms to the ``no hair theorem''. It is chosen tobe parameterized in terms of massless fields of the toroidally compactifiedheterotic string. The solutions are obtained by performing a subset of O(8,24)transformations, i.e., symmetry transformations of the effectivethree-dimensional action for stationary solutions, on the five-dimensional(neutral) rotating solution parameterized by the mass m and two rotationalparameters $l_1$ and $l_2$. The explicit form of the generating solution isdetermined by three $SO(1,1)\subset O(8,24)$ boosts, which specify two electriccharges $Q_1^{(1)}, Q_{2}^{(2)}$ of the Kaluza-Klein and two-form U(1) gaugefields associated with the same compactified direction, and the charge Q(electric charge of the vector field, whose field strength is dual to the fieldstrength of the five-dimensional two-form field). The general solution,parameterized by 27 charges, two rotational parameters and the ADM masscompatible with the Bogomol'nyi bound, is obtained by imposing $[SO(5)\timesSO(21)]/[SO(4)\times SO(20)]\subset O(5,21)$ transformations, which do notaffect the five-dimensional space-time. We also analyze the deviations from theBPS-saturated limit.
