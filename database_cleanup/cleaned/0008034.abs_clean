We construct static axially symmetric black holes in SU(2)Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. Located in between a monopole-antimonopolepair, these black holes possess magnetic dipole hair. The difference of theirmass and their horizon mass equals the mass of the regularmonopole-antimonopole solution, as expected from the isolated horizonframework.
