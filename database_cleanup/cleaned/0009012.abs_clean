Authors: Juan Ospina

Using y-deformed algebraic geometric techniques the y-deformed Mukay vectorof RR-charges of the y-deformed BPS Dp-branes localized on a surface in aCalabi-Yau threefold. The formulas that are obtained here are generalizationsof the formulas of the fourth section of the preprint hep-th/0007243 .
