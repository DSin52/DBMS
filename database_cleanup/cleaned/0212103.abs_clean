In this paper we study half-supersymmetric (D6,D8) bound state braneconfiguration of massive type IIA supergravity. We show that this bound statecan also be generated by using massive T-duality rules of type-IIsupergravities in D=9, starting from D7-branes. We write down correspondingKilling spinors and find that these backgrounds indeed preserve 16supersymmetries like any other D$p$-brane bound state with $B$-field. We alsomake a point on the massive nature of the $B$-field in this background. TheSeiberg-Witten limits to obtain 9-dimensional NCYMs are also discussed, but thefull understanding of such gauge theories remains unanswered.
