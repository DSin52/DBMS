We present finite energy analytic monopole and dyon solutions whose size isfixed by the electroweak scale. The new solutions are obtained by regularizingthe recent Cho-Maison solutions of the Weinberg-Salam model. Our result showsthat genuine electroweak monopole and dyon could exist whose mass scale is muchsmaller than the grand unification scale.
