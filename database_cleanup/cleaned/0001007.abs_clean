Authors: Sheng Li, Yong Zhang and Zhongyuan Zhu

Comments: 9 pages, Revtex

By making use of the complete decomposition of SO(3) spin connection, thetopological defect in 3-dimensional Euclidean gravity is studied in detail. Thetopological structure of disclination is given as the combination of a monopolestructure and a vortex structure. Furthermore, the Kac-Moody algebra generatedby the monopole and vortex is discussed in three dimensional Chern-Simonstheory.
