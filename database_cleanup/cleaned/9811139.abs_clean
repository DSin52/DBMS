We show that a set of parallel 3-brane probes near a conifold singularity canbe mapped onto a configuration of intersecting branes in type IIA stringtheory. The field theory on the probes can be explicitly derived from thisformulation. The intersecting-brane metric for our model is obtained usingvarious dualities and related directly to the conifold metric. The M-theorylimit of this model is derived and turns out to be remarkably simple. Theglobal symmetries and counting of moduli are interpreted in the M-theorypicture.
