Supersymmetric closed string theories contain an infinite tower ofBPS-saturated, oscillating, macroscopic strings in the perturbative spectrum.When these theories have dual formulations, this tower of states must existnonperturbatively as solitons in the dual theories. We present a general classof exact solutions of low-energy supergravity that corresponds to all thesestates. After dimensional reduction they can be interpreted as supersymmetricblack holes with a degeneracy related to the degeneracy of the string states.{}For example, in four dimensions we obtain a point-like solution which isasymptotic to a stationary, rotating, electrically-charged black hole withRegge-bounded angular momentum and with the usual ring-singularity replaced bya string source. This further supports the idea that the entropy ofsupersymmetric black holes can be understood in terms of counting of stringstates. We also discuss some applications of these solutions to string duality.
