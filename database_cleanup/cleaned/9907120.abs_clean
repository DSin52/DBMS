The non-renormalization theorems of chiral vertex functions are derived onthe basis of an algebraic analysis. The property, that the interaction vertexis a second supersymmetry variation of a lower dimensional field monomial, isused to relate chiral Green functions to superficially convergent Greenfunctions by extracting the two supersymmetry variations from an internalvertex and transforming them to derivatives acting on external legs. Theanalysis is valid in the massive as well as in the massless model and can beperformed irrespective of properties of the superpotential at vanishingmomentum.
