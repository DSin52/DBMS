Title: Algebraic-geometrical n-orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems and

solutions to the associativity equationsComments: 25 pages, Latex

Algebraic-geometrical n-orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems in a flatspace are constructed. They are expressed in terms of the Riemann thetafunction of auxiliary algebraic curves. The exact formulae for the potentialsof algebraic geometrical Egoroff metrics and the partition functions of thecorresponding topological field theories are obtained.
