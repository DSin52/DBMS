We investigate a bifurcation of periodic instanton in Euclideanaction-temperature diagram in quantum mechanical models. It is analyticallyshown that multiple zero modes of fluctuation operator should be arised atbifurcation points. This fact is used to derive a condition for the appearanceof bifurcation points in action-temperature diagram. This condition enables oneto compute the number of bifurcation points for a given quantum mechanicalsystem and hence, to understand the whole behaviour of decay rate. It isexplicitly shown that the previous criterion derived by nonlinear perturbationor negative-mode consideration is special limit of our case.
