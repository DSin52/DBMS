We study the finite theta correction to the metric of the moduli space ofnoncommutative multi-solitons in scalar field theory in (2+1) dimensions. Bysolving the equation of motion up to order O(theta^{-2}) explicitly, we showthat the multi-soliton solution must have the same center for a genericpotential term. We examine the condition that the multi-centered configurationsare allowed. Under this condition, we calculate the finite theta correction tothe metric of the moduli space of multi-solitons and argue the possibility ofthe non right-angle scattering of two solitons. We also obtain the potentialbetween two solitons.
