The moving mirror model is designed to extract essential features of theblack hole formation and the subsequent Hawking radiation by neglectingcomplication due to a finite curvature. We extend this approach to dynamicallytreat back reaction against the mirror motion due to Hawking radiation. It isfound that a unique model in two spacetime dimensions exists in which Hawkingradiation completely stops and the end point of evaporation contains adisconnected remnant. When viewed from asymptotic observers at one side of thespacetime, quantum mechanical correlation is recovered in the end. Although thethermal stage accompanying short range correlation may last for an arbitrarilylong period, at a much longer time scale a long tail of non-thermal correlationis clearly detected.
