We introduce a new type of cluster expansion which generalizes a previousformula of Brydges and Kennedy. The method is especially suited for performinga phase-space multiscale expansion in a just renormalizable theory, and allowsthe writing of explicit non-perturbative formulas for the Schwinger functions.The procedure is quite model independent, but for simplicity we chose theinfrared $\ph^4_4$ model as a testing ground. We used also a large field versussmall field expansion. The polymer amplitudes, corresponding to graphs withoutalmost local two and for point functions, are shown to satisfy the polymerbound.
