The IKKT matrix model was proposed to be a non-perturbative formulation oftype IIB superstring theory. One of its important consistency criteria is thatthe leading one-loop $1/r^8$ effective interaction between a cluster of typeIIB D-objects should not receive any corrections from higher loop effects forit to describe accurately the type IIB supergravity results. In analogy withthe BFSS matrix model {\it versus} the eleven-dimensional supergravity example,we show in this work that the one-loop effective potential in the IKKT matrixmodel is also not renormalized at the two-loop order.
