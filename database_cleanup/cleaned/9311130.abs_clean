Title: Conformal Field Theory Techniques in Large N Yang-Mills Theory

Authors: Michael R. Douglas

Comments: 18 pp. (LaTeX)

Following some motivating comments on large N two-dimensional Yang-Millstheory, we discuss techniques for large N group representation theory, usingquantum mechanics on the group manifold U(N), its equivalence to aquasirelativistic two-dimensional free fermion theory, and bosonization. Asapplications, we compute the free energy for two-dimensional Yang-Mills theoryon the torus to O(1/N^2), and an interesting approximation to the leadinganswer for the sphere. We discuss the question of whether the free energy forthe torus has R -> 1/R invariance. A substantially revised version ofhep-th/9303159 with many new results.
