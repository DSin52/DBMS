examples, the KAW and grand hierarchiesRecently, a class of interaction round the face (IRF) solvable lattice modelswere introduced, based on any rational conformal field theory (RCFT). Weinvestigate here the connection between the general solvable IRF models and thefusion ones. To this end, we introduce an associative algebra associated to anygraph, as the algebra of products of the eigenvalues of the incidence matrix.If a model is based on an RCFT, its associated graph algebra is the fusion ringof the RCFT. A number of examples are studied. The Gordon--generalized IRFmodels are studied, and are shown to come from RCFT, by the graph algebraconstruction. The IRF models based on the Dynkin diagrams of A-D-E are studied.While the $A$ case stems from an RCFT, it is shown that the $D-E$ cases do not.The graph algebras are constructed, and it is speculated that a naturalisomorphism relating these to RCFT exists. The question whether all solvableIRF models stems from an RCFT remains open, though the $D-E$ cases shows that amixing of the primary fields is needed.
