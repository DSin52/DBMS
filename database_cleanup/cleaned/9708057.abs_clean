iterative solution at any order of the superconformal Ward identity and we showthat this solution is resumed by the Wess-Zumino-Polyakov (WZP) action thatdescribes the $(1,0)$ 2D-supergravity. The resolution of the superBeltramiequation for the Wess-Zumino (WZ) field is done by using on the one hand theCauchy kernel defined on $ST_2$ and on the other hand, the formalism developedto get the general solution on the supercomplex plane. Hence, we determine then-points Green functions from the (WZP) action expressed in terms of the (WZ)field.
