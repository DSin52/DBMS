We construct the family of spin chain Hamiltonians, which have affine $U_q g$guantum group symmetry. Their eigenvalues coincides with the eigenvalues of theusual spin chain Hamiltonians which have non-affine $U_q g_0$ quantum groupsymmetry, but have the degeneracy of levels, corresponding to affine $U_q g$.The space of states of these chaines are formed by the tensor product of thefully reducible representations.
