We consider a $(3+1)$-dimensional QCD model using a dual supergravitydescription with a non-extremal $D0$-$D4$ brane background. We calculate thespectrum of glueball masses and Wilson loops in the background. The massspectrum is shown to coincide with one in non-extremal $D4$-brane systems, andan area low of spatial Wilson loops is established. We show that there is aregion that Kaluza-Klein modes of the Euclidean time direction are decoupledwithout decoupling glueball masses.
