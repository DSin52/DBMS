Title: A note on the dyonic D6-brane

Authors: Cesar Gomez and Juan Jose Manjarin

Comments: 8 pages, Contribution to the 6th International Workshop on Conformal

Field Theory and Integrable Models, Landau Institute, Sept. 2002, to honourA. Belavin on the occasion of his 60th birthdayWe study the dyon electric charge of D6-branes as eleven dimensionalKK-monopoles. We observe that the dyon charge is intimately related with theexistence of gauge connections and antisymmetric fields on the brane worldvolume.
