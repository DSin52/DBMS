We study the propagations of gravitational wave and D-particle on D6-braneand orientifold 6-plane backgrounds in the M-theory framework. In the case oforientifold plane, D-particle number is not conserved and gravitational wavecan convert into D-particle. For the simplest case, we calculate its amplitudenumerically.
