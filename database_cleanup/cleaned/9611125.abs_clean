It has been observed recently that many properties of some near extremalblack holes can be described in terms of bound states of D-branes. Using anon-renormalization theorem we argue that the D-brane description is thecorrect quantum gravity description of the black hole at low energies. The lowenergy theory includes the black hole degrees of freedom that account for theentropy and describes also Hawking radiation. The description is unitary andthere seems to be no information loss at low energies.
