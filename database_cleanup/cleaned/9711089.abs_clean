We show that six-dimensional supergravity coupled to tensor and Yang-Millsmultiplets admits not one but two different theories as global limits, one ofwhich was previously thought not to arise as a global limit and the other ofwhich is new. The new theory has the virtue that it admits a globalanti-self-dual string solution obtained as the limit of the curved-space gaugedyonic string, and can, in particular, describe tensionless strings. Wespeculate that this global model can also represent the worldvolume theory ofcoincident branes. We also discuss the Bogomol'nyi bounds of the gauge dyonicstring and show that, contrary to expectations, zero eigenvalues of theBogomol'nyi matrix do not lead to enhanced supersymmetry and that negativetension does not necessarily imply a naked singularity.
