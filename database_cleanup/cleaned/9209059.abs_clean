$N=2$ coset models of the type $SU(m+1)/SU(m)\times U(1)$ with nondiagonalmodular invariants for both $SU(m+1)$ and $SU(m)$ are considered. Poincar\'epolynomials of the corresponding chiral rings of these algebras areconstructed. They are used to compute the number of chiral generations of theassociated string compactifications. Moddings by discrete symmetries are alsodiscussed.
