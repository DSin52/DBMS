In this paper we further elaborate on the notion of fractional exclusionstatistics, as introduced by Haldane, in two-dimensional conformal fieldtheory, and its connection to the Universal Chiral Partition Function asdefined by McCoy and collaborators. We will argue that in general, besides thepseudo-particles introduced recently by Guruswamy and Schoutens, one needsadditional `null quasi-particles' to account for the null-states in thequasi-particle Fock space. We illustrate this in several examples ofWZW-models.
