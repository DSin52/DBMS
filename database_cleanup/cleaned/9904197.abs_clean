The physical properties of Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in(n+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime are related, by a holographic map,to the physics of a class of n-dimensional field theories coupled to abackground global current. Motivated by that fact, and the recent observationsof the striking similarity between the thermodynamic phase structure of theseblack holes (in the canonical ensemble) and that of the van der Waals-Maxwellliquid-gas system, we explore the physics in more detail. We study fluctuationsand stability within the equilibrium thermodynamics, examining the specificheats and electrical permittivity of the holes, and consider the analogue ofthe Clayperon equation at the phase boundaries. Consequently, we refine thephase diagrams in the canonical and grand canonical ensembles. We study theinteresting physics in the neighbourhood of the critical point in the canonicalensemble. There is a second order phase transition found there, and that regionis characterized by a Landau-Ginzburg model with A_3 potential. Theholographically dual field theories provide the description of the microscopicdegrees of freedom which underlie all of the thermodynamics, as can be seen byexamining the form of the microscopic fluctuations.
