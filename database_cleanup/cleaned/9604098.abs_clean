Title: A New RSOS Restriction of the Zhiber-Mikhailov-Shabat Model and

$\Phi_{(1,5)}$ Perturbations of Nonunitary Minimal ModelsComments: several typos corrected; error in (3,14) S-matrix found and

The RSOS restriction of the Zhiber-Mikhailov-Shabat (ZMS) model isinvestigated. It is shown that in addition to the usual RSOS restriction,corresponding to $\Phi_{(1,2)}$ and $\Phi_{(2,1)}$ perturbations of minimalCFT, there is another one which yields $\Phi_{(1,5)}$ perturbations ofnon-unitary minimal models. The new RSOS restriction is carried out and theparticular case of the minimal models ${\cal M}_{(3,10)}$, ${\cal M}_{(3,14)}$and ${\cal M}_{(3,16)}$ is discussed in detail. In the first two cases, whilethe mass spectra of the two RSOS restrictions are the same, the bootstrapsystems and the detailed amplitudes are different. In the third case, even thespectra of the two RSOS restrictions are different. In addition, for ${\calM}_{(3,10)}$ an interpretation in terms of the tensor product of two copies of${\cal M}_{(2,5)}$ is given.
