It is shown that self-dual theories generalize to four dimensions both theconformal and analytic aspects of two-dimensional conformal field theories. Inthe harmonic space language there appear several ways to extend complexanalyticity (natural in two dimensions) to quaternionic analyticity (natural infour dimensions). To be analytic, conformal transformations should be realizedon $CP^3$, which appears as the coset of the complexified conformal groupmodulo its maximal parabolic subgroup. In this language one visualizes thetwistor correspondence of Penrose and Ward and consistently formulates theanalyticity of Fueter.
