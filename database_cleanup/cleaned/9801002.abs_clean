Using a six-orientifold on top of a NS-fivebrane we construct a chiral N=1supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions with gauge group SU(N_c) andmatter in the symmetric, antisymmetric and (anti)fundamental representations.Anomaly cancellation is fulfilled by the requirement of a smooth RR 7-formcharge distribution and leads us to the introduction of 8 half D-sixbranesending on the NS-fivebrane. We obtain the dual model from branes by a linkingnumber argument. We check explicitly the 't Hooft anomaly matching conditionsand the map between deformations in the original and the dual model.
