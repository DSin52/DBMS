This is a short note on the relation of the Matrix model with thenon-commutative geometry of the 11-dimensional supermembrane. We put forwardthe idea that M-theory is described by the 't Hooft topological expansion ofthe Matrix model in the large N-limit where all topologies of membranes appear.This expansion can faithfully be represented by the Moyal Yang-Mills theory ofmembranes. We discuss this conjecture in the case of finite N, where thenon-commutative geometry of the membrane is given be the finite quantummechanics. The use of the finite dimensional representations of the Heisenberggroup reveals the cellular structure of a toroidal supermembrane on which theMatrix model appears as a non-commutatutive Yang-Mills theory. The Moyal starproduct on the space of functions in the case of rational values of the Planckconstant \hbar represents exactly this cellular structure. We also discuss theintegrability of the instanton sector as well as the topological charge and thecorresponding Bogomol'nyi bound.
