The current status of bounds on and limits of fermion determinants in two,three and four dimensions in QED and QCD is reviewed. A new lower bound on thetwo-dimensional QED determinant is derived. An outline of the demonstration ofthe continuity of this determinant at zero mass when the background magneticfield flux is zero is also given.
