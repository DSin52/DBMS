In the large N limit, conditions for the conformal invariance of thebackground field method and the Hamiltonian method based on an operatoralgebra, and the agreement between them is established. A free fieldrepresentation of the relevant algebra is presented, and the structure of thestress tensor in terms of free fields (and free currents) is studied in detail.
