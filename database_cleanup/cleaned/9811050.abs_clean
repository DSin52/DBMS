The instanton contributions to the partition function and to homologicallytrivial Wilson loops for a U(N) Yang-Mills theory on a torus $T^2$ areanalyzed. An exact expression for the partition function is obtained as a sumof contributions localized around the classical solutions of Yang-Millsequations, that appear according to the general classification of Atiyah andBott. Explicit expressions for the exact Wilson loop averages are obtained whenN=2, N=3. For general $N$ the contribution of the zero-instanton sector hasbeen carefully derived in the decompactification limit, reproducing the sum ofthe perturbative series on the plane, in which the light-cone gauge Yang-Millspropagator is prescribed according to Wu-Mandelstam-Leibbrandt (WML). Agreementwith the results coming from $S^2$ is therefore obtained, confirming the trulyperturbative nature of the WML computations.
