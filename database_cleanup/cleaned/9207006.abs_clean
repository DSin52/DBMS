We study canonical quantization of a class of 2d dilaton gravity models,which contains the model proposed by Callan, Giddings, Harvey and Strominger. Aset of non-canonical phase space variables is found, forming an $SL(2,{\bf R})\times U(1)$ current algebra, such that the constraints become quadratic inthese new variables. In the case when the spatial manifold is compact, thecorresponding quantum theory can be solved exactly, since it reduces to aproblem of finding the cohomology of a free-field Virasoro algebra. In thenon-compact case, which is relevant for 2d black holes, this construction islikely to break down, since the most general field configuration cannot beexpanded into Fourier modes. Strategy for circumventing this problem isdiscussed.
