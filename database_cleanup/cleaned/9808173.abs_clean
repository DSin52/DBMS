Starting from the Kac--Moody structure of the WZNW model for SL(2,R) andusing the general canonical formalism, we formulate a gauge theory invariantunder local SL(2,R) x SL(2,R) and diffeomorphisms. This theory represents agauge extension of the WZNW system, defined by a difference of two simple WZNWactions. By performing a partial gauge fixing and integrating out somedynamical variables, we prove that the resulting effective theory coincideswith the induced gravity in 2D. The geometric properties of the induced gravityare obtained out of the gauge properties of the WZNW system with the help ofthe Dirac bracket formalism.
