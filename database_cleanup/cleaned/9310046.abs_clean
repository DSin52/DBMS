We calculate two- and three-point tachyon amplitudes of the SL(2,R)/U(1)two-dimensional Euclidean black hole for spherical topologies in the continuumapproach proposed by Bershadsky and Kutasov. We find an interesting relation tothe tachyon scattering amplitudes of standard non-critical string theory.
