Title: Comments, Questions and Proposal of a Topological M(atrix) Theory

Comments: 23 pages, RevTex, typos fixed, D=9 and D=8 cases added and a section

on the origin of chemical potential term addedKeeping in mind the several models of M(atrix) theory we attempt tounderstand the possible structure of the topological M(atrix) theory``underlying'' these approaches. In particular we raise the issue about thenature of the structure of the vacuum of the topological M(atrix) theory andhow this could be related to the vacuum of the electroweak theory. In doing sowe are led to a simple Topological Matrix Model. Moreover it is expected fromthe current understanding that the noncommutative nature of ``spacetime'' andbackground independence should lead to Topological Model. The main purpose ofthis note is to propose a simple Topological Matrix Model which bears relationto F and M theories. Suggestions on the origin of the chemical potential termappearing in the matrix models are given.
