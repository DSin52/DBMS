General Relativity reduced to two dimensions possesses a large group ofsymmetries that exchange classical solutions. The associated Lie algebra isknown to contain the affine Kac-Moody algebra $A_1^{(1)}$ and half of a realWitt algebra. In this paper we exhibit the full symmetry under the semi-directproduct of $\Lie{A_1^{(1)}}$ by the Witt algebra $\Lie{\Wir}$. Furthermore weexhibit the corresponding hidden gauge symmetries. We show that the theory canbe understood in terms of an infinite dimensional potential space involving alldilaton sector the linear system that extends the previously known Lax pair hasthe form of a twisted self-duality constraint that is the analog of theself-duality constraint arising in extended supergravities in higher spacetimedimensions. Our results furnish a group theoretical explanation for thesimultaneous occurrence of two spectral parameters, a constant one ($=y$) and avariable one ($=t$). They hold for all $2d$ non-linear $\sigma$-models that areobtained by dimensional reduction of $G/H$ models in three dimensions coupledto pure gravity. In that case the Lie algebra is $\Lie{\Wir \semi G^{(1)}}$;this symmetry acts on a set of off shell fields (in a fixed gauge) andpreserves the equations of motion.
