We study the black hole shape using the C-metric solution for a mattertrapped near the IR-brane in the ${AdS}_4$ space. In the AdS/CFT duality, theIR-brane is introduced by embedding a 2-brane at the ${AdS}_4$ radius $z=l$,while the UV-brane is defined by the ${AdS}_4$ boundary. We find the C-metricsolution generates a negative tension IR-brane and a negative thermal energygas of colliding particles. We analyze the momentum energy tensor at the${AdS}_4$ boundary. We find that the negative energy black hole solution isentirely unstable even for a small perturbation in the Poincare coordinatespace. However, such a black hole decays very rapidly due to the imaginary partemerges in the ADM mass. This imaginary part appears because of the orbifoldconstraints of the C-metric solution in the unusual coordinates. Moreover, thisdecay rate diverges at the UV-brane. This implies that the black holeevaporates instantaneously otherwise the boundary itself will collapse.
