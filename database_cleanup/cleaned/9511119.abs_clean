Title: Global issues in gauge fixing

Comments: 19p with 7 figs, uufiles -gz format. Talk at the ECT* workshop

"Non-perturbative approaches to QCD", July 10-29, 1995, Trento, ItalyWe review the global issues associated to gauge fixing ambiguities and theirconsequence for glueball spectroscopy. To avoid infrared singularities thetheory is formulated in a finite volume. The examples of a cubic and sphericalgeometry will be discussed in some detail. Our methods are not powerful enoughto study the infinite volume limit, but the results clearly indicate that forlow-lying states, wave functionals are sensitive to global gauge copies whichwe will argue is equivalent to saying that they are sensitive to the geometricand topological features of configuration space.
