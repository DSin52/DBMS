Title: Conformal field theory

Comments: 55 pages, LaTex, 21 figures

This is a set of introductory lecture notes devoted to the Wess-Zumino-Wittenmodel of two-dimensional conformal field theory. We review the construction ofthe exact solution of the model from the functional integral point of view. Theboundary version of the theory is also briefly discussed.
