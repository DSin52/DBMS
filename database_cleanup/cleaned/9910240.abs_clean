The Parisi-Sourlas mechanism is exhibited in pure Yang-Mills theory. Usingthe new scalar degrees of freedom derived from the non-linear gauge condition,we show that the non-perturbative sector of Yang-Mills theory is equivalent toa 4D O(1,3) sigma model in a random field. We then show that the leading termof this equivalent theory is invariant under supersymmetry transformationswhere (x^{2}+\thetabar\theta) is unchanged. This leads to dimensional reductionproving the equivalence of the non-perturbative sector of Yang-Mills theory toa 2D O(1,3) sigma model.
