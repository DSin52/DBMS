We investigate a recently proposed model for a full quantum description oftwo-dimensional black hole evaporation, in which a reflecting boundarycondition is imposed in the strong coupling region. It is shown that in thismodel each initial state is mapped to a well-defined asymptotic out-state,provided one performs a certain projection in the gravitational zero modesector. We find that for an incoming localized energy pulse, the correspondingout-going state contains approximately thermal radiation, in accordance withsemi-classical predictions. In addition, our model allows for certain acausalstrong coupling effects near the singularity, that give rise to corrections tothe Hawking spectrum and restore the coherence of the out-state. To anasymptotic observer these corrections appear to originate from behind thereceding apparent horizon and start to influence the out-going state longbefore the black hole has emitted most of its mass. Finally, by putting thesystem in a finite box, we are able to derive some algebraic properties of thescattering matrix and prove that the final state contains all initialinformation.
