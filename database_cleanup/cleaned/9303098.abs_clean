In the quenched approximation, the gauge covariance properties of threevertex Ans\"{a}tze in the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the fermion self energyare analysed in three- and four- dimensional quantum electrodynamics. Based onthe Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective action, it is inferred that thespectral representation used for the vertex in the gauge technique cannotsupport dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. A criterion for establishingwhether a given Ansatz can confer gauge covariance upon the Schwinger-Dysonequation is presented and the Curtis and Pennington Ansatz is shown to satisfythis constraint. We obtain an analytic solution of the Schwinger-Dyson equationfor quenched, massless three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics for arbitraryvalues of the gauge parameter in the absence of dynamical chiral symmetrybreaking.
