The fusion of fields in a rational conformal field theory gives rise to aring structure which has a very particular form. All such rings studied so farwere shown to arise from some potentials. In this paper the fusion rings of theWZW models based on the symplectic group are studied. It is shown that theyindeed arise from potentials which are described. These potentials give rise tonew massive perturbations of superconformal hermitian symmetric models. Themetric of the perturbation is computed and is shown to be given by solutions ofthe sinh--gordon equation. The kink structure of the theories is described, andit is argued that these field theories are integrable. The $S$ matrices for thefusion theories are argued to be non--minimal extensions of the $G_k\times G_1/G_{k+1}$ $S$ matrices with the adjoint perturbation, in the case of $G=SU(N)$.
