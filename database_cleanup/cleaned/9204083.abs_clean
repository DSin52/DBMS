Topological gravity is equivalent to physical gravity in two dimensions in away that is still mysterious, though by now it has been proved by Kontsevich.In this paper it is shown that a similar relation between topological andphysical Yang-Mills theory holds in two dimensions; in this case, however, therelation can be explained by a direct mapping between the two path integrals.This (1) explains many strange facts about two dimensional Yang-Mills theory,like the way the partition function can be expressed exactly as a sum overclassical solutions, including unstable ones; (2) makes the correspondingtopological theory completely computable.
