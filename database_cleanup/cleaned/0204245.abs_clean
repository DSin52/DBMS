Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) theory is a recently proposed theory with twoobserver-independent scales (of velocity and mass), which is to describe akinematic structure underlining the theory of Quantum Gravity. We observe thatthere is infinitely many DSR constructions of the energy-momentum sector, eachof whose can be promoted to the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e quantum (Hopf) algebra.Then we use the co-product of this algebra and the known construction of$\kappa$-deformed phase space via Heisenberg double in order to derive thenon-commutative space-time structure and description of the whole of the DSRphase space. Next we show that contrary to the ambiguous structure of theenergy momentum sector, the space-time of the DSR theory is unique andequivalent to the theory with non-commutative space-time proposed long ago bySnyder. This theory provides non-commutative version of Minkowski space-timeenjoying ordinary Lorentz symmetry. It turns out that when one builds a naturalphase space on this space-time, its intrinsic length parameter $\ell$ becomesobserver-independent.
