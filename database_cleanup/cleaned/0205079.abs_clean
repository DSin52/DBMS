We study possible backgrounds of 2D string theory using its equivalence witha system of fermions in upside-down harmonic potential. Each backgroundcorresponds to a certain profile of the Fermi sea, which can be considered as adeformation of the hyperbolic profile characterizing the linear dilatonbackground. Such a perturbation is generated by a set of commuting flows, whichform a Toda Lattice integrable structure. The flows are associated with allpossible left and right moving tachyon states, which in the compactified theoryhave discrete spectrum. The simplest nontrivial background describes theSine-Liouville string theory. Our methods can be also applied to the study of2D droplets of electrons in a strong magnetic field.
