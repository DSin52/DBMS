We first recall a covariant formalism used to compute conserved charges ingauge invariant theories. We then study the case of gravity for two differentboundary conditions, namely spatial infinity and a Brane-World boundary. Thenew conclusion of this analysis is that the gravitational energy (and linearand angular momentum) is a local expression if our universe is really aboundary of a five-dimensional spacetime.
