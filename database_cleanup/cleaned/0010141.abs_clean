We reformulate the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model on the compactified AdS byadding a term proportional to the area of the boundary to the usual gravityaction with a negative cosmological constant and show that gravity can still belocalized on the boundary without introducing singular brane sources. Theboundary conditions now follow from the field equations, which are obtained byletting the induced metric vary on the boundary. This approach gives similarmodes that are obtained in [1] and clarifies the complementarity of the RS andthe AdS/CFT pictures. Normalizability of these modes is checked by aninner-product in the space of linearized perturbations. The same conclusionshold for a massless scalar field in the bulk.
