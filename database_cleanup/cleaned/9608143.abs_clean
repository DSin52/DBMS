We outline the renormalization of the standard model to all orders ofperturbation theory in a way which does not make essential use of a specificsubtraction scheme but is based on the Slavnov-Taylor identity. Physical fieldsand parameters are used throughout the paper. The Ward-identity for the globalgauge invariance of the vertex functions is formulated. As an application theCallan-Symanzik equation is derived.
