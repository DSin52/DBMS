Title: Fock Spaces with Reflection Condition and Generalized Statistics

Comments: LaTeX file, No figures, 11 pages, 30 kb

An oscillator algebra and the associated Fock space with reflecting boundaryand generalized statistics are constructed and is generalized to themulticomponent case. The oscillator algebra depends manifestly on thereflection factor and the statistical (exchange) factor, and the correspondingFock space can be obtained from that of the usual bosonic oscillator withoutreflection condition by certain projection operation.
