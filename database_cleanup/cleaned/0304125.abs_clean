One-loop corrections to kink masses in a family of (1+1)-dimensional fieldtheoretical models with two scalar fields are computed. A generalized DHNformula applicable to reflection and reflectionless potentials is obtained. Itis thus shown how half-bound states arising in the spectrum of the second orderfluctuation operator around TK1 kinks and the vacuum play a central role in thecomputation of the kink Casimir energy. The issue of whether or not the kinkdegeneracy exhibited by this family of models at the classical level survivesquantum fluctuations up to the one-loop order is addressed.
