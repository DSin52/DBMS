Comments: 9 pages, latex; To be published in the proceedings of the Quantum

Aspects of Gauge Theories, Supersymmetry and Unification, Corfu, Greece,20-26 September 1998Multicenter supergravity solutions corresponding to Higgs phases ofsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theories are considered. For NS5 branes we identifythree cases where there is a description in terms of exact conformal fieldtheories. Other supergravity solutions, such as D3-branes with angularmomentum, are understood as special limits of multicenter ones. Within ourcontext we also consider 4-dim gravitational multi-instantons.
