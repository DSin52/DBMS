We explicitly show that the net number of degrees of freedom in thetwo-dimensional dilaton gravity is zero through the Hamiltonian constraintanalysis. This implies that the local space-time dependent physical excitationsdo not exist. From the linear perturbation around the black hole background, weexplicitly prove that the exponentially growing mode with time is in facteliminated outside the horizon. Therefore, the two-dimensional dilation gravityis essentially stable.
