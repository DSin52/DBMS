The correlation function of two dimensional Ising model with the nearestneighbours interaction on the finite size lattice with the periodical boundaryconditions is derived. The expressions similar to the form factorrepresentation are obtained both for the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic regionsof coupling constant. The peculiarities caused by the finite size of the systemare discussed. The asymptotic behaviour of the corresponding quantities asfunctions of size is calculated. Some generalization of the obtained result isconjectured.
