Using known mode properties, the functional determinant for masslessspin-half fields on the Euclidean 4-ball is calculated and shown to bedifferent for spectral (nonlocal) and mixed (local) boundary conditions. Thelocal result agrees with that from a conformal argument. Some higher-spinresults are also given.
