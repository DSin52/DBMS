We study closed string tachyon condensation on general non-supersymmetricorbifolds of C^2. Extending previous analyses on Abelian cases, we present theclassification of quotients by discrete finite subgroups of GL(2; C) as well asthe generalised Hirzebruch-Jung continued fractions associated with theresolution data. Furthermore, we discuss the intimate connexions with certaingeneralised versions of the McKay Correspondence.
