Quadratic algebras related to the reflection equations are introduced. Theyare quantum group comodule algebras. The quantum group $F_q(GL(2))$ is taken asthe example. The properties of the algebras (center, representations,realizations, real forms, fusion procedure etc) as well as the generalizationsare discussed.
