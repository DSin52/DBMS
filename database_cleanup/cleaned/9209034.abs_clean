We discuss various techniques for computing the semi-infinite cohomology ofhighest weight modules which arise in the BRST quantization of two dimensionalfield theories. In particular, we concentrate on two such theories -- the $G/H$coset models and $2d$ gravity coupled to $c\leq 1$ conformal matter. (to appearin the proceedings of the XXV Karpacz Winter School)
