A model-independent formulation of anyons as spinning particles is presented.The general properties of the classical theory of (2+1)-dimensionalrelativistic fractional spin particles and some properties of their quantumtheory are investigated. The relationship between all the known approaches toanyons as spinning particles is established. Some widespread misleading notionson the general properties of (2+1)-dimensional anyons are removed.
