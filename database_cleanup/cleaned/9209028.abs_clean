We give a general procedure for extracting the propagators in gauge theoriesin presence of a sharp gauge fixing and we apply it to derive the propagatorsin quantum gravity in the radial gauge, both in the first and in the secondorder formalism in any space-time dimension. In the three dimensional case suchpropagators vanish except for singular collinear contributions, in agreementwith the absence of propagating gravitons.
