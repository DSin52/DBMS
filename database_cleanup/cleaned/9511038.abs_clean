Title: New Results in Topological Field Theory and Abelian Gauge Theory

Comments: 57 pages; hard copies of figures are available on request from

"grilli@ictp.trieste.it"These are the lecture notes of a set of lectures delivered at the 1995Trieste summer school in June. I review some recent work on duality in fourdimensional Maxwell theory on arbitrary four manifolds, as well as a new set oftopological invariants known as the Seiberg-Witten invariants. Much of thenecessary background material is given, including a crash course in topologicalfield theory, cohomology of manifolds, topological gauge theory and therudiments of four manifold theory. My main hope is to wet the readers appetite,so that he or she will wish to read the original works and perhaps to enterthis field.
