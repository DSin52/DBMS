We study compactifications of Einstein gravity on product spaces in vacuumand their acceleration phases. Scalar potentials for the dimensionally reducedeffective theory are found to be of exponential form and exact solutions areobtained for a class of product spaces. The inflation in our solutions is notsufficient for the early universe. We comment on the possibility of obtainingsufficient inflation by compactification in general.
