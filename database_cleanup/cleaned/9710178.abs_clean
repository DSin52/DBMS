Recently Sen and Seiberg gave a prescription for constructing the matrixtheory in any superstring background. We use their prescription to test thefinite N matrix theory conjecture on an ALE space. Based on our earlier workwith Shenker, we find a sharper discrepancy between matrix theory computationand supergravity prediction. We discuss subtleties in the light-frontquantization which may lead to a resolution to the discrepancy.
