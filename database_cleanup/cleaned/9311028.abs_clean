Authors: O.V.Dodlov, S.E.Konstein, and M.A.Vasiliev

Comments: 7 pages, FIAN/TD/17--93

Matrix generalizations of the N-particle quantum-mechanical Calogero modelclassifying according to representations of the symmetric group $S_N$ areconsidered. Symmetry properties of the eigen-wave functions in the matrixCalogero models are analyzed. Latex.
