We find double-extreme black holes associated with the special geometry ofthe Calabi-Yau moduli space with the prepotential F=STU. The area formula isSTU-moduli independent and has ${[SL(2,Z)]}^3$ symmetry in space of charges.The dual version of this theory without prepotential treats the dilaton Sasymmetric versus T,U-moduli. We display the dual relation between new (STU)black holes and stringy (S|TU) black holes using particular Sp(8, Z)transformation. The area formula of one theory equals that of the dual theorywhen expressed in terms of dual charges. We analyse the relation between (STU)solutions. In the democratic STU-symmetric version we find that all three S andT and U duality symmetries are non-perturbative and mix electric and magneticcharges.
