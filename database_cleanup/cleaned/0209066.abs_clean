Using graviton correlator on deSitter (dS) brane in 5d AdS or dS bulk wecalculate the four-dimensional Newton potential. For flat brane in AdS bulk theRandall-Sundrum result is recovered. For flat brane in dS bulk the sign ofsubleading ($1/r^3$) term in Newton potential is negative if compare with AdSbulk. In accordance with dS/CFT correspondence this indicates that dual CFTshould be non-unitary (for example, higher derivative conformal theory).
