Canonical quantisation of rigid particles is considered paying specialattention to the restriction on phase space due to causal propagation. A mixedLorentz-gravitational anomaly is found in the commutator of Lorentz boosts withworld-line reparametrisations. The subspace of gauge invariant physical statesis therefore not invariant under Lorentz transformations. The analysis appliesfor an arbitrary extrinsic curvature dependence with the exception of only onecase to be studied separately. Consequences for rigid strings are alsodiscussed.
