We show that in a Wilsonian renormalization scheme with zero-momentumsubtraction point the massless Wess-Zumino model satisfies thenon-renormalization theorem; the finite renormalization of the superpotentialappearing in the usual non-zero momentum subtraction schemes is thus avoided.We give an exact expression of the beta and gamma functions in terms of theWilsonian effective action; we prove the expected relation $\beta = 3g\gamma$.We compute the beta function at the first two loops, finding agreement withprevious results.
