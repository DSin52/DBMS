Motivated by a recent paper of Fock and Rosly \cite{FoRo} we describe amathematically precise quantization of the Hamiltonian Chern-Simons theory. Weintroduce the Chern-Simons theory on the lattice which is expected to reproducethe results of the continuous theory exactly. The lattice model enjoys thesymmetry with respect to a quantum gauge group. Using this fact we constructthe algebra of observables of the Hamiltonian Chern-Simons theory equipped witha *-operation and a positive inner product.
