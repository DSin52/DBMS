The concept of universal T matrix, recently introduced by Fronsdal andGalindo in the framework of quantum groups, is here discussed as ageneralization of the exponential mapping. New examples related toinhomogeneous quantum groups of physical interest are developed, the dualitycalculations are explicitly presented and it is found that in some cases theuniversal T matrix, like for Lie groups, is expressed in terms of usualexponential series.
