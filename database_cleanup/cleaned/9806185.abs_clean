``Constants of Nature'' and cosmological parameters may in fact be variablesrelated to some slowly-varying fields. In models of eternal inflation, suchfields will take different values in different parts of the universe. Here Ishow how one can assign probabilities to values of the ``constants'' measuredby a typical observer. This method does not suffer from ambiguities previouslydiscussed in the literature.
