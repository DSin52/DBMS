We derive some consistency conditions for fivebrane in M theory on R^5/Z_2orbifold from the quantization law for the antisymmetric tensor field. Weconstruct consistent fivebrane configurations in R^5/Z_2 type orbifold thatexhibit the correct low energy dynamics of N=2 SQCD in four dimensions withsymplectic and orthogonal gauge groups. This leads us to propose the M theoryrealization of orientifold four-planes of various types, and we study theirproperties by applying the consistency conditions.
