A crucial element of scattering theory and the LSZ reduction formula is theassumption that the coupling vanishes at large times. This is known not to holdfor the theories of the Standard Model and in general such asymptotic dynamicsis not well understood. We give a description of asymptotic dynamics in fieldtheories which incorporates the important features of weak convergence andphysical boundary conditions. Applications to theories with three and fourpoint interactions are presented and the results are shown to be completelyconsistent with the results of perturbation theory.
