Title: Parity and Large Gauge Invariance in Thermal QED_3

We settle the ``apparent'' paradox present in thermal QED_3 that theperturbative series is not invariant, as manifested by the temperaturedependence of the induced Chern-Simons term, by showing that large (unlikesmall) transformations and hence their Ward identities, are not perturbativeorder-preserving. Instead the thermal effective gauge field actions induced bycharged fermions in QED_3 can be made invariant under both small and largegauge transformations by suitable regularization of the Dirac operatordeterminant, at the usual price of parity anomalies. Our result is illustratedby a concrete example.
