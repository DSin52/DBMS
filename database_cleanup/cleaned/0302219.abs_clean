Title: The Anthropic Landscape of String Theory

Authors: Leonard Susskind

Comments: 21 pages, 5 figures

In this lecture I make some educated guesses, about the landscape of stringtheory vacua. Based on the recent work of a number of authors, it seemsplausible that the lanscape is unimaginably large and diverse. Whether we likeit or not, this is the kind of behavior that gives credence to the AnthropicPrinciple. I discuss the theoretical and conceptual issues that arise indeveloping a cosmology based on the diversity of environments implicit instring theory.
