We discuss the infinite dimensional algebras appearing in integrableperturbations of conformally invariant theories, with special emphasis in thestructure of the consequent non-abelian infinite dimensional algebrageneralizing $W_\infty$ to the case of a non abelian group. We prove that thepure left-symmetry as well as the pure right-sector of the thus obtainedalgebra coincides with the conformally invariant case. The mixed sector is moreinvolved, although the general structure seems to be near to be unraveled. Wealso find some subalgebras that correspond to Kac-Moody algebras. Theconstraints imposed by the algebras are very strong, and in the case of themassive deformation of a non-abelian fermionic model, the symmetry alone isenough to fix the 2- and 3-point functions of the theory.
