We describe a functional method to obtain the exact evolution equation of theeffective action with a parameter of the bare theory. When this parameterhappens to be the bare mass of the scalar field, we find a functionalgeneralization of the Callan-Symanzik equations. Another possibility is whenthis parameter is the Planck constant and controls the amplitude of thefluctuations. We show the similarity of these equations with the Wilsonianrenormalization group flows and also recover the usual one loop effectiveaction.
