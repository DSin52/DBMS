We show that all important features of 2d gravity coupled to $c<1$ matter canbe easily understood from the canonical quantization approach a la Dirac.Furthermore, we construct a canonical transformation which maps the theory intoa free-field form, i.e. the constraints become free-field Virasoro generatorswith background charges. This implies the gauge independence of theDavid-Distler-Kawai results, and also proves the free-field assumption whichwas used for obtaining the spectrum of the theory in the conformal gauge. Adiscussion of the unitarity of the physical spectrum is presented and we pointout that the scalar products of the discrete states are not well defined in thestandard Fock space framework.
