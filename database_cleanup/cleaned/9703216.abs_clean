We solve the problem of mixing between the fixed scalar and metricfluctuations. First, we derive the decoupled fixed scalar equation for thefour-dimensional black hole with two different charges. We proceed to thefive-dimensional black hole with different electric (1-brane) and magnetic(5-brane) charges, and derive two decoupled equations satisfied by appropriatemixtures of the original fixed scalar fields. The resulting greybody factorsare proportional to those that follow from coupling to dimension (2,2)operators on the effective string. In general, however, the string action alsocontains couplings to chiral operators of dimension (1,3) and (3,1), whichcause disagreements with the semiclassical absorption cross-sections.Implications of this for the effective string models are discussed.
