We consider entropy and relative entropy in Field theory and establishrelevant monotonicity properties with respect to the couplings. The relativeentropy in a field theory with a hierarchy of renormalization group fixedpoints ranks the fixed points, the lowest relative entropy being assigned tothe highest multicritical point. We argue that as a consequence of ageneralized $H$ theorem Wilsonian RG flows induce an increase in entropy andpropose the relative entropy as the natural quantity which increases from onefixed point to another in more than two dimensions.
