Title: On the Flattening of Negative Curvature via T-Duality with a

non-constant B-FieldAuthors: Axel Krause

Comments: 8 pages, small corrections

In an earlier paper, Alvarez, Alvarez-Gaume, Barbon and Lozano pointed out,that the only way to "flatten" negative curvature by means of a T-duality is byintroducing an appropriate, non-constant NS-NS B-field. In this paper, we areinvestigating this further and ask, whether it is possible to T-dualize AdS_dspace to flat space with some suitably chosen B. To answer this question, wederive a relationship between the original curvature tensor and the one of theT-dualized metric involving the B-field. It turns out that there is oneparticular component, which is independent of B. By inspection of thiscomponent, we then show, that it is not possible to dualize AdS_d to flat spaceirrespective of the choice of B. Finally, we examine the extension of AdS to anAdS_5 x S^5 geometry and propose a chain of S- and T-dualities together with anSL(2,Z) coordinate transformation, leading to a dual D9-brane geometry.
