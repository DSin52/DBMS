We analyze the propagation of open and unoriented strings on theNeveu-Schwarz pentabrane (N5-brane) along the lines of a similar analysis forthe SU(2) WZNW models. We discuss the two classes of open descendants of thediagonal models and a series of Z_2 projected models which exist only for evenvalues of the level k and correspond to branes at D-type orbifoldsingularities. The resulting configurations of branes and planes are T-dual tothose relevant to the study of dualities in super Yang-Mills theories. Theassociation of Chan-Paton factors to D-brane multiplicities is possible in thesemi-classical limit k -> infinity, but due to strong curvature effects isunclear for finite k. We show that the introduction of a magnetic field impliesa twist of the SU(2) current algebra in the open-string sector leading tospacetime supersymmetry breaking.
