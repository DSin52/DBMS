I compare heatkernel regularization with sharp gauge invariant cutoffs in theHamiltonian formulation of the Coulomb gauged Schwinger model on a circle. Theeffective potential for the zero mode of the gauge field in a given fermionicconfiguration is different in these two regularizations, the difference beingindependent of the chosen fermionic configuration. In the continuum limit thegauge field can be localized or delocalized depending on the regulator.
