Title: Liouville Models of Black Hole Evaporation

Authors: Adel Bilal and Curtis Callan

Comments: 27 pages, revised ("Note Added" is expanded to show how careful

treatment of quantum effects makes the Hawking radiation rate proportional toN/12 rather than (N-24)/12 and also to show that the cosmic censorshipmechanism proposed by Russo et.al. for a somewhat different model works forour model as well. New references are added and the preprint number iscorrected.) PUPT-1320Journal-ref: Nucl.Phys. B394 (1993) 73-100

We construct new theories of dilation gravity coupled to conformal matterwhich are exact $c=26$ conformal field theories and presumably consistentframeworks for discussing black hole physics in two dimensions. They differfrom the CGHS equations in the precise dilaton dependence of the cosmologicalconstant. A further modification proposed by Strominger with a view toeliminating unphysical ghost Hawking radiation is also considered. The newclassical equations of motion are explicitly soluble, thus permitting an exactanalysis of both static and dynamic senarios. While the static solutions arephysically reasonable, the dynamical solutions include puzzling examples withwrong-sign Hawking radiation. We indicate how the latter problem may beresolved in the full quantum theory.
