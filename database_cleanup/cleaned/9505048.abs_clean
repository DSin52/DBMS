A full Postscript version of this paper is available atWe present a precise lattice computation of the slope of the effectivepotential for massless $(\lambda\Phi^4)_4$ theory in the region of bareparameters indicated by the Brahm's analysis of lattice data. Our resultsconfirm the existence on the lattice of a remarkable phase of$(\lambda\Phi^4)_4$ where Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking is generated through``dimensional transmutation''. The resulting effective potential shows noevidence for residual self-interaction effects of the shifted `Higgs' field$h(x)=\Phi(x)-\langle\Phi\rangle$, as predicted by ``triviality'', and cannotbe reproduced in perturbation theory. Accordingly the mass of the Higgsparticle, by itself, does not represent a measure of any observableinteraction.
