A model of SU(2) gauge theory in the space-time $R\times S^3$ is constructedin terms of local gauge-invariant variables. A metric tensor $g_{\mu \nu}$ isdefined starting with the components of the strength tensor $F_{\mu \nu}^k$ andof its dual $\widetilde{F}_{\mu \nu}^k$. It is shown that the components$g_{\mu \nu}$ determine the gauge field equations if some supplementaryconstraints are imposed. Two families of analitical solutions of the fieldequations are also obtained.
