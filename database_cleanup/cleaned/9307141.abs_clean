We obtain off-critical (elliptic) Boltzmann weights for lattice models whosecontinuum limits correspond to massive, $N=2$ supersymmetric, quantumintegrable field theories. We also compute the free energies of these modelsand show that they are analytic in the region of parameter space where webelieve that the supersymmetry is unbroken. While the supersymmetry is notdirectly realized on the lattice, there is still a very close connectionbetween the models described here and topological lattice models. A simpleexample is discussed in detail and some corner transfer matrix computations arealso presented.
