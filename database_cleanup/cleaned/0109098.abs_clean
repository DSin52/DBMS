Title: Remarks on A-branes, Mirror Symmetry, and the Fukaya category

Authors: Anton Kapustin, Dmitri Orlov

We discuss D-branes of the topological A-model (A-branes), which are believedto be closely related to the Fukaya category. We give string theory argumentswhich show that A-branes are not necessarily Lagrangian submanifolds in thebundle on the brane is not flat. We show that a coisotropic A-brane has anatural structure of a foliated manifold with a transverse holomorphicstructure. We argue that the Fukaya category must be enlarged with such objectsfor the Homological Mirror Symmetry conjecture to be true.
