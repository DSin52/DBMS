We find a quantum group structure in two-dimensional motion ofnonrelativistic electrons in a uniform magnetic field on a torus. Therepresentation basis of the quantum algebra is composed of the quantum Hallwavefunctions proposed by Haldane-Rezayi at the Landau-level filling factor$\nu=1/m$ ($m$ odd). It is also shown that the quantum group symmetry isrelevant to the degenerate Landau states and the deformation parameter of thequantum algebra is given by the filling factor.
