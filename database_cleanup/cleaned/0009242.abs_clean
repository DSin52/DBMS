Some properties of N=2 superstrings on AdS_3 x N are studied. Their spectrumhas the same pattern as 2-d CFTs in the moduli space of symmetric productsM^p/S_p, where p is associated with the number of long fundamental stringsrequired to construct the AdS_3 background, and M is the spacetime CFTcorresponding to short string excitations of a single long string. Worldsheetoperators associated with w long strings correspond to twisted sectors ofM^p/S_p.
