Title: Simple considerations on the behaviour of bosonic modes with quantum

group symmetryAuthors: A. Kempf

Comments: 6 pages, preprint DAMTP/93-43

While it is possible to introduce quantum group symmetry into the frameworkof quantum mechanics, the general problem of how to implement quantum groupsymmetry into $(3+1)$ dimensional quantum field theory has not yet been solved.Here we try to estimate some features of the behaviour of bosonic modes.
