We consider a diagonalization of Witten's star product for a ghost system ofarbitrary background charge and Grassmann parity. To this end we use abosonized formulation of such systems and a spectral analysis of Neumannmatrices. We further identify a continuous Moyal product structure for acombined ghosts+matter system. The normalization of multiplication kernel isdiscussed.
