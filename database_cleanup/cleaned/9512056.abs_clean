Starting from the concept of the universal exterior algebra innon-commutative differential geometry we construct differential forms on thequantum phase-space of an arbitrary system. They bear the same naturalrelationship to quantum dynamics which ordinary tensor fields have with respectto classical hamiltonian dynamics.
