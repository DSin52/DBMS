We present a method for explicitly computing the non-perturbativesuperpotentials associated with the vector bundle moduli in heteroticsuperstrings and M-theory. This method is applicable to any stable, holomorphicvector bundle over an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefold. Forspecificity, the vector bundle moduli superpotential, for a vector bundle withstructure group G=SU(3), generated by a heterotic superstring wrapped once overan isolated curve in a Calabi-Yau threefold with base B=F1, is explicitlycalculated. Its locus of critical points is discussed. Superpotentials ofvector bundle moduli potentially have important implications for smallinstanton phase transitions and the vacuum stability and cosmology ofsuperstrings and M-theory.
