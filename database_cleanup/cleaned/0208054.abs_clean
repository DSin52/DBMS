Title: On Peculiarities and Pit Falls in Path Integrals

Comments: Opening Lecture given at the 7th International Conference on Path

Integrals, "From Quarks to Galaxies", Antwerp, 27 to 31 May 2002. UsesPath integrals can be rigorously defined only in low dimensional systemswhere the small distance limit can be taken. Particularly non-trivial models inmore than four dimensions can only be handled with considerable amount ofspeculation. In this lecture we try to put these various aspects inperspective.
