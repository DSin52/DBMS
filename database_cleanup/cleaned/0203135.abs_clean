We study the Euclidean two-point function of Fermi fields in theSU(2)-Thirring model on the whole distance (energy) scale. We performperturbative and renormalization group analyses to obtain the short-distanceasymptotics, and numerically evaluate the long-distance behavior by using theform factor expansion. Our results illustrate the use of bosonization andconformal perturbation theory in the renormalization group analysis of afermionic theory, and numerically confirm the validity of the form factorexpansion in the case of the SU(2)-Thirring model.
