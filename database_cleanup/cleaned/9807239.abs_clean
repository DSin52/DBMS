A path integral formalism is developed to study the interaction of anarbitrary curved Dirichlet (D-) string with elementary excitations of thefundumental (F-) string in bosonic string theory. Up to the next to leadingorder in the derivative expansion, we construct the properly renormalizedvertex operator, which generalizes the one previously obtained for a D-particlemoving along a curved trajectory. Using this vertex, an attempt is further madeto quantize the D-string coordinates and to compute the quantum amplitude forscattering between elementary excitations of the D- and F-strings. By studyingthe dependence on the Liouville mode for the D-string, it is found that thevertex in our approximation consists of an infinite tower of local vertexoperators which are conformally invariant on their respective mass-shell. Thisanalysis indicates that, unlike the D-particle case, an off-shell extension ofthe interaction vertex would be necessary to compute the full amplitude andthat the realization of symmetry can be quite non-trivial when the dualextended objects are simultaneously present. Possible future directions aresuggested.
