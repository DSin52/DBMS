The plot of allowed p and D values for p-brane solitons in D-dimensionalsupergravity is the same whether the solitons are extremal or non-extremal. Oneof the useful tools for relating different points on the plot is verticaldimensional reduction, which is possible if periodic arrays of p-brane solitonscan be constructed. This is straightforward for extremal p-branes, since theno-force condition allows arbitrary multi-centre solutions to be constructed interms of a general harmonic function on the transverse space. This has alsobeen shown to be possible in the special case of non-extremal black holes inD=4 arrayed along an axis. In this paper, we extend previous results to includemulti-scalar black holes, and dyonic black holes. We also consider theiroxidation to higher dimensions, and we discuss general procedures forconstructing the solutions, and studying their symmetries.
