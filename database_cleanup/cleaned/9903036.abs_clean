We reconsider the Kaluza Klein compactifications of D=11 supergravity onAdS_4x(G/H)_7 manifolds that were classified in the eighties, in the modernperspective of AdS_4/CFT_3 correspondence. We focus on one of the three N=2systematic use of the harmonic analysis techniques developed in the eighties byone of us (P. Fre') with R. D'Auria, we derive the complete spectrum of long,short and massless Osp(2|4)xSU(3)xSU(2) unitary irreducible representationsobtained in this compactification. Our result also provides a general schemefor the other N=2 compactifications. Furthermore, it is a necessary comparisonspectra that we obtain will provide a much more stringent proof of the AdS/CFTcorrespondence than in the S^7 case, since the structure of the superconformalfield theory on the M2-brane world volume must be such as to reproduce, at thelevel of composite operators, the flavor group representations, the conformaldimensions and the hypercharges that we obtain in the present article. Theinvestigation of the match is left to future publications. Here we provide anexhaustive construction of the Kaluza Klein side of our spectroscopy.
