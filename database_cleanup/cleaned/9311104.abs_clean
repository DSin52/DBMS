Title: N=2 Superconformal Theories and their Integrable Deformations

Authors: J.-B. Zuber

Comments: (11 pages)

After a short review of the algebraic setting of N=2 superconformal fieldtheories, their chiral ring and their perturbations, I present some recentresults on curious relations between the integrability of their perturbationsand algebraic properties of their deformed chiral ring.
