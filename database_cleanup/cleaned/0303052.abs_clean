Title: Calculations in the Light-Cone Representation

Comments: 7 pages and uses revtex

For the problem of calculating bound states in quantum field theory, thelight-cone representation offers advantages over the more common equal-timerepresentation. It also has subtleties and disadvantages compared to theequal-time representation. If current efforts to use the light-conerepresentation to solve for the properties of hadrons in QCD are to succeed, atmust develop an effective procedure of regularization and renormalization. Inthis paper I will try to explain what an induced operator is and say what weknow about them and will report on recent attempts to develop an effectiveprocedure of regularization and renormalization.
