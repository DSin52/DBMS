Negative dimensional integration method (NDIM) is a technique which can beapplied, with success, in usual covariant gauge calculations. We consider threepropagators and the scalar pentabox in two cases, where six virtual particleshave the same mass and in the case where all of them are massless. Our resultsare given in terms hypergeometric functions of Mandelstam variables and forarbitrary exponents of propagators and dimension $D$ as well.
