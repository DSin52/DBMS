Title: Finite-difference representations of the degenerate affine Hecke algebra

Authors: D.Uglov

Comments: 13p Latex

The representations of the degenerate affine Hecke algebra in which theanalogues of the Dunkl operators are given by finite-difference operators areintroduced. The non-selfadjoint lattice analogues of the spinCalogero-Sutherland hamiltonians are analysed by Bethe-Ansatz. The $sl(m)$-Yangian representations arising from the finite-differencerepresentations of the degenerate affine Hecke algebra are shown to be relatedto the Yangian representation of the 1-d Hubbard Model.
