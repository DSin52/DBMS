We studied the massive scalar wave propagation in the background ofReissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole by using numerical simulations. We learnedthat the value $Mm$ plays an important role in determining the properties ofthe relaxation of the perturbation. For $Mm << 1$ the relaxation processdepends only on the field parameter and does not depend on the spacetimeparameters. For $Mm >> 1$, the dependence of the relaxation on the black holeparameters appears. The bigger mass of the black hole, the faster theperturbation decays. The difference of the relaxation process caused by theblack hole charge $Q$ has also been exhibited.
