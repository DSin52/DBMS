The exactly and quasi-exactly solvable problems for spin one-half in onedimension on the basis of a hidden dynamical symmetry algebra of Hamiltonianare discussed. We take the supergroup, $OSP(2|1)$, as such a symmetry. A numberof exactly solvable examples are considered and their spectrum are evaluatedexplicitly. Also, a class of quasi-exactly solvable problems on the basis ofsuch a symmetry has been obtained.
