A quantum theory is constructed for the system of a relativistic particlewith mass m moving freely on the SL(2,R) group manifold. Applied to thecotangent bundle of SL(2,R), the method of Hamiltonian reduction allows us tosplit the reduced system into two coadjoint orbits of the group. We find thatthe Hilbert space consists of states given by the discrete series of theunitary irreducible representations of SL(2,R), and with a positive-definite,discrete spectrum.
