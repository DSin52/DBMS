We prove that the Jacobi identity for the generalized Poisson bracket issatisfied in the generalization of Heisenberg picture quantum mechanicsrecently proposed by one of us (SLA). The identity holds for any combination offermionic and bosonic fields, and requires no assumptions about their mutualcommutativity.
