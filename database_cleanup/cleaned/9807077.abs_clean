A well-defined chirally split functional integrating the 2D chirally splitdiffeomorphism anomaly is exhibited on an arbitrary compact Riemann surfacewithout boundary. The construction requires both the use of the Beltramiparametrisation of complex structures and the introduction of a backgroundmetric possibly subject to a Liouville equation. This formula reproduces in theflat case the so-called Polyakov action. Although it works on the torus (genus1), the proposed functional still remains to be related to a Wess-Zumino actionfor diffeomorphisms.
