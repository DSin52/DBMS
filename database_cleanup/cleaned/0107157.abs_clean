We study a large N_{c} limit of a two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory coupledto bosons and fermions in the fundamental representation. Extending an approachdue to Rajeev we show that the limiting theory can be described as a classicalHamiltonian system whose phase space is an infinite-dimensionalsupergrassmannian. The linear approximation to the equations of motion and theconstraint yields the 't Hooft equations for the mesonic spectrum. Two otherapproximation schemes to the exact equations are discussed.
