The "minimal matter + scalar" system can be embedded into the twistedsome results concerning the topological descendants and their DDK and KMrealizations. In particular, we prove four "no-ghost" theorems (two for nullstates) regarding the reduction of the topological descendants into secon-daries of the "minimal matter + scalar" conformal field theory. We writedown the relevant expressions for the case of level 2 descendants.
