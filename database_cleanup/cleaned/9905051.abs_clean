We study the problem of decoupling fermion fields in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions,in interaction with a gauge field, by performing local transformations of thefermions in the functional integral. This could always be done if singular(large) gauge transformations were allowed, since any gauge field configurationmay be represented as a singular pure gauge field. However, the effect of asingular gauge transformation of the fermions is equivalent to the one of aregular transformation with a non-trivial action on the spinorial indices. Forexample, in the two dimensional case, singular gauge transformations leadnaturally to chiral transformations, and hence to the usual decouplingmechanism based on Fujikawa Jacobians. In 2+1 dimensions, using the sameprocedure, different transformations emerge, which also give rise to FujikawaJacobians. We apply this idea to obtain the v.e.v of the fermionic current in abackground field, in terms of the Jacobian for an infinitesimal decouplingtransformation, finding the parity violating result.
