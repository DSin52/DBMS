We show that in heterotic string theory compactified on a six dimensionaltorus, the lower bound (Bogomol'nyi bound) on the dyon mass is invariant underthe SL(2,Z) transformation that interchanges strong and weak coupling limits ofthe theory. Elementary string excitations are also shown to satisfy this lowerbound. Finally, we identify specific monopole solutions that are related viathe strong-weak coupling duality transformation to some of the elementaryparticles saturating the Bogomol'nyi bound, and these monopoles are shown tohave the same mass and degeneracy of states as the corresponding elementaryparticles.
