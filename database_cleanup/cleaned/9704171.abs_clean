We study the zero mode and the spontaneous symmetry breaking on the lightfront (LF). We use the discretized light-cone quantization (DLCQ) ofMaskawa-Yamawaki to treat the zero mode in a clean separation from all othermodes. It is then shown that the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) phase can be realized onthe trivial LF vacuum only when an explicit symmetry-breaking mass of the NGboson $m_{\pi}$ is introduced. The NG-boson zero mode integrated over the LFmust exhibit singular behavior $ \sim 1/m_{\pi}^2$ in the symmetric limit$m_{\pi}\to 0$, which implies that current conservation is violated at zeromode, or equivalently the LF charge is not conserved even in the symmetriclimit. We demonstrate this peculiarity in a concrete model, the linear sigmamodel, where the role of zero-mode constraint is clarified. We further compareour result with the continuum theory. It is shown that in the continuum theoryit is difficult to remove the zero mode which is not a single mode with measurezero but the accumulating point causing uncontrollable infrared singularity. Apossible way out within the continuum theory is also suggested based on the``$\nu$ theory''. We finally discuss another problem of the zero mode in thecontinuum theory, i.e., no-go theorem of Nakanishi-Yamawaki on thenon-existence of LF quantum field theory within the framework of Wightmanaxioms, which remains to be a challenge for DLCQ, ``$\nu$ theory'' or any otherframework of LF theory.
