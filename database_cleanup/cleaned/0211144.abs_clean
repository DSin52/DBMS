The massless Curci-Ferrari model with N_f flavours of quarks is renormalizedto three loops in the MSbar scheme in an arbitrary covariant gauge withparameter alpha. The renormalization of the BRST invariant dimension twocomposite operator, 1/2 (A^a_\mu)^2 - alpha \bar{c}^a c^a, which corresponds tothe mass operator in the massive Curci-Ferrari model, is determined byrenormalizing the Green's function where the operator is inserted in a ghosttwo-point function. Consequently the anomalous dimension of the QCD Landaugauge operator, 1/2 (A^a_\mu)^2, and the (gauge independent) photon massanomalous dimension in QED are both deduced at three loops.
