We show how to determine the unknown functions arising when the peelingdecomposition is applied to multi-critical matter coupled to two-dimensionalquantum gravity and compute the loop-loop correlation functions. The resultsthat $\eta=2+2/(2K-3)$ and $\nu=1-3/2K$ agree with the slicing decomposition,and satisfy Fisher scaling.
