Title: Lorentz-Invariant "Elements of Reality" and the Question of Joint

Measurability of Commuting ObservablesComments: 15 pages

It is shown that the joint measurements of some physical variablescorresponding to commuting operators performed on pre- and post-selectedquantum systems invariably disturb each other. The significance of this resultfor recent proofs of the impossibility of realistic Lorentz invariantinterpretation of quantum theory (without assumption of locality) is discussed.
