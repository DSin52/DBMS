The possible tensor constructions of open string theories are analyzed fromfirst principles. To this end the algebraic framework of open string fieldtheory is clarified, including the role of the homotopy associative A_\inftyalgebra, the odd symplectic structure, cyclicity, star conjugation, and twist.It is also shown that two string theories are off-shell equivalent if thecorresponding homotopy associative algebras are homotopy equivalent in a strictsense.It is demonstrated that a homotopy associative star algebra with a compatibleeven bilinear form can be attached to an open string theory. If this algebradoes not have a spacetime interpretation, positivity and the existence of aconserved ghost number require that its cohomology is at degree zero, and thatit has the structure of a direct sum of full matrix algebras. The resultingstring theory is shown to be physically equivalent to a string theory with afamiliar open string gauge group.
