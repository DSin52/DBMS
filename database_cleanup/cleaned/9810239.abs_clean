We compute the one-loop non-holomorphic effective potential for the N=4 SU(n)supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with the gauge symmetry broken down to themaximal torus. Our approach remains powerful for arbitrary gauge groups and isbased on the use of N=2 harmonic superspace formulation for general N=2Yang-Mills theories along with the superfield background field method.
