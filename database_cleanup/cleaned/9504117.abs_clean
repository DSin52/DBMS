We consider pure $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory when the space is compactified toa 3-dimensional sphere with finite radius. The Euclidean classical self-dualsolutions of the equations of motion (the instantons) and the static finiteenergy solutions (the sphalerons) which have been found earlier are rewrittenin handy physical variables with the gauge condition $A_0 = 0$. Stationarysolutions to the equations of motion in the Minkowski space-time (the standingwaves) are discussed. We briefly discuss also the theory defined in a flatfinite spherical box with rigid boundary conditions and present the numericalsolution describing the sphaleron.
