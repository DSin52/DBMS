Workshop on the Internal Structure of Black Holes and SpacetimeSingularities, Haifa, Israel, June 29 - July 3, 1997. Published in "HaifaRecent results concerning the internal structure of staticspherically-symmetric non-Abelian black holes in the Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM)theory and its generalizations including scalar fields are reviewed anddiscussed with an emphasis on the problem of a generic singularity in blackholes. It is argued that in the theories admitting a violation of the naiveno-hair conjecture the structure of singularity is essentially affected by the"hair roots". This invalidates an image of a non-Abelian black hole as aSchwarzschild black hole sitting inside the soliton. We give an analyticdescription of the generic oscillatory approach to the singularity in the pureEYM theory in terms of a divergent discrete sequence and show that the massfunction is exponentially growing "in average". The second type of a genericapproach to the singularity in hairy black holes is a "power-law massinflation" which is realized in the theories including scalar fields. Bothsingularities are spacelike and no Cauchy horizons are met in the full interiorregion in conformity with the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture. Black holesviolating this conjecture exist only for certain discrete values of the eventhorizon radius thus forming a subset of zero measure.
