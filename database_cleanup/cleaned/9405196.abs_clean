We discuss some physical aspects of our Liouville approach to non-criticalstrings, including the emergence of a microscopic arrow of time, effectivefield theories as classical ``pointer'' states in theory space, $CPT$ violationand the possible apparent non-conservation of angular momentum. We also reviewthe application of a phenomenological parametrization of this formalism to theneutral kaon system.
