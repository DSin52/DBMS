We apply the method of coadjoint orbits of \winf-algebra to the problem ofnon-relativistic fermions in one dimension. This leads to a geometricformulation of the quantum theory in terms of the quantum phase spacedistribution of the fermi fluid. The action has an infinite series expansion inthe string coupling, which to leading order reduces to the previously discussedgeometric action for the classical fermi fluid based on the group $w_\infty$ ofarea-preserving diffeomorphisms. We briefly discuss the strong coupling limitof the string theory which, unlike the weak coupling regime, does not seem toadmit of a two dimensional space-time picture. Our methods are equallyapplicable to interacting fermions in one dimension.
