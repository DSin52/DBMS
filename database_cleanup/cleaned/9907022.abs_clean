We derive an energy bound for a `baryonic' D5-brane probe in the $adS_5\timesS^5$ background near the horizon of $N$ D3-branes. Configurations saturatingthe bound are shown to be 1/4 supersymmetric $S^5$-wrapped D5-branes, with atotal Born-Infeld charge $N$. Previous results are recovered as a special case.We derive a similar energy bound for a `baryonic' M5-brane probe in thebackground of $N$ M5-branes. Configurations saturating the bound are again 1/4supersymmetric and, in the $adS_7\times S^4$ near-horizon limit, provide aworldvolume realization of the `baryon string' vertex of the(2,0)-supersymmetric six-dimensional conformal field theory on coincidentM5-branes. For the full M5-background we find a worldvolume realization of theHanany-Witten effect in M-theory.
