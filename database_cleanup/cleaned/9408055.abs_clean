We describe how geometrical methods can be applied to a system withexplicitly time-dependent second-class constraints so as to cast it inHamiltonian form on its physical phase space. Examples of particular interestare systems which require time-dependent gauge fixing conditions in order toreduce them to their physical degrees of freedom. To illustrate our results wediscuss the gauge-fixing of relativistic particles and strings moving inarbitrary background electromagnetic and antisymmetric tensor fields.
