In order to prevent ``unavoidable'' break-down of the ``peacefulcoexistence'' between foundations of quantum theory and relativity I propose anew type of a quantum gauge theory (superrelativity). This differs fromordinary gauge theories in the sense that the affine connection of this theoryis constructed from first derivatives of the Fubini-Study metric tensor in theprojective Hilbert space of the pure quantum states CP(N). That is we have notmerely analogy with general relativity but this construction should presumablyprovide a unification of general relativity and quantum theory.
