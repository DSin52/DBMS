In this paper, starting from the common foundation of Connes' noncommutativegeometry (NCG) [1,2,3,4], various possible alternatives in the formulation of atheory of gravity in noncommutative spacetime are discussed in detail. Thediversity in the final physical content of the theory is shown to the theconsequence of the arbitrariness in each construction steps. As an alternativein the last step, when the staructure equations are to be solved, a minimal setof constraints on the torsion and connection is found to determine all thegeometric notions in terms of metric. In the Connes-Lott model ofnoncommutative spacetime, in order to keep the full spectrum of the discretizedKaluza-Klein theory [5], it is necessary to include the torsion in thegeneralized Einstein-Hilbert-Cartan action.
