The formalism, which permits to study the phase structure of gauged NJL-modelfor arbitrary external fields, is developed. The effective potential in thegauged NJL model in the weak magnetic field is found. It is shown that in fixedgauge coupling case the weak magnetic field doesn't influence chiral symmetrybreaking condition. The analogy with the situation near black hole is brieflymentioned.
