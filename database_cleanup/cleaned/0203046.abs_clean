added. Mixing of the dilaton with other moduli properly taken into account.Explanatory notes addedIn heterotic string theory compactified to four dimensions with N=2supersymmetry, string-loop corrections to the universal sector of thelow-energy effective action are studied. Within the framework of N=2supersymmetric formulation of the theory, in the first order in string couplingconstant, we solve the system of the loop-corrected Maxwell and Killing spinorequations. Taking as the in-put the tree-level dyonic black hole solution, wecalculate string-loop corrections to the string tree-level metric and moduli ofdyonic black hole.
