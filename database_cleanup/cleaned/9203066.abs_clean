We study some aspects of 2d supersymmetric sigma models on orbifolds. Itturns out that independently of whether the 2d QFT is conformal the operatorproducts of twist operators are non-singular, suggesting that massive(non-conformal) orbifolds also `resolve singularities' just as in the conformalcase. Moreover we recover the OPE of twist operators for conformal theories byconsidering the UV limit of the massive orbifold correlation functions.Alternatively, we can use the OPE of twist fields at the conformal point toderive conditions for the existence of non-singular solutions to specialnon-linear differential equations (such as Painleve III).
