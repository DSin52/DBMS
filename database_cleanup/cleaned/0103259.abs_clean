We investigate quantum field theory in a bulk space with boundary, whichrepresents a 3-brane. Both flat and anti-de Sitter backgrounds are considered.The basic idea is to keep local commutativity only on the brane, giving up thisrequirement in the bulk. We explore the consequences of this proposal,constructing a large family of nonlocal bulk fields, whose brane relatives arelocal. We estimate the ultraviolet behavior of these local brane fields,characterizing a subfamily which generates renormalizable theories on thebrane. The issue of brane conformal invariance and the relation between bulkand brane conserved currents are also examined in this framework.
