We derive all covariant and consistent divergence and commutator anomalies ofchiral QED$_2$ within the framework of canonical quantization of the fermions.Further, we compute the time evolution of all occurring operators and find thatall commutators evolve canonically. We comment on the relation of our resultsto the finding of a nontrivial U(1)-curvature in gauge-field space.
