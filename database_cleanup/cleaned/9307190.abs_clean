We simplify and generalize an argument due to Bowcock and Watts showing thatone can associate a finite Lie algebra (the `classical vacuum preservingalgebra') containing the M\"obius $sl(2)$ subalgebra to any classical$\W$-algebra. Our construction is based on a kinematical analysis of thePoisson brackets of quasi-primary fields. In the case of the $\W_\S^\G$-algebraconstructed through the Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction based on an arbitrary$sl(2)$ subalgebra $\S$ of a simple Lie algebra $\G$, we exhibit a naturalisomorphism between this finite Lie algebra and $\G$ whereby the M\"obius$sl(2)$ is identified with $\S$.
