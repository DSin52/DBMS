Title: Conformal Field Theory Correlators From sine-Gordon Model on AdS

SpacetimeAuthors: Sze-Shiang Feng and Mu-Lin Yan

Comments: Latex, 8 pages, no figures

Using the proposed AdS/CFT correspondence, we calculate the correlators ofoperators of conformal field theory at the boundary of AdS$_{d+1}$corresponding to the sine-Gordon model in the bulk.
