It was shown by Connes, Douglas, Schwarz[1] that one can compactify M(atrix)theory on noncommutative torus. We prove that compactifications on Moritaequivalent tori are physically equivalent. This statement can be considered asa generalization of non-classical duality conjectured in [1] fortwo-dimensional tori.
