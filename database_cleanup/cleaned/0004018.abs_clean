DimensionComments: Tex file, 3 pages

Journal-ref: Entropy 3 (2001) 12-26

A straightforward two-line derivation of the Bekenstein-Hawking Area-Entropyrelation for Black-Holes in {\bf any} dimension is shown based on Shannon'sinformation theory and Clifford algebras required by the New RelativityPrinciple.
