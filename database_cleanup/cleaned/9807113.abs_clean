We show that each rigid symmetry of a D-string action is contained in afamily of infinitely many symmetries. In particular, kappa-invariant D-stringactions have infinitely many supersymmetries. The result is not restricted tostandard D-string actions, but holds for any two-dimensional action dependingon an abelian world-sheet gauge field only via the field strength. It appliesthus also to manifestly $SL(2,Z)$ covariant D-string actions. Furthermore, itextends analogously to $d$-dimensional actions with $(d-1)$-form gaugepotentials, such as brane actions with dynamical tension.
