We consider non-perturbative six and four dimensional N=1 space-timesupersymmetric orientifolds. Some states in such compactifications arise in``twisted'' open string sectors which lack world-sheet description in terms ofD-branes. Using Type I-heterotic duality we are able to obtain the masslessspectra for some of such orientifolds. The four dimensional compactification wediscuss in this context is an example of a chiral N=1 supersymmetric stringvacuum which is non-perturbative in both orientifold and heterotic pictures. Inparticular, it contains both D9- and D5-branes plus non-perturbative``twisted'' open string sector states as well.
