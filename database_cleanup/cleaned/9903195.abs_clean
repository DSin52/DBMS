We review some of the problems associated with deriving field theoreticresults from nonsupersymmetric AdS, focusing on how to control the behavior ofthe field theory along the flat directions. We discuss an example in which theorigin of the moduli space remains a stable vacuum at finite $N$, and arguethat it corresponds to an interacting CFT in three dimensions. Associated tothis fixed point is a statement of nonsupersymmetric duality. Because 1/Ncorrections may change the global picture of the RG flow, the statement ofduality is much weaker than in the supersymmetric case.
