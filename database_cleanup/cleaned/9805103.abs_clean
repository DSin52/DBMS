pages. To be published in the proceedings of SILAFAE'98, April 8-11, SanJuan, Puerto RicoIn this work we study the dynamical generation of a fermion mass induced by aconstant and uniform external magnetic field in an Abelian gauge model with aYukawa term. We show that the Yukawa coupling not only enhances the dynamicalgeneration of the mass, but it substantially decreases the magnetic fieldrequired for the mass to be generated at temperatures comparable to theelectroweak critical temperature. These results indicate that if large enoughprimordial magnetic fields were present during the early universe evolution,the field-induced generation of fermion masses, which in turn corresponds tothe generation of fermion bound states, may play an important role in theelectroweak phase transition.
