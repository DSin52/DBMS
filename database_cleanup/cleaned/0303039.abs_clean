By using the hybrid formalism, superstrings in four-dimensional NS-NS planewaves are studied in a manifest supersymmetric manner. This description of thesuperstring is obtained by a field redefinition of the RNS worldsheet fieldsand defined as a topological N=4 string theory. The Hilbert space consists oftwo types of representations describing short and long strings. We study thephysical spectrum to find boson-fermion asymmetry in the massless spectrum ofthe short string. Some massive spectrum of the short string and the masslessspectrum of the long string are also studied.
