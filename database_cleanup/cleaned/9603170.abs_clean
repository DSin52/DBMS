We discuss how transitions in the space of heterotic K3*T^2 compactificationsare mapped by duality into transitions in the space of Type IIcompactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds. We observe that perturbativesymmetry restoration, as well as non-perturbative processes such as changes inthe number of tensor multiplets, have at least in many cases a simpledescription in terms of the reflexive polyhedra of the Calabi-Yau manifolds.Our results suggest that to many, perhaps all, four-dimensional N=2 heteroticvacua there are corresponding type II vacua.
