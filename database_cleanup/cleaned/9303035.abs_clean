Title: Quantum-double for a nonstandard deformation of a Borel subalgebra

$sl(2,C)$Comments: 9 pages

We give a construction of Drienfeld's quantum double for a nonstandarddeformation of Borel subalgebra of $sl(2)$. We construct explicitly some simplerepresentations of this quantum algebra and from the universal R-matrix weobtain the explicit solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation in those cases.
