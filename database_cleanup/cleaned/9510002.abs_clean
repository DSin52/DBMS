2299-2304A pseudoclassical theory of Weyl particle in the space--time dimensions$D=2n$ is constructed. The canonical quantization of that pseudoclassicaltheory is carried out and it results in the theory of the $D=2n$ dimensionalWeyl particle in the Foldy--Wouthuysen representation. A quantum mechanics ofthe neutral Weyl particle in even--dimensional space--time is suggested and theconnection of this theory with the theory of Mayorana--Weyl particle in QFT isdiscussed for $D=10$.
