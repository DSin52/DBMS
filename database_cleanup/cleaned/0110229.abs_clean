By rigorous reanalysis of the results, we have proven that the propagators atfinite temperature for scalar bound states in one-generation fermion condensatescheme of electroweak symmetry breaking are in fact identical in theimaginary-time and the real-time formalism. This dismisses the doubt aboutpossible discrepancy between the two formalisms in this problem. Identity ofthe derived thermal transformation matrices of the real-time matrix propagatorsfor scalar bound states without and with chemical potential and the ones forcorresponding elementary scalar particles shows similarity of thermodynamicproperty between the two types of particles. Only one former inference ismodified, i.e. when the two flavors of fermions have unequal nonzero masses,the amplitude of the composite Higgs particle will decay instead grow in time.
