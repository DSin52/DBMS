We show that the embedding of either a static or a time dependent maximally3-symmetric brane with non-zero spatial curvature $k$ into a non-compactified$AdS_5$ bulk does not yield exponential suppression of the geometry away fromthe brane. Implications of this result for brane-localized gravity arediscussed.
