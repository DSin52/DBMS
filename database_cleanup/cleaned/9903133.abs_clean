We analytically and numerically investigate the 't Hooft-Bergknoff-Ellerequations, the lowest order mesonic Light-Front Tamm-Dancoff equations forU(N_C) and SU(N_C) gauge theories. We find the wavefunction can be wellapproximated by new basis functions and obtain an analytic formula for the massof the lightest bound state. Its value is consistent with the precedentresults.
