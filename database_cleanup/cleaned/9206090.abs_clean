We obtain in closed form averages of polynomials, taken over hermitianmatrices with the Gaussian measure involved in the Kontsevich integral, andprove a conjecture of Witten enabling one to express analogous averages withthe full (cubic potential) measure, as derivatives of the partition functionwith respect to traces of inverse odd powers of the external argument. Theproofs are based on elementary algebraic identities involving a new set ofinvariant polynomials of the linear group, closely related to the general Schurfunctions.
