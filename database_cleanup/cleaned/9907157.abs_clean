We construct non-BPS dyon solutions of N=4 SU(n) supersymmetric Yang-Millstheory. These solutions are the worldvolume solitons which describe non-BPSType IIB non-planar string junctions connecting n parallel D3-branes. Thesolutions are smooth deformations of the 1/4 BPS states which describe planarstring junctions.
