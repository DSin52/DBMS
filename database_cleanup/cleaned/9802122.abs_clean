This paper deals with classical solutions of the modified chiral model on$R^{2+1}$. Such solutions are shown to correspond to products of various factorwhich we call time-dependent unitons. Then the problem of solving the system ofsecond-order partial differential equations for the chiral field is reduced tosolving a sequence of systems of first-order partial differential equations forthe unitons.
