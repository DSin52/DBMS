We analyse the famous Baxter's $T-Q$ equations for $XXX$ ($XXZ$) spin chainand show that apart from its usual polynomial (trigonometric) solution, whichprovides the solution of Bethe-Ansatz equations, there exists also the secondsolution which should corresponds to Bethe-Ansatz beyond $N/2$. This secondsolution of Baxter's equation plays essential role and together with the firstone gives rise to all fusion relations.
