We study the $W_\infty$ algebra in the Calegero-Sutherland model using theexchange operators. The presence of all the sub-algebras of $W_\infty$ is shownin this model. A simplified proof for this algebra, in the symmetric orderedbasics, is given. It is pointed out that the algebra contains in general,nonlinear terms. Possible connection to the nonlinear $W_\infty$ is discussed.
