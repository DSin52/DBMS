We propose a dynamical mechanism to induce gauge fields in four dimensionalspace-time from a single scalar field or a spinor field in higher dimensions.The Born-Oppenheimer treatment of the extra dimensions is an essentialingredient in our approach. A possible applications of the idea to lowdimensional condensed matter systems and high temperature field theory are alsopointed out. This paper is an extended version of our previous unpublished work(SUNY-NTG-89-48, Jan. 1990).
