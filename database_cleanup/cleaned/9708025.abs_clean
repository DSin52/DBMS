We give an invariant classification of orbits of the fundamentalrepresentations of exceptional groups $E_{7(7)}$ and $E_{6(6)}$ which classifyBPS states in string and M theories toroidally compactified to d=4 and d=5. Theexceptional Jordan algebra and the exceptional Freudenthal triple system andtheir cubic and quartic invariants play a major role in this classification.The cubic and quartic invariants correspond to the black hole entropy in d=5and d=4, respectively. The classification of BPS states preserving differentnumbers of supersymmetries is in close parallel to the classification of thelittle groups and the orbits of timelike, lightlike and space-like vectors inMinkowski space. The orbits of BPS black holes in N=2 Maxwell-Einsteinsupergravity theories in d=4 and d=5 with symmetric space geometries are alsoclassified including the exceptional N=2 theory that has $E_{7(-25)}$ and$E_{6(-26)}$ as its symmety in the respective dimensions.
