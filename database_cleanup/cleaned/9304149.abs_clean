The affine Toda field theories based on the non simply-laced Lie algebras arediscussed. By rewriting the S-matrix formulae found by Delius et al, auniversal form for the coupling-constant dependence of these models isobtained, and related to various general properties of the classical couplings.This is illustrated via the S-matrix associated with the dual pair of algebras$f_4^{(1)}$ and $e_6^{(2)}$.
