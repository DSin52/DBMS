Free field representations of the affine superalgebra $A(1,0)^{(1)}$ at level$k$ are needed in the description of the noncritical $N=2$ string. Thesuperalgebra admits two inequivalent choices of simple roots. We give theWakimoto representations corresponding to each of these and derive the relationbetween the two at the quantum level.
