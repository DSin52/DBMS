We discuss the problem of tachyon condensation in the framework of backgroundindependent open string field theory. We show, in particular, that thecomputation of the string field theory action simplifies considerably if onelooks at closed string backgrounds with a large B field, and can be carried outexactly for a generic tachyon profile. We confirm previous results on the formof the exact tachyon potential, and we find, within this framework, solitonicsolutions which correspond to lower dimensional unstable branes.
