boundary conditions at infinity addedThe correlator of a Wilson loop with a local operator in N=4 SYM theory canbe represented by a string amplitude in AdS(5)xS(5). This amplitude describesan overlap of the boundary state, which is associated with the loop, with thestring mode, which is dual to the local operator. For chiral primary operatorswith a large R charge, the amplitude can be calculated by semiclassicaltechniques. We compare the semiclassical string amplitude to the SYMperturbation theory and find an exact agrement to the first two non-vanishingorders.
