We discuss the relation between the Ramond-Ramond charges of D-branes and thetopology of Chan-Paton vector bundles. We show that a topologically nontrivialnormal bundle induces RR charge and that the result fits in perfectly with theproposal that D-brane charge is the topology of the Chan-Paton bundle, regardedas an element of K-theory.
