Title: On the Linearized Artin Braid Representation

Comments: 13 pages. Frankfurt a. M. preprint

We linearize the Artin representation of the braid group given by (right)automorphisms of a free group providing a linear faithful representation of thebraid group. This result is generalized to obtain linear representations forthe coloured braid groupoid and pure braid group too. Applications to someareas of two-dimensional physics are discussed.
