Evidence for the possible existence of a quantum process opposite to thefamous Hawking radiation (evaporation) of black holes is presented. This newphenomenon could be very relevant in the case of exotic multiple horizon Nariaiblack holes and in the context of common grand unified theories. This isclearly manifested in the case of the SO(10) GUT, that is here investigated indetail. The remarkable result is obtained, that anti-evaporation can occurthere only in the SUSY version of the theory. It is thus concluded that theexistence of primordial black holes in the present Universe might be consideredas an evidence for supersymmetry.
