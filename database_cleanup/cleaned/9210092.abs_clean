Supersymmetric theories in four dimensions with chiral superfields have veryrich BRS cohomology, which gives rise to potential anomalies in theories thatcontain composite antichiral spinor superfields. Assuming the coefficients arenon-zero, absence of the anomalies would generate new constraints on theories.In addition, the anomalies give rise to a new kind of supersymmetry breakingwhich is quite different from the known kinds, and also naturally yields a zerocosmological constant after supersymmetry breaking.
