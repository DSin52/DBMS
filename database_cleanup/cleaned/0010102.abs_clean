We consider Wilson loop observables for Chern-Simons theory at large N andits topological string dual and extend the previous checks for this duality tothe case of links. We find an interesting structure involvingrepresentation/spin degeneracy of branes ending on branes which features in thelarge N dual description of Chern-Simons theory. This leads to a refinement ofthe integer invariants for links and knots. We illustrate our results withexplicit computations on the Chern-Simons side.
