We study the boundary states of D-branes wrapped around supersymmetric cyclesin a general Calabi-Yau manifold. In particular, we show how the geometric dataon the cycles are encoded in the boundary states. As an application, we analyzehow the mirror symmetry transforms D-branes, and we verify that it isconsistent with the conjectured periodicity and the monodromy of theRamond-Ramond field configuration on a Calabi-Yau manifold. This also enablesus to study open string worldsheet instanton corrections and relate them toclosed string instanton counting. The cases when the mirror symmetry isrealized as T-duality are also discussed.
