In a recent paper Dargis and Mathieu introduced integrodifferential odd flowsfor the supersymmetric KdV equation. These flows are obtained from the nonlocalconservation laws associated with the fourth root of its Lax operator. In thisnote I show that only half of these flows are of the standard Lax form, whilethe remaining half provide us with hamiltonians for an SKdV-type reduction of anew supersymmetric hierarchy. This new hierarchy is shown to be closely relatedto the Jacobian supersymmetric KP-hierarchy of Mulase and Rabin. A detailedstudy of the algebra of additional symmetries of this new hierarchy revealsthat it is isomorphic to the super-W_{1+\infty} algebra, thus making it acandidate for a possible interrelationship between superintegrability andtwo-dimensional supergravity.
