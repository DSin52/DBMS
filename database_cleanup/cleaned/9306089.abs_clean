The general solutions for the factorization equations of the reflectionmatrices $K^{\pm}(\theta)$ for the eight vertex and six vertex models (XYZ, XXZand XXX chains) are found. The associated integrable magnetic Hamiltonians areexplicitly derived, finding families dependig on several continuous as well asdiscrete parameters.
