We construct the gauge field and graviton propagators in Euclidean AdS(d+1)space-time by two different methods. In the first method the gauge invariantMaxwell or linearized Ricci operator is applied directly to bitensor ansatzefor the propagators which reflect their gauge structure. This leads to a rapiddetermination of the physical part of the propagators in terms of elementaryfunctions. The second method is a more traditional approach using covariantgauge fixing which leads to a solution for both physical and gauge parts of thepropagators. The gauge invariant parts agree in both methods.
