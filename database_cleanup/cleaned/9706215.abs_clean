Title: Normal Biconformal Spaces

Comments: 32 pages, plain TeX, no figures

A new 8-dimensional conformal gauging avoids the unphysical size change,third order gravitational field equations, and auxiliary fields that preventtaking the conformal group as a fundamental symmetry. We give the structureequations, gauge transformations and intrinsic metric structure for the newbiconformal spaces. We prove that a torsion-free biconformal space with exactWeyl form, closed dilational curvature and trace-free spacetime curvatureadmits a sub-bundle of vanishing Weyl form homeomorphic to the Whitney sumbundle of the tangent bundle and the bundle of orthonormal Lorentz frames over4-dimensional spacetime. Conversely, any 4-dimensional spacetime extendsuniquely to such a normal biconformal space. The Einstein equation holds if andonly if the biconformal basis is orthonormal. Unconstrained antisymmetric traceof the spacetime curvature provides a closed 2-form, independent of the Weylvector, consistently interpretable as the electromagnetic field. The trace ofthe spacetime co-torsion decouples from gravitational sources and serves aselectromagnetic source.
