It is shown that the Affine Toda models (AT) constitute a ``gauge fixed''version of the Conformal Affine Toda model (CAT). This result enables one tomap every solution of the AT models into an infinite number of solutions of thecorresponding CAT models, each one associated to a point of the orbit of theconformal group. The Hirota's $\tau$-function are introduced and solitonsolutions for the AT and CAT models associated to $\hat {SL}(r+1)$ and $\hat{SP}(r)$ are constructed.
