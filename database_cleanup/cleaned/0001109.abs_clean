We use the manifestly N=2 supersymmetric, off-shell, harmonic (or twistor)superspace approach to solve the constraints implied by four-dimensional N=2superconformal symmetry on the N=2 non-linear sigma-model target space, knownas the special hyper-K"ahler geometry. Our general solution is formulated interms of a homogeneous (of degree two) function of unconstrained (analytic)Fayet-Sohnius hypermultiplet superfields. We also derive the improved (N=2superconformal) actions for the off-shell (constrained) N=2 projectivehypermultiplets, and relate them (via non-conformal deformations) to theasymptotically locally-flat (ALF) A_k and D_k series of the gravitationalinstantons. The same metrics describe Kaluza-Klein monopoles in M-theory, whilethey also arise in the quantum moduli spaces of N=4 supersymmetric gauge fieldtheories with SU(2) gauge group and matter hypermultiplets in three spacetimedimensions. We comment on rotational isometries versus translational isometriesin the context of N=2 NLSM in terms of projective hypermultiplets.
