problems in texing earlier version. Revised to eliminate appendices. Usesboxedeps.tex for figuresWe introduce the notion of cyclic cohomology of an A-infinity algebra andshow that the deformations of an A-infinity algebra which preserve an invariantinner product are classified by this cohomology. We use this result toconstruct some cycles on the moduli space of algebraic curves. The paper alsocontains a review of some well known notions and results about Hochschild andcyclic cohomology of associative algebras, A-infinity algebras, and deformationtheory of algebras, and includes a discussion of the homology of the graphcomplex of metric ribbon graphs which is associated to the moduli space ofRiemann surfaces with marked points.
