The constraints proposed recently by Bershadsky to produce $W^l_n$ algebrasare a mixture of first and second class constraints and are degenerate. We showthat they admit a first-class subsystem from which they can be recovered bygauge-fixing, and that the non-degenerate constraints can be handled byprevious methods. The degenerate constraints present a new situation in whichthe natural primary field basis for the gauge-invariants is rational ratherthan polynomial. We give an algorithm for constructing the rational basis andconverting the base elements to polynomials.
