We introduce the massive gauge invariant, second order pure spin-3 theory inthree dimensions. It consists of the addition of the second order gaugeinvariant massless pure spin-3 action with the first ordertopological(generalized) Chern-Simons spin-3 term corrected with lower spinauxiliary actions which avoid lower spin ghosts propagation. This second orderintermediate action completes the catalogue of massive spin-3 actions havingtopological structure. We also consider its spontaneous break down through theaddition of the inertial spin-3 nontopological Fierz-Pauli mass term. It isshown that this non gauge invariant pure spin-3 system is the uniformgeneralization of linearized massive vector Chern-Simons gravity and propagatesjust two spin $3^{\pm}$ excitations having different masses.
