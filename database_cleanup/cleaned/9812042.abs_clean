Comments: 14 pages, LATEX. LATEX error corrected

We review some properties of the field equations of six-dimensional (1,0)supergravity coupled to tensor and vector multiplets, and in particular theirrelation to covariant and consistent anomalies and a peculiar Noether identityfor the energy-momentum tensor. We also describe a lagrangian formulation forthis system, obtained applying the Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin prescription.
