We study branes and orientifolds on the group manifold of SO(3). We considerparticularly the case of the equatorial branes, which are projective planes. Weshow that a Dirac-Born-Infeld action can be defined on them, although they arenot orientable. We find that there are two orientifold projections with thesame spacetime action, which differ by their action on equatorial branes.
