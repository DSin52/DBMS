Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equations for twisted conformal blocks oncompact Riemann surfaces with marked points are written explicitly in a generalprojective structure in terms of correlation functions in the theory of twistedb-c systems. It is checked that on the moduli space the equations provide aflat connection with the spectral parameter.
