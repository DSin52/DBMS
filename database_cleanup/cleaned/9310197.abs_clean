We show that the WZNW model with arbitrary $\sigma$-model coupling constantmay be viewed as a $\sigma$-model perturbation of the WZNW theory around theWitten conformal point. In order for the $\sigma$-model perturbation to berelevant, the level $k$ of the underlying affine algebra has to be negative. Weprove that in the large $|k|$ limit the perturbed WZNW system with negative $k$flows to the conformal WZNW model with positive level. The flow appears to beintegrable due to the existence of conserved currents satisfying the Laxequation. This fact is in a favorable agreement with the integrability of theWZNW model discovered by Polyakov and Wiegmann within the Bethe ansatztechnique.
