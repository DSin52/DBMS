Almost all known instanton solutions in noncommutative Yang-Mills theory havebeen obtained in the modified ADHM scheme. In this paper we employ twoalternative methods for the construction of the self-dual U(2) BPST instantonon a noncommutative Euclidean four-dimensional space with self-dualnoncommutativity tensor. Firstly, we use the method of dressingtransformations, an iterative procedure for generating solutions from a givenseed solution, and thereby generalize Belavin's and Zakharov's work to thenoncommutative setup. Secondly, we relate the dressing approach with Ward'ssplitting method based on the twistor construction and rederive the solution inthis context. It seems feasible to produce nonsingular noncommutativemulti-instantons with these techniques.
