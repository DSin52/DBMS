Title: Phase Space Discretization and Moyal Quantization

Authors: Ryuji Kemmoku and Satoru Saito

Comments: 8 pages

The Moyal quantization is described as a discretization of the classicalphase space by using difference analogue of vector fields. Difference analogueof Lie brackets plays the role of Heisenberg commutators.
