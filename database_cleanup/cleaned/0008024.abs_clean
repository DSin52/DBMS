Torino 15-20/12/96, D. Bambusi and G. Gaeta Ed. (1998) p. 204-244Invariant functions under the transformations of a compact linear group $G$acting in $\real^n$ can be expressed in terms of functions defined in the orbitspace of $G$. We develop a method to determine the isotropy classes of theorbit spaces of all the real linear groups whose integrity bases (IB) satisfyonly one independent relation. The method is tested for IB's formed by 3(independent) basic invariants. The result is obtained through a metric matrix$\hat P(p)$, defined only from the scalar products between the gradients of aminimal IB. We determine the matrices $\wP(p)$ from a universal differentialequation, which satisfy new convenient additional conditions, which fit for thenon-coregular case. Our results may be relevant in physical contexts where thestudy of covariant or invariant functions is important, like in thedetermination of patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum fieldtheory, in the analysis of phase spaces and structural phase transitions(Landau's theory), in covariant bifurcation theory, in crystal field theory andso on.
