The (2+1)-dimensional Thirring model is studied by using the Gaussianapproximation method in the functional Schr\"odinger picture. Although thedynamical symmetry breaking does not occur in the large N limit, it does occurin the Gaussian approximation which includes the higher order contributions in1/N.
