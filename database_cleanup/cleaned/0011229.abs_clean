Quantum Field TheoryAuthors: J. W. Moffat

remain the sameThe unitarity condition for scattering amplitudes in a non-anticommutativequantum field theory is investigated. The Cutkosky rules are shown to hold forFeynman diagrams in Euclidean momentum space and unitarity of amplitudes can besatisfied. An analytic continuation of the diagrams to physical Minkowskispacetime can be performed without invoking unphysical singularities inamplitudes. The high energy behavior of amplitudes is found to be regular atinfinity provided that only space-space non-anticommutativity is allowed.
