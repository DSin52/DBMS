In the pseudo-euclidean metrics Chern-Simons gauge theory in the infraredregion is found to be associated with dissipative dynamics. In the infraredlimit the Lagrangian of 2+1 dimensional pseudo-euclidean topologically massiveelectrodynamics has indeed the same form of the Lagrangian of the dampedharmonic oscillator. On the hyperbolic plane a set of two damped harmonicoscillators, each other time-reversed, is shown to be equivalent to a singleundamped harmonic oscillator. The equations for the damped oscillators areproven to be the same as the ones for the Lorentz force acting on two particlescarrying opposite charge in a constant magnetic field and in the electricharmonic potential. This provides an immediate link with Chern-Simons-likedynamics of Bloch electrons in solids propagating along the lattice plane withhyperbolic energy surface. The symplectic structure of the reduced theory isfinally discussed in the Dirac constrained canonical formalism.
