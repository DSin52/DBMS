This work is intended as a pedagogical introduction to M-theory and to itsmaximally supersymmetric toroidal compactifications, in the frameworks of 11Dsupergravity, type II string theory and M(atrix) theory. U-duality is used asthe main tool and guideline in uncovering the spectrum of BPS states. We reviewthe 11D supergravity algebra and elementary 1/2-BPS solutions, discussT-duality in the perturbative and non-perturbative sectors from an algebraicpoint of view, and apply the same tools to the analysis of U-duality at thelevel of the effective action and the BPS spectrum, with a particular emphasison Weyl and Borel generators. We derive the U-duality multiplets of BPSparticles and strings, U-duality invariant mass formulae for 1/2- and 1/4-BPSstates for general toroidal compactifications on skew tori with gaugebackgrounds, and U-duality multiplets of constraints for states to preserve agiven fraction of supersymmetry. A number of mysterious states are encounteredin D<=3, whose existence is implied by T-duality and 11D Lorentz invariance. Wethen move to the M(atrix) theory point of view, give an introduction toDiscrete Light Cone Quantization (DLCQ) in general and DLCQ of M-theory inparticular. We discuss the realization of U-duality as electric-magneticdualities of the Matrix gauge theory, display the Matrix gauge theory BPSspectrum in detail, and discuss the conjectured extended U-duality group inthis scheme.
