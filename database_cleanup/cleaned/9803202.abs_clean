288-304A modification of the harmonic superfield formalism in $D=4, N=2$supergravity using a subsidiary condition of covariance under the backgroundsupersymmetry with a central charge ($B$-covariance) is considered.Conservation of analyticity together with the $B$-covariance leads to theappearance of linear gravitational superfields. Analytic prepotentials arise ina decomposition of the background linear superfields in terms of spinorcoordinates and transform in a nonstandard way under the backgroundsupersymmetry. The linear gravitational superfields can be written via spinorderivatives of nonanalytic spinor prepotentials. The perturbative expansion ofthe extended supergravity action in terms of the $B$-covariant superfields andthe corresponding version of the differential-geometric formalism areconsidered. We discuss the dual harmonic representation of the linearizedextended supergravity, which corresponds to the dynamical condition ofGrassmann analyticity.
