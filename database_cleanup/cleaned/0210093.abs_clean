We perform a one-loop calculation of the vacuum energy of a tachyon field inanti de-Sitter space with boundary conditions corresponding to the presence ofa double-trace operator in the dual field theory. Such an operator can lead toa renormalization group flow between two different conformal field theoriesrelated to each other by a Legengre transformation in the large N limit. Thecalculation of the one-loop vacuum energy enables us to verify the holographicc-theorem one step beyond the classical supergravity approximation.
