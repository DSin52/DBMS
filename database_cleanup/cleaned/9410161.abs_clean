Title: Dimensionality as a Perturbation Parameter in the Generalized Hydrogen

AtomAuthors: C.R. Hagen

Comments: 5 pages, UR1392, ER-40685-841

A recent suggestion has been made that the hydrogen bound state spectrumshould not depend on the number of spatial dimensions. It is pointed out herethat the uncertainty principle implies that such differences must exist andthat a perturbation expansion in the dimensionality parameter yields a precisequantitative confirmation of the effect.
