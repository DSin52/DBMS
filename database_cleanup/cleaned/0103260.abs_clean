We adress ourselves the question of the quantum equivalence of non abeliandualised $\si$-models on the simple example of the T-dualised $SU(2)\si$-model. This theory is classically canonically equivalent to the standardchiral $SU(2) \si$-model. It is known that the equivalence also holds at thefirst order in perturbations with the same $\be$ functions. However, this modelhas been claimed to be non-renormalisable at the two-loop order. The aim of thepresent work is the proof that it is - at least up to this order - stillpossible to define a correct quantum theory. Its target space metric being onlymodified in a finite manner, all divergences are reabsorbed into coupling andfields (infinite) renormalisations.
