We argue that the description of meson-nucleon dynamics based on theboson-exchange approach, is compatible with the description of the nucleon as asoliton in the nonrelativistic limit. Our arguments are based on an analysis ofthe meson-soliton form factor and the exact meson-soliton and soliton-solitonscattering amplitudes in the Sine-Gordon model.
