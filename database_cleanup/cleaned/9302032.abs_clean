We discuss the structure of correlators involving the spinor emission vertexin non critical $N=1$ superstring theory. The technique used in the computationis the zero mode integration to arrive at the integral representation, andlater an analysis of the pole structure of the integrals which are thusobtained. Our analysis has been done primarily for the 5-point functions. Theresult confirms previous expectations and prepares ground for a comparison withcomputations using matrix models techniques.
