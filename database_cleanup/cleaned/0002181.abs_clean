We introduce the notion of fractal index associated with the universal class$h$ of particles or quasiparticles, termed fractons, which obey specificfractal statistics. A connection between fractons and conformal fieldtheory(CFT)-quasiparticles is established taking into account the centralcharge $c[\nu]$ and the particle-hole duality$\nu\longleftrightarrow\frac{1}{\nu}$, for integer-value $\nu$ of thestatistical parameter. In this way, we derive the Fermi velocity in terms ofthe central charge as $v\sim\frac{c[\nu]}{\nu+1}$. The Hausdorff dimension $h$which labelled the universal classes of particles and the conformal anomaly aretherefore related. Following another route, we also established a connectionbetween Rogers dilogarithm function, Farey series of rational numbers and theHausdorff dimension.
