The problem of quantum equivalence between non-linear sigma models related byAbelian or non-Abelian T-duality is studied in perturbation theory. Using theanomalous Ward identity for Weyl symmetry we derive a relation between the Weylanomaly coefficients of the original and dual theories. The analysis is notrestricted to conformally invariant backgrounds. The formalism is applied tothe study of two examples. The first is a model based on SU(2) non-Abelian Tduality. The second represents a simple realization of Poisson-Lie T dualityinvolving the Drinfeld double based on SU(2). In both cases quantum T dualityis established at the 1-loop level.
