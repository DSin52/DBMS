Title: Self-interaction effects on screening in three-dimensional QED

Journal-ref: J.Phys. A33 (2000) 1915-1919

We have shown that self interaction effects in massive quantumelectrodynamics can lead to the formation of bound states of quark antiquarkpairs. A current-current fermion coupling term is introduced, which induces awell in the potential energy profile. Explicit expressions of the effectivepotential and renormalized parameters are provided.
