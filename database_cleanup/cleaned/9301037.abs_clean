Using the appropriate representation of the Poincare group and a definitionof minimal coupling, we discuss some aspects of the electromagneticinteractions of charged anyons. In a nonrelativistic expansion, we derive aSchrodinger-type equation for the anyon wave function which includesspin-magnetic field and spin-orbit couplings. In particular, the gyromagneticratio for charged anyons is shown to be 2; this last result is essentially areflection of the fact that the spin is parallel to the momentum in (2+1)dimensions.
