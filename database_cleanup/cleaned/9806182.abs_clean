We study the doubly charged Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger (CGHS) model,which has black hole solutions that were found to be U-dual to the D1-D5-KKblack holes of the IIB supergravity. We derive the action of the model via aspontaneous compactification on S^3 of the IIB supergravity on S^1*T^4 andobtain the general static solutions including black holes corresponding tocertain non-asymptotically flat black holes in the IIB supergravity.Thermodynamics of them is established by computing the entropy, temperature,chemical potentials, and mass in the two-dimensional setup, and the first lawof thermodynamics is explicitly verified. The entropy is in precise agreementwith that of the D1-D5-KK black holes, and the mass turns out to be consistentwith the infinite Lorentz boost along the M theory circle that is a part of theaforementioned U-dual chain.
