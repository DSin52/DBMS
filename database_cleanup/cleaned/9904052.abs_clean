Differential realizations in coordinate space for deformed Lie algebras withthree generators are obtained using bosonic creation and annihilation operatorssatisfying Heisenberg commutation relations. The unified treatment presentedhere contains as special cases all previously given coordinate realizations of$so(2,1),so(3)$ and their deformations. Applications to physical problemsinvolving eigenvalue determination in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics arediscussed.
