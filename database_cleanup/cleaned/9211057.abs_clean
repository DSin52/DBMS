A suggestion on how black holes may appear in Das-Jevicki Collective fieldtheory is given. We study the behaviour of a `test' particle when energy issent into the system. A perturbation moving near the potential barrier cancreate a large-distance black hole geometry where the seeming curvaturesingularity is at the position of the barrier. In the simplest `static' casethe exact $D=2$ black hole metric emerges.
