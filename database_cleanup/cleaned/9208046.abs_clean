571-582We consider the deformations of ``monomial solutions'' to GeneralizedKontsevich Model \cite{KMMMZ91a,KMMMZ91b} and establish the relation betweenthe flows generated by these deformations with those of $N=2$ Landau-Ginzburgtopological theories. We prove that the partition function of a genericGeneralized Kontsevich Model can be presented as a product of some``quasiclassical'' factor and non-deformed partition function which dependsonly on the sum of Miwa transformed and flat times. This result is importantfor the restoration of explicit $p-q$ symmetry in the interpolation patternbetween all the $(p,q)$-minimal string models with $c<1$ and for revealing itsintegrable structure in $p$-direction, determined by deformations of thepotential. It also implies the way in which supersymmetric Landau-Ginzburgmodels are embedded into the general context of GKM. From the point of view ofintegrable theory these deformations present a particular case of what iscalled equivalent hierarchies.
