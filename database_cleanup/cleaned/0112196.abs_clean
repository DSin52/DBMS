The AdS/CFT correspondence can be realized in spaces that are globallycompact AdS space and the space generated by a large number of coincidentbranes. We discuss the physical consistency, in the sense of the Cauchyproblem, of these two formulations. We show that the role of the boundary inthe compact AdS space is equivalent to that of the flat asymptotic region inthe brane space. We also show, by introducing a second coordinate chart for thepure AdS space, that a point at its spatial infinity corresponds to a horizonin the brane system.
