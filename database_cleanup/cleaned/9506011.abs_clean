We show that the partition function of free Maxwell theory on a genericEuclidean four-manifold transforms in a non-trivial way under electric-magneticduality. The classical part of the partition sum can be mapped onto thegenus-one partition function of a 2d toroidal model, without the oscillatorcontributions. This map relates electric-magnetic duality to modular invarianceof the toroidal model and, conversely, the $O(d,d',\Z)$ duality to theinvariance of Maxwell theory under the 4d mapping class group. These dualitiesand the relation between toroidal models and Maxwell theory can be understoodby regarding both theories as dimensional reductions of a self-dual 2-formtheory in six dimensions. Generalizations to more $U(1)$-gauge fields andreductions from higher dimensions are also discussed. We find indications thatthe Abelian gauge theories related to 4d string theories with $N=4$ space-timesupersymmetry are exactly duality invariant.
