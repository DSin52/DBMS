Title: Mirror Maps and Instanton Sums for Complete Intersections in Weighted

Projective SpaceComments: 10 pages

Journal-ref: Mod.Phys.Lett. A9 (1994) 1807-1818

We consider a class of Calabi-Yau compactifications which are constructed asa complete intersection in weighted projective space. For manifolds with oneK\"ahler modulus we construct the mirror manifolds and calculate the instantonsum.
