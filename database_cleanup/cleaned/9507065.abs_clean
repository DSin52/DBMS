The affine Toda field theory is studied as a 2+1-dimensional system. Thethird dimension appears as the discrete space dimension, corresponding to thesimple roots in the $A_N$ affine root system, enumerated according to thecyclic order on the $A_N$ affine Dynkin diagram. We show that there exists anatural discretization of the affine Toda theory, where the equations of motionare invariant with respect to permutations of all discrete coordinates. Thediscrete evolution operator is constructed explicitly. The thermodynamic Betheansatz of the affine Toda system is studied in the limit $L,N\to\infty$. Someconjectures about the structure of the spectrum of the corresponding discretemodels are stated.
