Title: Aspects of $\kappa$--symmetry

Authors: E. Sezgin

Comments: 21 pages, plain tex, CTP TAMU-28/93. (Based on a talk given at the

Salamfest, Trieste, March 1993)We review various aspects of a fermionic gauge symmetry, known as the$\kappa$--symmetry, which plays an important role in formulations ofsuperstrings, supermembranes and higher dimensional extended objects. We alsoreview some aspects of the connection between $\kappa$--symmetric theories andtheir twistor-like formulations.
