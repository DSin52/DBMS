Title: Remarks on the Geometry of Wick Rotation in QFT and its Localization on

ManifoldsComments: 24 pages, 9 Postscript figures

The geometric aspect of Wick rotation in quantum field theory and itslocalization on manifolds are explored. After the explanation of the notion andits related geometric objects, we study the topology of the set of landing $W$for Wick rotations and its natural stratification. These structures in two,three, and four dimensions are computed explicitly. We then focus on moredetails in two dimensions. In particular, we study the embedding of $W$ in theambient space of Wick rotations, the resolution of the generic metricsingularities of a Lorentzian surface $\Sigma$ by local Wick rotations, andsome related $S^1$-bundles over $\Sigma$.
