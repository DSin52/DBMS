1706-1714In a space of arbitrary dimensions, the effect of an external magnetic fieldon the vacuum of a quantized charged scalar field is studied for the fieldconfiguration in the form of a singular vortex. The zeta-function technique isused to regularize ultraviolet divergences. The expression for the effectiveaction is derived. It is shown that the energy density and current induced inthe vacuum decrease exponentially at large distances from the vortex. Theanalytic properties of vacuum features as functions of the complex-valued spacedimension are discussed.
