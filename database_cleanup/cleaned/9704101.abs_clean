We provide world sheet non-supersymmetrical actions that describe thecoupling of a bosonic string to the tachyon and massless states of both thetype-B and type-O theories. The type-B theory is derived as a truncation andchiral doubling of the Ramond-Ramond sector in our previous model thatconnected the (1,0) heterotic string to a 10 D type IIB supergravitybackground. The type-O theory then follows from a ``fermionization'' of thetype-B theory.
