We obtain for the attractive Dirac delta-function potential intwo-dimensional quantum mechanics a renormalized formulation that avoidsreference to a cutoff and running coupling constant. Dimensional transmutationis carried out before attempting to solve the system, and leads to aninteresting eigenvalue problem in N-2 degrees of freedom (in the center ofmomentum frame) when there are N particles. The effective Hamiltonian for N-2particles has a nonlocal attractive interaction, and the Schrodinger equationbecomes an eigenvalue problem for the logarithm of this Hamiltonian. The 3-bodycase is examined in detail, and in this case a variational estimate of theground-state energy is given.
