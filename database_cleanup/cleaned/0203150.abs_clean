It is pointed out that a collider experiment involves a local contribution tothe energy-momentum tensor, a circumstance which not a common feature of thecurrent state of the Universe at large characterized by the cosmologicalconstant $\Lambda_0$. This contribution may be viewed as a change in thestructure of space-time from its large scale form governed by $\Lambda_0$ toone governed by a $\Lambda$ peculiar to the scale of the experiment. Possibleconsequences of this effect are explored by exploiting the asymptotic symmetryof space-time for non-vanishing $\Lambda$ and its relation to vacuum energy.
