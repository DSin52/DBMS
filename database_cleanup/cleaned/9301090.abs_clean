Previous results on quasi-classical limit of the KP and Toda hierarchies arenow extended to the BKP hierarchy. Basic tools such as the Lax representation,the Baker-Akhiezer function and the tau function are reformulated so as to fitinto the analysis of quasi-classical limit. Two subalgebras $\WB_{1+\infty}$and $\wB_{1+\infty}$ of the W-infinity algebras $W_{1+\infty}$ and$w_{1+\infty}$ are introduced as fundamental Lie algebras of the BKP hierarchyand its quasi-classical limit, the dispersionless BKP hierarchy. The quantumW-infinity algebra $\WB_{1+\infty}$ emerges in symmetries of the BKP hierarchy.In quasi-classical limit, these $\WB_{1+\infty}$ symmetries are shown to becontracted into $\wB_{1+\infty}$ symmetries of the dispersionless BKPhierarchy.
