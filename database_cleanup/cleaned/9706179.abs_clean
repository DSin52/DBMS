We discuss the existence of de Sitter inflationary solutions for thestring-inspired fourth-derivative gravity theories with dilaton field. Weconsider a space-time of arbitrary dimension D and an arbitraryparametrization of the target space metric. The specific features of the theoryin dimension D=4 and those of the special ghost-free parametrization of themetric are found. We also consider similar string-inspired theories withtorsion and construct an inflationary solution with torsion and dilaton forD=4. The stability of the inflationary solutions is also investigated.
