Title: The basic principles of geometrization of the quantum mechanics

Authors: K.B. Korotchenko (Tomsk Polytechnical University, Rossia)

Comments: 6 pages

The basic principles of the quantum mechanics in the K-field formalism (seeauthor's papers) are stated in the paper. K-field formalism arises fromgeometric generalization of de Broglie postulate. So, the quantum theoryequations (including well-known Schrodinger, Klein-Gordon and quadratic Diracequations) are obtained as the free wave equations on a manifold metrizingforce interactions of particles. In this paper, describing wave properties ofparticles we will restricted ourself with construction special geometricformulation of force interactions.
