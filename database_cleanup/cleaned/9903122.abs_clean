We develop two N=2 superfield formulations of free equations of motion forthe joint model of all D=4 massless higher-superspin fields in generating form.The explicit Osp(2|4) supersymmetry is achieved without exploiting the harmonicsuperspace, and with adding no auxiliary component fields to those of N=1superfields. The formulations are developed in two different Osp(2|4)homogeneous superspaces which have a structure of a fibre bundle over thestandard D=4 AdS superspace, with dimensions (7|4) and (7|8). The N=2 covariantderivatives in these spaces are expressed in terms of N=1 ones which givessimple rules for component analysis.
