Title: Massive Gauge Field Theory Without Higgs Mechanism IV. Illustration of

UnitarsityComments: 30 pages, latex, 9 figures

To illustrate the unitarity of the massive gauge field theory described inthe foregoing papers, we calculate the imaginary part of two-gauge boson andfermion-antifermion scattering amplitudes in the fourth order perturbativeapproximation. Through these calculations, we find that for a given process, ifall the diagrams are taken into account, the contributions arising from theunphysical intermediate states to the amplitudes are eventually cancelled out.Thus, the unitarity of the S-matrix is perfectly ensured.
