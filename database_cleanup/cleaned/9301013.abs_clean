Title: Fermionic Determinant of the Massive Schwinger Model

A representation for the fermionic determinant of the massive Schwingermodel, or $QED_2$, is obtained that makes a clean separation between theSchwinger model and its massive counterpart. From this it is shown that theindex theorem for $QED_2$ follows from gauge invariance, that the Schwingermodel's contribution to the determinant is canceled in the weak field limit,and that the determinant vanishes when the field strength is sufficientlystrong to form a zero-energy bound state.
