Perspectives in Theoretical Physics and Cosmology, Stephen Hawking's 60thBirthday WorshopThis is a slightly expanded version of my talk at Future Perspectives inTheoretical Physics and Cosmology, Stephen Hawking's 60th Birthday Worshop. Idescribe some of the issues that were important in gauged supergravity in the1980's and how these, and related issues have once again become important inthe study of holographic field theories.
