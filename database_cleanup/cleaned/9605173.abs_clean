We study the cosmological implications of the one-loop terms in the stringexpansion. In particular, we find non-singular solutions which interpolatebetween a contracting universe and an expanding universe, and show that thesesolutions provide a mechanism for removing the initial conditions problempeculiar to spatially closed FRW cosmologies. In addition, we perform numericalcalculations to show that the non-singular cosmologies do not require a carefulchoice of initial conditions, and estimate the likely magnitude of higher orderterms in the string expansion.
