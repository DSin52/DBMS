CP violation by soft supersymmetry-breaking terms in orbifoldcompactifications is investigated. We include the universal part of themoduli-dependent threshold corrections in the construction of thenon-perturbative effective potential due to gaugino-condensation. This allowsinterpolation of the magnitude of CP violating phases between the weakly andstrongly coupled regimes. We find that the universal threshold corrections havea large effect on the CP violating phases in the weakly coupled regime.
