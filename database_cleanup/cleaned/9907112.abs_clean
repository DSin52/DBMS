We study in detail the pattern of anomaly cancellation in D=6 Type IIB Z_Norientifolds, occurring through a generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism involvingseveral RR antisymmetric tensors and scalars fields. The starting point is adirect string theory computation of the inflow of anomaly arising from magneticinteraction of D-branes, O-planes and fixed-points, which are encoded intopological one-loop partition functions in the RR odd spin-structure. All theRR anomalous couplings of these objects are then obtained by factorization.They are responsible for a spontaneous breaking of U(1) factors through a Higgsmechanism involving the corresponding hypermultiplets. Some of them are alsorelated by supersymmetry to gauge couplings involving the NSNS scalars sittingin the tensor multiplets. We also comment on the possible occurrence oftensionless strings when these couplings diverge.
