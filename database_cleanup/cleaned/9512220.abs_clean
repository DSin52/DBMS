We give a gauge invariant formulation of $N=2$ supersymmetric abelian Todafield equations in \n2 superspace. Superconformal invariance is studied. Theconserved currents are shown to be associated with Drinfeld-Sokolov typegauges. The extension to non-abelian \n2 Toda equations is discussed. Verysimilar methods are then applied to a matrix formulation in \n2 superspace ofone of the \n2 KdV hierarchies.
