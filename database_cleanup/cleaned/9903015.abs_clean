including some corrections and addition of some commentsIn this paper, we investigate about two physically distinct classes of the`one-dimensional' worldvolume solutions describing the status of an arbitrarybrane in the presence of another arbitrary (flat) brane which supplies therequired supergravity background. One of these classes concerns with a relative(transverse) motion of two parallel flat branes, while the other class isrelated to a static configuration in which one of the branes is flat and theother is curved as a cylindrical hypersurface. Global symmetries of theworldvolume theory are used to show that both types of these solutions aredescribed by some sort of `planar orbits' which are specified by their `energy'and `angular momentum' $(E,l)$ parameters. We find that various phases of the`motion' along these orbits, for different values of $(E,l)$, are easilydeduced from the curve of an $E$-dependent function of the relative `distance'between the two branes, which is somehow related to their mutual `effectivepotential'.
