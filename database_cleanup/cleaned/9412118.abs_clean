Title: Modular Invariance and (Quasi)-Galois symmetry in Conformal Field Theory

Comments: 18 pages, phyzzx macro pkg, 3 figures

A brief heuristic explanation is given of recent work with Juergen Fuchs,Beatriz Gato-Rivera and Christoph Schweigert on the construction of modularinvariant partition functions from Galois symmetry in conformal field theory. Ageneralization, which we call quasi-Galois symmetry, is also described. As anapplication of the latter, the invariants of the exceptional algebras at level$g$ (for example $E_8$ level 30) expected from conformal embeddings arepresented.
