The various descent and duality relations among BPS and non-BPS D-branes areclassified using topological K-theory. It is shown how the descent proceduresfor producing type-II D-branes from brane-antibrane bound states by tachyoncondensation and $\klein$ projections arise as natural homomorphisms ofK-groups generating the brane charges. The transformations are generalized totype-I theories and type-II orientifolds, from which the complete set of vacuummanifolds and field contents for tachyon condensation is deduced. A new set ofinternal descent relations is found which describes branes over orientifoldplanes as topological defects in the worldvolumes of brane-antibrane pairs ontop of planes of higher dimension. The periodicity properties of theserelations are shown to be a consequence of the fact that all fundamental boundstate constructions and hence the complete spectrum of brane charges areassociated with the topological solitons which classify the four Hopffibrations.
