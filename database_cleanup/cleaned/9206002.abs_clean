We reconsider the construction of solitons by dressing transformations in thesine-Gordon model. We show that the $N$-soliton solutions are in the orbit ofthe vacuum, and we identify the elements in the dressing group which allow usto built the $N$-soliton solutions from the vacuum solution. The dressedactions in the affine Lie algebra $\hat {sl_2}$, and this gives the relationwith the B\"acklund transformations, or using the level one representations ofthe affine Lie algebra $\widehat{sl_2}$, and this directly gives the formulaefor the $\tau$-functions in terms of vertex operators.
