The four-dimensional superstring solutions define at low energy effectivesupergravity theories. A class of them extends successfully the validity of thestandard model up to the string scale (${\cal O}(10^{17})~TeV$). We stress theimportance of string corrections which are relevant for low energy (${\calO}(1)~TeV$) predictions of gauge and Yukawa couplings as well as the spectrumof the supersymmetric particles. A class of exact string solutions are alsopresented, providing non trivial space-time backgrounds, from which we can drawsome lessons concerning the regions of space-time where the notion of theeffective field theory prescription make sense. We show that the stringgravitational phenomena may induce during the cosmological evolution,transitions from one effective field theory prescription to a different onewhere the geometrical and topological data, as well as the relevant observablestates are drastically different.
