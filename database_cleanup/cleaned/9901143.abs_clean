We compute the O(alpha'^3) corrections to the AdS_5 Black hole metric in typeIIB string theory. Contrary to previous work in this direction we keep theBlack Hole radius finite. Thus the topology of the boundary is S^3 x S^1. Wefind the corrections to the free energy and the critical temperature of thephase transition.
