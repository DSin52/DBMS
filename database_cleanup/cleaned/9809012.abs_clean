The asymptotic expansion of the product of an operator raised to an arbitrarypower and an exponential function of this operator is obtained. With the aid ofthis expansion, the density of vacuum energy induced by a static externalmagnetic field of an Abelian or non-Abelian nature is expressed in terms of theDeWitt-Seeley-Gilkey coefficients.
