We propose an all-orders beta function for current-current interactions in 2dwith flavor anisotropy. When the number of left-moving and right-moving flavorsare unequal, the beta function has a non-trivial fixed point at finite valuesof the couplings. We also extend the computation to simple cases with bothflavor and color anisotropy.
