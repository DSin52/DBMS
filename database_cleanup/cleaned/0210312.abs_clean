We consider the Dirac equation in the magnetic-solenoid field (the field of asolenoid and a collinear uniform magnetic field). For the case of Aharonov-Bohmsolenoid, we construct self-adjoint extensions of the Dirac Hamiltonian usingvon Neumann's theory of deficiency indices. We find self-adjoint extensions ofthe Dirac Hamiltonian in both above dimensions and boundary conditions at theAB solenoid. Besides, for the first time, solutions of the Dirac equation inthe magnetic-solenoid field with a finite radius solenoid were found. We studythe structure of these solutions and their dependence on the behavior of themagnetic field inside the solenoid. Then we exploit the latter solutions tospecify boundary conditions for the magnetic-solenoid field with Aharonov-Bohmsolenoid.
