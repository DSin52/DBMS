We present a zero dimensional matrix model based on $USp(2k)$ withsupermultiplets in symmetric, antisymmetric and fundamental representations.The four dimensional compactification of this model naturally captures theexact results of Sen \cite{Sen} in $F$ theory. Eight dynamical and eightkinematical supercharges are found, which is required for critical stringinterpretation. Classical vacuum has ten coordinates and is equipped withorbifold structure. We clarify the issue of spacetime dimensions which $F$theory represented by this matrix model produces.
