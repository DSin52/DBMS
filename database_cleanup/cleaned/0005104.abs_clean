Probabilities of crossing on same-spin clusters, seen as order parameters,have been introduced recently for the critical 2d Ising model by Langlands,Lewis and Saint-Aubin. We extend Cardy's ideas, introduced for percolation, toobtain an ordinary differential equation of order 6 for the horizontal crossingprobability pih. Due to the identity pih(r)+pih(1/r)=1, the function pih mustlie in a 3-dimensional subspace. New measurements of pih are made for 40 valuesof the aspect ratio r (r in [0.1443,6.928]). These data are more precise thanthose obtained by Langlands et al as the 95%-confidence interval is brought to4x10^{-4}. A 3-parameter fit using these new data determines the solution ofthe differential equation. The largest gap between this solution and the 40data is smaller than 4x10^{-4}. The probability pihv of simultaneous horizontaland vertical crossings is also treated.
