Olympia, Greece, 27-30 Sept. 1993, Eds. M. Barone and F. Selleri, HadronicPress, 1995, pp.329-348Relation between Bopp-Kubo formulation and Weyl-Wigner-Moyal symbol calculus,and non-commutative geometry interpretation of the phase space representationof quantum mechanics are studied. Harmonic oscillator in phase space viacreation and annihilation operators, both the usual and $q$-deformed, isinvestigated. We found that the Bopp-Kubo formulation is just non-commutingcoordinates representation of the symbol calculus. The Wigner operator for the$q$-deformed harmonic oscillator is shown to be proportional to the 3-axisspherical angular momentum operator of the algebra $su_{q}(2)$. The relation ofthe Fock space for the harmonic oscillator and double Hilbert space of theGelfand-Naimark-Segal construction is established. The quantum extension of theclassical ergodiicity condition is proposed.
