In this paper we discuss the BRST-quantization of anomalous 2d-Yang Mills(YM) theory. Since we use an oscillator basis for the YM-Fock-space the anomalyappears already for a pure YM-system and the constraints form a Kac-Moodyalgebra with negative central charge. We also discuss the coupling of chiralfermions and find that the BRST-cohomology for systems with chiral fermions ina sufficiently large representation of the gauge group is completely equivalentto the cohomology of the finite dimensional gauge group. For pure YM theory orYM theory coupled to chiral fermions in small representations there exists aninfinite number of inequivalent cohomology classes. This is discussed in somedetail for the example of $SU(2)$.
