We study the q-deformed fuzzy sphere, which is related to D-branes on SU(2)WZW models, for both real q and q a root of unity. We construct for both casesa differential calculus which is compatible with the star structure, study theintegral, and find a canonical frame of one-forms. We then consider actions forscalar field theory, as well as for Yang-Mills and Chern-Simons-type gaugetheories. The zero curvature condition is solved.
