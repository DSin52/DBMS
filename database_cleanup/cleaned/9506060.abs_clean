The Weierstrassian $\wp, \zeta$ and $\sigma $ functions are generalized to${\bf R}^{n}$. The $n=3$ and $n=4$ cases have already been used ingravitational and Yang-Mills instanton solutions which may be interpreted asexplicit realizations of spacetime foam and the monopole condensate,respectively. The new functions satisfy higher dimensional versions of theperiodicity properties and Legendre's relations obeyed by their familiarcomplex counterparts. For $n=4$, the construction reproduces functions foundearlier by Fueter using quaternionic methods. Integrating over lattice pointsalong all directions but two, one recovers the original Weierstrassian ellipticfunctions.
