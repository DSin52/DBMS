We argue that there are generic solutions to the type 0 gravity equations ofmotion that are confining in the infrared and have log scaling in theultraviolet. The background curvature generically diverges in the IR.Nevertheless, there exist solutions where higher order string correctionsappear to be exponentially suppressed in the IR with respect to the leadingtype 0 gravity terms. For these solutions the tachyon flows to a fixed value.We show that the generic solutions lead to a long range linear quarkpotential, magnetic screening and a discrete glueball spectrum. We alsoestimate some WKB glueball mass ratios and compare them to ratios found usingfinite temperature models and lattice computations.
