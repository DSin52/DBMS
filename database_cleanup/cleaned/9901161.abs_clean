Title: Duality in the Context of Topological Quantum Field Theory

Authors: J. M. F. Labastida and Carlos Lozano

Comments: Invited lecture at the Workshop on New Developments in Algebraic

Topology, Faro 1998, 25 pages, latexWe present a summary of the progress made in the last few years ontopological quantum field theory in four dimensions. In particular, we describethe role played by duality in the developments which led to the Seiberg-Witteninvariants and their relation to the Donaldson invariants. In addition, weanalyze the fruitful framework that this connection has originated. Thisanalysis involves the study of topological quantum field theories which containtwisted N=2 supersymmetric matter fields as well as theories obtained aftertwisting N=4 supersymmetry. In the latter case, we present some recent resultsincluding the generalization of the partition function of the Vafa-Wittentheory for gauge group SU(N) with prime N.
