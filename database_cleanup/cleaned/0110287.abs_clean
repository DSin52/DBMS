We compare N=2 string and N=4 topological string within the framework of thesigma model approach. Being classically equivalent on a flat background, thetheories are shown to lead to different geometries when put in a curved space.In contrast to the well studied Kaehler geometry characterising the formercase, in the latter case a manifold has to admit a covariantly constantholomorphic two-form in order to support an N=4 twisted supersymmetry. Thisrestricts the holonomy group to be a subgroup of SU(1,1) and leads to aRicci--flat manifold. We speculate that, the N=4 topological formalism is anappropriate framework to smooth down ultraviolet divergences intrinsic to theN=2 theory.
