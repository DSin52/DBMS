In this letter the Chern-Simons field theories are studied in the Coulombgauge using the Dirac's canonical formalism for constrained systems. As astrategy, we first work out the constraints and then quantize, replacing theDirac brackets with quantum commutators. We find that the Chern-Simons fieldtheories become two dimensional models with no propagation along the timedirection. Moreover, we prove that, despite of the presence of non-trivialself-interactions in the gauge fixed functional, the commutation relationsbetween the fields are trivial at any order in perturbation theory in theabsence of couplings with matter fields. If these couplings are present,instead, the commutation relations become rather involved, but it is stillpossible to study their main properties and to show that they vanish at thetree level.
