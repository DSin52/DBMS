Discretized light-cone quantization of (3+1)-dimensional electrodynamics isdiscussed, with careful attention paid to the interplay between gauge choiceand boundary conditions. In the zero longitudinal momentum sector of the theorya general gauge fixing is performed, and the corresponding relations thatdetermine the zero modes of the gauge field are obtained. One particularlynatural gauge choice in the zero mode sector is identified, for which theconstraint relations are simplest and the fields may be taken to satisfy theusual canonical commutation relations. The constraints are solved inperturbation theory, and the Poincar\'e generators $P^\mu$ are constructed. Theeffect of the zero mode contributions on the one-loop fermion self-energy isstudied.
