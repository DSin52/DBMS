We reconsider the conjecture by Gepner that the fusion ring of a rationalconformal field theory is isomorphic to a ring of polynomials in $n$ variablesquotiented by an ideal of constraints that derive from a potential. We showthat in a variety of cases, this is indeed true with {\it one-variable}polynomials.
