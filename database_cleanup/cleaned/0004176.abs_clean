We find a large class of quantum gauge models with massless fermions wherethe coupling to the gauge fields is not chirally symmetric and whichnevertheless do not suffer from gauge anomalies. To be specific we study twodimensional Abelian models in the Hamiltonian framework which can beconstructed and solved by standard techniques. The general model describes$\Np$ photon fields and $\Nf$ flavors of Dirac fermions with $2\Nf\Np$different coupling constants i.e. the chiral component of each fermion can becoupled to the gauge fields differently. We construct these models and findconditions so that no gauge anomaly appears. If these conditions hold it ispossible to construct and solve the model explicitly, so that gauge- andLorentz invariance are manifest.
