We extend the considerations of a previous paper on black hole statisticalmechanics to the case of black extended objects such as black strings and blackmembranes in 10-dimensional space-time. We obtain a general expression for theEuclidean action of quantum black p-branes and derive their correspondingdegeneracy of states. The statistical mechanics of a gas of black p-branes isthen analyzed in the microcanonical ensemble. As in the case of black holes,the equilibrium state is not thermal and the stable configuration is the onefor which a single black object carries most of the energy. Again, neutralblack p-branes obey the bootstrap condition and it is then possible to arguethat their scattering amplitudes satisfy crossing symmetry. Finally, argumentsidentifying quantum black p-branes with ordinary quantum branes of differentdimensionality are presented.
