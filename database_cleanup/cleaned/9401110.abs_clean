We investigate the phase space of a typical model of 1+1 dimensional gravity(Jackiw-Teitelboim model with cylindrical topology) using its reformulation asa non abelian gauge theory based on the sl(2,R) algebra. Modifying theconventional approach we argue that one should take the universal covering ofSL(2,R) rather than PSL(2,R) as the gauge group of the theory. We discuss theconsequences for the quantization of the model and find that the spectrum ofthe Dirac observables is sensible to this modification. Our analysis furtherprovides an example for a gravity theory where the standard Hamiltonianformulation identifies gravitationally inequivalent solutions.
