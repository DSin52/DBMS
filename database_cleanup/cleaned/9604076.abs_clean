The general structure of the renormalization group equations for the lowenergy effective field theory formulation of pure gravity is presented. Thesolution of these equations takes a particular simple form if the mass scale ofthe effective theory is much smaller than the Planck mass (a possibilitycompatible with the renormalization of the effective theory). A theory withjust one free renormalized parameter is obtained when contributions suppressedby inverse powers of the Planck mass are neglected.
