We show that, in quaternion quantum mechanics with a complex geometry, theminimal four Higgs of the unbroken electroweak theory naturally determine thequaternion invariance group which corresponds to the Glashow group.Consequently, we are able to identify the physical significance of theanomalous Higgs scalar solutions. We introduce and discuss the complexprojection of the Lagrangian density.
