Title: Finiteness following from underlying theory

Comments: 8 pages, rewritten in REVTEX, Gally mode

A tentative proposal is demonstrated that there is a natural strategy to getrid of unphysical (UV) infinities in QFTs if one adopts the modern standardpoint of view that a fundamental theory that is complete and well-defined inall respects underlies the QFTs. This simple strategy works in principle forany interaction model and space-time dimension. It provides a physicalrationality behind the UV divergence and the conventional renormalizationprograms and improves the latter in several important aspects.
