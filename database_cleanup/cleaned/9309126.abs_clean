We demonstrate that the Hagedorn-like growth of the number of observed mesonstates can be used to constrain the degrees of freedom of the underlyingeffective QCD string. We find that the temperature relevant for such stringtheories is not given by the usual Hagedorn value $T_H\approx 160$ MeV, but isconsiderably higher. This resolves an apparent conflict with the results from astatic quark-potential analysis, and suggests that conformal invariance andmodular invariance are indeed reflected in the hadronic spectrum. We also findthat the $D_\perp=2$ scalar string is in excellent agreement with data.
