The generalization of the black hole in three-dimensional spacetime toinclude an electric charge Q in addition to the mass M and the angular momentumJ is given. The field equations are first solved explicitly when Q is small andthe general form of the field at large distances is established. The total``hairs'' M, J and Q are exhibited as boundary terms at infinity. It is foundthat the inner horizon of the rotating uncharged black hole is unstable underthe addition of a small electric charge. Next it is shown that when Q=0 thespinning black hole may be obtained from the one with J=0 by a Lorentz boost inthe $\phi -t$ plane. This boost is an ``illegitimate coordinatetransformation'' because it changes the physical parameters of the solution.The extreme black hole appears as the analog of a particle moving with thespeed of light. The same boost may be used when $Q\neq 0$ to generate asolution with angular momentum from that with J=0, although the geometricalmeaning of the transformation is much less transparent since in the chargedcase the black holes are not obtained by identifying points in anti-de Sitterspace. The metric is given explicitly in terms of three parameters,$\widetilde{M}$, $ \widetilde{Q}$ and $\omega $ which are the ``rest mass'' and``rest charge'' and the angular velocity of the boost. These parameters arerelated to M, J and Q through the solution of an algebraic cubic equation.Altogether, even without angular momentum, the electrically charged 2+1 blackhole is somewhat pathological since (i) it exists for arbitrarily negativevalues of the mass, and (ii) there is no upper bound on the electric charge.
