Inspired by Polyakov's original formulation of quantum Liouville theorythrough functional integral, we analyze perturbation expansion around aclassical solution. We show the validity of conformal Ward identities forpuncture operators and prove that their conformal dimension is given by theclassical expression. We also prove that total quantum correction to thecentral charge of Liouville theory is given by one-loop contribution, which isequal to 1. Applied to the bosonic string, this result ensures the vanishing oftotal conformal anomaly along the lines different from those presented by KPZand Distler-Kawai.
