We argue that the trace structure of the non-abelian Born-Infeld action canbe fixed by demanding that the action be linearised by certainenergy-minimising BPS-like configurations. It is shown how instantons inD4-branes, SU(2) monopoles and dyons in D3-branes, and vortices in D2-branesare all BPS states of the action recently proposed by Tseytlin. The T-dualworldvolume theories of D-strings and D0-branes are also considered. All suchconfigurations can be dealt with exactly within the context of non-abelianBorn-Infeld theory since, given the relevant BPS-like condition, the actionreduces to that of Yang-Mills theory. The worldvolume energy of suchconfigurations is an absolute minimum. It would seem, moreover, that such ananalysis holds for the symmetrised trace structure of Tseytlin's proposal only.
