We consider five-dimensional black holes modeled by D-strings bound toD5-branes, with momentum along the D-strings. We study the greybody factors forthe non-minimally coupled scalars which originate from the gravitons and R-Rantisymmetric tensor particles polarized along the 5-brane, with one indexalong the string and the other transverse to the string. These scalars, whichwe call intermediate, couple to the black holes differently from the minimaland the fixed scalars which were studied previously. Analysis of theirfluctuations around the black hole reveals a surprising mixing between theseNS-NS and R-R scalars. We disentangle this mixing and obtain two decoupledscalar equations. These equations have some new features, and we are able tocalculate the greybody factors only in certain limits. The results agree withcorresponding calculations in the effective string model provided one of theintermediate scalars couples to an operator of dimension (1,2), while the otherto an operator of dimension (2,1). Thus, the intermediate scalars are sensitiveprobes of the chiral operators in the effective string action.
