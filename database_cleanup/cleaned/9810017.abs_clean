holographic principle stated, role of lambda clarified in a new section, anew solution discussed, conclusion elaborated, references added and minorStarting from lagrangian field theory and the variational principle, we showthat duality in equations of motion can also be obtained by introducingexplicit spacetime dependence of the lagrangian. Poincare invariance isachieved precisely when the duality conditions are satisfied in a particularway. The same analysis and criteria are valid for both abelian and nonabeliandualities. We illustrate how (1)Dirac string solution (2)Dirac quantisationcondition (3)t'Hooft-Polyakov monopole solutions and (4)a procedure emerges forobtaining {\it new} classical solutions of Yang-Mills (Y-M) theory. Moreover,these results occur in a way that is strongly reminiscent of the {\itholographic principle}.
