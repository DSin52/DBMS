We examine T-duality transformations for supersymmetric strings with targetspace geometry with compact abelian isometries. We consider the partitionfunction of these models and we show that although T-duality is not a symmetry,due to an anomaly, it relates type IIA to type IIB strings. In this way weextend the corresponding result for toroidal compactification to the generalcase of non-trivial backgrounds with abelian isometries and for world sheets ofany genera.
