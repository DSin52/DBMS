In this paper we propose a new supersymmetric extension of conformalmechanics. The Grassmannian variables that we introduce are the basis of theforms and of the vector-fields built over the symplectic space of the originalsystem. Our supersymmetric Hamiltonian itself turns out to have a cleargeometrical meaning being the Lie-derivative of the Hamiltonian flow ofconformal mechanics. Using superfields we derive a constraint which gives theexact solution of the supersymmetric system in a way analogous to theconstraint in configuration space which solved the original non-supersymmetricmodel. Besides the supersymmetric extension of the original Hamiltonian, wealso provide the extension of the other conformal generators present in theoriginal system. These extensions have also a supersymmetric character beingthe square of some Grassmannian charge. We build the whole superalgebra ofthese charges and analyze their closure. The representation of the even part ofthis superalgebra on the odd part turns out to be integer and not spinorial incharacter.
