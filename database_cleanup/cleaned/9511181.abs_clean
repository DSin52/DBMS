Theory of the Electron, Sept.95, Mexico City. To appear in the proceedingsIn this paper we formulate Maxwell and Dirac theories as an already unifiedtheory (in the sense of Misner and Wheeler). We introduce Dirac spinors as"Dirac square root" of the Faraday bivector, and use this in order to find aspinorial representation of Maxwell equations. Then we show that under certaincircunstances this spinor equation reduces to an equation formally identical toDirac equation. Finally we discuss certain conditions under which this equationcan be really interpreted as Dirac equation, and some other possibleinterpretations of this result.
