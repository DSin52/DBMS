number of improvementsQCD strings are color-electric flux tubes between quarks with a finitethickness and thus a finite curvature stiffness. Contrary to an earlierrigid-string by Polyakov and Kleinert, and motivated by the properties of amagnetic flux tubes in type-II superconductors we put forward the hypothesisthat QCD strings have a {\em negative\/ stiffness. We set up a new string modelwith this property and show that it is free of the three principal problems ofrigid-strings --- particle states with negative norm, nonexistence of alowest-energy state, and wrong high-temperature behavior of string tension ---thus making it a better candidate for a string description of quark forces thanprevious models.
