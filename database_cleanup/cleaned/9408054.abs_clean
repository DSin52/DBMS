Title: High Temperature Field Theory Beyond Perturbation Theory

Comments: 15 pages, plain tex, transmision error corrected

For realistic values of the Higgs boson mass the high temperature electroweakphase transition cannot be described perturbatively. The symmetric phase isgoverned by a strongly interacting $SU(2)$ gauge theory. Typical masses ofexcitations and scales of condensates are set by the ``high temperatureconfinement scale'' $\approx 0.2\ T$. For a Higgs boson mass around 100 GeV orabove all aspects of the phase transition are highly nonperturbative. Near thecritical temperature strong electroweak interactions are a dominant featurealso in the phase with spontaneous symmetry breaking. Depending on the value ofthe Higgs boson mass the transition may be a first order phase transition or ananalytical crossover.
