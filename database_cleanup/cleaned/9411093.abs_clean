We construct new realizations of the Virasoro algebra inspired by theCalogero model. The Virasoro algebra we find acts as a kind ofspectrum-generating algebra of the Calogero model. We furthermore present thesuperextension of these results and introduce a class of higher-spin extensionsof the Virasoro algebra which are of the $W_\infty$ - type.
