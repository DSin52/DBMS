We show that twisted reduced models can be interpreted as noncommutativeYang-Mills theory. Based upon this correspondence, we obtain noncommutativeYang-Mills theory with D-brane backgrounds in IIB matrix model. We propose thatIIB matrix model with D-brane backgrounds serve as a concrete definition ofnoncommutative Yang-Mills. We investigate D-instanton solutions as localexcitations on D3-branes. When instantons overlap, their interaction can bewell described in gauge theory and AdS/CFT correspondence. We show that IIBmatrix model gives us the consistent potential with IIB supergravity when theyare well separated.
