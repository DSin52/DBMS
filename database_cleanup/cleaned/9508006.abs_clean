We discuss bosonized two-dimensional QCD with massless fermions in theadjoint and multi-flavor fundamental representations. We evaluate the massivemesonic spectra of several models by using the light-front quantization anddiagonalizing the mass operator $M^2=2P^+P^- $. We recover previous results inthe case of one flavor adjoint fermions and we find the exact massive spectrumof multi flavor QCD in the limit of large number of flavors.
