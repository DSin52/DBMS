This paper supersedes the preprint Superloop Equations in the Double ScalingLimit, CERN-TH-6575. It is an improved version with corrections in thederivation of the continuum limit, a clarification of the doubling of degreesof freedom for even potentials, and with a heuristic argument showing that thepart of the free energy independent of fermion couplings in our model satisfiesthe KdV Hierarchy.
