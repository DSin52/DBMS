We derive the four point correlation function involving four twist fields forarbitrary even dimensional Z_N x Z_M orbifold compactifications. Usingtechniques from the conformal field theory the three point correlationfunctions with twist fields are determined. Both the choice of the modularbackground (compatible with the twists) and of the (higher) twisted sectorsinvolved are fully general. Our results turn out to be target space dualityinvariant.
