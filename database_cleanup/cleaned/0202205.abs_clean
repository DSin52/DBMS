Recently, the author has proposed a generalization of the matrix and vectormodels approach to the theory of random surfaces and polymers. The idea is toreplace the simple matrix or vector (path) integrals by gauge theory ornon-linear sigma model (path) integrals. We explain how this solves one of thenon-perturbative definitions in non-Borel summable cases. This is exemplifiedon the simplest possible examples involving O(N) symmetric non-linear sigmamodels with N-dimensional target spaces, for which we construct (multi)criticalmetrics. The non-perturbative definitions of the double scaled, manifestlypositive, partition functions rely on remarkable identities involving (path)integrals.
