We consider gravity in 2+1 dimensions in presence of extended stationarysources with rotational symmetry. We prove by direct use of Einstein'sequations that if i) the energy momentum tensor satisfies the weak energycondition, ii) the universe is open (conical at space infinity), iii) there areno CTC at space infinity, then there are no CTC at all.
