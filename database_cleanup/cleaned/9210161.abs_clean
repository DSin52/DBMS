This paper is dedicated to the study of the existence and the properties ofelectron-electron bound states in QED$_3$. A detailed analysis of the infraredstructure of the perturbative series of the theory is presented. We start byanalyzing the two-point Green's function, in the Bloch-Nordsieck approximation.The theory appears to be plagued by severe infrared divergencies, whichnevertheless disappear when vacuum-polarization effects are non-perturbativelytaken into account. The dynamical induction of a Chern-Simons term is at theroot of this mechanism. {}From the inspection of the electron-electronnon-relativistic potential it then follows that equally charged fermions mayeither repel or attract and, moreover, that bound states do in fact exist inthe theory. We calculate numerically the binding energies and average radius ofthe bound states. We find an accidental quasi-degeneracy of the ground state ofthe system, between the lowest-energy $l=-3$ and $l=-5$ states, which could berelated to a radio-frequency resonance in high-$T_c$ superconductors.
