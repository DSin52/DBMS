Title: On the Free Field Realization of Form Factors

Comments: 13 pages in Latex

A method to construct free field realizations for the form factors ofdiagonal factorized scattering theories is described. Form factors areconstructed from linear functionals over an associative `form factor algebra',which in particular generate solutions of the deformed Knizhnik-Zamolodchikovequations with parameter $2\pi$. We show that there exists a unique deformationoff the (`Rindler') value $2\pi$ that preserves the original $S$-matrix andwhich allows one to realize form factors as vector functionals over an algebraof generalized vertex operators.
