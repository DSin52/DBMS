We find regular string duals of three dimensional N=1 SYM with a Chern-Simonsinteraction at level k for SO and Sp gauge groups. Using the string dual weexactly reproduce the conjectured pattern of supersymmetry breaking proposed byWitten by showing that there is dynamical supersymmetry breaking for k<h/2while supersymmetry remains unbroken for k>= h/2, where h is the dual Coxeternumber of the gauge group. We also find regular string duals of fourdimensional N=1 SYM for SO and Sp gauge groups and exactly reproduce theexpected pattern of chiral symmetry breaking Z_{2h}--> Z_2 by analyzing thesymmetries of the string solution.
