Comments: 10 pages, harvmac

Time-dependent domain wall solutions with infinitesimal thickness areobtained in the theory of a scalar field coupled to gravity with the dilaton,i.e. the Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity. The value of the dilaton is determined interms of the Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega$. In particular, the solutions existfor any $\omega>0$ and as $\omega\to\infty$ we obtain new solutions in generalrelativity. They have horizons whose sizes depend on $\omega$.
