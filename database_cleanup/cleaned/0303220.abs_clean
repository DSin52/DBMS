We study the quantum mechanics of BMN operators with two scalar impuritiesand arbitrarily many traces, at one loop and all genus. We prove an operatoridentity which partially elucidates the structure of this quantum mechanics,provides some support for a conjectured formula for the free all genustwo-point functions, and demonstrates that a single O(g_2^2) contact termarises in the Hamiltonian as a result of transforming from the natural gaugetheory basis to the string basis. We propose to identify the S-matrix of thisquantum mechanics with the S-matrix of string theory in the plane-wavebackground.
