references; Serious misprints in eqs. (2.165), (4.54)--(4.55), (4.62)--(4.63)and many other typos are fixed; Many cosmetic changes; English is thoroughlyrevisedof De Witt coefficients is elaborated; 2. The coefficients $a_3$ and $a_4$ arecalculated; 3. Covariant methods for the study of the nonlocal structure of theeffective action are developed. The terms of first and second order inbackground fields in De Witt coefficients are calculated. The summation ofthese terms is carried out and nonlocal covariant expression for the Greenfunction, the heat kernel and the effective action are obtained. It is shownthat in the conform-invariant case the Green function is finite. A finiteeffective action in the conform-invariant case of massless scalar field intwo-dimensional space is obtained; 4. The off-shell one-loop divergences of theeffective action in arbitrary covariant gauge as well as those of the `unique'effective action in higher-derivative quantum gravity are calculated; Theultraviolet asymptotics of coupling constants are found. It is shown that inthe `physical' region of coupling constants (no tachyons!) the conformal sectorhas `zero-charge' behavior contrary to previous authors. This means that thetheory goes beyond the limits of weak conformal coupling at higher energies. Inother words, the condition of conformal stability of flat background isincompatible with the asymptotic freedom in the conformal sector. There is astable non-flat ground state but only in the case of positive definiteEuclidean action. In this case the theory is asymptotically free both in tensorand conformal sectors. The off-shell one-loop effective action in arbitrarycovariant gauge and the `unique' effective action on De Sitter background arecalculated.
