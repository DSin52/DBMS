Title: Non-perturbative string connections

Authors: Andrea Gregori

Comments: 7 pages, latex, to appear in the proceedings of the TMR meeting on

Quantum aspects of gauge theories, supersymmetry and unification, Paris, 1--7September 1999We discuss the duality between two type I compactifications to fourdimensions and an heterotic construction with spontaneous breaking of the N=4supersymmetry to N=2. This duality allows us to gain insight into thenon-perturbative properties of these models. Through the analysis of thegravitational corrections, we then investigate the connections betweenfour-dimensional, N=2 M-theory vacua constructed as orbifolds of type II,heterotic, and type I strings.
