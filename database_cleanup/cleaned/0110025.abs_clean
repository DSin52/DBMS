"Modern Trends in String Theory, Lisbon, 13-17 July 2001We discuss why the N_6=1 heterotic string has to be viewed as somethingsimilar to a ``non-compact orbifold''. Only the perturbative spectrum is forcedto satisfy the constraints imposed by the vanishing of six-dimensionalanomalies. These do not apply to the states of the non-perturbative spectrum,such as those appearing when small instantons shrink to zero size.
