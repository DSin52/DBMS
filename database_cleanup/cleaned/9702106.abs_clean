We present a detailed description of the three inequivalent twists of N=4supersymmetric gauge theories. The resulting topological quantum field theoriesare reobtained in the framework of the Mathai-Quillen formalism and thecorresponding moduli spaces are analyzed. We study their geometric features ineach case. In one of the twists we make contact with the theory of non-abelianmonopoles in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. In another twist weobtain a topological quantum field theory which is orientation reversalinvariant. For this theory we show how the functional integral contributions tothe vacuum expectation values leading to topological invariants notablysimplify.
