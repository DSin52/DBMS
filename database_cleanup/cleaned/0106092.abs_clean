We study, in the context of five dimensional N=2 gauged supergravity withvector and hypermultiplets, curved domain wall solutions with worldvolumesgiven by four dimensional Einstein manifolds. For a choice of the projectioncondition on the Killing spinors of the BPS solutions, first order differentialequations governing the flow of the scalars are derived. With these equations,we analyze the equations of motion and determine conditions under which gaugedsupergravity theories may admit Einstein domain wall solutions.
