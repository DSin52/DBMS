We review exact results obtained for R^4 couplings in maximallysupersymmetric type II string theories. These couplings offer a privilegedscene to understand the rules of semiclassical calculus in string theory. Uponexpansion in weak string coupling, they reveal an infinite sum ofnon-perturbative e^{-1/g} effects that can be imputed to euclidean D-braneswrapped on cycles of the compactification manifolds. They also shed light onthe relation between Dp-branes and D-(p-2)branes, D-strings and (p,q) strings,instanton sums and soliton loops. The latter interpretation takes over in D<=6in order to account for the e^{-1/g^2} effects, still mysterious from the pointof view of instanton calculus.[To appear in the proceedings of the conference "Quantum Aspects of GaugeTheories, Supersymmetry and Unification" held at Neuchatel University,Switzerland, 18-23 September 1997.]
