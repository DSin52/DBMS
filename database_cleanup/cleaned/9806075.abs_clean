We explore the consequences of imposing Polyakov's zig/zag-invariance in thesearch for a confining string. We first find that the requirement ofzig/zag-invariance seems to be incompatible with spacetime supersymmetry. Wethen try to find zig/zag-invariant string backgrounds on which to implement theminimal-area prescription for the calculation of Wilson loops consideringdifferent possibilities.
