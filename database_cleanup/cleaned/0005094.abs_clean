We show that dilaton beta-function equation in the brane-like sigma-model(regarded as NSR analogue of string theory on $AdS_5\times{S^5}$) has the formof stochastic Langevin equation with non-Markovian noise. The worldsheet cutoffis identified with stochastic time and the $V_5$-operator plays the role of thenoise. We derive the Fokker-Planck equation associated with this stochasticprocess and show that the Hamiltonian of the $AdS_5$ supergravity defines thedistribution satisfying this Fokker-Planck equation. This means that thedynamical compactification of flat ten-dimensional space-time on$AdS_5\times{S^5}$ occurs as a result of the non-Markovian stochastic process,generated by the $V_5$-operator noise. This provides us with an insight intorelation between holography principle and the concept of stochasticquantization from the point of view of critical string theory.
