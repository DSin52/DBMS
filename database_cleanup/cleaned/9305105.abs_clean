We study the Batalin-Vilkovisky master equation for both open and closedstring field theory with special attention to anomalies. Open string fieldtheory is anomaly free once the minimal coupling to closed strings induced byloop amplitudes is considered. In closed string field theory the full-fledgedmaster equation has to be solved order by order in perturbation theory. Theexistence of a solution implies the absence of anomaly. We briefly discuss therelation of the iterative process of solution to methods used in the firstquantized formalism and comment on some possible non-perturbative corrections.
