A generalized harmonic oscillator on noncommutative spaces is considered.Dynamical symmetries and physical equivalence of noncommutative systems withthe same energy spectrum are investigated and discussed. General solutions ofthree-dimensional noncommutative harmonic oscillator are found and classifiedaccording to dynamical symmetries. We have found conditions under whichthree-dimensional noncommutative harmonic oscillator can be represented byordinary, isotropic harmonic oscillator in effective magnetic field.
