Title: Shock Waves and the Vacuum Structure of Gauge Theories

Authors: M. Martellini, A. Sagnotti and M. Zeni

Comments: 7 pages, latex, no figures

In Yang-Mills theory massless point sources lead naturally to shock-waveconfigurations. Their magnetic counterparts endow the vacuum of thefour-dimensional compact abelian model with a Coulomb-gas behaviour whosephysical implications are briefly discussed.
