The spectrum of the massive Schwinger model in the strong coupling region isobtained by using the light-front Tamm-Dancoff (LFTD) approximation up toincluding six-body states. We numerically confirm that the two-meson boundstate has a negligibly small six-body component. Emphasis is on the usefulnessof the information about states (wave functions). It is used for identifyingthe three-meson bound state among the states below the three-meson threshold.We also show that the two-meson bound state is well described by the wavefunction of the relative motion.
