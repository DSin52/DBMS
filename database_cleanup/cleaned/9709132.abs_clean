For the SU(N) invariant supersymmetric matrix model related to membranes in 4space-time dimensions, the general solution to the equation(s)$Q^{\dagger}\Psi=0$ $(Q\chi =0)$ is determined for N odd. For any such(bosonic) solution of $Q^{\dagger}\Psi=0$, a (fermionic) $\Phi$ is found that(formally) satisfies $Q^{\dagger}\Phi=\Psi$.For the analogous model in 11 dimensions the solution of $Q^{\dagger}\Psi=0(Q\Psi=0)$ is outlined.
