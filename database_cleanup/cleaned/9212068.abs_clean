The generating functional for hard thermal loops in QCD is important insetting up a resummed perturbation theory, so that all terms of a given orderin the coupling constant can be consistently taken into account. It is also thefunctional which leads to a gauge invariant description of Debye screening andplasma waves in the quark-gluon plasma. We have recently shown that thisfunctional is closely related to the eikonal for a Chern-Simons gauge theory.In this paper, this relationship is explored and explained in more detail,along with some generalizations.
