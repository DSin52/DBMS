Some time ago, Atiyah showed that there exists a natural identificationbetween the k-instantons of a Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $G$ and theholomorphic maps from $CP_1$ to $\Omega G$. Since then, Nair and Mazur, haveassociated the $\Theta $ vacua structure in QCD with self-intersecting Riemannsurfaces immersed in four dimensions. From here they concluded that these 2Dsurfaces correspond to the non-perturbative phase of QCD and carry thetopological information of the $\Theta$ vacua. In this paper we would like toelaborate on this point by making use of Atiyah's identification. We will arguethat an effective description of QCD may be more like a $WZW$ model coupled tothe induced metric of an immersion of a 2-D Riemann surface in $R^4$. We makesome further comments on the relationship between the coadjoint orbits of theKac-Moody group on $G$ and instantons with axial symmetry and monopole charge.
