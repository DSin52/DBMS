A nonperturbative method is proposed for the approximative solution of theexact evolution equation which describes the scale dependence of the effectiveaverage action. It consists of a combination of exact evolution equations forindependent couplings with renormalization group improved one loop expressionsbeta-function of the quartic coupling lambda of an O(N) symmetric scalar fieldtheory to order lambda^3 as well as the anomalous dimension to order lambda^2using only one loop expressions and find agreement with the two loopperturbation theory. We also treat the case of very strong coupling and confirmthe existence of a "triviality bound".
