We study the infra-red limit of non-abelian Chern-Simons gauge theoryperturbed by a non-topological, albeit gauge invariant, mass term. It is shownthat, in this limit, we may construct an infinite class of integrable quantummechanical models which, for the case of SU(2) group, are labelled by theangular momentum eigenvalue. The first non-trivial example in this class isobtained for the triplet representation and it physically describes the gaugeinvariant coupling of a non-abelian Chern-Simons particle with a particlemoving on $S^3$ - the SU(2) group manifold. In addition to this, the model hasa fascinating resemblance to the Landau problem and may be regarded as anon-abelian and a non-linear generalisation of the same defined on thethree-sphere with the uniform magnetic field replaced by an angular momentumfield. We explicitly solve for some eigenstates of this model in a closed formin terms of some generalised orthogonal polynomials. In the process, we unravelsome startling connections with Anderson's chain models which are important inthe study of disordered systems in condensed matter physics. We also sketch amethod which allows us, in principle, to find the energy eigenvaluescorresponding to the above eigenstates of the theory if the Lyapunov exponentsof the transfer matrix of the infinite chain model involved are known.
