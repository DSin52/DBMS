A scattering scattering description is proposed for a boundary perturbationof a c=1 SL(2,Z) invariant conformal field theory. The bulk massless S-matricesare of the form of Zamolodchikov's staircase model. Using the boundary versionof the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, we show that the boundary free energy goesthrough a series of integer valued plateaux as a function of system size.
