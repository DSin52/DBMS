We discuss how cosmic strings can be used to mine energy from black holes. Astring attached to the black hole gives rise to an additional channel for theenergy release. It is demonstrated that when a string crosses the eventhorizon, its transverse degrees of freedom are thermally excited and thermalstring perturbations propagate along the string to infinity. The internalmetric induced on the 2D worldsheet of the static string crossing the horizondescribes a 2D black hole. For this reason thermal radiation of stringexcitations propagating along the string can be interpreted as Hawkingradiation of the 2D black hole. It is shown that the rate of energy emissionthrough the string channel is of the same order of magnitude as the bulkradiation of the black hole. Thus, for N strings attached to the black hole theefficiency of string channels is increased by factor N. We discuss restrictionson N which exist because of the finite thickness of strings, the gravitationalbackreaction and quantum fluctuations. Our conclusion is that the energyemission rate by strings can be increased as compared to the standard emissionin the bulk by the factor 10^3 for GUT strings and up to the factor 10^{31} forelectroweak strings.
