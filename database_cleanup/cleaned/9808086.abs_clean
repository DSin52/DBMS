The emission rate of fermions from 2+1 dimensional BTZ black holes is shownto have a form which can be reproduced from a conformal field theory at finitetemperature. The rate obtained for fermions is identical to the rate ofnon-minimally coupled fermions emitted from a five dimensional black hole,whose near horizon geometry is BTZ X M, where M is a compact manifold.
