We present two methods for studying fibrations of Calabi-Yau manifoldsembedded in toric varieties described by single weight systems. We analyse184,026 such spaces and identify among them 124,701 which are K3 fibrations. Assome of the weights give rise to two or three distinct types of fibrations, thetotal number we find is 167,406. With our methods one can also study ellipticfibrations of 3-folds and K3 surfaces. We also calculate the Hodge numbers ofthe 3-folds obtaining more than three times as many as were previously known.
