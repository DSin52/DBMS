U(1) gauge theory on non-commutative Minkowski space-time in the Feynman-'tHooft background gauge is studied. In particular, UV divergences andnon-commutative IR divergent contributions to the two, three and four-pointfunctions are explicitly computed at one loop. We show that the negative signof the beta function results from paramagnetism --producing UV chargeanti-screening-- prevailing over diamagnetism --giving rise toUV chargescreening. This dominance in the field theory setting corresponds to tachyonmagnification dominance in the string theory framework. Our calculationsprovide an explicit realization of UV/IR mixing and lead to an IRrenormalization of the coupling constant, where now paramagnetic contributionsproduce screening and diamagnetic contributions anti-screening.
