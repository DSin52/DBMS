Atiyah and Manton have outlined a scheme to obtain approximations to theSU(2) skyrmions from instantons in $\R^4$. In this paper we apply this schemeto construct, in an explicit form, approximations to static sphericallysymmetric SU(N) skyrmions with various baryon numbers. In particular we showhow to obtain the skyrmions from instantons using harmonic maps into complexprojective spaces.
