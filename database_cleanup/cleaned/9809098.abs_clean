Workshop on Thermal Field Theories and Their Applications, August 1998,Regensburg, GermanyThe relativistic complex scalar field at finite temperature and in presenceof a net conserved charge is studied in reference to recent developments on themultiplicative anomaly. This quantity, overlooked until now, is computed and itis shown how it could play a role for this system. Other possible applicationsare also mentioned.
