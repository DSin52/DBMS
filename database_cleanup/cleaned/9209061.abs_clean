We study the Turaev-Viro invariant as the Euclidean Chern-Simons-Wittengravity partition function with positive cosmological constant. Afterexplaining why it can be identified as the partition function of 3-dimensionalgravity, we show that the initial data of the TV invariant can be constructedfrom the duality data of a certain class of rational conformal field theories,and that, in particular, the original Turaev-Viro's initial data is associatedwith the $A_{k+1}$ modular invariant WZW model. As a corollary we then showthat the partition function $Z(M)$ is bounded from above by $Z((S^2\timesS^1)^{\sharp g}) =(S_{00})^{-2g+2}\sim \Lambda^{-\frac{3g-3}{2}}$, where $g$ isthe smallest genus of handlebodies with which $M$ can be presented by Hegaardsplitting. $Z(M)$ is generically very large near $\Lambda\sim +0$if $M$ isneither $S^3$ nor a lens space, and many-wormholeconfigurations dominate near$\Lambda\sim +0$ in the sense that $Z(M)$ generically tends to diverge fasteras the ``number of wormholes'' $g$ becomes larger.
