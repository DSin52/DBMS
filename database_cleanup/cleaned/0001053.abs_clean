In this paper we study the spectrum of bosonic string theory on AdS_3. Westudy classical solutions of the SL(2,R) WZW model, including solutions forlong strings with non-zero winding number. We show that the model has asymmetry relating string configurations with different winding numbers. We thenstudy the Hilbert space of the WZW model, including all states related by theabove symmetry. This leads to a precise description of long strings. We prove ano-ghost theorem for all the representations that are involved and discuss thescattering of the long string.
