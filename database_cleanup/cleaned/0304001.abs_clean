updatedWe study the superpotential for the heterotic string compactified onnon-Kahler complex manifolds. We show that many of the geometrical propertiesof these manifolds can be understood from the proposed superpotential. Inparticular we give an estimate of the radial modulus of these manifolds. Wealso show, how the torsional constraints can be obtained from thissuperpotential.
