We compare two approaches in supersymmetric confinement, the Seibergformulation and the superconvergence rule. For the latter, the critical pointis $\gamma_{00}=0$ in the Landau gauge. We find $4\gamma_{00}=\beta_0$ is thecritical point for most of confining theories without a tree-levelsuperpotential in the Seiberg formulation, in particular, in the large $N_c$and $N_f$ limit. We show how confining theories with a discrete symmetry and asmall discrete symmetry limits correspond to the critical points$4\gamma_{00}=\beta_0$ and $\gamma_{00}=0$, respectively.
