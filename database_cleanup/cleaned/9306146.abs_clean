We study on-shell and off-shell properties of the supersymmetric sinh-Gordonand perturbed SUSY Yang-Lee models using the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz andform factors. Identifying the supersymmetric models with the Eight Vertex FreeFermion Model, we derive inversion relation for inhomogeneous transfer matrixand TBA equations and get correct UV results. We obtain two-point form factorsof the trace of energy-momentum tensor using the Watson equations and theirSUSY transformations. As an application, we compute the UV central charge usingthese form factors and spectral representation of the $C$-theorem.
