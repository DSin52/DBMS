Title: Linear Inflation in Curvature-Quadratic Gravity

Authors: Paul Federbush (Univ. of Michigan)

Comments: 3 pages, LaTeX

We continue our study of gravity described by the action density(-g)^(1/2)(R_ik^2+bR^2); and look for cosmological solutions of gravity coupledto dust, for the closed isotropic model. There is a solution that at tapproaches zero has for the radius, a(t)=t/3^(1/2); in the absence of dust thissolution holds for all time.
