The equation of motion for Berkovits' WZW-like open (super)string fieldtheory is shown to be integrable in the sense that it can be written as thecompatibility condition ("zero-curvature condition") of some linear equations.Employing a generalization of solution-generating techniques (the splitting andthe dressing methods), we demonstrate how to construct nonperturbativeclassical configurations of both N=1 superstring and N=2 fermionic string fieldtheories. With and without u(n) Chan-Paton factors, various solutions of thestring field equation are presented explicitly.
