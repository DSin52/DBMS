We study particles creation in arbitrary space-time dimensions by externalelectric fields, in particular, by fields, which are acting for a finite time.The time and dimensional analysis of the vacuum instability is presented. It isshown that the distributions of particles created by quasiconstant electricfields can be written in a form which has a thermal character and seems to beuniversal. Its application, for example, to the particles creation in externalconstant gravitational field reproduces the Hawking temperature exactly.
