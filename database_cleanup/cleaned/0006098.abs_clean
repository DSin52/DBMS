The requirements of N=1 superconformal invariance for the correlationfunctions of chiral superfields are analysed. Complete expressions are foundfor the three point function for the general spin case and for the four pointfunction for scalar superfields for \sum q_i=3 where q_i is the scale dimensionfor the i'th superfield and is related to the U(1) R-charge. In the latter casethe relevant Ward identities reduce to eight differential equations for fourfunctions of u,v which are invariants when the superconformal symmetry isreduced to the usual conformal group. The differential equations have a generalsolution given by four linearly independent expressions involving a twovariable generalisation of the hypergeometric function. By considering thebehaviour under permutations, or crossing symmetry, the chiral four pointfunction is shown to be determined up to a single overall constant. The resultsare in accord with the supersymmetric operator product expansion.
