We study the physical spectrum of cubic open string field theory arounduniversal solutions, which are constructed using the matter Virasoro operatorsand the ghost and anti-ghost fields. We find the cohomology of the new BRScharge around the solutions, which appear with a ghost number that differs fromthat of the original theory. Considering the gauge-unfixed string field theory,we conclude that open string excitations perturbatively disappear after thecondensation of the string field to the solutions.
