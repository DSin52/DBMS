We construct a model of a chiral transition using the well known large Ntransition in two dimensional U(N) lattice gauge theory. Restricting themodel to a single plaquette, we introduce Grassmann variables on the corners ofthe plaquette with the natural phase factors of staggered fermions and couplethem to the U(N) link variables. The classical theory has a continuous chiralsymmetry which is broken at strong couplings, but is restored for weakcouplings in the $N \to \infty$ limit.
