We reformulate the Born-Infeld action, coupled to an axion and a dilaton in aduality manifest way. This action is the generalization of the Schwarz-Senaction for non-linear electrodynamics. We show that this action may be obtainedby dimensional reduction on a torus of a self-dual theory in 6 dimensions. Thedilaton-axion being identified with the complex structure of the torus.Applications to M-theory and the self-dual IIB three brane are investigated.
