Comments: 6 pages, LATEX. Contributed paper at the International Europhysics

Conference on High Energy Physics HEP-97 (Jerusalem, Israel, 19--26 August1997)It is well known that charges coupled to a pure Chern-Simons gauge field in(2+1) dimensions undergo an effective change of statistics, i.e., becomeanyons. We will consider several generalizations thereof, arising when thegauge field is more general. The first one is ``multispecies anyons''---chargedparticles of several species coupled to one, or possibly several, Chern-Simonsfields. The second one is finite-size anyons, which are charged particlescoupled to a gauge field described by the Chern-Simons term plus some otherterm. In fact, rigorously speaking, quasielectrons and quasiholes in thefractional quantum Hall effect are multispecies finite-size anyons. The thirdone is an analog of finite-size anyons which arises in a model with a mixedChern-Simons term; notably, this model is P,T-invariant, which opens the wayfor practical applications even when there is no parity-breaking magneticfield.
