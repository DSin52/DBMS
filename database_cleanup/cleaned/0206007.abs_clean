Algebras and Applications, Cookeville, TN, May 2002The progress of noncommutative geometry has been crucially influenced, fromThe Standard Model, with its central role for the Dirac operator, led toseveral formulations culminating in the concept of a real spectral triple.String theory then came into contact with NCG, leading to an emphasis onMoyal-like algebras and formulations of quantum field theory on noncommutativespaces. Hopf algebras have yielded an unexpected link between thenoncommutative geometry of foliations and perturbative quantum field theory.The quest for a suitable foundation of quantum gravity continues to promotefruitful ideas, among them the spectral action principle and the search for abetter understanding of "noncommutative spaces".
