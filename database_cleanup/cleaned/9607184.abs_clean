The restrictions of target--space duality are imposed at the perturbativelevel on the holomorphic Wilsonian couplings that encode certain higher-ordergravitational interactions in $N=2, D=4$ heterotic string compactifications. Acrucial role is played by non-holomorphic corrections. The requirement ofsymplectic covariance and an associated symplectic anomaly equation play animportant role in determining their form. For models which also admit a type-IIdescription, this equation coincides with the holomorphic anomaly equation fortype-II compactifications in the limit that a specific K\"ahler-class modulusgrows large. We explicitly evaluate some of the higher-order couplings for atoroidal compactification with two moduli $T$ and $U$, and we express them interms of modular forms.
