All anomaly candidates and the form of the most general invariant localaction are given for old and new minimal supergravity, including the caseswhere additional Yang--Mills and chiral matter multiplets are present.Furthermore nonminimal supergravity is discussed. In this case localsupersymmetry itself may be anomalous and some of the corresponding anomalycandidates are given explicitly. The results are obtained by solving thedescent equations which contain the consistency equation satisfied byintegrands of anomalies and invariant actions.
