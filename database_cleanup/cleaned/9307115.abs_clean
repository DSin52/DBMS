We study the relation between topological string theory and singularitytheory using the partition function of $A_{N-1}$ topological string defined bymatrix integral of Kontsevich type. Genus expansion of the free energy isconsidered, and the genus $g=0$ contribution is shown to be described by aspecial solution of $N$-reduced dispersionless KP system. We show a universalcorrespondences between the time variables of dispersionless KP hierarchy andthe flat coordinates associated with versal deformations of simplesingularities of type $A$. We also study the behavior of topological mattertheory on the sphere in a topological gravity background, to clarify the roleof the topological string in the singularity theory. Finally we make somecomment on gravitational phase transition.
