We consider Penrose limits of the Klebanov-Strassler and Maldacena-Nunezholographic duals to N =1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills. By focusing in on the IRregion we obtain exactly solvable string theory models. These represent thenonrelativistic motion and low-lying excitations of heavy hadrons with massproportional to a large global charge. We argue that these hadrons, bothphysically and mathematically, take the form of heavy nonrelativistic strings;we term them "annulons." A simple toy model of a string boosted along a compactcircle allows us considerable insight into their properties. We also calculatethe Wilson loop carrying large global charge and show the effect of confinementis quadratic, not linear, in the string tension.
