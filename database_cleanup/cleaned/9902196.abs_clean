Using boundary states we derive the presence of (chiral) fermions on theintersection of type 0 D-branes. The corresponding anomalous couplings on thebranes are then computed. Furthermore, we discuss systems of branes sitting at$A_n$ singularities. In particular, the massless spectrum on the branes isderived, and a boundary state description is given.
