Using a representation of the q-deformed Lorentz algebra as differentialoperators on quantum Minkowski space, we define an algebra of observables for aq-deformed relativistic quantum mechanics with spin zero. We construct aHilbert space representation of this algebra in which the square of the mass $p^2 $ is diagonal.
