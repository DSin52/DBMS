We study a general dilatonic p-brane solution in arbitrary dimensions inrelation to the Randall-Sundrum scenario. When the p-brane is fully localizedalong its transverse directions, the Kaluza-Klein zero mode of bulk graviton isnot normalizable. When the p-brane is delocalized along its transversedirections except one, the Kaluza-Klein zero mode of bulk graviton isnormalizable if the warp factor is chosen to increase, in which case there aresingularities at finite distance away from the p-brane. Such delocalizedp-brane can be regarded as a dilatonic domain wall as seen in higherdimensions. This unusual property of the warp factor allows one to avoid aproblem of dilatonic domain wall with decreasing warp factor that free massiveparticles are repelled from the domain wall and hit singularities, sincemassive particles with finite energy are trapped around delocalized p-braneswith increasing warp factor by gravitational force and can never reach thesingularities.
