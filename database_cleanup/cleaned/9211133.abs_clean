We review some aspects of the quantum Yangians as symmetry algebras oftwo-dimensional quantum field theories. The plan of these notes is theThe generators of the symmetries and the semi-classical Yangians;An alternative presentation of the semi-classical Yangians;Non-Abelian symmetries and the quantum Yangians;The transfer matrix and an alternative presentation of the Yangians;Digression on the double Yangians. Talk given at the "Integrable QuantumField Theories" conference held at Come, Italy , September 13-19, 1992.
