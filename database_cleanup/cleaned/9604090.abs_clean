We review the status of domain walls in $N=1$ supergravity theories for boththe vacuum domain walls as well as dilatonic domain walls. We concentrate on asystematic analysis of the nature of the space-time in such domain wallbackgrounds and the special role that supersymmetry is playing in determiningthe nature of such configurations.
