We derive modular anomaly equations from the Seiberg-Witten-Donagi curves forsoftly broken N=4 SU(n) gauge theories. From these equations we can deriverecursion relations for the pre-potential in powers of m^2, where m is the massof the adjoint hypermultiplet. Given the perturbative contribution of thepre-potential and the presence of ``gaps'' we can easily generate the m^2expansion in terms of polynomials of Eisenstein series, at least for relativelylow rank groups. This enables us to determine efficiently the instantonexpansion up to fairly high order for these gauge groups, e. g. eighth orderfor SU(3). We find that after taking a derivative, the instanton expansion ofthe pre-potential has integer coefficients. We also postulate the form of themodular anomaly equations, the recursion relations and the form of theinstanton expansions for the SO(2n) and E_n gauge groups, even though thecorresponding Seiberg-Witten-Donagi curves are unknown at this time.
