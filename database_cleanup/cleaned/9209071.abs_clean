Title: Coset Models in Monopole Backgrounds

Comments: 26 pages

We study a fermionic coset model $G/H$ when the subgroup $H$ is not simplyconnected. We show that even when the fermionic zero modes impose selectionrules which alters the values of the correlators, the Virasoro central chargeof the theory results independent of the topological sector.
