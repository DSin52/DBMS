Techniques of non-commutative field theories have proven to be useful indescribing D-branes as tachyonic solitons in open string theory. However, thisprocedure also leads to unwanted degeneracy of solutions not present in thespectrum of D-branes in string theories. In this paper we explore thepossibility that this apparent multiplicity of solutions is due to the wrongchoice of variables in describing the solutions, and that with the correctchoice of variables the unwanted degeneracy disappears.
