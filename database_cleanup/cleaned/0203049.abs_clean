We consider rotating topological black branes with one rotational parameterin various dimensions. Also a general five-dimensional higher genus solution ofthe Einstein equation with a negative cosmological constant which represents atopological black brane with two rotational parameters is introduced. We findout that the counterterms inspired by conformal field theory introduced byKraus, Larsen and Sieblink cannot remove the divergences in $r$ of the actionin more than five dimensions. We modify the counterterms by adding a curvatureinvariant term to it. Using the modified counterterms we show that the $r$divergences of the action, the mass, and the angular momentum densities ofthese spacetimes are removed. We also find out in the limit of $m=0$ the massdensity of these spacetimes in odd dimensions is not zero.
