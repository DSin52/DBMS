Projections play crucial roles in the ADHM construction on noncommutative$\R^4$. In this article a framework for the description of equivalencerelations between projections is proposed. We treat the equivalence ofprojections as ``gauge equivalence'' on noncommutative space. We find aninteresting application of this framework to the study of U(2) instanton onorigin is ``gauge equivalent'' to the noncommutative analog of the BPSTinstanton. Thus the ``gauge transformation'' in this case can be understood asa noncommutative resolution of the singular gauge transformation in ordinary$\R^4$.
