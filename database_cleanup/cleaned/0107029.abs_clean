The dual theory describing the 4D Coulomb gas of point-like magneticallycharged objects, which confines closed electric strings, is considered. Therespective generalization of the theory of confining strings to confiningmembranes is further constructed. The same is done for the analogousSU(3)-inspired model. We then consider a combined model which confines bothelectric charges and closed strings. Such a model is nothing, but the mixtureof the above-mentioned Coulomb gas with the condensate of the dual Higgs field,described by the dual Abelian Higgs model. It is demonstrated that in a certainlimit of this dual Abelian Higgs model, the system under study undergoesnaively the dimensional reduction and becomes described by the (completelyintegrable) 2D sine-Gordon theory. In particular, owing to this fact, the phasetransition in such a model must be of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type,and the respective critical temperature is expressed in terms of the parametersof the dual Abelian Higgs model. However, it is finally discussed that thedimensional reduction is rigorously valid only in the strong coupling limit ofthe original 4D Coulomb gas. In such a limit, this reduction transforms thecombined model to the 2D free bosonic theory.
