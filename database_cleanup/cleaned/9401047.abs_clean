Title: Octonions and Binocular Mobilevision

System Studies of Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow)Comments: 9p AMSTEX, (revised version

typographi- cal errors are excluded)Systemsoctonions, the classical structure of pure mathematics, the 2nd one isMobilevision, the recently developped technique of computer graphics. Namely,it is shown that the binocular Mobilevision maybe elaborated by use of theoctonionic colour space - the 7-dimensional extension of the classical one,which includes a strange overcolour besides two triples of ordinary ones(blue,green, red for left and right eyes).Contents.I.
