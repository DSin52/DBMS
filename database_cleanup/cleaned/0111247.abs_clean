We examine the cosmological evolution equations of de Sitter, flat andanti-de Sitter braneworlds sandwiched in between two n dimensionalAdS-Schwarzschild spacetimes. We are careful to use the correct form for theinduced Newton's constant on the brane, and show that it would be naive toassume the energy of the bulk spacetime is just given by the sum of the blackhole masses. By carefully calculating the energy of the bulk for large mass weshow that the induced geometry of the braneworld is just a radiation dominatedFRW universe with the radiation coming from a CFT that is dual to the AdS bulk.
