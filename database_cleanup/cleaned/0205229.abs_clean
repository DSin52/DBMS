We study the one dimensional potentials in q space and the new features thatarise. In particular we show that the probability of tunneling of a particlethrough a barrier or potential step is less than the one of the same particlewith the same energy in ordinary space which is somehow unexpected. We alsoshow that the tunneling time for a particle in q space is less than the one ofthe same particle in ordinary space.
