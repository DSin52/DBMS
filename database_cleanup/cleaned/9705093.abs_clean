Comments: 13 pages, Latex, Contribution to Supersymmetry and Quantum Field

Theory, International Seminar dedicated to the memory of D. V. Volkov(Kharkov, 1997), some clarifications are madeSome aspects of the geometry of superembeddings and its application tosupersymmetric extended objects are discussed. In particular, the embeddings of(3|16) and (6|16) dimensional superspaces into (11|32) dimensional superspace,corresponding to supermembranes and superfivebranes in eleven dimensions, aretreated in some detail.
