Title: Towards a solution of two dimensional QCD

Comments: 8 pages, to appear in the proceedings of Trieste workshop on strings,

gravity and related topics, 1995Using the well-known result for the fermionic determinant in terms of a WZWtheory, we write QCD$_2$ in bosonized form. After some manipulations we givetwo versions of the theory, where it is factorized as a product of theconformally invariant WZW models, ghost terms, and a WZW action perturbed offcriticality. We first prove that the latter is an integrable model.Furthermore, as a consequence of the BRST analysis, there are severalconstraints. Second-class constraints also show up. Using the integrabilitycondition we find higher conservation laws, their action on the asymptoticstates, and we propose an exact $S$-matrix for the physical excitations. Thevacuum structure is analysed, and we prove that a finite number of differentvacua exist. An outline of possible generalizations of the procedure is given.
