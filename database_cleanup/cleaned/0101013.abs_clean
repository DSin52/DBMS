We discuss the field theory interpretation (via holographic duality) of somerecently-discovered string theory solutions with varying flux, focusing on fourdimensional theories with N=2 supersymmetry and with N=1 supersymmetry whicharise as the near-horizon limits of "fractional D3-branes". We argue that inthe N=2 case the best interpretation of the varying flux in field theory is viaa Higgs mechanism reducing the rank of the gauge group, and that there is noneed to invoke a duality to explain the varying flux in this case. We discusswhy a similar interpretation does not seem to apply to the N=1 case of Klebanovand Strassler, which was interpreted as a "duality cascade". However, wesuggest that it might apply to different vacua of the same theory, such as theone constructed by Pando Zayas and Tseytlin.
