Two dimensional induced quantum gravity with matter central charge $c>1$ isstudied taking a careful consideration of both diffeomorphism and Weylsymmetries . It is shown that, for the gauge fixing condition $R(g)$ (scalarcurvature)=$const$, one obtains a modification of the David-Distler-Kawaiversion of KPZ scaling. We obtain a class of models with the real stringtension for all values $c>1$. They contain an indeterminate parameter which is,however, strongly constrained by the requirement of non triviality of such amodel. The possible physical significance of the new model is discussed. Inparticular we note that it describes smooth surfaces imbedded in$d$-dimensional flat space time for arbitrary $d$, consistently with recentnumerical result for $d=3$.
