We present new supersymmetric domain wall and string solutions offive-dimensional N = 2 gauged supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number ofvector multiplets. Using the techniques of very special geometry allows toobtain the most general domain wall preserving half of the supersymmetries.This solution, which describes a renormalization group flow in the dual fieldtheory, is given in terms of Weierstrass elliptic functions. The magneticallycharged, one quarter supersymmetric string solutions are shown to be closelyrelated to Liouville theory. We furthermore investigate general product spacecompactifications, and show that topological transitions from AdS_3 x S^2 toAdS_3 x H^2 can occur when one moves in moduli space.
