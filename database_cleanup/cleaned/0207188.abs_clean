We present a universal normal algebra suitable for constructing andclassifying Calabi-Yau spaces in arbitrary dimensions. This algebraic approachincludes natural extensions of reflexive weight vectors to higher dimensions,related to Batyrev's reflexive polyhedra, and their n-ary combinations. It alsoincludes a `dual' construction based on the Diophantine decomposition ofinvariant monomials, which provides explicit recurrence formulae for thenumbers of Calabi-Yau spaces in arbitrary dimensions with Weierstrass, K3,etc., fibrations. Our approach also yields simple algebraic relations betweenchains of Calabi-Yau spaces in different dimensions, and concretevisualizations of their singularities related to Cartan-Lie algebras. ThisUniversal Calabi-Yau Algebra is a powerful tool for decyphering the Calabi-Yaugenome in all dimensions.
