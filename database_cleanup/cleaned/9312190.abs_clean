A certain topological field theory is shown to be equivalent to thecompactified c=1 string. This theory is described in both Kazama-Suzuki cosetand Landau-Ginzburg formulations. The genus-g partition function and genus-0multi-tachyon correlators of the c=1 string are shown to be calculable in thisapproach. The KPZ formulation of non-critical string theory has a naturalrelation to this topological model.
