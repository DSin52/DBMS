Title: Matrix Models of 2D Gravity and Induced QCD

Authors: Yu. Makeenko

Comments: 14pp., Latex, ITEP-YM-6-93 (a review talk)

I review some recent works on the Hermitean one-matrix and d-dimensionalgauge-invariant matrix models. Special attention is paid to solving the modelsat large-N by the loop equations. For the one-matrix model the main resultconcerns calculations of higher genera, while for the d-dimensional model thelarge-N solution for a logarithmic potential is described. Some results onfermionic matrix models are briefly reviewed. Talk at the Workshop on QuantumField Theoretical Aspects of High Energy Physics, Kyffhaeuser, Germany,September 20-24, 1993
