Title: Exact Solution of 1-matrix Model

Authors: Hiroshi Shirokura (Osaka University)

Comments: 10 pages, uses LaTeX, based on a contribution paper for the

proceedings of the workshop "Frontiers in Quantum Field Theory", held atOsaka, December, 1995I review my new method for solving general 1-matrix models by expanding in$N^{-1}$ without taking a physical continuum limit. Using my method, eachcoefficient of the free energy in the genus expansion is exactly computable.One can include physical information in a function which is uniquely specifiedby the action of the model. My method gives completely the same result with theusual one if the physical fine tuning is done and the leading singular termsare extracted. I also calculate in the genus three case and confirm thevalidity of my method.
