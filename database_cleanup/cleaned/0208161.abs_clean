We obtain, in a systematic way, all the classical BPS equations whichcorrespond to the quantum BPS states in the M-theory on a fully supersymmetricpp-wave. The superalgebra of the M-theory matrix model shows that the BPSstates always preserve pairs of supersymmetry, implying the possible fractionsof the unbroken supersymmetry as 2/16, 4/16, 6/16,.... We study their classicalcounterparts, and find there are essentially one unique set of 2/16 BPSequations, three inequivalent types of 4/16 BPS equations, and threeinequivalent types of 8/16 BPS equations only, in addition to the 16/16 staticfuzzy sphere. We discuss various supersymmetric objects as solutions. Inparticular, when the fuzzy sphere rotates, the supersymmetry is further brokenas 16/16 -> 8/16 -> 4/16.
