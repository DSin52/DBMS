We use Feynman diagrams to prove a formula for the Jones polynomial of a linkderived recently by N.~Reshetikhin. This formula presents the colored Jonespolynomial as an integral over the coadjoint orbits corresponding to therepresentations assigned to the link components. The large $k$ limit of theintegral can be calculated with the help of the stationary phase approximation.The Feynman rules allow us to express the phase in terms of integrals over themanifold and the link components. Its stationary points correspond to flatconnections in the link complement. We conjecture a relation between thedominant part of the phase and Milnor's linking numbers. We check it explicitlyfor the triple and quartic numbers by comparing their expression through theMassey product with Feynman diagram integrals.
