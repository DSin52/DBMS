In type II string theories, we examine intersecting brane constructionscontaining brane-antibrane pairs suspended between 5-branes, and more generalnon-BPS constructions. The tree-level spectra are obtained in each case. Weadjacent pairs, non-adjacent pairs, and configurations which break allsupersymmetry even though any pair of branes preserves some supersymmetry. Ineach case we examine the possible decay modes. Some of these configurationsturn out to be tachyon-free, stable non-BPS states. We use T-duality to mapsome of our brane constructions to brane-antibrane pairs at ALE singularities.This enables us to explicitly derive the spectra by the analogue of the quiverconstruction, and to compute the sign of the brane-antibrane force in eachcase.
