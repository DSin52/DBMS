The status of gaugino condensation in low-energy string theory is reviewed.Emphasis is given to the determination of the efective action belowcondensation scale in terms of the 2PI and Wilson actions. We illustrate howthe different perturbative duality symmetries survive this simplenonperturbative phenomenon, providing evidence for the believe that these areexact nonperturbative symmetries of string theory. Consistency with T dualitylifts the moduli degeneracy. The $B_{\mu\nu}-axion$ duality also survives in anontrivial way in which the degree of freedom corresponding to $B_{\mu\nu}$ isreplaced by a massive $H_{\mu\nu\rho}$ field but duality is preserved. Sduality may also be implemented in this process. Some general problems of thismechanism are mentioned and the possible nonperturbative scenarios forsupersymmetry breaking in string theory are discussed.
