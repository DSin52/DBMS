One considers the quantum dynamics of a charged spin-1/2 particle in anextended external eletromagnetic field that arises from the reduction of a5-dimensional Abelian gauge theory. The non-relativistic regime of the reduced4D-dynamics is worked out and one identifies the system as a sector of anN=2-supersymmetric quantum-mechanical dynamics. The full supersymmetric modelis studied and one checks the algebra of the fermionic charges; the conclusionis that no central charge drops out. The possible r\^ole of the extra externalfields, a scalar and a magnetic-like field, is discussed.
