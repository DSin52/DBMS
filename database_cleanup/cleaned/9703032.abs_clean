Title: Single particles and composite systems in a mathematically rigorous

formulation of relativistic quantum field theoryComments: 24 pages, latex

We define quantum field theory by taking the Lagrangian action to be given asa sequence of mathematically well-defined functionals written in terms ofoperator fields fulfilling given \hbox{local} commutation relations. Therenormalized solution fields have a fully defined Fock space expansion and are\hbox{multi-local}; thus Haag's theorem does not apply, i.e., the interactionpicture exists. Also, the formalism allows immediately the definition of a wavefunction and the description of many-body bound-state systems.
