Lab., USAThere is a close relation between duality in $N=2$ SUSY gauge theories andintegrable models. In particular, the quantum moduli space of vacua of $N=2$SUSY $SU(3)$ gauge theories coupled to two flavors of massless quarks in thefundamental representation can be related to the spectral curve of theGoryachev-Chaplygin top. Generalizing this to the cases with {\it massive}quarks, and $N_f = 0,1,2$, we find a corresponding integrable system in sevendimensional phase space where a hyperelliptic curve appears in the Painlev\'etest. To understand the stringy origin of the integrability of these theorieswe obtain exact nonperturbative point particle limit of type II stringcompactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold, which gives the hyperelliptic curve of$SU(2)$ QCD with $N_f =1$ hypermultiplet.
