We derive the five-dimensional metrics which describe a non-singular boundarybrane collision in the ekpyrotic scenario in the context of general relativity,taking into account brane tension. We show that the metrics constrain mattercreated in the collision to have negative energy density or pressure. Inparticular, the minimal field content of heterotic M-theory leads to negativeenergy density. We also consider bulk brane-boundary brane collisions and showthat the collapse of the fifth dimension is an artifact of the four-dimensionaleffective theory.
