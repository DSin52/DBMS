Title: AdS2 Models in an Embedding Superspace

Authors: D.G.C. McKeon (University of Western Ontario), T.N. Sherry (National

University of Ireland, Galway)An embedding superspace, whose Bosonic part is the flat 2 + 1 dimensionalembedding space for AdS2, is introduced. Superfields and several supersymmetricmodels are examined in the embedded AdS2 superspace.
