We develop further a new geometrical model of a discretized string, proposedin [1] and establish its basic physical properties. The model can be consideredas the natural extention of the usual Feynman amplitude of the random walks torandom surfaces. Both amplitudes coinside in the case, when the surfacedegenarates into a single particle world line. We extend the model to opensurfaces as well. The boundary contribution is proportional to the full lengthof the boundary and the coefficient of proportionality can be treated as ahopping parameter of the quarks. In the limit, when this parameter tends toinfinity, the theory is essentialy simlplified. We prove that the contributionof a given triangulation to the partition function is finite and have found theexplicit form for the upper bound. The question of the convergence of the fullpartition function remains open. In this model the string tension may vanish atthe critical point, if the last one exists, and possess a nontrivial scalinglimit. The model contains hidden fermionic variables and can be considered asan independent model of hadrons.
