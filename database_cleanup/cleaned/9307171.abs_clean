The interpretation of the apparent unification of gauge couplings withinsupersymmetric theories depends on uncertainties induced through heavy particlethresholds. While in standard grand unified theories these effects can beestimated easily, the corresponding calculations are quite complicated instring unified theories and do exist only in models with unbroken $E_6$. Wepresent results for heavy particle thresholds in more realistic models withgauge group $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$. Effects of Wilson line backgroundfields as well as the universal part of the (rather mild) threshold correctionsindicate a strong model dependence. We discuss the consequences of our resultsfor the idea of string unification without a grand unified gauge group.
