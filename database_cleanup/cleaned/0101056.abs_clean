N=1^* gauge theories are believed to have fractional instanton contributionsin the confining vacua. D3 brane probe computations in gravitation dual oflarge-N N=2^* gauge theories point to the absence of such contributions in thelow energy gauge dynamics. We study fractional instantons in N=2 SU(2)Yang-Mills theory from the field theoretical perspective. We present newsolutions to the Seiberg-Witten SU(2) monodromy problem with the sameperturbative asymptotic, a massless monopole and a dyon singularity on themoduli space, and fractional instanton corrections to N=2 prepotential in thesemi-classical region of the moduli space. We show that fractional instantonslead to infinite monopole (dyon) condensate in mass deformed N=2 gaugetheories.
