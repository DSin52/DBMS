Title: Strings from Tachyons

We propose a new interpretation of the c=1 matrix model as the world-linetheory of N unstable D-particles, in which the hermitian matrix is provided bythe non-abelian open string tachyon. For D-particles in 1+1-d string theory, wefind a direct quantitative match between the closed string emission due to arolling tachyon and that due to a rolling eigenvalue in the matrix model. Weexplain the origin of the double-scaling limit, and interpret it as an extremerepresentative of a large equivalence class of dual theories. Finally, wedefine a concrete decoupling limit of unstable D-particles in IIB string theorythat reduces to the c=1 matrix model, suggesting that 1+1-d string theoryrepresents the near-horizon limit of an ultra-dense gas of IIB D-particles.
