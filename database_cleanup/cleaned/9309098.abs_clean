We study the one-loop contributions of matter and radiation to thegravitational polarization tensor at finite temperatures. Using theanalytically continued imaginary-time formalism, the contribution of matter isexplicitly given to next-to-leading ($T^2$) order. We obtain an exact form forthe contribution of radiation fields, expressed in terms of generalized Riemannzeta functions. A general expression is derived for the physical polarizationtensor, which is independent of the parametrization of graviton fields. Weinvestigate the effective thermal masses associated with the normal modes ofthe corresponding graviton self-energy.
