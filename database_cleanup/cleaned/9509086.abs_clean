A non-abelian ``self-dual'' massive gauge theory describing a massive spinone physical mode is presented. The action is expressed in terms of twoindependent connections on a principle bundle over $2+1$ space-time. Thekinetic terms are respectively a Chern-Simons and a $BF$ lagrangians, while thegauge invariant interaction is expressed in terms of the difference of the twoconnections. At the linearized level the theory is equivalent to theTopological Massive gauge theory. The covariant, $BRST$ invariant, effectiveaction of the non-abelian sefl dual gauge theory is constructed.
