Within the framework of Euclidean path integral and mass perturbation theorywe compute the Wilson loop of widely separated external charges for the massiveSchwinger model. From this result we show for arbitrary order mass perturbationtheory that integer external charges are completely screened, whereas fornoninteger charges a constant long-range force remains.
