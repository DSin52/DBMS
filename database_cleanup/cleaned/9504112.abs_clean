Title: Deformations in Closed String Theory -- Canonical Formulation and

RegularizationComments: Plain TeX, 16 pages. Some additions in the discussion of the

curvatureJournal-ref: Nucl.Phys. B464 (1996) 117-134

We study deformations of closed string theory by primary fields of conformalweight $(1,1)$, using conformal techniques on the complex plane. A canonicalsurface integral formalism for computing commutators in a non-holomorphictheory is constructed, and explicit formul\ae for deformations of operators aregiven. We identify the unique regularization of the arising divergences thatrespects conformal invariance, and consider the corresponding paralleltransport. The associated connection is metric compatible and carries nocurvature.
