Title: Quantum algebras and Lie groups

Comments: 9 pages

Lie groups and quantum algebras are connected through their common universalenveloping algebra. The adjoint action of Lie group on its algebra is naturallyextended to related q-algebra and q-coalgebra. In such a way, quantum structurecan be dealt more or less as the Lie one and we do not need to introduce thenot easy to handle topological groups.Composed system also is described by the suitably symmetrized q-coalgebra.A physical application to the phonon, irreducible unitary representation ofE_q(1,1), shows both the transformation under the group action of one phononstate and the fusion of two phonons, by means of the coproduct, in only onephonon lying on a branch of the appropriate dispersion relation.
