We show that the harmonic Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin method of quantizingbosonic systems with second-class constraints or first-class holomorphicconstraints extends to systems having both bosonic and fermionic second-classor first-class holomorphic constraints. Using a limit argument, we show thatthe harmonic BRST modified path integral reproduces the correct Senjanovicmeasure.
