Title: Matrix String Theory As A Generalized Quantum Theory

Authors: Djordje Minic

Comments: 15 pages, TeX

Matrix String Theory of Banks, Fischler, Shenker and Susskind can beunderstood as a generalized quantum theory (provisionally named "quansical"theory) which differs from Adler's generalized trace quantum dynamics. Theeffective Matrix String Theory Hamiltonian is constructed in a particularfermionic realization of Matrix String Theory treated as an example of"quansical" theory.
