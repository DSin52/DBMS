We complete the construction of vacuum string field theory by proposing acanonical choice of ghost kinetic term -- a local insertion of the ghost fieldat the string midpoint with an infinite normalization. This choice, supportedby level expansion studies in the Siegel gauge, allows a simple analytictreatment of the ghost sector of the string field equations. As a result,solutions are just projectors, such as the sliver, of an auxiliary CFT built bycombining the matter part with a twisted version of the ghost conformal theory.Level expansion experiments lead to surprising new projectors -- butterflysurface states, whose analytical expressions are obtained. With the help of asuitable open-closed string vertex we define open-string gauge invariantoperators parametrized by on-shell closed string states. We use regulatedvacuum string field theory to sketch how pure closed string amplitudes onsurfaces without boundaries arise as correlators of such gauge invariantoperators.
