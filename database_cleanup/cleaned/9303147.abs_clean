The method of Hawking to obtain black hole evaporation through Bogoljubovtransformation between asymptotic modes (in and out) is generalized. Theconstruction is local in that the in modes (of say positive frequency) aredecomposed by Bogoljubov transformation into positive and negative frequencylocal inertial modes (i.e. those which are solutions of the d'Alembertian interms of the local normal coordinates). From this follows an interestingreexpression of the local energy momentum tensor, more particularly of theoutgoing energy flux. One finds that even in the local description there existsa partial thermal character parametrized by a local temperature. There existsquantum interference effects as well. These become negligible at large distancefrom the black hole.
