These unique properties play fundamental roles infield theory, especially, in the description of classical domains and quantumfluctuations of physical fields, in the calculations of physical processesinvolving infinite number of virtual particles, in the derivation of functionalintegrals and various effective field theories, also in the determination oflong-range orders and collective excitations, and finally in the exploration oforigins of topologically nontrivial gauge fields and associated gauge degreesof freedom.
