Title: Towards Covariant Quantization of the Supermembrane

Comments: Changed title since the hamiltonian still needs to be regularized.

By replacing ten-dimensional pure spinors with eleven-dimensional purespinors, the formalism recently developed for covariantly quantizing the d=10superparticle and superstring is extended to the d=11 superparticle andsupermembrane. In this formalism, kappa symmetry is replaced by a BRST-likeinvariance using the nilpotent operator Q=int (lambda^alpha d_alpha) whered_alpha is the worldvolume variable corresponding to the d=11 spacetimesupersymmetric derivative and lambda^alpha is an SO(10,1) pure spinor variablesatisfying (lambda Gamma^c lambda)=0 for c=1 to 11.Super-Poincare covariant unintegrated and integrated supermembrane vertexoperators are explicitly constructed which are in the cohomology of Q. Afterdouble-dimensional reduction of the eleventh dimension, these vertex operatorsare related to Type IIA superstring vertex operators where Q=Q_L+Q_R is the sumof the left and right-moving Type IIA BRST operators and the eleventh componentof the pure spinor constraint, (lambda Gamma^{11} lambda)=0, replaces the(b_L^0 - b_R^0) constraint of the closed superstring. A conjecture is made forthe computation of M-theory scattering amplitudes using these supermembranevertex operators.
