We construct the CP^n model on fuzzy sphere. The Bogomolny bound is saturatedby (anti-)self-dual solitons and the general solutions of BPS equation areconstructed. The dimension of moduli space describing the BPS solution on fuzzysphere is exactly the same as that of the commutative sphere or the(noncommutative) plane. We show that in the soliton backgrounds, the number ofzero modes of Dirac operator on fuzzy sphere, Atiyah-Singer index, is exactlygiven by the topological charge of the background solitons.
