We express the Pontryagin index in Polyakov gauge completely in terms ofmagnetically charged gauge fixing defects, namely magnetic monopoles, lines,and domain walls. Open lines and domain walls are topologically equivalent tomonopoles, which are the genuine defects. The emergence of non-genuinemagnetically charged closed domain walls can be avoided by choosing thetemporal gauge field smoothly. The Pontryagin index is then exclusivelydetermined by the magnetic monopoles.
