We construct and discuss all background charges and continuous consistentdeformations of standard $2d$ gravity theories with scalar matter fields. Itturns out that the background charges and those deformations which changenontrivially both the form of the action and of its gauge symmetries areclosely linked and exist only if the target space has at least one special(`covariantly constant') Killing vector which must be a null vector in the caseof the deformations. The deformed actions provide interesting novel $2d$gravity models. We argue that some of them lead to non-critical stringtheories.
