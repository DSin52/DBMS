In the paper we present a different proof of the theorem of B. L. Feigin andD. B. Fuchs about the structure of Verma modules over Virasoro algebra. Westate some new results about the structure of Verma modules over Neveu-Schwarz.cases (for example in the so called minimal models), second, it can begeneralized for Neveu-Schwarz algebra for some class of Verma modules.
