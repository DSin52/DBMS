We examine Bose-Einstein condensation as a form of symmetry breaking in thespecific model of the Einstein static universe. We show that symmetry breakingnever occursin the sense that the chemical potential $\mu$ never reaches itscritical value.This leads us to some statements about spaces of finite volumein general. In an appendix we clarify the relationship between the standardstatistical mechanical approaches and the field theory method using zetafunctions.
