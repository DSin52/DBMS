Title: Comment on ``Additional analytically exact solutions for three-anyons''

and ``Fermion Ground State of Three Particles in a Harmonic Potential Welland Its Anyon Interpolation''Comments: 2 pages, LATEX 2.09

The claim put forward in [hep-th/9512051, hep-th/9612244] that the energiesof the ``missing'' states of three anyons in a harmonic potential dependlinearly on the statistics parameter, is incorrect because the wave functionsproposed do not satisfy the anyonic interchange conditions.
