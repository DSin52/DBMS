Based on results for real deformation parameter q we introduce a compact non-commutative structure covariant under the quantum group SOq(3) for q being aroot of unity. To match the algebra of the q-deformed operators with necesarryconjugation properties it is helpful to define a module over the algebragenera- ted by the powers of q. In a representation where X is diagonal we showhow P can be calculated. To manifest some typical properties an example of aone-di- mensional q-deformed Heisenberg algebra is also considered and comparedwith non-compact case.
