We consider the recently obtained integral representation of quantumKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation of level 0. We obtain the condition for theintegral kernel such that these solutions satisfy three axioms for form factor\'{a} la Smirnov. We discuss the relation between this integral representationand the form factor of XXZ spin chain.
