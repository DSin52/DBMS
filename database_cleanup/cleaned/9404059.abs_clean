We investigate the structure of the configuration space of gauge theories andits description in terms of the set of absolute minima of certain Morsefunctions on the gauge orbits. The set of absolute minima that is obtained whenthe background connection is a pure gauge is shown to be isomorphic to theorbit space of the pointed gauge group. We also show that the stratum ofirreducible orbits is geodesically convex, i.e. there are no geometricalobstructions to the classical motion within the main stratum. An explicitdescription of the singularities of the configuration space of SU(2) theorieson a topologically simple space-time and on the lattice is obtained; in thecontinuum case we find that the singularities are conical and that the singularstratum is isomorphic to a Z_2 orbifold of the configuration space ofelectrodynamics.
