A new deformation of the of the Poincar\'e group and of the Minkowskispace-time is given. From the mathematical point of view this deformation israther quantum-braided group. Global and local structure of thisquantum-braided Poincar\'e group is investigated. A kind of ``quantum metrics''is introduced in the $q$-Minkowski space.
