We unify all existing results on the change of the speed of low--energyphotons due to modifications of the vacuum, finding that it is given by auniversal constant times the quotient of the difference of energy densitiesbetween the usual and modified vacua over the mass of the electron to thefourth power.  Whether photons move faster or slower than $c$ depends only onthe lower or higher energy density of the modified vacuum, respectively.Physically, a higher energy density is characterized by the presence ofadditional particles (real or virtual) in the vacuum whereas a lower one stemsfrom the absence of some virtual modes.  We then carry out a systematic studyof the speed of propagation of massless particles for several field theories upto two loops on a thermal vacuum. Only low--energy massless particlescorresponding to a massive theory show genuine modifications of their speedwhile remaining massless. All other modifications are mass-related, or runningmass-related. We also develop a formalism for the Casimir vacuum whichparallels the thermal one and check that photons travel faster than $c$ betweenplates.
