The heterotic string compactified on a six-torus is described by a low-energyeffective action consisting of N=4 supergravity coupled to N=4 superYang-Mills, a theory that was studied in detail many years ago. By explicitlycarrying out the dimensional reduction of the massless fields, we obtain thebosonic sector of this theory. In the Abelian case the action is written withmanifest global $O(6,6+n)$ symmetry. A duality transformation that replaces theantisymmetric tensor field by an axion brings it to a form in which the axionand dilaton parametrize an $SL(2,R)/SO(2)$ coset, and the equations of motionhave $SL(2,R)$ symmetry. This symmetry, which combines Peccei--Quinntranslations with Montonen--Olive duality transformations, has been exploitedin several recent papers to construct black hole solutions carrying bothelectric and magnetic charge. Our purpose is to explore whether, as variousauthors have conjectured, an $SL(2,Z)$ subgroup could be an exact symmetry ofthe full quantum string theory. If true, this would be of fundamentalimportance, since this group transforms the dilaton nonlinearly and can relateweak and strong coupling.
