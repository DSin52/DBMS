This paper presents an analysis of the radiation seen by an observer incircular acceleration, for a magnetic spin. This is applied to an electron in astorage ring, and the subtilty of the interaction of the spin with the spatialmotion of the electron is explicated. This interaction is shown to be timedependent (in the radiating frame), which explains the strange results foundfor the electron's residual polarisation in the literature. Finally, some briefcomments about the radiation emitted by an accelerating detector are made whereit is shown that the spectrum is correlated in that particles are emitted inpairs.
