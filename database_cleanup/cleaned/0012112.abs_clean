We present the discussion of the energy-momentum tensor of the scalar$\phi^4$- theory on a noncommutative space. The Noether procedure is performedat the operator level. Additionally, the broken dilatation symmetry will beconsidered in a Moyal-Weyl deformed scalar field theory at the classical level.
