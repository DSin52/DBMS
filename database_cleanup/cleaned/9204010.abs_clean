A method for finding Berry's phase is proposed under the Euclidean pathintegral formalism. It is characterized by picking up the imaginary part fromthe resultant exponent. Discussion is made on the generalized harmonicoscillator which is shown being so universal in a single degree case. The spinmodel expressed by creation and annihilation operators is also discussed. Asystematic way of expansion in the adiabatic approximation is presented inevery example.
