The affine-Virasoro Ward identities are a system of non-linear differentialequations which describe the correlators of all affine-Virasoro constructions,including rational and irrational conformal field theory. We study the Wardidentities in some detail, with several central results. First, we solve forthe correlators of the affine-Sugawara nests, which are associated to thenested subgroups $g\supset h_1 \supset \ldots \supset h_n$. We also find anequivalent algebraic formulation which allows us to find global solutionsacross the set of all affine-Virasoro constructions. A particular globalsolution is discussed which gives the correct nest correlators, exhibitsbraiding for all affine-Virasoro correlators, and shows good physical behavior,at least for four-point correlators at high level on simple $g$. In rationaland irrational conformal field theory, the high-level fusion rules of thebroken affine modules follow the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of therepresentations.
