Title: Dark Matter, Quantum Gravity, Vacuum Energy, and Lorentz Invariance

Authors: Roland E. Allen

Comments: 5 pages; to be published in the proceedings of the Second Meeting on

CPT and Lorentz Symmetry, edited by V. A. Kostelecky (World Scientific,Singapore, 2002)We discuss the problems of dark matter, quantum gravity, and vacuum energywithin the context of a theory for which Lorentz invariance is not postulated,but instead emerges as a natural consequence in the physical regimes where ithas been tested.
