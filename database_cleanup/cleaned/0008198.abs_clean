finite temperatureAuthors: A. C. Petkou and G. Siopsis

Comments: 8 pages, LaTex

We discuss the relevance of the Lee-Yang edge singularity to thefinite-temperature Z_2-symmetry restoration transition of the Gross-Neveu modelin three dimensions. We present an explicit result for its large-N free energydensity in terms of Zeta(3) and the absolute maximum of Clausen's function.
