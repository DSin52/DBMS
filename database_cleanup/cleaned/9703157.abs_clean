We study certain compactifications of the type I string on K3. The threetopologically distinct choices of gauge bundle for the type I theory are shownto be equivalent to type IIB orientifolds with different choices of backgroundanti-symmetric tensor field flux. Using a mirror transformation, we relatethese models to orientifolds with fixed seven planes, and without anyantisymmetric tensor field flux. This map allows us to relate these type Ivacua to particular six-dimensional F theory and heterotic stringcompactifications.
