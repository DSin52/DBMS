Recent ideas on modular localization in local quantum physics are used toclarify the relation between on- and off-shell quantities in particle physics;in particular the relation between on-shell crossing symmetry and off-shellEinstein causality. Among the collateral results of this new nonperturbativeapproach are profound relations between crossing symmetry of particle physicsand Hawking-Unruh like thermal aspects (KMS property, entropy attached tohorizons) of quantum matter behind causal horizons, aspects which hitherto wereexclusively related with Killing horizons in curved spacetime rather than withlocalization aspects in Minkowski space particle physics. The scope of thismodular framework is amazingly wide and ranges from providing a conceptualbasis for the d=1+1 bootstrap-formfactor program for factorizable d=1+1 modelsto a decomposition theory of QFT's in terms of a finite collection of unitarilyequivalent chiral conformal theories placed a specified relative positionwithin a common Hilbert space (in d=1+1 a holographic relation and in higherdimensions more like a scanning). The new framework gives a spacetimeinterpretation to the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra and explains its thermalaspects.
