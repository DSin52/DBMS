Title: Large Improved Wick Rotation Prescription in Stochastic Quantization of

Dissipative SystemsAuthors: Naohito Nakazawa and Eisaku Sakane

We apply Stochastic Quantization Method to dissipative systems at finitetemperature. Especially, the relation of SQM to the Caldeira-Leggett model isclarified ensuring that the naive Wick rotation is improved in this context. Weshow that the Langevin system obtained by the \lq\lq Improved Wick Rotation "prescription is equivalent to an ideal friction case ( low temperature limit)in the C-L model. We derive, based on our approach, a general formula on thefluctuation-dissipation theorem for higher derivative frictions.
