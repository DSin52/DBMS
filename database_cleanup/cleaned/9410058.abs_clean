the construction of p-adic field theory limit of TGDThis paper is the first one in the series devoted to the calculation ofparticle mass spectrum in Topological GeometroDynamics. TGD Universe iscritical at quantum level and an attractive idea to realize criticality is viaconformal invariance. Ordinary real numbers do not allow this but if oneassumes that in long length scales p-adic topology replaces real topology aseffective topology situation changes. The existence of square root in thevicinity of p-adic real axis implies 4-dimensional algebraic extension ofp-adic numbers ($p>2$), which can be regarded as padic counterpart of lightcone and consists of convergence-cubes of p-adic square root function. Laterwork has demonstrated that convergence cubes of square root function serve asnatural quantization volumes in p-adic field theory limit of TGD.
