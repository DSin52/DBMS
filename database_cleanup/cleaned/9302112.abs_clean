The master equation describing non-equilibrium one-dimensional problems likediffusion limited reactions or critical dynamics of classical spin systems canbe written as a Schr\"odinger equation in which the wave function is theprobability distribution and the Hamiltonian is that of a quantum chain withnearest neighbor interactions. Since many one-dimensional quantum chains areintegrable, this opens a new field of applications. At the same time physicalintuition and probabilistic methods bring new insight into the understanding ofthe properties of quantum chains. A simple example is the asymmetric diffusionof several species of particles which leads naturally to Hecke algebras and$q$-deformed quantum groups. Many other examples are given. Several relevanttechnical aspects like critical exponents, correlation functions andfinite-size scaling are also discussed in detail.
