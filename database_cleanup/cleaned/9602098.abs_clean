Three dyon solutions to the SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs system are presented.These solutions are obtained from the BPS dyon by allowing the gauge fields tobe complex, or by letting the free parameter of the BPS solution becomeimaginary. In all cases however the physically measurable quantities connectedwith these new solutions are entirely real. Although the new solutions aremathematically simple variations of the BPS solution, they have one or morephysically distinct characteristics.
