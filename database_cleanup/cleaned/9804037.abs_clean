Title: S-duality and Strong Coupling Behavior of Large N Gauge Theories with

N=4 SupersymmetryAuthors: Tohru Eguchi (ITP, Santa Barbara and Phys. Dept., Univ. of Tokyo)

We analyze the strong coupling behavior of the large N gauge theories in4-dimensions with N=4 supersymmetry by making use of S-duality. We show that atlarge values of the coupling constant $\lambda=g_{YM}^2N$ the j-th non-planaramplitude $f_j(\lambda) (j=0,1,2 ...)$ behaves as $f_j(\lambda)\approx\lambda^j$. Implication of this behavior is discussed in connection with thesupergravity theory on $AdS_5\times S^5$ suggested by the CFT/AdScorrespondence. S-duality of the gauge theory corresponds to the dualitybetween the closed and open string loop expansions in the gravity/stringtheory.
