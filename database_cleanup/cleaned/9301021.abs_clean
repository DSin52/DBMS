Title: Positive Energy Theorem and Supersymmetry in Exactly Solvable

Quantum-Corrected 2D Dilaton-GravityAuthors: Adel Bilal

Comments: 30 pages, significantly revised and extended

uniqueness of the positive energy functional is proven and the conditions aremade more precise. The functional is shown to lead to satisfactory ADM andBondi masses whose properties are studied in detail. The Bondi mass isevaluated explicitly for the RST shockwave scenarioJournal-ref: Phys.Rev.

Extending the work of Park and Strominger, we prove a positive energy theoremfor the exactly solvable quantum-corrected 2D dilaton gravity theories. Thepositive energy functional we construct is shown to be unique (within areasonably broad class of such functionals). For field configurationsasymptotic to the LDV we show that this energy functional (if defined on aspace-like surface) yields the usual (classical) definition of the ADM mass{\it plus a certain ``quantum"-correction. If defined on a null surface theenergy functional yields the Bondi mass. The latter is evaluated careflly andapplied to the RST shock-wave scenario where it is shown to behave asphysically expected. Motivated by the existence of a positivity theorem weconstruct manifestly supersymmetric (semiclassical) extensions of thesequantum-corrected dilaton-gravity theories.
