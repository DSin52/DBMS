We describe numerical methods for constructing lump solutions in open stringfield theory. According to Sen, these lumps represent lower dimensionalDp-Branes and numerical evaluation of their energy can be compared with theexpected value for the tension. We take particular care of all higherderivative terms inherent in Witten's version of open string field theory. Theimportance of these terms for off shell phenomena is argued in the text.Detailed numerical calculations done for the case of general $p$ brane showvery good agreement with Sen's conjectured value. This gives credence to theconjecture itself and establishes further the usefulness of Witten's version ofSFT .
