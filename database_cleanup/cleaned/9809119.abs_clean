The projector onto gauge invariant physical states was recently constructedfor arbitrary constrained systems. This approach, which does not require gaugefixing nor any additional degrees of freedom beyond the original ones---twocharacteristic features of all other available methods for quantisingconstrained dynamics---is put to work in the context of a general class ofquantum mechanical gauge invariant systems. The cases of SO(2) and SO(3) gaugegroups are considered specifically, and a comprehensive understanding of thecorresponding physical spectra is achieved in a straightforward manner, usingonly standard methods of coherent states and group theory which are directlyamenable to generalisation to other Lie algebras. Results extend by far the fewexamples available in the literature from much more subtle and delicateanalyses implying gauge fixing and the characterization of modular space.
