We show that a non-trivial dilaton condensation alters the dimensions oforientifold planes. An off-shell crosscap state which naturally interpolatesbetween the usual on-shell crosscap states and their T-duals plays an importantrole in the analysis. We present an explicit representation of the off-shellcrosscap state on an RP2 worldsheet in the gauge in which the worldsheetcurvature in the bulk of the fundamental region of the RP2 vanishes. We showthat the non-trivial dilaton condensation reproduces the correct descentrelation among orientifold plane tensions.
