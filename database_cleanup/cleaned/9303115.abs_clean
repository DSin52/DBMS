The positive-energy unitary irreducible representations of the $q$-deformedconformal algebra ${\cal C}_q = {\cal U}_q(su(2,2))$ are obtained byappropriate deformation of the classical ones. When the deformation parameter$q$ is $N$-th root of unity, all these unitary representations becomefinite-dimensional. For this case we discuss in some detail the masslessrepresentations, which are also irreducible representations of the $q$-deformedPoincar\'e subalgebra of ${\cal C}_q$. Generically, their dimensions aresmaller than the corresponding finite-dimensional non-unitary representation of$su(2,2)$, except when $N=2$, $h=0$ and $N = 2 \vert h\vert +1$, where $h$ isthe helicity of the representations. The latter cases include the fundamentalrepresentations with $h = \pm 1/2$.
