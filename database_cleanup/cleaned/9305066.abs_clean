We show that macroscopic heterotic strings, formulated as strings which windaround a compact direction of finite but macroscopic extent, exhibitnon-trivial scattering at low energies. This occurs at order velocity squaredand may thus be described as geodesic motion on a moduli space with anon-trivial metric which we construct. Our result is in agreement with a directcalculation of the string scattering amplitude.
