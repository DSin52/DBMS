Within mass perturbation theory, already the first order contribution to thechiral condensate of the massive Schwinger model is UV divergent. We discussthe problem of choosing a proper normalization and, by making use of somebosonization results, we are able to choose a normalization so that theresulting chiral condensate may be compared, e.g., with lattice data.
