We find an infinite number of noncommutative geometries which posses adifferential structure. They generalize the two dimensional noncommutativeplane, and have infinite dimensional representations. Upon applying generalizedcoherent states we are able to take the continuum limit, where we recover thepunctured plane with non constant Poisson structures.
