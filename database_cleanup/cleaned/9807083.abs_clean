In this work we construct the vacuum configuration of supergravityinteracting with homogeneous complex scalar matter fields. The correspondingconfiguration is of the FRW model invariant under the $n=2$ local conformaltime supersymmetry, which is a subgroup of the four dimensional space-timesupersymmetry. We show, that the potential of the scalar matter fields is afunction of the K\"ahler potential and of the arbitrary parameter $\alpha$.This parameter enumerates the vacuum states. The scalar matter potentialinduces the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry in supergravity. On thequantum level our model is a specific supersymmetric quantum mechanics, whichadmits quantum states in supergravity, and the states with zero energy aredescribed by the wave function of the FRW universe.
