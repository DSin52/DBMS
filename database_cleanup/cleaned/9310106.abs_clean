For three anyons confined in a harmonic oscillator, only the class of statesthat interpolate nonlinearly with the statistical parameter contributes to thethird virial coefficient of a free anyon gas. Rather than evaluating the fullthree-body partition function as was done in an earlier publication (Phys. Rev.{\bf A46}, 4693 (1992)), here only the nonlinear contribution is calculated,thus avoiding delicate cancellations between the irrelevant linear part and thetwo-body partition function. Our numerical results are consistent with thesimple analytical form suggested recently by Myrheim and Olaussen.
