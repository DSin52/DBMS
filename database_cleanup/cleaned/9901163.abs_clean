On manifolds with non-trivial Killing tensors admitting a square root of theKilling-Yano type one can construct non-standard Dirac operators which differfrom, but commute with, the standard Dirac operator. We relate the indexproblem for the non-standard Dirac operator to that of the standard Diracoperator. This necessitates a study of manifolds with torsion and boundary andwe summarize recent results obtained for such manifolds.
