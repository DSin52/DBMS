We study the excitations of a massive Schwarzschild black hole of mass Mresulting from the capture of infalling matter described by a massless scalarfield. The near-horizon dynamics of this system is governed by a Hamiltonianwhich is related to the Virasoro algebra and admits a one-parameter family ofself-adjoint extensions described by a parameter z \in R . The density ofstates of the black hole can be expressed equivalently in terms of z or M,leading to a consistent relation between these two parameters. Thecorresponding black hole entropy is obtained as S = S(0) - 3/2 log S(0) + C,where S(0) is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, C is a constant with othersubleading corrections exponentially suppressed. The appearance of this preciseform of the black hole entropy within our formalism, which is expected ongeneral grounds in any conformal field theoretic description, provides strongevidence for the near-horizon conformal structure in this system.
