We discuss the phase structure of QCD_4 as a perturbative deformation of theTopological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT). When we choose a special MaximalAbelian gauge (MAG) as the gauge fixing, the TQFT sector is equivalent to a 2DO(3) non-linear sigma model (NLSM). We consider the finite temperature case,and investigate the effect of the boundary conditions and the phase structureof the TQFT sector. It can have a deconfining phase under the twisted boundaryconditions. However, this phase is screened once pertubative parts are added.We conclude that the information about the phase structure is encoded in theU(1) background in the case of the MAG.
