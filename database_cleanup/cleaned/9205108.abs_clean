Comments: 11 pages

We review some exact solitonic solutions of string theory withhigher-membrane structure. These include an axionic instanton solution ofbosonic string theory as well as multi-instanton and multimonopole solutions ofheterotic string theory. The heterotic solutions reveal some interestingaspects of string theory as a theory of quantum gravity.
