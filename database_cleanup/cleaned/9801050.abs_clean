The theory of the strong interactions, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), has beenaddressed by a variety of non-perturbative techniques over the decades sinceits introduction. We have investigated Hamiltonian formulations with differentquantization methods and approximation schemes. In one method, we utilizelight-front coordinates to investigate the role of bosonic zero modes inleading to confinement. In another method we are able to obtain spectra for themesons and baryons using constituent quark masses but no phenomenologicalconfinement. We survey our principal accomplishments to date and indicate ourfuture directions.
