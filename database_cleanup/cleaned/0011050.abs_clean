Using the path integral method, we calculate the partition function andgenerating functional (of the field strengths) on the nonlocal generalized 2DYang - Mills theories ($nlgYM_2$'s), which is nonlocal in auxiliary field [14].Our calculations is done for general surfaces. We find a general expression forfree energy of $W(\phi) = \phi^{2k}$ in $nlgYM_2$ theories at the strongcoupling phase (SCP) regime ($A > A_c$) for large groups. In the specific$\phi^4$ model, we show that the theory has a third order phase transition.
