Authors: Ron Folman and Erasmo Recami

Journal-ref: Found.Phys.Lett. 8 (1995) 127-134

We present a brief overview of the different kinds of electromagneticradiations expected to come from (or to be induced by) space-like sources(tachyons). New domains of radiation are here considered; and the possibilityof experimental observation of tachyons via electromagnetic radiation isdiscussed.
