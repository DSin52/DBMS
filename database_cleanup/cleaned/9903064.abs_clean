An effective supergravity description of all instabilities of N_4=4superstrings is derived. The construction is based on the N_4=4 BPS massformula at finite temperature and uses the properties of N_4=4 gaugedsupergravity. It provides the boundaries of the various thermal phases in thenon-perturbative moduli space. It also draws a precise picture of the dynamicsin the high-temperature heterotic phase. This brief contribution summarizesresults obtained in collaboration with I. Antoniadis and C. Kounnas.
