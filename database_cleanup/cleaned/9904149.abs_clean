The AdS/CFT correspondence predicts a phase transition in Wilson loopcorrelators in the strong coupling N=4, D=4 SYM theory which arises due toinstability of the classical string stretched between the loops. We study thistransition in detail by solving equations of motion for the string in theparticular case of two circular Wilson loops. The transition is argued to besmoothened at finite `t Hooft coupling by fluctuations of the string worldsheet and to be promoted to a sharp crossover. Some general comments aboutWilson loop correlators in gauge theories are made.
