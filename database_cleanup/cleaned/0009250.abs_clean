We define the scaling supersymmetric Yang-Lee model with boundary as the(1,3) perturbation of the superconformal minimal model SM(2/8) (orequivalently, the (1,5) perturbation of the conformal minimal model M(3/8))with a certain conformal boundary condition. We propose the correspondingboundary S matrix, which is not diagonal for general values of the boundaryparameter. We argue that the model has an integral of motion corresponding toan unbroken supersymmetry, and that the proposed S matrix commutes with asimilar quantity. We also show by means of a boundary TBA analysis that theproposed boundary S matrix is consistent with massless flow away from theultraviolet conformal boundary condition.
