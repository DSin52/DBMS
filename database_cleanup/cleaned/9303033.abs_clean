{}~~~We show that the recently constructed $~N=4$~ supersymmetric self-dualYang-Mills theory as the consistent background of \hbox{$~N=2$} opensuperstring will generate Witten's topological field theory in two-dimensionsas a descendant theory after appropriate twisted dimensionalreduction/truncations. We also show that this topological field theory furthergenerates supersymmetric Korteweg de Vries equations, $~SL(n)\-$Toda theory and$~W_\infty\-$gravity in the $~n\rightarrow\infty$~ limit. Considering also thatthis topological field theory is to generate other integrable and topologicalsystems, our results give supporting evidence for the conjecture that the$~N=2$~ open superstring theory is the underlying ``master theory'' ofintegrable and topological systems, {\it via} the intermediate $~N=4$~supersymmetric self-dual Yang-Mills theory as its consistent target space-timebackground.
