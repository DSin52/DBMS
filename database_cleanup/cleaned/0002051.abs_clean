We calculate the screening and anti-screening contributions to theinter-quark potential in 2+1 dimensions, which is relevant to the hightemperature limit of QCD. We demonstrate that the relative strength ofscreening to anti-screening agrees with the 3+1 dimensional theory to betterthan one percent accuracy.
