$S$-matrices associated to the vector representations of the quantum groupsfor the classical Lie algebras are constructed. For the $a_{m-1}$ and $c_m$algebras the complete $S$-matrix is found by an application of the bootstrapequations. It is shown that the simplest form for the $S$-matrix whichgeneralizes that of the Gross-Neveu model is not consistent for thenon-simply-laced algebras due to the existence of unexplained singularities onthe physical strip. However, a form which generalizes the $S$-matrix of theprincipal chiral model is shown to be consistent via an argument which uses anovel application of the Coleman-Thun mechanism. The analysis also gives acorrect description of the analytic structure of the $S$-matrix of theprinciple chiral model for $c_m$.
