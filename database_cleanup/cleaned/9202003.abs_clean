Global-symmetry violating higher-dimension operators, expected to be inducedby Planck-scale physics, in general drastically alter the properties of theaxion field associated with the Peccei-Quinn solution to the strong-CP problem,and render this solution unnatural. The particle physics and cosmologyassociated with other global symmetries can also be significantly changed.
