Sometime ago it was shown that the operatorial approach to classicalmechanics, pioneered in the 30's by Koopman and von Neumann, can have afunctional version. In this talk we will extend this functional approach to thecase of classical field theories and in particular to the Yang-Mills ones. Weshall show that the issues of gauge-fixing and Faddeev-Popov determinant arisealso in this classical formalism.
