We show that a (3+1)-dimensional system composed of an open magnetic vortexand an electrical point charge exhibits the phenomenon of Fermi-Bosetransmutation. In order to provide the physical realization of this system wefocus on the lattice compact scalar electrodynamics $SQED_c$ whose topologicalexcitations are open Nielsen-Olesen strings with magnetic monopoles attached attheir ends.
