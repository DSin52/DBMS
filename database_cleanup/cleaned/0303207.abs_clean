We solve for the expectation values of chiral operators in supersymmetricU(N) gauge theories with matter in the adjoint, fundamental andanti-fundamental representations. A simple geometric picture emerges involvinga description by a meromorphic one-form on a Riemann surface. The equations ofmotion are equivalent to a condition on the integrality of periods of thisform. The solution indicates that all semiclassical phases with the same numberof U(1) factors are continuously connected.
