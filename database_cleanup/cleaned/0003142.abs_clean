I point out that standard two dimensional, asymptotically free, non-linearsigma models, supplemented with terms giving a mass to the would-be Goldstonebosons, share many properties with four dimensional supersymmetric gaugetheories, and are tractable even in the non-supersymmetric cases. The space ofmass parameters gets quantum corrections analogous to what was found on themoduli space of the supersymmetric gauge theories. I focus on a simple purelybound states, Argyres-Douglas-like CFTs and duality in the infrared, andrearrangement of the spectrum of stable states from weak to strong coupling. Atthe singularities on the space of parameters, the model can be described by acontinuous theory of randomly branched polymers, which is defined beyondperturbation theory by taking an appropriate double scaling limit.
