Picture changed operators are discussed in $N=2$ strings with space-timesignature $(2,2)$. A gauge symmetry algebra is derived in a background of torusspace-time $T^{2,2}$ and its simple representation on the picture changedoperators is given. Simple Ward identities associated with the gauge algebraand their consequences for three and four point amplitudes of arbitrary loopsare also discussed.
