The relation between Geisteswissenschaft and Naturwissenschaft has beendiscussed by Munster in hep-th/9305104. The plan of this paper is to begin withthe empty set; use it to form sets and quivers (sets of points plus sets ofarrows between pairs of points); and then use them to make complex vectorspaces and to get the A-D-E Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams. The Dn Spin(2n) Liealgebras have spinor representations to describe fermions. D4 Spin(8) trialitygives automorphisms among its vector and two half-spinor representations. D5Spin(10) contains both Spin(8) and the complexification of the vectorrepresentation of Spin(8). E6 contains both Spin(10) and the two half-spinorrepresentations of Spin(10), and therefore contains the adjoint representationof Spin(8) and the complexifications of the vector and the two half-spinorrepresentations of Spin(8). E6 is the basis for construction of a fundamentalmodel of physics that is consistent with experiment (see hep-th/9302030,hep-ph/9301210).
