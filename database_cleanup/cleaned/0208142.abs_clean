Using the techniques of two dimensional conformal field theory we constructtime dependent classical solutions in open string theory describing the decayof an unstable D-brane in the presence of background electric field, andexplicitly evaluate the time dependence of the energy momentum tensor and thefundamental string charge density associated with this solution. The finaldecay product can be interpreted as a combination of stretched fundamentalstrings and tachyon matter.
