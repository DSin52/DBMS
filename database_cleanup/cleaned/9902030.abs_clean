Integrable systems underlying the Seiberg-Witten solutions for the N=2 SQCDwith gauge groups SO(n) and Sp(n) are proposed. They are described by theinhomogeneous XXX spin chain with specific boundary conditions given byreflection matrices. We attribute reflection matrices to orientifold planes inthe brane construction and briefly discuss its possible deformations.
