Title: Recursive Graphical Solution of Closed Schwinger-Dyson Equations in

Feynman DiagramsAuthors: Axel Pelster and Konstantin Glaum

Comments: Author Information under http

Using functional derivatives with respect to the free correlation function wederive a closed set of Schwinger-Dyson equations in phi^4-theory. Itsconversion to graphical recursion relations allows us to systematicallygenerate all connected and one-particle irreducible Feynman diagrams for thetwo- and four-point function together with their weights.
