We show that there are solutions of the SU(2) Yang-Mills classical equationsof motion in R^4, which are self-dual and vortex-like(fluxons). The actiondensity is concentrated along a thick two-dimensional wall (the world sheet ofa straight infinite vortex line). The configurations are constructed fromself-dual R^2 x T^2 configurations.
