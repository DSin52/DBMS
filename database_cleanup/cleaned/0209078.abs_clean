We consider Dirac monopoles embedded into SU(N) gauge theory with theta-termfor $\theta = 4\pi M $ (where $M$ is half-integer for $N = 2$ and is integerfor $N>2$). Due to the theta - term those monopoles obtain the SU(N) charge andbecome the dyons. They belong to different irreducible representations of SU(N)(but not to all of them). The admitted representations are enumerated. Theirminimal rank increases with increasing of $N$. The main result of the paper isthe representation of the partition function of SU(N) model with theta-term(that contains singular gauge fields correspondent to the mentioned monopoles)as the vacuum average of the product of Wilson loops (considered along themonopole worldlines). This vacuum average should be calculated within thecorrespondent model without theta-term.
