We study the integrable and supersymmetric massive $\hat\phi_{(1,3)}$deformation of the tricritical Ising model in the presence of a boundary. Weuse constraints from supersymmetry in order to compute the exact boundary$S$-matrices, which turn out to depend explicitly on the topological charge ofthe supersymmetry algebra. We also solve the general boundary Yang-Baxterequation and show that in appropriate limits the general reflection matrices goover the supersymmetry preserving solutions. Finally, we briefly discuss thepossible connection between our reflection matrices and boundary perturbationswithin the framework of perturbed boundary conformal field theory.
