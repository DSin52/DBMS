Comments: 14 pages, latex, no figures. Talk given at the conference "Quantum

Field Theory Under the Influence of External Conditions", Leipzig, 14-18September 1998. Submitted to the conference ProceedingsThe Casimir energy for the transverse oscillations of a piecewise uniformclosed string is calculated. The string is relativistic in the sense that thevelocity of transverse waves is always equal to c. The great adaptibility ofthis string model with respect to various regularization methods is pointedcontour integration method, and the zeta-function method. The most powerfulmethod in the present case is the contour integration method. The Casimirenergy turns out to be negative, and the more so the larger is the number ofpieces in the string. The thermodynamic free energy F is calculated for atwo-piece string in the limit when the tension ratio x = T_I/T_II approacheszero. For large values of the length ratio s = L_II/L_I, the Hagedorntemperature becomes proportional to the square root of s.
