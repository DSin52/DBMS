Title: On Wilson Loops and Confinement without Supersymmetry from Composite

Antisymmeric Tensor Field theoriesComments: 8 pages, plain Tex

A novel approach that does not rely on supersymmetry, nor in the AdS/CFTcorrespondence, to evaluate the Wilson loops asociated with a gauge theory ofarea-preserving diffeomorphisms in terms of pure string degrees of freedoms ispresented. It is based on the Guendelman-Nissimov-Pacheva formulation ofcomposite antisymmetric tensor field theories of volume-preservingdiffeomorphisms. Such theories admit p-brane solutions. The quantum effects arediscussed and we evaluate exactly the vev of the Wilson loops, in the large Nlimit of quenched-reduced SU(N) QCD, in terms of a path integral involving purestring degrees of freedom. It is consistent with the recent results based onthe AdS/CFT correspondence and dual QCD models (dual Higgs model with dualDirac strings). More general Loop wave equations in C-spaces (Cliffordmanifolds) are proposed in terms of holographic variables that contain thedynamics of an aggregate of closed branes (p-loops) of variousdimensionalities.
