Title: Deformed Oscillator Algebras and Higher-Spin Gauge Interactions of

Matter Fields in 2+1 DimensionsComments: LaTex, 12 pages, no figures; Invited talk at the International

Seminar Supersymmetry and Quantum Field Theory dedicated to the memory ofDmitrij V. Volkov; Kharkov, January 1997; to appear in the proceedingsWe formulate a non-linear system of equations which describe higher-spingauge interactions of massive matter fields in 2+1 dimensional space-time andexplain some properties of the deformed oscillator algebra which underlies thisformulation. In particular we show that the parameter of mass $M$ of matterfields is related to the deformation parameter in this algebra.
