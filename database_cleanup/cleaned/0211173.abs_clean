I review the proposal of Berenstein-Douglas for a completely generaldefinition of Seiberg duality. To give evidence for their conjecture I presentthe first example of a physical dual pair and explicitly check that itsatisfies the requirements. Then I explicitly show that a pair of toric dualquivers is also dual according to their proposal. All these computations gobeyond tilting modules, and really work in the derived category. I introduceall necessary mathematics where needed.
