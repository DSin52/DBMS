We find a large family of solutions to the Dirac equation on a manifold of$G_2$ holonomy asymptotic to a cone over $S^3 \times S^3$, including all radialsolutions. The behaviour of these solutions is studied as the manifolddevelopes a conical singularity. None of the solutions found are both localisedand square integrable at the origin. This result is consistent with the absenceof chiral fermions in M-theory on the conifold over $S^3\times S^3$. Theapproach here is complementary to previous analyses using dualities and anomalycancellation.
