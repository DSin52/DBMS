The space of local operators in massive deformations of conformal fieldtheories is analysed. For several model systems it is shown that one can definechiral sectors in the theory, such that the chiral field content is in aone-to-one correspondence with that of the underlying conformal field theory.The full space of operators consists of the descendent spaces of all scalarfields. If the theory contains asymptotic states which satisfy generalisedstatistics, the form factor equations admit in addition also solutionscorresponding to the descendent spaces of the para-fermionic operators of thesame spin as the asymptotic states. The derivation of these results uses$q$-sum expressions for the characters and $q$-difference equations used inproving Rogers-Ramanujan type identities.
