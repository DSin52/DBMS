We show how BPS states of supersymmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills with matter -bothmassless and massive- are described as self-dual strings on a Riemannsurface. This connection enables us to prove the stability and the strongcoupling behaviour of these states. The Riemann surface naturally arises fromtype-IIB Calabi-Yau compactifications whose three-branes wrapped aroundvanishing two-cycles correspond to one-cycles on this surface.
