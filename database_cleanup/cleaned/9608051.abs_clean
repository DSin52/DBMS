Title: Adiabatic Geometrical Phase for Scalar Fields in a Curved Spacetime

Comments: Expanded Version

A convenient framework is developed to generalize Berry's investigation ofthe adiabatic geometrical phase for a classical relativistic charged scalarfield in a curved background spacetime which is minimally coupled toelectromagnetism and an arbitrary (non-electromagnetic) scalar potential. Itinvolves a two-component formulation of the corresponding Klein-Gordonequation. A precise definition of the adiabatic approximation is offered andconditions of its validity are discussed. It is shown that the adiabaticgeometric phase can be computed without making a particular choice for an innerproduct on the space of solutions of the field equations. What is needed isjust an inner product on the Hilbert space of the square integrable functionsdefined on the spatial hypersurfaces. The two-component formalism is applied inthe investigation of the adiabatic geometric phases for several specificexamples, namely, a rotating magnetic field in Minkowski space, a rotatingcosmic string, and an arbitrary spatially homogeneous cosmological background.It is shown that the two-component formalism reproduces the known results forthe first two examples. It also leads to several interesting results for thecase of spatially homogeneous cosmological models. In particular, it is shownthat the adiabatic geometric phase angles vanish for Bianchi type I models. Thesituation is completely different for Bianchi type IX models where a variety ofnontrivial non-Abelian adiabatic geometrical phases can occur. The analogybetween the adiabatic geometric phases induced by the Bianchi type IXbackgrounds and those associated with the well-known time-dependent nuclearquadrupole Hamiltonians is also pointed out.
