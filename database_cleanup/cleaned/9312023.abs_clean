Title: On free differentials on associative algebras

Comments: 10 pages

A free differential for an arbitrary associative algebra is defined as adifferential with a uniqueness property. The existence problem for such adifferential is posed. The notion of optimal calculi for given commutationrules is introduced and an explicit construction of it for a homogenous case isprovided. Some examples are presented.
