Title: c = 1 conformal field theory and the fractional quantum Hall effect

Authors: Christopher Ting and C. H. Lai

Comments: (10 pages)

We examine the application of $c=1$ conformal field theory to the descriptionof the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). It is found that the Gaussianmodel together with an appropriate boundary condition for the order parameterfurnishes an effective theory for the Laughlin type FQHE. The plateau formationcondition corresponds to taking the {\em chiral} portion of the theory.
