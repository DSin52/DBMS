We consider the type IIA string compactified on the Calabi-Yau space given bya degree 12 hypersurface in the weighted projective space ${\bf P}^4_{(1, 1,2,2, 6)}$. We express the prepotential of the low-energy effective supergravitytheory in terms of a set of functions that transform covariantly under $PSL(2,\IZ)$ modular transformations. These functions are then determined by monodromyproperties, by singularities at the massless monopole point of the modulispace, and by $S \leftrightarrow T$ exchange symmetry.
