We propose and investigate the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations for theminimal $W_p^N$ models~(associated with the $A_{N-1}$ Lie algebra) perturbed bythe least~($Z_N$ invariant) primary field $\Phi_N$. Our results reproduce theexpected ultraviolet and infrared regimes. In particular for the positive signof the perturbation our equations describe the behaviour of the ground stateflowing from the $W_p^N$ model to the next $W_{p-1}^N$ fixed point.
