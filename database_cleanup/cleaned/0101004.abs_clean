Workshop QFTHEP'2000 Tver, Russia, 14-20 September 2000In $D$-dimensional dilaton gravitational model stationary Schwarzschild typesolutions (centrally symmetrical solutions in vacuum) are obtained. Theyto a central mass and the second one describes intensity of the dilaton field.If the latter parameter equals zero we have pure Schwarzschild solution withthe black hole and constant dilaton field. But when the mentioned parameter isnon-zero and the dilaton is non-constant, the black hole horizon vanishes.
