It is shown that the heterotic string emerges as a soliton in the type Isuperstring theory in ten dimensions. The collective coordinates of the solitonare described by a smooth, chiral worldsheet theory. There are eight bosonicand eight right-moving fermionic zero modes that arise from the partiallybroken supertranslations. In addition, there are 496 charged bosonic zero modesof the gauge field that describe a left-moving WZNW model on a $spin(32)/{Z_2}$group manifold. Small, stable loops of the solitonic string furnish the massivestates required by duality that transform as spinors of $spin(32)$.
