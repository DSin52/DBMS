note addedWe calculate the thermal partition function in the canonical ensemble fortype IIB superstrings in the plane wave background with constant null R-R5-form. The Hagedorn temperature is found to be higher than the correspondingvalue for strings in flat space. In the limit corresponding to the weaklycoupled field theory we find that the Hagedorn temperature is pushed toinfinity. The key property of strings in the plane wave background underinvestigation on which our result relies is that the effective mass of thebosonic and fermionic coordinates in the light-cone gauge is proportional tothe momentum $p^+$. The free energy is finite as the Hagedorn temperature isapproached from below, suggesting a possible phase transition.
