the Proceedings of the Workshop on the Exact Renormalization Group held inFaro, Portugal, in September 10-12 1998, World ScientificWe investigate a $Z_2$-symmetric scalar field theory in two dimensions usingthe Polchinski exact renormalization group equation expanded to second order inthe derivative expansion. We find preliminary evidence that the Polchinskiequation is able to describe the non-perturbative infinite set of fixed pointsin the theory space, corresponding to the minimal unitary series of 2Dconformal field theories. We compute the anomalous scaling dimension $\eta$ andthe correlation length critical exponent $\nu$ showing that an accurate fit toconformal field theory selects particular regulating functions.
