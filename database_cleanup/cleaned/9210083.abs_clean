The Adler-Kostant-Symes theorem yields isospectral hamiltonian flows on thedual $\tilde\grg^{+*}$ of a Lie subalgebra $\tilde\grg^+$ of a loop algebra$\tilde\grg$. A general approach relating the method of integration ofKrichever, Novikov and Dubrovin to such flows is used to obtain finite-gapsolutions of matrix Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations in terms of quotients of$\tet$-functions.
