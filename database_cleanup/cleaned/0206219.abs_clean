We study static spherically symmetric solutions of high derivative gravitytheories, with 4, 6, 8 and even 10 derivatives. Except for isolated points inthe space of theories with more than 4 derivatives, only solutions that arenonsingular near the origin are found. But these solutions cannot smooth outthe Schwarzschild singularity without the appearance of a second horizon. Thisconundrum, and the possibility of singularities at finite r, leads us to studynumerical solutions of theories truncated at four derivatives. Rather than twohorizons we are led to the suggestion that the original horizon is replaced bya rapid nonsingular transition from weak to strong gravity. We also considerthis possibility for the de Sitter horizon.
