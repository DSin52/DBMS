We examine the stabilization of the two typical moduli, the length $\rho$ ofthe eleventh segment and the volume $V$ of the internal six manifold, incompactified heterotic $M$-theory. It is shown that, under certain conditions,the phenomenologically favored vacuum expectation values of $\rho$ and $V$ canbe obtained by the combined effects of multi-gaugino condensations on thehidden wall and the membrane instantons wrapping the three cycle of theinternal six manifold.
