We consider the Penrose limit of the solution of D5-brane given in theAnti-de Sitter space and analyse the shape of the D5-brane in the pp-wavebackground. We find that the D5-brane leads to the branes and the throatsconnecting the branes. The branes spread on R^4 with periodic values of thelight-cone time x^+ and the throats lie along x^+. We also give some commentson holography.
