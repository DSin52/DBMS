We study quantum caustics in $d$-dimensional systems with quadraticLagrangians. Based on Schulman's procedure in the path-integral we derive thetransition amplitude on caustics in a closed form for generic multiplicity $f$,and thereby complete the previous analysis carried out for the maximalmultiplicity case $f=d$. Multiplicity dependence of the caustics phenomena isillusrated by examples of a particle interacting with external electromagneticfields.
