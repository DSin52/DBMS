We generalize the braid algebra to the case of loops with intersections. Weintroduce the Reidemeister moves for 4 and 6-valent vertices to have a theoryof rigid vertex equivalence. By considering representations of the extendedbraid algebra, we derive skein relations for link polynomials, which allow usto generalize any link Polynomial to the intersecting case. We perturbativelyshow that the HOMFLY Polynomials for intersecting links correspond to thevacuum expectation value of the Wilson line operator of the Chern Simon'sTheory. We make contact with quantum gravity by showing that these polynomialsare simply related with some solutions of the complete set of constraints withcosmological constant
