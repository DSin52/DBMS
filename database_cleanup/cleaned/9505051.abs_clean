We present evidence for new, non-trivial RG fixed points with dual magneticdescriptions in $N=1$ supersymmetric $SP(N_c)$ and $SO(N_c)$ gauge theories.The $SP(N_c)$ case involves matter $X$ in the antisymmetric tensorrepresentation and $N_f$ flavors of quarks $Q$ in the fundamentalrepresentation. The $SO(N_c)$ case involves matter $X$ in the symmetric tensorrepresentation and $N_f$ flavors of quarks $Q$ in the vector representation of$SO(N_c)$. Perturbing these theories by superpotentials $W(X)$, we find avariety of interesting RG fixed points with dual descriptions. The duality inthese theories is similar to that found by Kutasov and by Kutasov and Schwimmerin $SU(N_c)$ with adjoint $X$ and $N_f$ quarks in the fundamental.
