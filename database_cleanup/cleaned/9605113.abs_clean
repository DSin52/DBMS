We study the non-perturbative behavior of some N=1 supersymmetricproduct-group gauge theories with the help of duality. As a test case weinvestigate an SU(2)xSU(2) theory in detail. Various dual theories areconstructed using known simple-group duality for one group or both groups insuccession. Several stringent tests show that the low-energy behavior of thedual theories agrees with that of the electric theory. When the theory is inthe confining phase we calculate the exact superpotential. Our results stronglysuggest that, in general, dual theories for product groups can be constructedin this manner, by using simple-group duality for both groups. Turning to aclass of theories with SU(N)xSU(M) gauge symmetry we study the renormalizationgroup flows in the space of the two gauge couplings and show that they areconsistent with the absence of phase transitions. Finally, we show that asubset of these theories, with SU(N)xSU(N-1) symmetry break supersymmetrydynamically.
