We discuss on the possible existence of a supersymmetric invariance in purelyfermionic planar systems and its relation to the fermion-boson mapping inthree-dimensional quantum field theory. We consider, as a very simple example,the bosonization of free massive fermions and show that, under certainconditions on the masses, this model displays a supersymmetric-like invariancein the low energy regime. We construct the purely fermionic expression for thesupercurrent and the non-linear supersymmetry transformation laws. We arguethat the supersymmetry is absent in the limit of massless fermions where thebosonized theory is non-local.
