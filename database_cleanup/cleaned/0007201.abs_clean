and errors amendedWe evaluate the quantum correlators associated with the Maxwell field vacuumdistorted by the presence of plane parallel material surfaces. Regularizationis performed through the generalized zeta funtion technique. Results areapplied to a local analysis of the atractive and repulsive Casimir effectthrough Maxwell stress tensor. Surface divergences are shown to cancel out whenstresses on both sides of the material surface are taken into account. Since anatom can be considered as a probe of the local distortion of the quantumvacuum, Casimir-Polder interactions between atoms and material surfaces arealso considered.
