In this paper the entropy of an eternal Schwarzschild black hole is studiedin the limit of infinite black hole mass. The problem is addressed from thepoint of view of both canonical quantum gravity and superstring theory. Theentropy per unit area of a free scalar field propagating in a fixed black holebackground is shown to be quadratically divergent near the horizon. It is shownthat such quantum corrections to the entropy per unit area are equivalent tothe quantum corrections to the gravitational coupling. Unlike field theory,superstring theory provides a set of identifiable configurations which giverise to the classical contribution to the entropy per unit area. Theseconfigurations can be understood as open superstrings with both ends attachedto the horizon. The entropy per unit area is shown to be finite to all ordersin superstring perturbation theory. The importance of these conclusions to theresolution of the problem of black hole information loss is reiterated.
