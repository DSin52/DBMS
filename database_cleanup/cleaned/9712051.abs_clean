Title: Microscopic universality in random matrix models of QCD

Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX2e + plenum.sty. To appear in the Proceedings of the

NATO Workshop "New Developments in Quantum Field Theory", Zakopane, June 1997NetworksJournal-ref: "New Developments in Quantum Field Theory" (Plenum Press, New

York, 1998), 287-295I shall present a proof of universality of the microscopic spectralcorrelations in Verbaarschot's random matrix models of QCD, to corroborate thebeautiful agreement between the predictions from the gaussian model and thenumerical data. Rather than following closely the original proof, I shalldisguise it with the conventional approach of Q, P operators and with themethod employed in an alternative proof by Kanzieper-Freilikher, in a hope thatborrowing notions from quantum mechanics may add the proof some pedagogicalflavor. I shall also discuss a problem associated with the multi-criticality.
