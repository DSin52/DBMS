We explicitly extract the structure of higher-derivative curvature-squaredterms at genus 0 and 1 in the d=4 heterotic string effective actioncompactified on symmetric orbifolds by computing on-shell S-matrix superstringamplitudes. In particular, this is done within the context of calculating thegraviton 4-point amplitude. We also discuss the moduli-dependent gravitationalthreshold corrections to the coupling associated with the CP even quadraticcurvature terms.
