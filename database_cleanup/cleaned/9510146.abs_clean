Symmetry restoration processes during the non-equilibrium stage of``preheating'' after inflation is studied. It is shown that symmetryrestoration is very efficient when the majority of created particles areconcentrated at energies much smaller than the temperature $T$ in equilibrium.The strength of symmetry restoration measured in terms of the equivalenttemperature can exceed $T$ by many orders of magnitude. In some models theeffect can be equivalent to that if the temperature of instant reheating wouldbe close to the Planck scale. This can have an important impact on GUT andaxion models.
