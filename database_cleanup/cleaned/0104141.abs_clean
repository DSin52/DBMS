We argue that the thermodynamics of conformal field theories with AdS dualsexhibits a remarkable universality. At strong coupling, a Cardy-Verlindeentropy formula holds even when R-charges or bulk supergravity scalars areturned on. In such a setting, the Casimir entropy can be identified with ageneralized C-function that changes monotonically with temperature as well aswhen non-trivial bulk scalar fields are introduced. We generalize theCardy-Verlinde formula to cases where no subextensive part of the energy ispresent and further observe that such a formula is valid for the N=4 superYang-Mills theory in D=4 even at weak coupling. Finally we show that ageneralized Cardy-Verlinde formula holds for asymptotically flat black holes inany dimension.
