An electron moving on plane in a uniform magnetic field orthogonal to planeis known as the Landau problem. Wigner functions for the Landau problem whenthe plane is noncommutative are found employing solutions of the Schroedingerequation as well as solving the ordinary *-genvalue equation in terms of aneffective Hamiltonian. Then, we let momenta and coordinates of the phase spacebe noncommutative and introduce a generalized *-genvalue equation. We solvethis equation to find the related Wigner functions and show that under anappropriate choice of noncommutativity relations they are independent ofnoncommutativity parameter.
