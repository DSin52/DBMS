We develop a formalism to calculate the effective action of the stronglycoupled conformal field theory (CFT) in curved spacetime. The effective actionof the CFT is obtained from AdS/CFT correspondence. The anti de-Sitter (AdS)spacetime has various slicing which give various curved spacetime on itsboundary. We show the de Sitter spacetime and the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker(FRW) universe can be embedded in the AdS spacetime and derive the scalartwo-point function of the conformal fields in those spacetime. In curvedspacetime, the two-point function depends on the vacuum state of the CFT. Amethod to specify the vacuum state in AdS/CFT calculations is shown. Becausethe classical action in AdS spacetime diverges near the boundary, we need thecounter terms to regulate the result. The simple derivation of the counterterms using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is also presented in the appendix.
