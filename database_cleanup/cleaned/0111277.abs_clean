We consider a class of 5-D brane-world solutions with a power-law warp factor$a(y)\propto y^{q}$, and bulk dilaton with profile $\phi \propto \ln y$, where$y$ is the proper distance in the extra dimension. This class includes theHeterotic M-theory brane-world of Refs. \cite{ovrut,ekpy} and theRandall-Sundrum (RS) model as a limiting case. In general, there are two modulifields $y_{\pm}$, corresponding to the "positions" of two branes (which live atthe fixed points of an orbifold compactification). Classically, the moduli aremassless, due to a scaling symmetry of the action. However, in the absence ofsupersymmetry, they develop an effective potential at one loop. Local termsproportional to $K_\pm^4$, where $K_\pm=q/y_\pm$ is the local curvature scaleat the location of the corresponding brane, are needed in order to remove thedivergences in the effective potential. Such terms break the scaling symmetryand hence they may act as stabilizers for the moduli. When the branes are veryclose to each other, the effective potential induced by massless bulk fieldsbehaves like $V\sim d^{-4}$, where $d$ is the separation between branes. Whenthe branes are widely separated, the potentials for each one of the moduligenerically develop a "Coleman-Weinberg"-type behaviour of the form$a^4(y_\pm)K_\pm^4 \ln(K_\pm/\mu_\pm)$, where $\mu_\pm$ are renormalizationscales. In the RS case, the bulk geometry is $AdS$ and $K_\pm$ are equal to aconstant, independent of the position of the branes, so these terms do notcontribute to the mass of the moduli. However, for generic warp factor, theyprovide a simple stabilization mechanism. For $q\gtrsim 10$, the observedhierarchy can be naturally generated by this potential, giving the lightestmodulus a mass of order $m_- \lesssim TeV$.
