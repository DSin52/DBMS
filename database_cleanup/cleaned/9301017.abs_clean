We present the solution of the discrete super-Virasoro constraints to allorders of the genus expansion. Integrating over the fermionic variables we geta representation of the partition function in terms of the one-matrix model. Wealso obtain the nonperturbative solution of the super-Virasoro constraints inthe double scaling limit but do not find agreement between our flows and theknown supersymmetric extensions of KdV.
