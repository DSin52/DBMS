We give an analytical description of the locus of the two-gap ellipticpotentials associated with the corresponding flow of the Calogero--Mosersystem. We start with the description of Treibich--Verdier two--gap ellipticpotentials. The explicit formulae for the covers, wave functions and Lam\'epolynomials are derived, together with a new Lax representation for theparticle dynamics on the locus. Then we consider more general potentials withinthe Weierstrass reduction theory of theta functions to lower genera. Thereduction conditions in the moduli space of the genus two algebraic curves aregiven. This is some subvariety of the Humbert surface, which can be singled outby the condition of the vanishing of some theta constants.
