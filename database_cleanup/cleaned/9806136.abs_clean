We compute the effective action for scattering of three well-separatedextremal brane solutions, in 11d supergravity, with zero p_ transfer and smalltransverse velocities. Using an interpretation of the conjecture of Maldacena,following Hyun, this can be viewed as the large N limit of the Matrix theorydescription of three supergraviton scattering at leading order. The result isconsistent with the perturbative supergravity calculation.
