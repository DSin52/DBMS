We discuss the unitarity relation of the Aharonov-Bohm scattering amplitudewith the hope that it distinguishes between the differing treatments whichemploy different incident waves. We find that the original Aharonov-Bohmscattering amplitude satisfies the unitarity relation under the regularizationprescription whose theoretical foundation does not appear to be understood. Onthe other hand, the amplitude obtained by Ruijsenaars who uses plane wave asincident wave also satisfies the unitarity relation but in an unusual way.
