We study the Bethe ansatz equations for a generalized $XXZ$ model on aone-dimensional lattice. Assuming the string conjecture we propose an integerversion for vacancy numbers and prove a combinatorial completeness of Bethe'sstates for a generalized $XXZ$ model. We find an exact form for inverse matrixrelated with vacancy numbers and compute its determinant. This inverse matrixhas a tridiagonal form, generalizing the Cartan matrix of type $A$.
