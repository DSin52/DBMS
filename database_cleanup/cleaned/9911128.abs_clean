We develop in a systematic fashion the idea of gauging 1d-space translationswith fixed Newtonian time for nonrelativistic matter (particles and fields). Bystarting with a nonrelativistic free theory we obtain its minimal gaugeinvariant extension by introducing two gauge fields with a Maxwellian selfinteraction. We fix the gauge so that the residual symmetry group is theGalilei group and construct a representation of the extended Galilei algebra.The reduced N-particle Lagrangian describes geodesic motion in a(N-1)-dimensional (Pseudo-) Riemannian space. The singularity of the metric fornegative gauge coupling leads in classical dynamics to the formation ofgeometric bags in the case of two or three particles. The ordering problemwithin the quantization scheme for $N$-particles is solved by canonicalquantization of a pseudoclassical Schroedinger theory obtained by adding to thecontinuum generalization of the point-particle Lagrangian an appropriatequantum correction. We solve the two-particle bound state problem for bothsigns of the gauge coupling. At the end we speculate on the possible physicalrelevance of the new interaction induced by the gauge fields.
