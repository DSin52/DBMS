Chiral perturbation lagrangian in the framework of non-commutative geometryis considered in full detail. It is found that the explicit symmetry breakingterms appear and some relations between the coupling constants of the theorycome out naturally. The WZW term also turns up on the same footing as the otherterms of the chiral lagrangian.
