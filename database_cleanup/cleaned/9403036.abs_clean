Developing upon the ideas of ref. \ref{6}, it is shown how the theory ofclassical $W$ algebras can be formulated on a higher genus Riemann surface inthe spirit of Krichever and Novikov. The basic geometric object is theDrinfeld--Sokolov principal bundle $L$ associated to a simple complex Lie group$G$ equipped with an $SL(2,\Bbb C)$ subgroup $S$, whose properties are studiedin detail. On a multipunctured Riemann surface, theDrinfeld--Sokolov--Krichever--Novikov spaces are defined, as a generalizationof the customary Krichever--Novikov spaces, their properties are analyzed andstandard bases are written down. Finally, a WZWN chiral phase space based onthe principal bundle $L$ with a KM type Poisson structure is introduced and, bythe usual procedure of imposing first class constraints and gauge fixing, aclassical $W$ algebra is produced. The compatibility of the construction withthe global geometric data is highlighted.
