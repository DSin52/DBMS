A-statistics is defined in the context of the Lie algebra sl(n+1). Somethermal properties of A-statistics are investigated under the assumption thatthe particles interact only via statistical interaction imposed by the Pauliprinciple of A-statistics. Apart from the general case, three particularenergy and chemical potential; (b) equidistant energy spectrum; (c) two speciesof particles with one and the same energy and chemical potential within eachclass. The grand partition functions and the average number of particles areamong the thermodynamical quantities written down explicitly.
