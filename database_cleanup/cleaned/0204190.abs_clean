added. Discussion of AdS brane includedThe most remarkable and interesting feature of brane world scenario is theuse of bulk's curvature to localize gravity on the brane, albeit with finetuning of the brane and bulk parameters. For FRW expanding universe on thebrane, it is a moving hypersurface in Schwarzschild anti de Sitter bulkspacetime. We show that zero mass gravitons have bound state on the brane forsuitable values of brane and bulk parameters. There occur various cases givingrise to different cosmological models, in particular we discuss the case ofinflationary model with positive cosmological constant.
