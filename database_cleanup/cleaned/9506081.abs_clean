Title: Duality Beyond Global Symmetries

Comments: Contribution to Strings 95, 4 pages, harvmac

Duality between the `axion' field $a$ and the antisymmetric tensor field$B_{\mu\nu}$ is traced after a nonperturbative effect, gaugino condensation,breaks the Peccei-Quinn symmetry $a \rightarrow a +c$. Even though the PQsymmetry was at its origin, duality is nevertheless {\it not} broken by thiseffect. Below condensation scale, the axion simply gets a mass, but in the`stringy' version, the $ B_{\mu\nu}$ field disappears from the propagatingspectrum. Its place is taken by a massive 3-index antisymmetric field$H_{\mu\nu\rho}$ which is the one dual to the massive axion. This is aparticular case of a general duality in $D$-dimensions among {\it massive} $p$and $D-p-1$-index antisymmetric tensor fields.
