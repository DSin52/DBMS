the Proceedings of the First Advanced Research Workshop "Gravity,Astrophysics and Strings at the Black Sea", June 10-16, 2002, Bulgaria; alsoan abridged version of the talk at the International Workshop "QuantumGravity and Superstrings",July 11-18, 2002, Dubna, RussiaThe SL(2, R) WZW model of strings on an ADS3 background is investigated inthe spirit of J.Maldacena's and H.Ooguri's approach (hep-th/0001053) and(hep-th/0005183). Choosing a standard, but most general three-variableparametrization of the SL(2, R) group element g, the system of equations forthe Operator Product Expansion (OPE) relations is analysed. In the investigatedSL(2, R) case, this system is consistent if each three points on the complexplane lie on a certain hypersurface in CP3. A system of three nonlinearfirst-order differential equations has been obtained for the parametrizationfunctions. It was demonstrated also how the mathematical apparatus ofgeneralized functions and integral geometry can be implemented in order tomodify the integral operators, entering the Kac-Moody and Virasoro algebras.
