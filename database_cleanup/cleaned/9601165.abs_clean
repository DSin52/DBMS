$\lambda\varphi^4$ theory at finite temperature suffers from infrareddivergences near the temperature at which the symmetry is restored. Thesedivergences are handled using renormalization group methods. Flow equationswhich use a fiducial mass as flow parameter are well adapted to predicting thenon-trivial critical exponents whose presence is reflected in thesedivergences. Using a fiducial temperature as flow parameter, we predict thecritical temperature, at which the mass vanishes, in terms of thezero-temperature mass and coupling. We find some universal amplitude ratioswhich connect the broken and symmetric phases of the theory which agree wellwith those of the three-dimensional Ising model obtained from high- andlow-temperature series expansions.
