We describe string-theory and $d=11$ supergravity solutions involvingsymmetric spaces of constant negative curvature. Many examples ofnon-supersymmetric string compactifications on hyperbolic spaces $H_r$ offinite volume are given in terms of suitable cosets of the form $H_r/\Gamma $,where $\Gamma $ is a discrete group. We describe in some detail the cases ofthe non-compact hyperbolic spaces $F_2$ and $F_3$, representing the fundamentalregions of $H_2$ and $H_3$ under $SL(2,Z)$ and the Picard group, respectively.By writing $AdS$ as a U(1) fibration, we obtain new solutions where$AdS_{2p+1}$ gets untwisted by T-duality to ${\bf R}\times SU(p,1)/(SU(p)\timesU(1))$. Solutions with time-dependent dilaton field are also constructed bystarting with a solution with NS5-brane flux over $H_3$. A new class ofnon-supersymmetric conformal field theories can be defined via holography.
