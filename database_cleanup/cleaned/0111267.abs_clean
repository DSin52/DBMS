We consider electrons in uniform external magnetic and electric fields whichmove on a plane whose coordinates are noncommuting. Spectrum and eigenfunctionsof the related Hamiltonian are obtained. We derive the electric current whoseexpectation value gives the Hall effect in terms of an effective magneticfield. We present a receipt to find the action which can be utilized in pathintegrals for noncommuting coordinates. In terms of this action we calculatethe related Aharonov--Bohm phase and show that it also yields the sameeffective magnetic field. When magnetic field is strong enough this phasebecomes independent of magnetic field. Measurement of it may give some hints onspatial noncommutativity. The noncommutativity parameter \theta can be tunedsuch that electrons moving in noncommutative coordinates are interpreted aseither leading to the fractional quantum Hall effect or composite fermions inthe usual coordinates.
