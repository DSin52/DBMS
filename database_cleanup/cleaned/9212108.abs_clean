We study a generating function for the sum over fatgraphs with specifiedvalences of vertices and faces, inversely weighted by the order of theirsymmetry group. A compact expression is found for general (i.e. non necessarilyconnected) fatgraphs. This expression admits a matrix integral representationwhich enables to perform semi--classical computations, leading in particular toa closed formula corresponding to (genus zero, connected) trees.
