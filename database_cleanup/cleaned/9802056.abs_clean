The effects bringing about by the finiteness of the photon mass due to theDebye screening in the monopole gas in three-dimensional compact QED arestudied. In this respect, a representation of the partition function of thistheory as an integral over monopole densities is derived. Dual formulation ofthe Wilson loop yields a new theory of confining strings, which in thelow-energy limit almost coincides with the one corresponding to the case whenthe photon is considered to be massless, whereas in the high-energy limit thesetwo theories are quite different from each other. The confining string massoperator in the low-energy limit is also found, and its dependence on thevolume of observation is studied.
