Reported are two applications of the functional relations ($T$-system) amonga commuting family of row-to-row transfer matrices proposed in the previouspaper Part I. For a general simple Lie algebra $X_r$, we determine thecorrelation lengths of the associated massive vertex models in theanti-ferroelectric regime and central charges of the RSOS models in twocritical regimes. The results reproduce known values or even generalize them,demonstrating the efficiency of the $T$-system.
