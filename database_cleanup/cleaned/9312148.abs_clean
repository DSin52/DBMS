Title: Casimir operators of the exceptional group $F_4$

F_4\subset D_{13}$Journal-ref: J.Phys. A27 (1994) 3847-3856

Expressions are given for the Casimir operators of the exceptional group$F_4$ in a concise form similar to that used for the classical groups. Thechain $B_4\subset F_4\subset D_{13}$ is used to label the generators of $F_4$in terms of the adjoint and spinor representations of $B_4$ and to express the26-dimensional representation of $F_4$ in terms of the defining representationof $D_{13}$. Casimir operators of any degree are obtained and it is shown thata basis consists of the operators of degree 2, 6, 8 and 12.
