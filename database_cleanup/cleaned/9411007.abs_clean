Title: Light-Front QCD and the Constituent Quark Model

Authors: Kenneth G. Wilson and David G. Robertson

Comments: 14 pages, LaTeX, no figures

A general strategy is described for deriving a constituent approximation toQCD, inspired by the constituent quark model and based on light-frontquantization. Some technical aspects of the approach are discussed, including amechanism for obtaining a confining potential and ways in which spontaneouschiral symmetry breaking can be manifested. (Based on a talk presented by K.G.Wilson at ``Theory of Hadrons and Light-Front QCD,'' Polana Zgorzelisko,Poland, August 1994.)
