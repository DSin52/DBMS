Title: Integrability and Fusion Algebra for Quantum Mappings

Authors: F.W. Nijhoff and H.W. Capel

Comments: 26 pages

We apply the fusion procedure to a quantum Yang-Baxter algebra associatedwith time-discrete integrable systems, notably integrable quantum mappings. Wepresent a general construction of higher-order quantum invariants for thesesystems. As an important class of examples, we present the Yang-Baxterstructure of the Gel'fand-Dikii mapping hierarchy, that we have introduced inprevious papers, together with the corresponding explicit commuting family ofquantum invariants.
