We have studied a modified Yang-Mills-Higgs system coupled to Einsteingravity. The modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action involves a directcoupling of the Higgs field to the scalar curvature. In this modified system weare able to write a Bogomol'nyi type condition in curved space and demonstratethat the positive static energy functional is bounded from below. We theninvestigate non-Abelian sperically symmetric static solutions in a similarfashion to the `t Hooft-Polyakov monopole. After reviewing previously studiedmonopole solutions of this type, we extend the formalism to included electriccharge and we present dyon solutions.
