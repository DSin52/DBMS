Title: Seiberg-Witten Solution from Matrix Theory

Comments: 19 pages, LaTeX, no figures

As another evidence for the matrix Discrete Light Cone formulation of Mtheory, we show how general integrable Hamiltonian systems emerge from BPSbound states of k longitudinal fivebranes. Such configurations preserve eightsupercharges and by chain of dualities can be related to the solution of N=2four-dimensional gauge theories. Underlying Hitchin systems on the barespectral curve with k singular points arise from the Matrix theorycompactification on the dual curve.
