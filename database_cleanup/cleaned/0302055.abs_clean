Authors: L. Martina, O.K. Pashaev

Comments: 7 pages

The Moyal *-deformed noncommutative version of Burgers' equation isconsidered. Using the *-analog of the Cole-Hopf transformation, thelinearization of the model in terms of the linear heat equation is found.Noncommutative q-deformations of shock soliton solutions and their interactionare described
