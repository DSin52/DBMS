The physical states on the free field Fock space of the ${SL(2,R)\overSL(2,R)$ model at any level are computed. Using a similarity transformation on$Q_{BRST}$, the cohomology of the latter is mapped into a direct sum of simplercohomologies. We show a one to one correspondence between the states of the$k=-1$ model and those of the $c=1$ string model. A full equivalence betweenthe ${SL(2,R)\over SL(2,R)$ and ${SL(2,R)\over U(1)$ models at the level oftheir Fock space cohomologies is found.
