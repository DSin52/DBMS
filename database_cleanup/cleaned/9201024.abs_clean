We construct a centerless W-infinity type of algebra in terms of a generatorof a centerless Virasoro algebra and an abelian spin-1 current. This algebraconventionally emerges in the study of pseudo-differential operators on acircle or alternatively within KP hierarchy with Watanabe's bracket.Construction used here is based on a special deformation of the algebra$w_{\infty}$ of area preserving diffeomorphisms of a 2-manifold. We show thatthis deformation technique applies to the two-loop WZNW and conformal affineToda models, establishing henceforth $W_{\infty}$ invariance of these models.
