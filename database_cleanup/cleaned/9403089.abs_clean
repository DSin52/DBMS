Motivated by understanding the phase structure of $d >1$ strings weinvestigate the $c=1$ matrix model with $g' (\tr M(t)^{2})^{2}$ interactionwhich is the simplest approximation of the model expected to describe thecritical phenomena of the large-$N$ reduced model of odd-dimensional matrixphase, (ii) a branched polymer phase and (iii) an intermediate phase. Furtherwe can also analyse the one with slightly generalized $ g^{(2)} (\frac{1}{N}\trM(t)^{2})^{2} +g^{(3)} (\frac{1}{N}\tr M(t)^{2})^{3} + \cdots + g^{(n)}(\frac{1}{N}\tr M(t)^{2})^{n} $ interaction. As a result the multi-criticalversions of the phase (ii) are found.
