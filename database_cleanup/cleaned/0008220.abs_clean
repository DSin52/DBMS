Title: Multi-Instanton Calculus in Supersymmetric Theories

Authors: F.Fucito

Comments: 3 pages, uses ws-p10x7.cls, talk delivered at ICHEP 2000 in Osaka

In this talk I review some recent results concerning multi-instanton calculusin supersymmetric field theories. More in detail, I will show how thesecomputations can be efficiently performed using the formalism of topologicalfield theories.
