We study solutions corresponding to moving domain walls in theRandall-Sundrum universe. The bulk geometry is given by patching together blackhole solutions in AdS$_5$, and the motion of the wall is determined from thejunction equations. Observers on the wall interpret the motion as cosmologicalexpansion or contraction. We describe the possible wall trajectories, andexamine the consequences for localized gravity on the wall.
