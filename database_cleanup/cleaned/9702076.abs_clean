We calculate classical cross sections for absorption of massless scalars bythe extremal 3-branes of type IIB theory, and by the extremal 2- and 5-branesof M-theory. The results are compared with corresponding calculations in theworld volume effective theories. For all three cases we find agreement in thescaling with the energy and the number of coincident branes. For 3-branes,whose stringy description is known in detail in terms of multiple D-branes, thestring theoretic absorption cross section for low energy dilatons is in exactagreement with the classical gravity. This suggests that scattering fromextremal 3-branes is a unitary process well described by perturbative stringtheory.
