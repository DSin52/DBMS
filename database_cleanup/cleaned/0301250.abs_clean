We study string interactions among string states with arbitrary impurities inthe Type IIB plane wave background using string field theory. We reproduce allstring amplitudes from gauge theory by computing matrix elements of thedilatation operator in a previously proposed basis of states. A directcorrespondence is found between the string field theory and gauge theoryFeynman diagrams.
