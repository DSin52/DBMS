version of the contribution to the proceedingsWe discuss how in the presence of a nontrivial RR two-form field strength andnontrivial dilaton the conditions of preserving supersymmetry onsix-dimensional manifolds lead to generalized monopole and Killing spinorequations. We show that the manifold is K\"ahler in the ten-dimensional stringframe if F_0^{(1,1)}=0. We then determine explicitly the intrinsic torsion ofthe SU(3)-structure on six-manifolds that result via Kaluza-Klein reductionfrom seven-manifolds with G_2-structure of generic intrinsic torsion. Lastly wegive explicitly the intrinsic torsion of the SU(3)-structure for an N=1supersymmetric background in the presence of nontrivial RR two-form fieldstrength and nontrivial dilaton.
