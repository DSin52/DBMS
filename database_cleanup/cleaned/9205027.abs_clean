In supersymmetric theories the mass of any state is bounded below by thevalues of some of its charges. The corresponding bounds in case ofSchwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes are known to coincide withthe requirement that naked singularities be absent. Here we investigate chargeddilaton black holes in this context. We show that the extreme solutionssaturate the supersymmetry bound of $N=4\ d=4$ supergravity, or dimensionallyreduced superstring theory. Specifically, we have shown that extreme dilatonblack holes, with electric and magnetic charges, admit super-covariantlyconstant spinors. The supersymmetric positivity bound for dilaton black holes,$M \geq \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}(|Q|+|P|)$, takes care of the absence of nakedsingularities of the dilaton black holes and is, in this sense, equivalent tothe cosmic censorship condition. The temperature, entropy and singularity arediscussed. The Euclidean action (entropy) of the extreme black hole is given by$2\pi |PQ|$. We argue that this result, as well as the one for Lorentziansignature, is not altered by higher order corrections in the supersymmetrictheory. When a black hole reaches its extreme limit, it cannot continue toevaporate by emitting elementary particles, since this would violate thesupersymmetric positivity bound. We speculate on the possibility that anextreme black hole may ``evaporate" by emitting smaller extreme black holes.
