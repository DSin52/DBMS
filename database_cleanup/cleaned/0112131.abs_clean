It is well known that a weakly coupled U(N) gauge theory on a torus withsides of length L has extra light states with energies of order 1/NL. We showthat a similar result holds for gauge theories on M/G where M is any compactRiemannian manifold and G is any freely acting discrete isometry group. As inthe toroidal case, this is achieved by adding a suitable nontrivial flatconnection. As one application, we consider the AdS/CFT correspondence onspacetimes asymptotic to AdS_5/G. By considering finite size effects at nonzerotemperature, we show that consistency requires these extra light states of thegauge theory on S^3/G.
