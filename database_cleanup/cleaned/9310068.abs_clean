statements reworded, three references added, format expanded (reversible)We give a constructive account of the fundamental ingredients of Poisson Lietheory as the basis for a description of the classical double group $D$. Thedouble of a group $G$ has a pointwise decomposition $D\sim G\times G^*$, where$G$ and $G^*$ are Lie subgroups generated by dual Lie algebras which form a Liebialgebra. The double is an example of a factorisable Poisson Lie group, in thesense of Reshetikhin and Semenov-Tian-Shansky [1], and usually the study of itsPoisson structures is developed only in the case when the subgroup $G$ isitself factorisable. We give an explicit description of the Poisson Liestructure of the double without invoking this assumption. This is achieved by adirect calculation, in infinitesimal form, of the dressing actions of thesubgroups on each other, and provides a new and general derivation of thePoisson Lie structure on the group $G^*$. For the example of the double ofSU(2), the symplectic leaves of the Poisson Lie structures on SU(2) andSU(2$)^*$ are displayed.
