The stability of the shell of wrapped D6-branes on K3 is investigated fromthe point of view of supergravity. We first construct an effectiveenergy-momentum tensor for the shell under the reasonable conditions and showthat supersymmetric solutions satisfy Israel's junction conditions at arbitraryradius of the shell. Next we study the perturbation of the whole systemincluding the self-gravity of the shell. It is found that in spite of theexistence of wrapped D6-branes with negative tension, there is no eigenmodewhose frequencies of the shell and the fields are imaginary numbers, at anyradius of the shell. Furthermore, when the radius of the shell is less than theenhan\c{c}on radius, resonances are produced, and this indicates a kind of``instability'' of the system. This can even classically explain why the shellis constructed at the enhan\c{c}on radius.
