Theform of the crossover is obtained from the action of a symmetry group, aparticular subgroup of the modular group, on the upper-half complexconductivity plane, by assuming that the beta-function describing the crossoveris a holomorphic function of the conductivity. The group action also leads to aselection rule, |p_1q_2-p_2q_1|=1, for allowed transitions between Hallplateaux with filling factors p_1/q_1 and p_2/q_2, where q_1 and q_2 are odd.
