UCONN-93-8The two-dimensional self-dual Chern-Simons equations are equivalent to theconditions for static, zero-energy vortex-like solutions of the (2+1)dimensional gauged nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with Chern-Simonsmatter-gauge coupling. The finite charge vacuum states in the Chern-Simonstheory are shown to be gauge equivalent to the finite action solutions to thetwo-dimensional chiral model (or harmonic map) equations. The Uhlenbeck-Woodclassification of such harmonic maps into the unitary groups thereby leads to acomplete classification of the vacuum states of the Chern-Simons model. Thisconstruction also leads to an interesting new relationship between $SU(N)$ Todatheories and the $SU(N)$ chiral model.
