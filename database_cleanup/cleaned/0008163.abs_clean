In a previous paper (G.Yoneda, Proc.R.Soc.London, A445,(1994),221), we provedthe no-interaction theorem for four particles with the assumption that the(linear and angular) momentum on space-like planes is invariant. In this paper,we assume that the momentum on null cones is invariant and prove that there isno interaction for four particles.
