Comments: 34 pages, 3 figures

The complete exact solution of the Schwinger model with compact gauge groupU(1), in the Hamiltonian approach, is presented . The compactification isimposed by demanding that the only surviving true electromagnetic degree offreedom has angular character. Not surprinsingly, this topological conditiondefines a version of the Schwinger model which is different from the standardspectra of the zero modes is not degenerated and does not correspond to theequally spaced harmonic oscillator, both the electric charge and a modifiedgauge invariant chiral charge are conserved (nevertheless, the axial-currentanomaly is still present) and, finally, there is no need to introduce a$\theta$-vacuum. A comparison with the results of the standard Schwinger modelis pointed out along the text.
