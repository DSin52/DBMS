Static, spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein--Kalb--Ramond (KR)field equations are obtained. Besides an earlier known exact solution, we alsofind an approximate, asymptotically flat solution for which the metriccoefficients are obtained as an infinte series in $\frac{1}{r}$. Subsequently,we study gravitational lensing and perihelion precession in these spacetimesand obtain explicit formulae which include corrections to these effects in thepresence of the KR field.
