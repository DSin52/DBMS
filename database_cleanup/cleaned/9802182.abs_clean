We introduce a $N_c\times N_c$ matrix model with $\cN=2$ supersymmetries andshow its relation to the topological rigid string and the topological YM$_2$.This allows to connect the latter two theories directly. Moreover theconstruction leads to a new insight in the \ninfty limit. Finally a quantummechanical matrix theory is proposed which may describe light-cone(light-front) dynamics of gauge fields.
