Recent work has uncovered a correspondence between theories in anti-de Sitterspace, and those on its boundary. This has important implications for blackholes in string theory which have near-horizon AdS geometries. Using theeffective coupling to the boundary conformal field theory, I compute thelow-energy, s-wave absorption cross-sections for a minimally coupled scalar inthe near-extremal four- and five-dimensional black holes. The results agreeprecisely with semi-classical gravity calculations. Agreement for fixedscalars, and for the BTZ black hole, is also found.
