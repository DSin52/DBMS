By using BPS closed string, the entropy is calculated of the extremal fivedimensional black hole consisting of Dirichlet onebranes, Dirichlet fivebranesand Kaluza-Klein momentum in the flat background approximation. In ourformulations we consider two kinds of BPS closed strings with or without awinding number. In the former case heavy excitation modes of closed strings areused to derive the entropy. In the latter case we have no oscillator modes andconsider collective motion of such massless closed strings. The entropy isgiven by the number of the ways how we divide the Kaluza-Klein momentum amongthe massless closed strings. In both cases the black hole entropy is the sameas the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We argue that the collective modes of closedstrings without winding is equivalent to a single closed string with winding.We propose that the two closed string pictures are connected with the openstring pictures by the modular transformation.
