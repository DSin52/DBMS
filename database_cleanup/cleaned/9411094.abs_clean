Title: On the Local Equilibrium Condition

Comments: 5 pages, latex

A physical system is in local equilibrium if it cannot be distinguished froma global equilibrium by ``infinitesimally localized measurements''. This shouldbe a natural characterization of local equilibrium, but the problem is to givea precise meaning to the qualitative phrase ``infinitesimally localizedmeasurements''. A solution is suggested in form of a Local EquilibriumCondition, which can be applied to linear relativistic quantum field theoriesbut not directly to selfinteracting quantum fields. The concept of localtemperature resulting from LEC is compared to an old approach to localtemperature based on the principle of maximal entropy. It is shown that theprinciple of maximal entropy does not always lead to physical states if it isapplied to relativistic quantum field theories.
