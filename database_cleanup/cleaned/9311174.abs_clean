In the numerical simulation of certain field theoretical models, the complexLangevin simulation has been believed to fail due to the violation ofergodicity. We give a detailed analysis of this problem based on a toy modelwith one degree of freedom ($S=-\beta\cos\theta$). We find that the failure isnot due to the defect of complex Langevin simulation itself, but rather to theway how one treats the singularity appearing in the drift force. An effectivealgorithm is proposed by which one can simulate the ${1/\beta}$ behaviour ofthe expectation value $<\cos\theta>$ in the small $\beta$ limit.
