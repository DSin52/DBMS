Title: New Solution of the Open Bosonic String Field Theory

Authors: J.Kluson

Comments: 10 pages

We present example of exact solution to Witten's open bosonic string fieldtheory. We will analyse the new BRST operator and we will argue that the newsolution describes the flow from zero slope limit to the tensionless limit inthe string world-sheet action.
