The one-loop effective action for a massive self-interacting scalar field isinvestigated in $4$-dimensional ultrastatic space-time $ R \times H^3/\Gamma$,$H^3/\Gamma$ being a non-compact hyperbolic manifold with finite volume. Makinguse of the Selberg trace formula, the $\zeta$-function related to the smalldisturbance operator is constructed. For an arbitrary gravitational coupling,it is found that $\zeta(s)$ has a simple pole at $s=0$. The one-loop effectiveaction is analysed by means of proper-time regularisations and the one-loopdivergences are explicitly found. It is pointed out that, in this special case,also $\zeta$-function regularisation requires a divergent counterterm, whichhowever is not necessary in the free massless conformal invariant couplingcase. Finite temperature effects are studied and the high-temperature expansionis presented. A possible application to the problem of the divergences of theentanglement entropy for a free massless scalar field in a Rindler-likespace-time is briefly discussed.
