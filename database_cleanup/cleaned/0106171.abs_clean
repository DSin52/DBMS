We consider worldsheet string theory on $Z_N$ orbifolds of $AdS_3$ associatedwith conical singularities. If the orbifold action includes a similar twist of$S^3$, supersymmetry is preserved, and there is a moduli space of vacua arisingfrom blowup modes of the orbifold singularity. We exhibit the spectrum,including the properties of twisted sectors and states obtained by fractionalspectral flow. A subalgebra of the spacetime superconformal symmetry remainsintact after the $Z_N$ quotient, and serves as the spacetime symmetry algebraof the orbifold.
