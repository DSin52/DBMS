RR fluxes representing different cohomology classes may correspond to thesame twisted K-theory class. We argue that such fluxes are related bymonodromies, generalizing and sometimes T-dual to the familiar monodromies of aD7-brane. A generalized theta angle is also transformed, but changes by amultiple of 2pi. As an application, NS5-brane monodromies modify the twistedK-theory classification of fluxes. Furthermore, in the noncompact case K-theorydoes not distinguish flux configurations in which dG is nontrivial in compactlysupported cohomology. Such fluxes are realized as the decay products ofunstable D-branes that wrapped nontrivial cycles. This is interpreted using theE8 bundle formalism.
