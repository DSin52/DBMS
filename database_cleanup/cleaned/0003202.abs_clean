The renormalized photon and electron propagators are expanded over planarbinary trees. Explicit recurrence solutions are given for the terms of theseexpansions. In the case of massless Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the relationbetween renormalized and bare expansions is given in terms of a Hopf algebrastructure. For massive quenched QED, the relation between renormalized and bareexpansions is given explicitly.
