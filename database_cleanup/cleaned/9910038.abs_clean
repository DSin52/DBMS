GeometryThe zeta and eta-functions associated with massless and massive Diracoperators, in a D-dimensional (D odd or even) manifold without boundary, arerigorously constructed. Several mathematical subtleties involved in thisprocess are stressed, as the intrisic ambiguity present in the definition ofthe associated fermion functional determinant in the massless case and, also,the unavoidable presence (in some situations) of a multiplicative anomaly, thatcan be conveniently expressed in terms of the noncommutative residue. Theambiguity is here seen to disappear in the massive case, giving rise to a phaseof the Dirac determinant - that agrees with very recent calculations appearedin the mathematical literature - and to a multiplicative anomaly - also inagreement with other calculations, in the coinciding situations. Afterexplicit, nontrivial resummation of the mass series expansions involving zetaand eta functions, the results are expressed in terms of quite simple formulas.
