We show that infinite variety of Poincar\'{e} bialgebras with nontrivialclassical r-matrices generate nonsymmetric nonlinear composition laws for thefourmomenta. We also present the problem of lifting the Poincar\'{e} bialgebrasto quantum Poincar\'{e} groups by using e.g. Drinfeld twist, what permits toprovide the nonlinear composition law in any order of dimensionfull deformationparmeter $\lambda$ (from physical reasons we can put $\lambda = \lambda_{p}$where $\lambda_{p}$ is the Planck lenght). The second infinite variety ofcomposition laws for fourmomentum is obtained by nonlinear change of basis inPoincar\'{e} algebra, which can be performed for any choice of coalgebraicsector, with classical or quantum coproduct. In last Section we propose somemodification of Hopf algebra scheme with Casimir-dependent deformationparameter, which can help to resolve the problem of consistent passage tomacroscopic classical limit.
