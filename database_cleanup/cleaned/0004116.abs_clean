Title: Symmetry Origin of Infrared Divergence Cancellation in Topologically

Massive Yang-Mills TheoryComments: 11 pages, RevTex, No figures

We manifestly verify that the miraculous cancellation of the infrareddivergence of the topologically massive Yang-Mills theory in the Landau gaugeis completely determined by a new vector symmetry existing in its largetopological mass limit, the Chern-Simons theory. Furthermore, we show that thecancellation theorem proposed by Pisarski and Rao is an inevitable consequenceof this new vector symmetry.
