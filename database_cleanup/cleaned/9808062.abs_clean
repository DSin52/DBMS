Recently it was observed by one of the authors that supersymmetric quantummechanics (SUSYQM) admits a formulation in terms of only one bosonic degree offreedom. Such a construction, called the minimally bosonized SUSYQM, appearedin the context of integrable systems and dynamical symmetries. We show that theminimally bosonized SUSYQM can be obtained from Witten's SUSYQM by applying toit a nonlocal unitary transformation with a subsequent reduction to one of theeigenspaces of the total reflection operator. The transformation depends on theparity operator, and the deformed Heisenberg algebra with reflection,intimately related to parabosons and parafermions, emerges here in a naturalway. It is shown that the minimally bosonized SUSYQM can also be understood assupersymmetric two-fermion system. With this interpretation, the bosonizationconstruction is generalized to the case of N=1 supersymmetry in 2 dimensions.The same special unitary transformation diagonalises the Hamiltonian operatorof the 2D massive free Dirac theory. The resulting Hamiltonian is not a squareroot like in the Foldy-Wouthuysen case, but is linear in spatial derivative.Subsequent reduction to `up' or `down' field component gives rise to a lineardifferential equation with reflection whose `square' is the massiveKlein-Gordon equation. In the massless limit this becomes the self-dual Weylequation. The linear differential equation with reflection admitsgeneralizations to higher dimensions and can be consistently coupled to gaugefields. The bosonized SUSYQM can also be generated applying the nonlocalunitary transformation to the Dirac field in the background of a nonlinearscalar field in a kink configuration.
