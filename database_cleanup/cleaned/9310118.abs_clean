We show that the `instantonic' soliton of five-dimensional Yang-Mills theoryand the closely related BPS monopole of four-dimensional Yang-Mills/Higgstheory continue to be exact static, and stable, solutions of these fieldtheories even after the inclusion of gravitational, electromagnetic and, in thefour-dimensional case, dilatonic interactions, provided that certainnon-minimal interactions are included. With the inclusion of theseinteractions, which would be required by supersymmetry, these exactself-gravitating solitons saturate a gravitational version of the Bogomol'nyibound on the energy of an arbitrary field configuration.
