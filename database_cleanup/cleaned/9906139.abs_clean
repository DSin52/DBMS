We find the solution of the $\hat{sl}(3)_k$ singular vector decouplingequations on 3-point functions for the particular case when one of the fieldsis of weight $w_0\cdot k\Lambda_0$. The result is a function with non-trivialsingularities in the flag variables, namely a linear combination of 2F1hypergeometric functions. This calculation fills in a gap in [1] and confirmsthe $\hat{sl}(3)_k$ fusion rules determined there both for generic $\kappa \not\in \IQ$ and fractional levels.We have also analysed the fusion in $\hat{sl}(3)_k$ using algebraic methodsgeneralising those of Feigin and Fuchs and again find agreement with [1]. Inthe process we clarify some details of previous treatments of the fusion of$\hat{sl}(2)_k$ fractional level admissible representations.
