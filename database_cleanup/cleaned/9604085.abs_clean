We show that excitations of physical interest of the heavenly equation aregenerated by symmetry operators which yields two reduced equations withdifferent characteristics. One equation is of the Liouville type and gives riseto gravitational instantons, including those found by Eguchi-Hanson andGibbons-Hawking. The second equation appears for the first time in the theoryof heavenly spaces and provides meron-like configurations endowed with afractional topological charge. A link is also established between the heavenlyequation and the socalled Schr{\"o}der equation, which plays a crucial role inthe bootstrap model and in the renormalization theory.
