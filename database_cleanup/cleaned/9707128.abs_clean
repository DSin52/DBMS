The perturbation of the Dirac sea to first order in the external potential iscalculated in an expansion around the light cone. It is shown that theperturbation consists of a causal contribution, which describes the singularbehavior of the Dirac sea on the light cone and contains bounded line integralsover the potential and its partial derivatives, and a non-causal contribution,which is a smooth function. As a preparatory step, we construct a formalsolution of the inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation in terms of an infiniteseries of line integrals.More generally, the method presented can be used for an explicit analysis ofFeynman diagrams of the Dirac, Klein-Gordon, and wave equations in positionspace.
