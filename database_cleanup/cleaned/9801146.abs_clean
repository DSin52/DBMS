We study Seiberg duality for N=1 supersymmetric QCD with softsupersymmetry-breaking terms. We generate the soft terms through gaugemediation by coupling two theories related by Seiberg duality to the samesupersymmetry-breaking sector. In this way, we know what asupersymmetry-breaking perturbation in one theory maps into in its ``dual''.Assuming a canonical Kahler potential we calculate the soft terms induced inthe magnetic theory and find that some of the scalars acquire negative massessquared. If duality is still good for small supersymmetry breaking, this mayimply some specific symmetry breaking patterns for supersymmetric QCD withsmall soft supersymmetry-breaking masses, in the case that its dual theory isweakly coupled in the infrared. In the limit of large supersymmetry breaking,the electric theory becomes ordinary QCD. However, the resulting symmetrybreaking in the magnetic theory is incompatible with that expected for QCD.
