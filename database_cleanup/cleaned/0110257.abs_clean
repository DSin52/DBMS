Symmetry", 18-21 July, 2001, Krakow (Poland)We define a class of orthosymplectic superalgebras $osp(m;j|2n;\omega)$ whichmay be obtained from $osp(m|2n)$ by contractions and analytic continuations ina similar way as the orthogonal and the symplectic Cayley-Klein algebras areobtained from the corresponding classical ones. Contractions of $osp(1|2)$ and$osp(3|2)$ are regarded as an examples.
