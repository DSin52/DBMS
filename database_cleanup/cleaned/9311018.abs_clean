A set of Green functions ${\cal G}_{\alpha}(x-y), \alpha \in [0, 2 \pi [$,for free scalar field theory is introduced, varying between the Hadamard Greenfunction $\Delta_1(x-y) \equiv \linebreak[2] \lsta{0} \hspace{-0.1cm} \{\varphi(x), \varphi(y) \} \hspace{-0.1cm} \rsta{0}$ and the causal Greenfunction ${\cal G}_{\pi}(x-y) = i \Delta(x-y) \equiv [\varphi(x), \varphi(y)]$.For every $\alpha \in [0, 2 \pi [$ a path-integral representation for ${\calG}_{\alpha}$ is obtained both in the configuration space and in the phase spaceof the classical relativistic particle. Especially setting $\alpha = \pi$ asum-over-histories representation for the causal Green function is obtained.Furthermore using BRST theory an alternative path-integral representation for${\cal G}_{\alpha}$ is presented. From these path integral representations thecomposition laws for the ${\cal G}_{\alpha}$'s are derived using a modifiedpath decomposition expansion.
