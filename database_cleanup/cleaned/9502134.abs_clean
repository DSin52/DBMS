We find a new solution of the renormalization group for the Potts model withferromagnetic random valued coupling constants. The solution exhibitsuniversality and broken replica symmetry. It is argued that the model reachesthis universality class if the replica symmetry is broken initially. Otherwisethe model stays with the replica symmetric renormalization group flow andreaches the fixed point which has been considered before.
