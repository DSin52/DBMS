Comments: 10 pages, uses latex with sprocl.sty, to appear in the Proceedings of

the Workshop (Talk presented at the Workshop "Frontiers in Quantum FieldTheories" in honor of the 60th birthday of Prof. Keiji Kikkawa, Osaka, Japan,December 1995.)It is generally accepted that the double-scaled 1D matrix model is equivalentto the $c=1$ string theory with tachyon condensation. There remain howeverpuzzles that are to be clarified in order to utilize this connection for ourquest towards possible non-perturbative formulation of string theory. Wediscuss some of the issues that are related to the space-time interpretation ofmatrix models, in particular, the questions of leg poles, causality, and blackhole background. Finally, a speculation about a possible connection of adeformed matrix model with the idea of Dirichret brane is presented.
