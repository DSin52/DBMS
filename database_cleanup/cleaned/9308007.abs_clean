In a previous paper \cite{Simple} it was shown that the BRST charge $Q$ forany gauge model with a Lie algebra symmetry may be decomposed as$Q=\del+\del^{\dag},\;\;\;\del^2=\del^{\dag 2}=0,\;\;\;[\del, \del^{\dag}]_+=0$provided dynamical Lagrange multipliers are used but without introducing othermatter variables in $\del$ than the gauge generators in $Q$. In this paperfurther decompositions are derived but now by means of gauge fixing operators.As in \cite{Simple} it is shown that $\del=c^{\dag a}\phi_a$ where $c^a$ arenew ghosts and $\phi_a$ are nonhermitian variables satisfying the gaugealgebra. However, in distinction to \cite{Simple} also solutions of the form$\del=c^{\dag a}A_a$ where $A_a$ satisfy an abelian algebra is derived(abelianization). By means of a bigrading the BRST condition reduces to$\del|ph\hb=\del^{\dag}|ph\hb=0$ on inner product spaces whose generalsolutions are expressed in terms of the solutions to a proper Diracquantization. Thus, the procedure provides for inner products for the solutionsof a Dirac quantization.
