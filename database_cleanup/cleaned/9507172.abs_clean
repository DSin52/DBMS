We apply the canonical perturbation theory to the semi--quantal hamiltonianof the SU(3) shell model. Then, we use the Einstein--Brillowin--Kellerquantization rule to obtain an analytical semi--quantal formula for the energylevels, which is the usual semi--classical one plus quantum corrections.Finally, a test on the numerical accuracy of the semiclassical approximationand of its quantum corrections is performed.
