The finite temperature one-loop effective potential for a scalar fielddefined on an ultrastatic spacetime, whose spatial part is a compact hyperbolicmanifold, is studied. Different analytic expressions, especially valuable atlow and high temperature are derived. Based on these results, the symmetrybreaking and the topological mass generation are discussed.
