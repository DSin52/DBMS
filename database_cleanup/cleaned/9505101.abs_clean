In this paper the stability and the renormalizability of Yang-Mills theory inthe Background Field Gauge are studied. By means of Ward Identities ofBackground gauge invariance and Slavnov-Taylor Identities the stability of theclassical model is proved and, in a regularization independent way, itsrenormalizability is verified. A prescription on how to build the countertermsis given and the possible anomalies which may appear for Ward Identities andfor Slavnov-Taylor Identities are shown.
