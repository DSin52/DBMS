Title: Holographic Duals of 4D Field Theories

Authors: M. Porrati and A. Starinets (Department of Physics NYU)

Comments: LaTeX, 11 pages

We discuss various aspect of the holographic correspondence between 5-dgravity and 4-d field theory. First of all, we describe deformations of N=4Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theories in terms of 5-d gauged supergravity. Inparticular, we describe N=0 and N=1 deformations of N=4 SYM to confiningtheories. Secondly, we describe recent proposals for the holographic dual ofthe renormalization group and for 4-d central charges associated to it. Weconclude with a ``holographic'' proof of the Goldstone theorem.
