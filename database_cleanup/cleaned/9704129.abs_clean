We explain the observation by Candelas and Font that the Dynkin diagrams ofnonabelian gauge groups occurring in type IIA and F-theory can be read off fromthe polyhedron $\Delta^*$ that provides the toric description of theCalabi-Yau manifold used for compacification. We show how the intersectionpattern of toric divisors corresponding to the degeneration of elliptic fibersfollows the ADE classification of singularities and the Kodaira classificationof degenerations. We treat in detail the cases of elliptic K3 surfaces and K3fibered threefolds where the fiber is again elliptic. We also explain how eventhe occurrence of monodromy and non-simply laced groups in the latter case isvisible in the toric picture. These methods also work in the fourfold case.
