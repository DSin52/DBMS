The representation theory of the maximally extended superalgebra with 32fermionic and 528 bosonic generators is developed in order to investigatenon-perturbative properties of the democratic secret theory behind strings andother p-branes. The presence of Lorentz non-singlet central extensions isemphasized, their role for understanding up to 13 hidden dimensions and theirphysical interpretation as boundaries of p-branes is elucidated. The criteriafor a new larger set of BPS-like non-perturbative states is given and themethods of investigation are illustrated with several explicit examples.
