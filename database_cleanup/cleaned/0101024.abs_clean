A massless spinor field is quantized in the background of a singular staticmagnetic vortex in 2+1-dimensional space-time. The method of self-adjointextensions is employed to define the most general set of physically acceptableboundary conditions at the location of the vortex. Under these conditions, alleffects of polarization of the massless fermionic vacuum in the vortexbackground are determined. Absence of anomaly is demonstrated, and patterns ofboth parity and chiral symmetry breaking are discussed.
