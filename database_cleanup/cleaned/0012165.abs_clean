We find a class of extremal black hole-like global p-brane inhigher-dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant. The regioninside the p-brane horizon possesses all essential features required for theRandall-Sundrum-type brane world scenario. The set-up allows to interpret thehorizon size as the compactification size in that the Planck scale isdetermined by the fundamental scale M* and the horizon size r_H via thefamiliar relation M_Pl^2 ~ M*^{2+n} r_{H}^n, and the gravity behaves asexpected in a world with n-extra dimensions compactified with size r_H. Mostimportantly, a stable mass hierarchy between M_Pl and M* can be generated fromtopological charge of the p-brane and the horizon size r_H therein. We alsooffer a new perspective on various issues associated to the brane worldscenarios including the cosmological constant problem.
