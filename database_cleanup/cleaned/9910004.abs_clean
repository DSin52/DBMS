We study the correlation functions of the Wilson loops in noncommutativeYang-Mills theory based upon its equivalence to twisted reduced models. Wepoint out that there is a crossover at the noncommutativity scale. At largemomentum scale, the Wilson loops in noncommmutative Yang-Mills representextended objects. They coincide with those in ordinary Yang-Mills theory in lowenergy limit. The correlation functions on D-branes in IIB matrix model exhibitthe identical crossover behavior. It is observed to be consistent with thesupergravity description with running string coupling. We also explain that theresults of Seiberg and Witten can be simply understood in our formalism.
