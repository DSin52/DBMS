It has long been claimed that antisymmetric tensor field of the second rankis longitudinal after quantization. Such a situation is quite unacceptable froma viewpoint of the Correspondence Principle. On the basis of the Lagrangianformalism we calculate the Pauli-Lyuban'sky vector of relativistic spin forthis field. Even at the classical level it can be equal to zero afterapplication of the well-known constraints. The correct quantization procedurepermits us to propose solution of this puzzle in the modern field theory.Obtained results develop the previous consideration of Evans [{\it PhysicaA}214 (1995) 605-618].
