We discuss in detail the parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics of arbitraryorder where the parasupersymmetry is between the normal bosons and thosecorresponding to the truncated harmonic oscillator. We show that even thoughthe parasusy algebra is different from that of the usual parasusy quantummechanics, still the consequences of the two are identical. We further showthat the parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics of arbitrary order p can also berewritten in terms of p supercharges (i.e. all of which obey $Q_i^{2} = 0$).However, the Hamiltonian cannot be expressed in a simple form in terms of the psupercharges except in a special case. A model of conformal parasupersymmetryis also discussed and it is shown that in this case, the p supercharges, the pconformal supercharges along with Hamiltonian H, conformal generator K anddilatation generator D form a closed algebra.
