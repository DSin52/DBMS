Supersymmetry breaking via gaugino condensation is studied in vacua ofheterotic M-theory with five-branes. We show that supersymmetry is still brokenby a global mechanism and that the non-perturbative superpotential takes thestandard form. When expressed in terms of low energy fields, a modificationarises due to a threshold correction in the gauge kinetic function that dependson five-brane moduli. We also determine the form of the low energy matter fieldKahler potential. These results are used to discuss the soft supersymmetrybreaking parameters, in particular the question of universality.
