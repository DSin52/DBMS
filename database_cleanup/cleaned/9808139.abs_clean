We study the cancellation of U(1) anomalies in Type I and Type IIB D=4, N=1string vacua. We first consider the case of compact toroidal $Z_N$ Type IIBorientifolds and then proceed to the non-compact case of Type IIB D3 branes atorbifold and orientifold singularities. Unlike the case of the heterotic stringwe find that for each given vacuum one has generically more than one U(1) withnon-vanishing triangle anomalies. There is a generalized Green-Schwarzmechanism by which these anomalies are cancelled. This involves only theRamond-Ramond scalars coming from the twisted closed string spectrum but notthose coming from the untwisted sector. Associated to the anomalous U(1)'sthere are field-dependent Fayet-Illiopoulos terms whose mass scale is fixed byundetermined vev's of the NS-NS partners of the relevant twisted RR fields.Thus, unlike what happens in heterotic vacua, the masses of the anomalousU(1)'s gauge bosons may be arbitrarily light. In the case of D3 branes atsingularities, appropriate factorization of the U(1)'s constrains theChan-Paton matrices beyond the restrictions from cancellation of non-abeliananomalies. These conditions can be translated to constraints on the T-dual TypeIIB brane box configurations. We also construct a new large family of N=1chiral gauge field theories from D3 branes at orientifold singularities, andcheck its non-abelian and U(1) anomalies cancel.
