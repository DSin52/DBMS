Comments: 17 pages, 1 figure

It has been a puzzle that rotating detector may respond even in theappropriate vacuum defined via canonical quantization. We solve this puzzle bytaking back reaction of the detector into account. The influence of the backreaction, even in the detector's mass infinite limit, appears in the responsefunction. It makes the detector possible to respond in the vacuum if thedetector is rotating, though the detector in linear uniform motion neverrespond in the vacuum as expected from Poincare invariance.
