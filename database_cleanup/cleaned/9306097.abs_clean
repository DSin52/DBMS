We analyze quantum two dimensional dilaton gravity model, which is describedby $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model deformed by $(1,1)$ operator.We show that the curvature singularity does not appear when the central charge$c_{\rm matter}$ of the matter fields is given by $22<c_{\rm matter}<24$. When$22<c_{\rm matter}<24$, the matter shock waves, whose energy momentum tensorsare given by $T_{\rm matter} \propto \delta(x^+ - x^+_0)$, create a kind ofwormholes, {\it i.e.,} causally disconnected regions. Most of the quantuminformations in past null infinity are lost in future null infinity but thelost informations would be carried by the wormholes.We also discuss about the problem of defining the mass of quantum blackholes. On the basis of the argument by Regge and Teitelboim, we show that theADM mass measured by the observer who lives in one of asymptotically flatregions is finite and does not vanish in general. On the other hand, the Bondimass is ill-defined in this model. Instead of the Bondi mass, we consider themass measured by observers who live in an asymptotically flat region at first.A class of the observers finds the mass of the black hole created by a shockwave changes as the observers' proper time goes by, i.e. they observe theHawking radiation. The measured mass vanishes after the infinite proper timeand the black hole evaporates completely. Therefore the total Hawking radiationis positive even when $N<24$.
