Renormalization group flow equations for scalar lambda Phi^4 are generatedusing three classes of smooth smearing functions. Numerical results for thecritical exponent nu in three dimensions are calculated by means of a truncatedseries expansion of the blocked potential. We demonstrate how the convergenceof nu as a function of the order of truncation can be improved through a finetuning of the smoothness of the smearing functions.
