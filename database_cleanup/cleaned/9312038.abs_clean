We study classical radiation and quantum bremsstrahlung effect of a movingpoint scalar source. Our classical analysis provides another example ofresolving a well-known apparent paradox, that of whether a constantlyaccelerating source radiates or not. Quantum mechanically, we show that for ascalar source with arbitrary motion, the tree level emission rate of scalarparticles in the inertial frame equals the sum of emission and absorption ratesof zero-energy Rindler particles in the Rindler frame. We then explicitlyverify this result for a source undergoing constant proper acceleration.
