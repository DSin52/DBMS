pagesWe discuss new results in QCD obtained with string-based methods. Thesemethods were originally derived from superstring theory and are significantlymore efficient than conventional Feynman rules. This technology was a keyingredient in the first calculation of the one-loop five-gluon amplitude. Wealso present a conjecture for a particular one-loop helicity amplitude with anarbitrary number of external gluons.
