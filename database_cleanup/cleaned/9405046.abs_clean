Comments: 10 pages

We study the interaction between a $p$-brane and $BF$ system constituted by a$(p+1)$-form and a $n-(p+2)$-form B with a metric independent action on amanifold $M^n$. We identify the allowed $(p+1)$-world manifolds sweeped by the$p$-brane as those restricted by the topological condition of being theboundaries of chains in $M^n$. We find the general solutions of the equation ofmotion for the field configurations. The solutions for the $B$ field areclosely related to the external field configurations that describe the defectsneeded for the computation of soliton correlation functions.The particularcases of the particle and string evolution are discussed with some detail.
