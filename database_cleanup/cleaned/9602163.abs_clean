Title: BRS Symmetry and Cohomology

The BRS symmetry determines physical states, Lagrange densities and candidateanomalies. It renders gauge fixing unobservable in physical states and isrequired if negative norm states are to decouple also in interacting models.The relevant mathematical structures and the elementary cohomologicalinvestigations are presented.
