We use the approach to generate spin foam models by an auxiliary field theorydefined on a group manifold (as recently developed in quantum gravity andquantization of BF-theories) in the context of topological quantum fieldtheories with a 3-form field strength. Topological field theories of this kindin seven dimensions are related to the superconformal field theories which liveon the worldvolumes of fivebranes in M-theory. The approach through anauxiliary field theory for spinfoams gives a topology independent formulationof such theories.
