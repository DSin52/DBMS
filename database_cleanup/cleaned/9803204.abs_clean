We study the role of bosonic zero modes in light-cone quantisation on theinvariant mass spectrum for the simplified setting of two-dimensional SU(2)Yang-Mills theory coupled to massive scalar adjoint matter. Specifically, weuse discretised light-cone quantisation where the momentum modes becomediscrete. Two types of zero momentum mode appear -- constrained and dynamicalzero modes. In fact only the latter type of modes turn out to mix with the Fockvacuum. Omission of the constrained modes leads to the dynamical zero modesbeing controlled by an infinite square-well potential. We find that taking intoaccount the wavefunctions for these modes in the computation of the full boundstate spectrum of the two dimensional theory leads to 21% shifts in the massesof the lowest lying states.
