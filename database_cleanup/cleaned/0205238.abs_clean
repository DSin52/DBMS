We examine some excited state energies in the non-unitary integrable quantumfield theory obtained from the perturbation of the minimal conformal fieldtheory model $M_{3,5}$ by its operator $\phi_{2,1}$. Using the correspondenceof this IQFT to the scaling limit of the dilute $A_2$ lattice model (in aparticular regime) we derive the functional equations for the QFT commutingtransfer matrices. These functional equations can be transformed to a closedset of TBA-like integral equations which determine the excited state energiesin the finite-size system. In particular, we explicitly construct theseequations for the ground state and two lowest excited states. Numerical resultsfor the associated energy gaps are compared with those obtained by thetruncated conformal space approach (TCSA).
