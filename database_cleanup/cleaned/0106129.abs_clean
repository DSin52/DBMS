We study the spectrum of open strings on AdS_2 branes in AdS_3 in an NS-NSbackground, using the SL(2,R) WZW model. When the brane carries no fundamentalstring charge, the open string spectrum is the holomorphic square root of thespectrum of closed strings in AdS_3. It contains short and long strings, and isinvariant under spectral flow. When the brane carries fundamental stringcharge, the open string spectrum again contains short and long strings in allwinding sectors. However, branes with fundamental string charge break half thespectral flow symmetry. This has different implications for short and longstrings. As the fundamental string charge increases, the brane approaches theboundary of AdS_3. In this limit, the induced electric field on the worldvolumereaches its critical value, producing noncommutative open string theory onAdS_2.
