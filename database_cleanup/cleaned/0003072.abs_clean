It is shown that magnetic seven-branes previously considered as differentobjects are members of a one-parametric family of supersymmetric seven branes.We enlarge the class of seven-branes by constructing new magnetically and alsoelectrically charged seven branes. The solutions display a kink-like behavior.We also construct a solution that naturally generalizes the D-instanton.
