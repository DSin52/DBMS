Title: A Causal Approach to Massive Yang-Mills Theories

Comments: 23 pages, Plain TeX

We study quantized Yang-Mills theory with massive vector fields in theframework of causal perturbation theory. The most general form of theinteraction which is invariant under operator gauge transformations is pointedout. The generator of these transformations generally fails to be nilpotent.This defect, however, is easily cured by including scalar fields in the gaugetransformations. Due to gauge invariance these scalar gauge fields couple tothe Yang-Mills fields with predicted strength. We also show that invarianceunder ghost charge conjugation fixes the form of the interaction completely.The coupling of the Yang-Mills fields and the scalar gauge fields to matter isinvestigated. It is proven that gauge invariance implies unitarity of thephysical $S$-matrix. We always work in the Fock space of free quantum fields inwhich all expressions are mathematically well defined.
