The massive Schwinger model may be analysed by a perturbation expansion inthe fermion mass. However, the results of this mass perturbation theory aresensible only for sufficiently small fermion mass. By performing arenormal-ordering, we arrive at a chiral perturbation expansion where theexpansion parameter remains small even for large fermion mass. We use thisrenormal-ordered chiral perturbation theory for a computation of the Schwingermass and compare our results with lattice computations.
