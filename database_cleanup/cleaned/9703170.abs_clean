included and minor typos correctedUsing the differential equation approach to W-algebras, we discuss theinclusion of punctures in W-string theory. The key result is the existence ofdifferent kinds of punctures in W-strings. This is similar to the NS and Rpunctures occuring in superstring theories. We obtain the moduli associatedwith these punctures and present evidence in existing W-string theories forthese punctures. The $W_3$ case is worked out in detail. It is conjectured thatthe $(1,3)$ minimal model coupled to two dimensional gravity corresponds totopological $W_3$-gravity.
