Authors: Bernard de Wit, Bas Kleijn and Stefan Vandoren

Comments: Invited talk given at the International Seminar "Supersymmetries and

Quantum Symmetries", July 1997, Dubna. Latex, 9 ppWe discuss superconformally invariant systems of hypermultiplets coupled togauge fields associated with target-space isometries.
