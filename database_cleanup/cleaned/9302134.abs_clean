We consider a class of $N=2$ supersymmetric non--unitary theories intwo--dimensional Minkowski spacetime which admit classical solitonic solutions.We show how these models can be twisted into a topological sector whoseenergy--momentum tensor is a BRST commutator. There is an infinite number ofdegrees of freedom associated to the zero modes of the solitons. As explicitrealizations of such models we discuss the BRST quantization of a system offree fields, while in the interacting case we study $N=2$ complexified twistedToda theories.
