Based on the world-line formalism with a sewing method, we derive theYang-Mills effective action in a form useful to generate the Bern-Kosower-typemaster formulae for gluon scattering amplitudes at the two-loop level. It isshown that four-gluon ($\Phi^4$ type sewing) contributions can be encapsulatedin the action with three-gluon ($\Phi^3$ type) vertices only, the total actionthus becoming a simple expression. We then derive a general formula for atwo-loop Euler-Heisenberg type action in a pseudo-abelian $su(2)$ background.The ghost loop and fermion loop cases are also studied.
