We find the spectrum P(w)dw of the gravitational wave background produced inthe early universe in string theory. We work in the framework of String DrivenCosmology, whose scale factors are computed with the low-energy effectivestring equations as well as selfconsistent solutions of General Relativity witha gas of strings as source. The scale factor evolution is described by an earlystring driven inflationary stage with an instantaneous transition to aradiation dominated stage and successive matter dominated stage. This is anexpanding string cosmology always running on positive proper cosmic time. Acareful treatment of the scale factor evolution and involved transitions ismade. A full prediction on the power spectrum of gravitational waves withoutany free-parameters is given. We study and show explicitly the effect of thedilaton field, characteristic to this kind of cosmologies. We compute thespectrum for the same evolution description with three differents approachs.Some features of gravitational wave spectra, as peaks and asymptoticbehaviours, are found direct consequences of the dilaton involved and not onlyof the scale factor evolution. A comparative analysis of different treatments,solutions and compatibility with observational bounds or detection perspectivesis made.
