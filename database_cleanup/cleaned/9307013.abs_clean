Using (1,0) superfield methods, we determine the general scalar potentialconsistent with off-shell (p,0) supersymmetry and (1,1) supersymmetry intwo-dimensional non-linear sigma models with torsion. We also present anextended superfield formulation of the (p,0) models and show how the (1,1)models can be obtained from the (1,1)-superspace formulation of the gauged, butmassless, (1,1) sigma model.
