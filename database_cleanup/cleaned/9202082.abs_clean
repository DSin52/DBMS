Title: The Pokrovski-Talapov Phase Transitions and Quantum Groups

Authors: Haye Hinrichsen and Vladimir Rittenberg

Comments: 9 pages

We show that the XY quantum chain in a magnetic field is invariant under atwo parameter deformation of the $SU(1/1)$ superalgebra. One is led to anextension of the braid group and the Hecke algebras which reduce to the knownones when the two parameter coincide. The physical significance of the twoparameters is discussed. When both are equal to one, one gets aPokrovski-Talapov phase transition. We also show that the representation theoryof the quantum superalgebras indicates how to take the appropriatethermodynamical limits.
