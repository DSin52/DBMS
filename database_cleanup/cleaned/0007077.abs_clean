We consider the one-point functions of bulk and boundary fields in thescaling Lee-Yang model for various combinations of bulk and boundaryperturbations. The one-point functions of the bulk fields are analysed usingthe truncated conformal space approach and the form-factor expansion. Goodagreement is found between the results of the two methods, though we find thatthe expression for the general boundary state given by Ghoshal andZamolodchikov has to be corrected slightly. For the boundary fields we usethermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations to find exact expressions for the stripand semi-infinite cylinder geometries. We also find a novel off-criticalidentity between the cylinder partition functions of models with differingboundary conditions, and use this to investigate the regions ofboundary-induced instability exhibited by the model on a finite strip.
