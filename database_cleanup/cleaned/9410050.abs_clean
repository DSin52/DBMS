We investigate the stability of the extremal black p-brane which contains an-form and a dilaton. We show that the instability due to the s-mode, which waspresent in the uncharged and non-extremal p-brane, disappears in the extremecase. This is shown to be consistent with an entropy argument which shows thatthe zero entropy of the extremal black hole is approached more rapidly than thezero entropy of the black p-brane, which would mean an instability wouldviolate the second law of thermodynamics.
