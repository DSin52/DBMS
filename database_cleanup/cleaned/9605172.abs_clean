The problem of computing the thermodynamic properties of a one-dimensionalgas of particles which transform in the adjoint representation of the gaugegroup and interact through non-Abelian electric fields is formulated and solvedin the large $N$ limit. The explicit solution exhibits a first orderconfinement-deconfinement phase transition with computable properties anddescribes two dimensional adjoint QCD in the limit where matter field massesare large.
