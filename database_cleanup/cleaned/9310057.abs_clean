Title: Modular Theory and Symmetry in QFT

Authors: B. Schroer

Comments: 35 pages, LaTeX

The application of the Tomita-Takesaki modular theory to the Haag-Kastler netapproach in QFT yields external (space-time) symmetries as well as internalones (internal ``gauge para-groups") and their dual counterparts (the ``superselection para-group"). An attempt is made to develop a (speculative) pictureon ``quantum symmetry" which links space-time symmetries in an inexorable waywith internal symmetries. In the course of this attempt, we present severaltheorems and in particular derive the Kac-Wakimoto formula which links Jonesinclusion indices with the asymptotics of expectation values in physicaltemperature states. This formula is a special case of a new asymptoticGibbs-state representation of mapping class group matrices (in a Haag-Kastlernet indexed by intervals on the circle!) as well as braid group matrices.
