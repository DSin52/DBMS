A direct relation between the conformal formalism for 2d-quantum gravity andthe W-constrained KP hierarchy is found, without the need to invokeintermediate matrix model technology. The Kontsevich-Miwa transform of the KPhierarchy is used to establish an identification between W constraints on theKP tau function and decoupling equations corresponding to Virasoro nullvectors. The Kontsevich-Miwa transform maps the $W^{(l)}$-constrained KPhierarchy to the $(p^\prime,p)$ minimal model, with the tau function beinggiven by the correlator of a product of (dressed) $(l,1)$ (or $(1,l)$)operators, provided the Miwa parameter $n_i$ and the free parameter (anabstract $bc$ spin) present in the constraints are expressed through the ratio$p^\prime/p$ and the level $l$.
