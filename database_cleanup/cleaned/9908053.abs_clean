We construct a tensionless string model in a four-dimensional space-time${\bf R}^{2,2}$ with the (2,2) signature and solve the string equations. Wefind that the signature change radically changes the structure of the holonomygroup of the null worldsheet. As a result the introduction of the worldsheetDirac operator invariant under the holonomy group becomes possible. We showthat the such possibility is absent in the tensionless string model in the(3+1)-dimensional Minkowski space.
