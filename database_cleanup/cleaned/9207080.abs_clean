In this paper, we formulate a generalization of the classical BRSTconstruction which applies to the case of the reduction of a poisson manifoldby a submanifold. In the case of symplectic reduction, our proceduregeneralizes the usual classical BRST construction which only applies tosymplectic reduction of a symplectic manifold by a coisotropic submanifold,\ie\ the case of reducible ``first class'' constraints. In particular, ourprocedure yields a method to deal with ``second-class'' constraints. Weconstruct the BRST complex and compute its cohomology. BRST cohomology vanishesfor negative dimension and is isomorphic as a poisson algebra to the algebra ofsmooth functions on the reduced poisson manifold in zero dimension. We thenshow that in the general case of reduction of poisson manifolds, BRSTcohomology cannot be identified with the cohomology of vertical differentialforms.
