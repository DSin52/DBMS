We study the possibility of spontaneous CP violation in string models withthe dilaton field stabilized at a phenomenologically acceptable value. Wecondensates, a nonperturbative Kahler potential, and a superpotential based onS-duality, and analyze consequent CP phases in the soft SUSY breaking terms.Due to non-universality forced upon the theory by requiring a non-trivial CKMphase, the EDM problem becomes more severe. Even if there are no complex phasesin the VEVs of the SUSY breaking fields, the electric dipole moments areoverproduced by orders of magnitude. We also address the question of modularinvariance of the physical CP phases.
