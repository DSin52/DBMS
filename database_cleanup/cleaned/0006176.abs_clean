We discuss the interpaly between IR and UV divergences in theories with openand unoriented strings in view of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We start byderiving general formulas for the computation of threshold corrections to gaugecouplings in generic configurations with open and unoriented strings. Theseallow us to discuss the IR/UV correspondence between beta-function coefficientsand ``dilaton'' tadpoles for several brane configurations probed by D3-branes.Finally we comment on the AdS supergravity descriptions of gauge theories thatare (super)conformal in the large N limit.
