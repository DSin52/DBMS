Title: A Generalized ``Surfaceless'' Stokes' Theorem

Authors: N. Bralic

Comments: 8 pages, plain TeX

We derive a generalized Stokes' theorem, valid in any dimension and forarbitrary loops, even if self intersecting or knotted. The generalized theoremdoes not involve an auxiliary surface, but inherits a higher rank gaugesymmetry from the invariance under deformations of the surface used in theconventional formulation.
