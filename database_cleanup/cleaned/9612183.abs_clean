We study domain wall solitons in the relativistic self-dual Chern-SimonsHiggs systems by the dimensional reduction method to two dimensional spacetime.The Bogomolny bound on the energy is given by two conserved quantities in asimilar way that the energy bound for BPS dyons is set in some Yang-Mills-Higgssystems in four dimensions. We find the explicit soliton configurations whichsaturate the energy bound and their nonrelativistic counter parts. We alsodiscuss the underlying N=2 supersymmetry.
