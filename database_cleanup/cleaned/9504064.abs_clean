The first quantum corrections to the entropy for an eternal 4-dimensionalextremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole is investigated at one-loop level, inthe large mass limit of the black hole, making use of the conformal techniquesrelated to the optical metric. A leading cubic horizon divergence is found andother divergences appear due to the singular nature of the optical manifold.The area law is shown to be violated.
