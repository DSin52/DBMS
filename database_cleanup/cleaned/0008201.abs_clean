In a recent paper we have given the macroscopic and microscopic descriptionof the generating solution of toroidally compactified string theory BPS blackholes. In this note we compute its corresponding microscopic entropy. Since bydefinition the generating solution is the most general solution moduloU-duality transformations, this result allows for a description of thefundamental degrees of freedom accounting for the entropy of any regular BPSblack holes of toroidally compactified string (or M) theory.
