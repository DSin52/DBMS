Title: A Single Classical Quark

Comments: LATEX, 7 pages, 3 EPS fig's

The spherically symmetric solution in classical SU(3) Yang - Mills theory isfound. It is supposed that such solution describes a classical quark. It isregular in origin and hence the interaction between two quarks is small on thesmall distance. The obtained solution has the singularity on infinity. It ispossible that is the reason why the free quark cannot exist. Evidently,nonlocality of this object leads to the fact that in quantum chromodynamic thedifficulties arise connected with investigation of quarks interaction on largedistance.
