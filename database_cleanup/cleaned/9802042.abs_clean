We consider field theories with sixteen supersymmetries, which includes U(N)Yang-Mills theories in various dimensions, and argue that their large N limitis related to certain supergravity solutions. We study this by considering asystem of D-branes in string theory and then taking a limit where the braneworldvolume theory decouples from gravity. At the same time we study thecorresponding D-brane supergravity solution and argue that we can trust it incertain regions where the curvature (and the effective string coupling, whereappropriate) are small. The supergravity solutions typically have severalweakly coupled regions and interpolate between different limits ofstring-M-theory.
