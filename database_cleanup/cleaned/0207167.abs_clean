We consider the model of topological fermions allowing for solitons withinteger multiples of elementary electric charges only. In the electromagneticlimit the Lagrangean reduces to the Skyrme term of the Skyrme model with twodegrees of freedom only, two Goldstone bosons, corresponding to twopolarisations of photons. We derive the equations of motion and discuss theirrelations with Maxwell's equations. It is shown that Coulomb and Lorentz forcesare a consequence of topology. Further, we relate the U(1) gauge invariance ofelectrodynamics to the geometry of the soliton field, give a general relationfor the derivation of the soliton field from the field strength tensor inelectrodynamics and use this relation to express homogeneous electric fields interms of the soliton field.
