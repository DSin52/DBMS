Title: On the Classification of Spatially Homogeneous String Backgrounds

Comments: 12 pages, LaTeX, one Table included, no figures.

A classification of all possible spatially homogeneous 4D string backgrounds(HSBs) has been obtained by appropriate ramification of the existing nineBianchi types of homogeneous 3D spaces. A total of $24^2=576$ HSBs which havebeen classified as distinct contains a subclass of 192 which includes allpossible FRW models as well as those in which SO(3) isotropy is attainedasymptotically. A discussion of these results also aims to fascilitate theidentification of HSBs which have already appeared in the literature. The basicphysical perspective of the parameters of classification is outlined togetherwith certain features relating to deeper aspects of string theory.
