As has long been known, it is energetically favorable for massive fermions todeform the homogeneous vacuum around them, giving rise to extended bag-likeobjects. We study this phenomenon non-perturbatively in a model field theory,the $1+1$ dimensional Massive Gross-Neveu model, in the large $N$ limit. Weprove that the bags in this model are necessarily time dependent. We calculatetheir masses variationally and demonstrate their stability. We find anon-analytic behavior in these masses as we approach the standard masslessGross-Neveu model and argue that this behavior is caused by the kink-antikinkthreshold. This work extends our previous work to a non-integrable fieldtheory.
