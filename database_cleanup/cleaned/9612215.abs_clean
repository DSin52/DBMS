Title: Antibranes and crossing symmetry

Authors: Vipul Periwal

Crossing symmetry appears in Dbrane-anti-Dbrane dynamics in the form of ananalytic continuation from U(N) for N brane amplitudes to U(N-p,p) for theinteractions of N-p branes with p anti-branes. I consider the consequences forsupersymmetry and brane-anti-brane forces.
