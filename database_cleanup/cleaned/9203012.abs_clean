We have argued previously that the infinitely many gauge symmetries of stringtheory provide an infinite set of conserved (gauge) quantum numbers ($W$-hair)which characterise black hole states and maintain quantum coherence. Here westudy ways of measuring the $W$-hair of spherically-symmetric four-dimensionalobjects with event horizons, treated as effectively two-dimensional stringblack holes. Measurements can be done either through the s-wave scattering oflight particles off the string black-hole background, or through interferenceexperiments of Aharonov-Bohm type. In the first type of measurement, selectionrules
