In the covariant-gauge two-dimensional quantum gravity, various derivationsof the critical dimension D=26 of the bosonic string are critically reviewed,and their interrelations are clarified. It is shown that the string theory isnot identical with the proper framework of the two-dimensional quantum gravity,but the former should be regarded as a particular aspect of the latter. Theappearance of various anomalies is shown to be explainable in terms of a newtype of anomaly in a unified way.
