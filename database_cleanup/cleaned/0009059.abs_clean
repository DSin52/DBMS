d5 dilatonic gravity action with surface counterterms motivated by AdS/CFTcorrespondence and with contributions of brane quantum CFTs is consideredaround AdS-like bulk. The effective equations of motion are constructed. Theyadmit two (outer and inner) or multi-brane solutions where brane CFTs may bedifferent. The role of quantum brane CFT is in inducing of complicated branedilatonic gravity. For exponential bulk potentials the number of AdS-like bulkspaces is found in analytical form.The correspondent flat or curved (de Sitteror hyperbolic) dilatonic two branes are created, as a rule, thanks to quantumeffects. The observable early Universe may correspond to inflationary brane.The found dilatonic quantum two brane-worlds usually contain the nakedsingularity but in couple explicit examples the curvature is finite and horizon(corresponding to wormhole-like space) appears.
