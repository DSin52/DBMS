Title: Exact path integral of the hydrogen atom and the Jacobi's principle of

least actionComments: 10 pages. Talk presented at Inauguration Conference of Asia Pacific

Center for Theoretical Physics, Seoul, Korea, June 4-10,1996 (To be publishedin the Proceedings(World Scientific, Singapore))The general treatment of a separable Hamiltonian of Liouville-type iswell-known in operator formalism. A path integral counterpart is formulated ifone starts with the Jacobi's principle of least action, and a path integralevaluation of the Green's function for the hydrogen atom by Duru and Kleinertis recognized as a special case. The Jacobi's principle of least action forgiven energy is reparametrization invariant, and the separation of variables inoperator formalism corresponds to a choice of gauge in path integral. TheGreen's function is shown to be gauge independent,if the operator ordering isproperly taken into account. These properties are illustrated by evaluating anexact path integral of the Green's function for the hydrogen atom in paraboliccoordinates.
