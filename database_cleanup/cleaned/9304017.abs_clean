We considered a charged quantum mechanical particle with spin ${1\over 2}$and gyromagnetic ratio $g\ne 2$ in the field af a magnetic string. Whereas theinteraction of the charge with the string is the well kown Aharonov-Bohm effectand the contribution of magnetic moment associated with the spin in the case$g=2$ is known to yield an additional scattering and zero modes (one for eachflux quantum), an anomaly of the magnetic moment (i.e. $g>2$) leads to boundstates. We considered two methods for treating the case $g>2$. \\ The first isthe method of self adjoint extension of the corresponding Hamilton operator. Ityields one bound state as well as additional scattering. In the second weconsider three exactly solvable models for finite flux tubes and take the limitof shrinking its radius to zero. For finite radius, there are $N+1$ boundstates ($N$ is the number of flux quanta in the tube).\\ For $R\to 0$ the boundstate energies tend to infinity so that this limit is not physical unless $g\to2$ along with $R\to 0$. Thereby only for fluxes less than unity the results ofthe method of self adjoint extension are reproduced whereas for larger fluxes$N$ bound states exist and we conclude that this method is not applicable.\\ Wediscuss the physically interesting case of small but finite radius whereby thenatural scale is given by the anomaly of the magnetic moment of the electron$a_e=(g-2)/2\approx 10^{-3}$.
