We present in detail the procedure for calculating the heterotic one-loopeffective action. We focus on gravitational and gauge couplings. We show thatthe two-derivative couplings of the gravitational sector are not renormalizedat one loop when the ground state is supersymmetric. Arguments are presentedthat this non-renormalization theorem persists to all orders in perturbationtheory. We also derive the full one-loop correction to the gauge coupling. Fora class of $N=2$ ground states, namely those that are obtained by toroidalcompactification to four dimensions of generic six-dimensional $N=1$ models, wegive an explicit formula for the gauge-group independent thresholds, and showthat these are equal within the whole family.
