There are fractionally supersymmetric pp-waves in 11 dimensionalsupergravity. We study the corresponding supersymmetric Yang-Mills matrixdynamics for M-theory and find its superalgebra and vacuum equations. We showthat the ground state energy of the Hamiltonian with nontrivial dynamicalsuperysmmetry can be zero, positive or negative depending on parameters.
