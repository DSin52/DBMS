Comments: Review lecture, 24 pictures

Journal-ref: Am.J.Phys. 65 (1997) 1042

This is a colloquium-style review lecture for physicists and non-physicists,a pressure of 220 atm. and a temperature of 374 Celsius there is a second-orderphase transition between water and steam. Understanding it requires the conceptof the renormalization group. Images from computer simulations of the latticegas model (included) are used to explain its basic ideas. It is brieflyreviewed how the renormalization group is used to compute critical coefficientsfor the water-steam phase transition, in good agreement with experiment.Applications in particle physics and string theory are mentioned. The appendixcontains a sample of the author's results on renormalization group flows intheories with dynamical gravity and their relation to perturbative stringwith numerical calculations, and leads to curious phenomena such as oscillatingflows and quantum mechanical flows.
