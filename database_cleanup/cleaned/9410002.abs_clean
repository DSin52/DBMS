Authors: M. Kibler

Comments: 8 pages, Tex, LYCEN 8766

Some results about non-bijective quadratic transformations generalizing theKustaanheimo-Stiefel and the Levi-Civita transformations are reviewed in \S 1.Lie algebras under constraints associated to some Hurwitz transformations; \S 3and \S 4 are concerned with several applications of some Hurwitztransformations to wave equations for various potentials in $R^3$ and $R^5$.
