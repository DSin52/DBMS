We introduce a doubled formalism for the bosonic sector of the maximalsupergravities, in which a Hodge dual potential is introduced for each bosonicfield (except for the metric). The equations of motion can then be formulatedas a twisted self-duality condition on the total field strength \G, which takesits values in a Lie superalgebra. This doubling is invariant underdualisations; it allows a unification of the gauge symmetries of all degrees,including the usual U-dualities that have degree zero. These ``superdualities''encompass the dualities for all choices of polarisation (i.e. the choicesbetween fields and their duals). All gauge symmetries appear as subgroups offinite-dimensional supergroups, with Grassmann coefficients in the differentialalgebra of the spacetime manifold.
