A framework of second-quantization of D5-branes is proposed. It is based onthe study of topology of the moduli space of their low energy effectiveworldvolume theory. Among the topological cycles which resolve singularitiescaused by overlapping D5-branes, it is introduced those cycles which duals,constituting a subspace of cohomology group of the moduli space, turn out todefine the Fock space of the second-quantized D5-branes. The second-quantizedoperators are given by creation and annihilation operators of those cycles ortheir duals.
