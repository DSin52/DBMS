As a step to understand general patterns of integrability in 1+1 quantumfield theories with supergroup symmetry, we study in details the case of$OSP(1/2)$. Our results include the solutions of natural generalizations ofcurrent current perturbation, the $UOSP(1/2)$ principal chiral model, and the$UOSP(1/2)\otimes UOSP(1/2)/UOSP(1/2)$ coset models perturbed by the adjoint.Graded parafermions are also discussed. A pattern peculiar to supergroups isthe emergence of another class of models, whose simplest representative is the$OSP(1/2)/OSP(0/2)$ sigma model, where the (non unitary) orthosymplecticsymmetry is realized non linearly (and can be spontaneously broken). For mostmodels, we provide an integrable lattice realization. We show in particularthat integrable $osp(1/2)$ spin chains with integer spin flow to $UOSP(1/2)$WZW models in the continuum limit, hence providing what is to our knowledge thefirst physical realization of a super WZW model.
