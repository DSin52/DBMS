N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory supplies us with a non-Abelian 4D gauge theorywith a meaningful perturbation expansion, both in the UV and in the IR. Wecalculate the free energy on a 3-sphere and observe a deconfinement transitionfor large N at zero coupling. The same thermodynamic behaviour is found for awide class of toy models, possibly also including the case of non-zerocoupling. Below the transition we also find Hagedorn behaviour, which isidentified with fluctuations signalling the approach to the deconfined phase.The Hagedorn and the deconfinement temperatures are identical. Application ofthe AdS/CFT correspondence gives a connection between string Hagedorn behaviourand black holes.
