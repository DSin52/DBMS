We study classical solutions of vacuum version of Berkovits' superstringfield theory, focusing on the (super)ghost sector. We first argue that thesupersliver state which is annihilated by eta_0, though it has the correctquantum numbers and solves the equation of motion, is actuallynon-perturbatively pure-gauge, and hence it fails to describe a D-brane. As astep toward the construction of non-trivial solutions, we calculatee^{-Phi}Qe^{Phi} for twisted superslivers. As a by-product, we find that thebc-twisted sliver solution in bosonic VSFT can, at least formally, also bewritten as a pure-gauge configuration.
