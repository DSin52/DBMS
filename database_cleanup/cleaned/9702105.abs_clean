In the context of the field theory limit of superstrings, we consider analmost realistic model of supersymmetry breaking by gaugino condensation whichincludes, through nonperturbative corrections to the K\"ahler potential,dilaton stabilization at a value compatible with a weak coupling regime.Invariance under modular transformations is ensured through a Green-Schwarzterm and string threshold corrections, which lead to moduli stabilization atthe self-dual point. We are thus in a position to discuss several issues ofsupersymmetry breaking parameters and gauge coupling unification.
