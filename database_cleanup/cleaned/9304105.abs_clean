Title: Non-Local Effects in String Black Holes

We consider modifications to general relativity due to non-local stringeffects by using perturbation theory about the 4-dimensional Schwarzschildblack hole metric. In keeping with our interpretation in previous works ofblack holes as quantum p-branes we investigate non-local effects due to acritical bosonic string compactified down to 4 dimensions. We show thatnon-local effects do not alter the spacetime topology (at leastperturbatively), but they do lead to violations of the area law of black holethermodynamics and to Hawking's first law of black hole thermodynamics. We alsoconsider a simple analytic continuation of our perturbaive result into thenon-perturbative region, which yields an ultraviolet-finite theory of quantumgravity. The Hawking temperature goes to zero in the non-perturbative region(zero string tension parameter), which is consistent with the view thatPlanck-size physics is quantum mechanical.
