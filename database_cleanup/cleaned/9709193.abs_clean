GeometryWe analyze the u-plane contribution to Donaldson invariants of afour-manifold X. For $b_2^+(X)>1$, this contribution vanishes, but for$b_2^+=1$, the Donaldson invariants must be written as the sum of a u-planeintegral and an SW contribution. The u-plane integrals are quite intricate, butcan be analyzed in great detail and even calculated. By analyzing the u-planeintegrals, the relation of Donaldson theory to N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Millstheory can be described much more fully, the relation of Donaldson invariantsto SW theory can be generalized to four-manifolds not of simple type, andinteresting formulas can be obtained for the class numbers of imaginaryquadratic fields. We also show how the results generalize to extensions ofDonaldson theory obtained by including hypermultiplet matter fields.
