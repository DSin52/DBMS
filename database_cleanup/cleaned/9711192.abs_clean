improvements in terminology and explanationsIn the framework of the four dimensional heterotic superstring with freeworld-sheet fermions we study the GUSTs which contain non-abelian horizontalsymmetry. To solve the problem of breaking the G_GUT gauge symmetry of thelevel one current algebra we extend the gauge symmetry to G x G. Using theautoduality of the fermionic charge lattice we study the possibilities ofconstructing of some GUST gauge groups. We also study the string amplitudes andfor one realistic model explicitly calculate the renormalizable andnon-renormalizable (N=4,5,6) contributions to the superpotential. We observethat the existence of the mass matrix ansatz depends on the way of the breakingof the horizontal gauge symmetry.
