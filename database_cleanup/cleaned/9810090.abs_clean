We find solutions of the bosonic sector of gauged N=4, D=4 SU(2) $\times$SU(2) supergravity, which represent dilaton black holes with toroidal orspherical event horizons. The axion is consistently truncated, and the gaugegroup is broken to U(1) $\times$ U(1). The spherical black holes carry twoelectric and two magnetic abelian charges, whereas the toroidal holes havevanishing magnetic charges. The spacetime metrics are warped products, and themanifolds turn out to be globally hyperbolic, in contrast to standard gaugedsupergravity ground states. It is shown that in the toroidal case, there aresolutions preserving one quarter or one half of the supersymmetries, while forspherical topologies all supersymmetries are broken. In general, the toroidalBPS states represent naked singularities, but there is also a supersymmetricblack hole with vanishing Hawking temperature. The 1/2 supersymmetric casearises for vanishing charges and mass, and represents the known domain wallsolution of the Freedman-Schwarz model. It provides the background in which theblack holes live. Finally, we use Chamseddine's and Volkov's Kaluza-Kleininterpretation of gauged N=4, D=4 SU(2) $\times$ SU(2) supergravity to lift oursolutions to ten and eleven dimensions and to consider them as solutions to theleading order equations of motion of the string-/M-theory effective action.
