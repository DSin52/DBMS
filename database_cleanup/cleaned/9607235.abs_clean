Title: Black Holes in String Theory

Comments: Minor changes in the references. 80 pages, 8 figures, uses harvmac

This thesis is devoted to trying to find a microscopic quantum description ofblack holes. We consider black holes in string theory which is a quantum theoryof gravity. We find that the ``area law'' black hole entropy for extremal andnear-extremal charged black holes arises from counting microscopicconfigurations. We study black holes in five and four spacetime dimensions. Wecalculate the Hawking temperature and give a physical picture of the Hawkingdecay process. Hopefully, the reader will find here a moderately self containedreview of D-branes and string theory applied to black hole physics.
