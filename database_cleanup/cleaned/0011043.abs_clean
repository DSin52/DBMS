We discuss the spectra of multi-flavor massless QCD_2. An approximation inwhich the Hilbert space is truncated to two currents states is used. We writedown a 't Hooft like equation for the wave function of the two currents states.We solve this equation for the lowest massive state and find an excellentagreement with the DLCQ results. In addition, the 't Hooft model and the largeN_f limit spectra are re-derived by using a description in terms of currents.
