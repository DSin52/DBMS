We clarify certain important issues relevant for the geometric interpretationof a large class of N = 2 superconformal theories. By fully exploiting thephase structure of these theories (discovered in earlier works) we are able toclearly identify their geometric content. One application is to present asimple and natural resolution to the question of what constitutes the mirror ofa rigid Calabi-Yau manifold. We also discuss some other models with unusualphase diagrams that highlight some subtle features regarding the geometriccontent of conformal theories.
