quartic terms corrected; there are then additional terms at quartic orderthat will be presented in the next update to this manuscriptWe write the type IIB worldsheet action in classes of bosonic curvedbackgrounds threaded with Ramond-Ramond fluxes. The fixing of the kappasymmetry in the light-cone gauge and the use of the Bianchi identities of thesupergravity theory lead to an expression of a relatively simple form, yet richwith new physical information about how fundamental strings react to thepresence of RR fields. The results are useful in particular to the study ofvacuum structure and dynamics in the context of the Holographic duality; and topossibly formulate an open-closed string duality at the level of theworldsheet.
