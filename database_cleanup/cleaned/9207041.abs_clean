The Vassiliev-Gusarov link invariants of finite type are known to be closelyrelated to perturbation theory for Chern-Simons theory. In order to clarify theperturbative nature of such link invariants, we introduce an algebra V_infinitycontaining elements g_i satisfying the usual braid group relations and elementsa_i satisfying g_i - g_i^{-1} = epsilon a_i, where epsilon is a formal variablethat may be regarded as measuring the failure of g_i^2 to equal 1.Topologically, the elements a_i signify crossings. We show that a large classof link invariants of finite type are in one-to-one correspondence withhomogeneous Markov traces on V_infinity. We sketch a possible application oflink invariants of finite type to a manifestly diffeomorphism-invariantperturbation theory for quantum gravity in the loop representation.
