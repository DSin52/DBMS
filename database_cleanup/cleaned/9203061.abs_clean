Title: Gravitational Phase Transitions and the Sine-Gordon Model

Authors: Gregory Moore

Comments: 23pp., 6 figures (not included)

We consider the Sine-Gordon model coupled to 2D gravity. We find anonperturbative expression for the partition function as a function of thecosmological constant, the SG mass and the SG coupling constant. At genus zero,the partition function exhibits singularities which are interpreted as signalsof phase transitions. A semiclassical picture of one of these transitions isproposed. According to this picture, a phase in which the Sine-Gordon field andthe geometry are frozen melts into another phase in which the fields andgeometry become dynamical.
