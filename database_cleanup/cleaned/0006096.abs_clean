We construct a multiple star product method and by using this method, showthat integral forms of some star products can be written in terms of thepath-integral. This method can be applied to some examples. Especially, theassociativity of the skew-symmetrized Berezin star product proposed in\cite{SW}, is recovered in large $N$ limit of the multiple star product. Wealso derive the path integral form of the Kontsevich star product from themultiple Moyal star product. This paper includes some reviews about starproducts.
