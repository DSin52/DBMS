The propagation differential for bosonic strings on a complex toruswith three symmetric punctures is investigated. We study deformation aspectsbetween two point and three point differentials as well as the behaviour of thecorresponding Krichever-Novikov algebras. The structure constants arecalculated and from this we derive a central extension of the Krichever-Novikovalgebras by means of b-c systems. The defining cocycle for this centralextension deforms to the well known Virasoro cocycle for certain kinds ofdegenerations of the torus.
