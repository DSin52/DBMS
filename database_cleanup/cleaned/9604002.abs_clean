We provide N=1 Super Yang-Mills theory in the Wess-Zumino gauge with massterms for the supersymmetric partners of the gauge fields and of the matterfields, together with a supersymmetric mass term for the fermionic matterfields. All mass terms are chosen in such a way to induce soft supersymmetrybreakings at most, while preserving gauge invariance to all orders ofperturbation theory. The breakings are controlled through an extendedSlavnov-Taylor identity. The renormalization analysis, both in the ultravioletand in the infrared region, is performed.
