University, March 22-29, 1988If cosmological constant is positive, a black hole is naturally described bythe Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution with two horizons. We use the globalmethod to extract the topological information and the selection rule for theGibbons-Hawking temperature for the thermal vacua. These are related to theEuler number of the Euclidean section whose topology is more complicated thanexpected. We also point out the failure of the usual local method of conicalsingularity approach in dealing with multi-horizon scenarios.
