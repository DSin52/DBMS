We construct chiral N=(1,0) self-dual supergravity in Euclideaneight-dimensions with reduced holonomy Spin(7), including all the higher-orderinteractions in a closed form. We first establish the non-chiral N=(1,1)superspace supergravity in eight-dimensions with SO(8) holonomy withoutself-duality, as the foundation of the formulation. In order to make the wholecomputation simple, and the generalized self-duality compatible withsupersymmetry, we adopt a particular set of superspace constraints similar tothe one originally developed in ten-dimensional superspace. The intrinsicproperties of octonionic structure constants make local supersymmetry,generalized self-duality condition, and reduced holonomy Spin(7) all consistentwith each other.
