SymposiumWe discuss a global anomaly associated with the coupling of chiral Weylfermions to gravity. The Standard Model based upon$SU(3){\times}SU(2){\times}{U(1)}$ which has 15 fermions per generation isshown to be inconsistent if all background spin manifolds with signatureinvariant $\tau=8k$ are allowed. Similarly, GUTs based on odd number of Weylfermions are inconsistent. Consistency can be achieved by adding an extra Weylfermion which needs to couple only to gravity. For arbitrary $\tau$'s,generalized spin structures are needed, and the global anomaly cancellationrequires that the net index of the total Dirac operator with spin and internalgauge connections be even. As a result GUTs with fundamental multiplets whichcontain multiples of 16 Weyls per generation are selected. The simplestconsistent GUT is the SO(10) model with a multiplet of 16 Weyls per generation.The combined gravity and internal symmetry gauge group of the theory is then$[Spin(3,1){\times}Spin(10)]/Z_2$. Physical implications of these results arecommented on.
