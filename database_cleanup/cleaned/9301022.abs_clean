The field content of the two dimensional string theory consists of thedynamical tachyon field and some nonpropagating fields which consist in thetopological sector of this theory. We propose in this paper to study thistopological sector as a spacetime gauge theory with a simple centrally extended$w_\infty$ algebra. This $w_\infty$ algebra appears in both the world sheetBRST analysis and the matrix model approach. Since the two dimensionalcentrally extended Poincar\'e algebra is naturally embedded in the centrallyextended $w_\infty$ algebra, the low energy action for the metric and dilatonappears naturally when the model is truncated at this level. We give aplausible explanation of emergence of discrete states in this formulation. Thistheory is again the effective theory at zero slope limit. To include higherorder $\alpha'$ corrections, we speculate that the whole theory is a gaugetheory of a deformed $w_\infty$ algebra, and the deformation parameter is just$\alpha'$.
