Quantum back reaction due to $N$ massless fields may be worked out to aconsiderable detail in a variant of integrable dilaton gravity model in twodimensions. It is shown that there exists a critical mass of collapsing objectof order $\hbar N \times$ (cosmological constant)$^{1/2}$, above which the endpoint of Hawking evaporation is two disconnected remnants of infinite extent,each separated by a mouth from the outside region. Deep inside the mouth thereis a universal flux of radiation in all directions, in a form different fromHawking radiation. Below the critical mass no remnant is left behind, implyingcomplete Hawking evaporation or even showing no sign of Hawking radiation.Existence of infinitely many static states of quantum nature is alsodemonstrated in this model.
