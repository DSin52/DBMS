We apply the method of \underline{zeta} functions, together with the$n_\mu^*$-prescription for the temporal gauge, to evaluate the thermodynamicpressure in QCD at finite temperature $T$. Working in the imaginary-timeformalism and employing a special version of the unified-gauge prescription, weshow that the pure-gauge contribution to the pressure at two loops is given by$P_2^{\mbox{{\scriptsize gauge}}} = -(g^2/144)N_cN_gT^4$, where $N_c$ and $N_g$denote the number of colours and gluons, respectively. This result agrees withthe value in the Feynman gauge.
