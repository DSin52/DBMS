We argue that it is possible to maintain both supersymmetry and integrabilityin the boundary tricritical Ising field theory. Indeed, we find two sets ofboundary conditions and corresponding boundary perturbations which are bothsupersymmetric and integrable. The first set corresponds to a ``direct sum'' oftwo non-supersymmetric theories studied earlier by Chim. The second setcorresponds to a one-parameter deformation of another theory studied by Chim.For both cases, the conserved supersymmetry charges are linear combinations ofQ, \bar Q and the spin-reversal operator \Gamma.
