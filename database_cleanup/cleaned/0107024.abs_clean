few references are addedThe high temperature asymptotics of thermodynamic functions ofelectromagnetic field subjected to boundary conditions with spherical andcylindrical symmetries are constructed by making use of a general expansion interms of heat kernel coefficients and the related determinant. For this, somenew heat kernel coefficients and determinants had to be calculated for theboundary conditions under consideration. The obtained results reproduce all theasymptotics derived by other methods in the problems at hand and involve a fewnew terms in the high temperature expansions. An obvious merit of this approachis its universality and applicability to any boundary value problem correctlyformulated.
