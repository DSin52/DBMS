Authors: E. D'Hoker and D.H. Phong

Comments: 30 pages, Based on Lectures delivered at Edinburgh and Kyoto

SystemsWe summarize recent results on the resolution of two intimately relatedproblems, one physical, the other mathematical. The first deals with theresolution of the non-perturbative low energy dynamics of certain N=2supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. We concentrate on the theories with onemassive hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation of an arbitrary gaugealgebra G. The second deals with the construction of Lax pairs with spectralparameter for certain classical mechanics Calogero-Moser integrable systemsassociated with an arbitrary Lie algebra G. We review the solution to both ofthese problems as well as their interrelation.
