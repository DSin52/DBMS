We analyse supermembrane instantons (fully wrapped supermembranes) bycomputing the partition function of the three-dimensional supersymmetrical U(N)matrix model under periodic boundary conditions. By mapping the model to acohomological field theory and considering a mass-deformation of the model, weshow that the partition function exactly leads to the U-duality invariantmeasure factor entering supermembrane instanton sums. On the other hand, acomputation based on the quasi-classical assumption gives the non U-dualityinvariant result of the zero-mode analysis by Pioline et al. This is suggestiveof the importance of supermembrane self-interactions and shows a crucialdifference from the matrix string case.
