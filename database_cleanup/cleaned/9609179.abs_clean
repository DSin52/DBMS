We found a quantum cohomology/homology of quantum Hall effect which arises asthe invariant property of the Chern-Simons theory of quantum Hall effect andshowed that it should be equivalent to the quantum cohomology which arose asthe invariant property of topological sigma models. This isomorphism should berelated with an equivalence between the supersymmetric- and quantizationstructures in two dimensional models and/or with an equivalence betweentopological sigma models and the Chern-Simons theory by the methode of masterequation.
