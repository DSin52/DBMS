We consider dimensionally reduced three-dimensional supersymmetricYang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory. Although the N=1 supersymmetry of this theorydoes not allow true massive Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) states, wefind approximate BPS states which have non-zero masses that are almostindependent of the Yang-Mills coupling constant and which are a reflection ofthe massless BPS states of the underlying N=1 super Yang-Mills theory. Themasses of these states at large Yang-Mills coupling are exactly at then-particle continuum thresholds. This leads to a relation between their massesat zero and large Yang-Mills coupling.
