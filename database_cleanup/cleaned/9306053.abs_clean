Title: Combinatorial $B_n$-analogues of Schubert polynomials

Comments: 14 pages, figures available upon request

Combinatorial $B_n$-analogues of Schubert polynomials and correspondingsymmetric functions are constructed from an exponential solution of the$B_n$-Yang-Baxter equation that involves the nilCoxeter algebra of thehyperoctahedral group.
