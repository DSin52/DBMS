In this note we display an observation about the geometrical properties ofthe gauge group manifold of the standard electroweak theory, and the values ofthe gauge coupling constants. Heuristically obtained stucture relates the value137.036... to the low energy U(1) coupling. The constuction resemblestechniques recently used within the framework of the string and D-brane theory.We consider this as an indication that the string theory has direct relevancefor the phenomenological QFT and particle physics.
