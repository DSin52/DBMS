We obtain new fermionic sum representations for the Virasoro characters ofthe confromal field theory describing the ferromagnetic three-state Potts spinchain. These arise from the fermionic quasi-particle excitations derived fromthe Bethe equations for the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian. In the conformalscaling limit, the Bethe equations provide a description of the spectrum interms of one genuine quasi-particle, and two ``ghost'' excitations with alimited microscopic momentum range. This description is reflected in thestructure of the character formulas, and suggests a connection with theintegrable perturbation of dimensions (2/3,2/3)$^+$ which breaks the $S_3$symmetry of the conformal field theory down to $Z_2$.
