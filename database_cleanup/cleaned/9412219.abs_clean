We study the $SU(2)$ WZNW model over a family of elliptic curves. Startingfrom the formulation developed by Tsuchiya, Ueno and Yamada, we derive a systemof differential equations which contains the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernardequations. Our system completely determines the $N$-point functions and it isregarded as a natural elliptic analogue of the one developed by Tsuchiya andKanie for the projective line. We also calculate the system for the 1-pointfunctions explicitly. This gives a generalization of the system for$\hat\frak{sl}(2,\C)$-characters derived by Eguchi and Ooguri.
