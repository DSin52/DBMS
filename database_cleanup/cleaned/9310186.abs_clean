It is shown that the application of Lax-Phillips scattering theory to quantummechanics provides a natural framework for the realization of the ideas of theMany-Hilbert-Space theory of Machida and Namiki to describe the development ofdecoherence in the process of measurement. We show that if the quantummechanical evolution is pointwise in time, then decoherence occurs only if theHamiltonian is time-dependent. If the evolution is not pointwise in time (as inLiouville space), then the decoherence may occur even for closed systems. Theseconclusions apply as well to the general problem of mixing of states.
