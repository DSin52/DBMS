Comments: revised version, some details and formulations are changed, few

The exact solutions to quantum string and gauge field theories are discussedand their formulation in the framework of integrable systems is presented. Inparticular I consider in detail several examples of appearence of solutions tothe first-order integrable equations of hydrodynamical type and stress that allknown examples can be treated as partial solutions to the same problem in thetheory of integrable systems.
