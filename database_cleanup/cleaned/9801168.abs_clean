We present results for some infinite series appearing in Feynman diagramcalculations, many of which are similar to the Euler series. These include bothone-dimensional and two-dimensional series. Most of these series can beexpressed in terms of zeta(2), zeta(3), the Catalan constant G and Cl{2}(pi/3)where Cl{2}(theta) is Clausen's function.
