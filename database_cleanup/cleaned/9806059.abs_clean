Title: String Dualities and Toric Geometry

Authors: Harald Skarke

Comments: 17 pages, Latex, 7 figures, invited paper to appear in the special

issue of the Journal of Chaos, Solitons and Fractals on "Superstrings, M, F,S, ... Theory" (M.S. El Naschie and C. Castro, editors)This note is supposed to be an introduction to those concepts of toricgeometry that are necessary to understand applications in the context of stringand F-theory dualities. The presentation is based on the definition of a toricvariety in terms of homogeneous coordinates, stressing the analogy withweighted projective spaces. We try to give both intuitive pictures and preciserules that should enable the reader to work with the concepts presented here.
