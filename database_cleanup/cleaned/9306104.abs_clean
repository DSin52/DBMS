Title: Space-Time Transitions in String Theory

Authors: Edward Witten

Comments: 6 pages, Phyzzx

Simple mean field methods can be used to describe transitions betweendifferent space-time models in string theory. These include transitions betweendifferent Calabi-Yau manifolds, and more exotic things such as theCalabi-Yau/Landau-Ginzberg correspondence.
