Recently an action formulation, called the general WZW orbifold action, wasgiven for each sector of every WZW orbifold. In this paper we gauge this actionby general twisted gauge groups to find the action formulation of each sectorof every coset orbifold. Connection with the known current-algebraicformulation of coset orbifolds is discussed as needed, and some large examplesare worked out in further detail.
