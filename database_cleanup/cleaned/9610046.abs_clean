The known BPS dyon black hole solutions of the N=4 heterotic string in fourdimensions with non-zero angular momentum all have naked singularities. We showthat it is possible to modify a certain class of these solutions by theaddition of massive Kaluza-Klein fields in such a way that the solutionsdecompactify near the core to five-dimensional black hole solutions withregular event horizons. We argue that the degeneracy of the four-dimensionalBPS dyon states is given, for large charges, by the five-dimensional geometricentropy.
