We argue that string interactions in a PP-wave spacetime are governed by aneffective coupling $g_{eff}=g_s(\mu p^+\apm)f(\mu p^+ \apm)$ where $f(\mu p^+\apm)$ is proportional to the light cone energy of the string states involvedin the interaction. This simply follows from generalities of a Matrix Stringdescription of this background. $g_{eff}$ nicely interpolates between theexpected result ($g_s$) for flat space (small $\mu p^+\apm$) and a recentlyconjectured expression from the perturbative gauge theory side (large $\mup^+\apm$).
