Title: Two-dimensional gravity with an invariant energy scale and arbitrary

dilaton potentialAuthors: S. Mignemi

Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX

We investigate a model of two-dimensional gravity with arbitrary scalarpotential obtained by gauging a deformation of de Sitter or more generalalgebras, which accounts for the existence of an invariant energy scale. Weobtain explicit solutions of the field equations and discuss their properties.
