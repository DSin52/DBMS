Title: ICTP Lectures on Covariant Quantization of the Superstring

Comments: 43 pages harvmac

These ICTP Trieste lecture notes review the pure spinor approach toquantizing the superstring with manifest D=10 super-Poincare invariance. Thefirst section discusses covariant quantization of the superparticle and gives anew proof of equivalence with the Brink-Schwarz superparticle. The secondsection discusses the superstring in a flat background and shows how toconstruct vertex operators and compute tree amplitudes in a manifestlysuper-Poincare covariant manner. And the third section discusses quantizationof the superstring in curved backgrounds which can include Ramond-Ramond flux.
