of the Spring School "QFT and Hamiltonian Systems", Calimanesti, Romania, May2-7, 2000Starting from a solution to the classical Batalin-Vilkovisky masterequation,an extended solution to an extended master equation is constructed bycoupling all the observables, the anomaly candidates and the generators ofglobal symmetries. The construction of the formalism and its applications inthe context of the renormalization of generic and potentially anomalous gaugetheories are reviewed.
