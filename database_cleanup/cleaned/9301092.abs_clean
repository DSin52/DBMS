Star products on the classical double group of a simple Lie group and oncorresponding symplectic grupoids are given so that the quantum double and the"quantized tangent bundle" are obtained in the deformation description."Complex" quantum groups and bicovariant quantum Lie algebras are discused fromthis point of view. Further we discuss the quantization of the Poissonstructure on symmetric algebra $S(g)$ leading to the quantized envelopingalgebra $U_{h}(g)$ as an example of biquantization in the sense of Turaev.Description of $U_{h}(g)$ in terms of the generators of the bicovariantdifferential calculus on $F(G_q)$ is very convenient for this purpose. Finallywe interpret in the deformation framework some well known properties of compactquantum groups as simple consequences of corresponding properties of classicalcompact Lie groups. An analogue of the classical Kirillov's universal characterformula is given for the unitary irreducible representation in the compactcase.
