Title: Ray-Singer Torsion, Topological field theories and the Riemann zeta

function at s=3Comments: 10 pages

Starting with topological field theories we investigate the Ray-Singeranalytic torsion in three dimensions. For the lens Spaces L(p;q) an explicitanalytic continuation of the appropriate zeta functions is contructed andimplemented. Among the results obtained are closed formulae for the individualdeterminants involved, the large $p$ behaviour of the determinants and theordinary Riemann zeta function evaluated at s=3.The torsion turns out to be trivial for the cases L(6,1), L((10,3) andL(12,5) and is, in general, greater than unity for large p and less than unityfor a finite number of p and q.
