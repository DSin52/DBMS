Title: String Dualities and the Geroch Group

Comments: 3 pages, latex, no figures

We examine the properties and symmetries of the lowest order effective theoryof 4-dim string backgrounds with axion and dilaton fields and zero cosmologicalconstant. The dimensional reduction yields an O(2,2) current group oftransformations in the presence of two commuting Killing symmetries. Specialemphasis is placed on the identification of the T and S string dualitysymmetries, and their intertwining relations.
