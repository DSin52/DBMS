Using the ideas of supersymmetry and shape invariance we show that theeigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a wide class of noncentral potentials can beobtained in a closed form by the operator method. This generalizationconsiderably extends the list of exactly solvable potentials for which thesolution can be obtained algebraically in a simple and elegant manner. As anillustration, we discuss in detail the example of the potential$$V(r,\theta,\phi)={\omega^2\over 4}r^2 + {\delta\over r^2}+{C\over r^2sin^2\theta}+{D\over r^2 cos^2\theta} + {F\over r^2 sin^2\theta sin^2\alpha\phi} +{G\over r^2 sin^2\theta cos^2\alpha\phi}$$ with 7 parameters.Otheralgebraically solvable examples are also given.
