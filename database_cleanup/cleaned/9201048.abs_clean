In a previous work, a straightforward canonical approach to the source-freequantum Chern-Simons dynamics was developed. It makes use of neither gaugeconditions nor functional integrals and needs only ideas known from QCD andquantum gravity. It gives Witten's conformal edge states in a simple way whenthe spatial slice is a disc. Here we extend the formalism by including sourcesas well. The quantum states of a source with a fixed spatial location are shownto be those of a conformal family, a result also discovered first by Witten.The internal states of a source are not thus associated with just a single rayof a Hilbert space. Vertex operators for both abelian and nonabelian sourcesare constructed. The regularized abelian Wilson line is proved to be a vertexoperator. We also argue in favor of a similar nonabelian result. Thespin-statistics theorem is established for Chern-Simons dynamics even thoughthe sources are not described by relativistic quantum fields. The proof employsgeometrical methods which we find are strikingly transparent and pleasing. Itis based on the research of European physicists about ``fields localized oncones.''
