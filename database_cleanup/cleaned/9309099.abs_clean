The phase space of a particle on a group manifold can be split in left andright sectors, in close analogy with the chiral sectors in Wess Zumino Wittenmodels. We perform a classical analysis of the sectors, and the geometricquantization in the case of $SU(2)$. The quadratic relation, classicallyidentifying $SU(2)$ as the sphere $S^3$, is replaced quantum mechanically by asimilar condition on non-commutative operators ('quantum sphere'). Theresulting quantum exchange algebra of the chiral group variables is quartic,not quadratic. The fusion of the sectors leads to a Hilbert space that issubtly different from the one obtained by a more direct (un--split)quantization.
