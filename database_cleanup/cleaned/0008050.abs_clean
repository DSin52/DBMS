We show that four-dimensional N=2 ungauged Einstein-Maxwell supergravity canbe embedded on the Randall-Sundrum 3-brane, as a consistent Kaluza-Kleinreduction of five-dimensional N=4 gauged supergravity. In particular, thisallows us to describe four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom black holes withinthe Randall-Sundrum scenario. Using earlier results on the embedding offive-dimensional N=4 gauged supergravity in ten dimensions, we can thendescribe the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell supergravity on the 3-brane, andits solutions, from a type IIB viewpoint. We also show that the minimalungauged supergravities in D=5 and D=6 can be consistently embedded in thehalf-maximally supersymmetric gauged supergravities in D=6 and D=7respectively. These allow us to construct solutions including BPS black holesand strings living in "Randall-Sundrum 4-branes," and BPS self-dual stringsliving in "Randall-Sundrum 5-branes." We can also lift the embeddings toten-dimensional massive type IIA and D=11 supergravity respectively. Inparticular, we obtain a solution describing the self-dual string living in theworld-volume of an M5-brane, which can be viewed as an open membrane ending onthe M5-brane.
