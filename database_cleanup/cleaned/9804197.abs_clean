We introduced a dynamical system given by a difference of two simple SL(2,R)WZNW actions in 2D, and defined the related gauge theory in a consistent way.It is shown that gauge symmetry can be fixed in such a way that, afterintegrating out some dynamical variables in the functional integral, oneobtains the induced gravity action.
