We compactify $M$-theory on a Calabi-Yau manifold to five dimensions bywrapping the membrane and fivebrane solitons of the eleven-dimensionalsupergravity limit around Calabi-Yau two-cycles and four-cycles respectively.We identify the perturbative and non-perturbative BPS states thus obtained withthose of heterotic string theory compactified on $K3\times S^1$. Quantumaspects of the five-dimensional theory are discussed.
