The generalization of the Yang-Baxter equations (YBE) in the presence of Z_2grading along both chain and time directions is presented. The XXZ model withstaggered disposition along a chain of both, the anisotropy \pm\Delta, as wellas shifts of the spectral parameters are considered and the correspondingintegrable model is constructed. The Hamiltonian of the model is computed infermionic and spin formulations. It involves three neighbour site interactionsand therefore can be considered as a zig-zag ladder model. The Algebraic BetheAnsatz technique is applied and the eigenstates, along with eigenvalues of thetransfer matrix of the model are found. The model has a free fermionic limit at\Delta=0 and the integrable boundary terms are found in this case.This construction is quite general and can be applied to other knownintegrable models.
