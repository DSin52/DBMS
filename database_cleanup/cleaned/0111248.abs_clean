The evaluation of field theoretic correlators at strong couplings isespecially interesting in the light of recently discovered string/field theorycorrespondences. We present a calculation of the stress-tensor correlator inN=1 SYM theory in 2+1 dimensions. We calculate this object numerically with themethod of supersymmetric discrete light-cone quantization (SDLCQ) at large N_c.For small distances we reproduce the conformal field theory result with thecorrelator behaving like 1/r^6. In the large r limit the correlator isdetermined by the (massless) BPS states of the theory. We find a critical valueof the coupling where the correlator goes to zero in this limit. This criticalcoupling is shown to grow linearly with the square root of the transversemomentum resolution.
