For a conformal theory it is natural to seek the conformal moduli space, M_cto which it belongs, generated by the exactly marginal deformations. By now weshould have the tools to determine M_c in the presence of enough supersymmetry.Here it is shown that its dimension is determined in terms of a certain index.Moreover, the D-term of the global group is an obstruction for deformation, inpresence of a certain amount of preserved supersymmetry. As an example we findthat the deformations of the membrane (3d) field theory, under certainconditions, are in 35/SL(4,C). Other properties including the local geometry ofM_c are discussed.
