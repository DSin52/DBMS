In this paper we propose a generalization of N=4 three dimensional AdSsupergravity to the noncommutative case. This is a supersymmetric version ofthe results presented in hep-th/0201103. We show that it continues to admit anN=4 supersymmetric solution which is the noncommutative couterpart of AdS_3space. Some other solutions are also discussed.
