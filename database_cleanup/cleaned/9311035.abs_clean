On an equation associated with the contact Lie algebras/ Mikhail V. Saveliev/In the framework of a Lie algebraic approach we study a nonlinear equationassociated with the contact Lie algebra ${\bf K}K_m$, that seems to be relavantfor some solvable models of field theory and gravity in higher dimensions.LPTENS--93/43.
