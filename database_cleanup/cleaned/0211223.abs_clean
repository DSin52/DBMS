Title: A New Type of Superstring in four dimension

Authors: B. B. Deo

Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B557 (2003) 105-113

A bosonic string in twenty six dimensions is effectively reduced to fourdimensions by eleven Majorana fermions which are vectors in the bosonicrepresetation SO(d-1,1). By dividing the fermions in two groups, actions can bewritten down which are world sheet supersymmetric, 2-d local and local 4-dsupersymmetric. The novel string is anomally free, free of ghosts and thepartition function is modular invariant.
