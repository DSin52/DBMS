We investigate multi-flavour gauge theories confined in $d\es 2n$-dimensionalEuclidean bags. The boundary conditions for the 'quarks' break the axialflavour symmetry and depend on a parameter $\theta$. We determine the$\theta$-dependence of the fermionic correlators and determinants and find thata $CP$-breaking $\theta$-term is generated dynamically. As an application wecalculate the chiral condensate in multi-flavour $QED_2$ and the abelianprojection of $QCD_2$. In the second model a condensate is generated in thelimit where the number of colours, $N_c$, tends to infinity. We prove that thecondensate in $QCD_2$ decreases with increasing bag radius $R$ at least as$\sim R^{-1/N_cN_f}$. Finally we determine the correlators of mesonic currentsin $QCD_2$.
