A supersymmetric extension of the color Calogero-Sutherland model isconsidered based on the Yangian $Y(gl(n|m))$. The algebraic structure of themodel is discussed in some details. We show that the commuting conservedquantities can be generated from the super-quantum determinant, thusestablishing the integrability of the model. In addition, rational limit of themodel is studied where the Yangian symmetry degenerates into a super loopalgebra.
