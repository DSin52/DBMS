The supergravity dual of $N$ regular and $M$ fractional D1-branes on the coneover the Einstein manifold $Q^{1,1,1}$ has a naked singularity in the infrared.The supergravity dual of $N$ regular and $M$ fractional D3-branes on theconifold also has such a singularity. Buchel suggested and Gubser et al. haveshown that in the D3-brane case, the naked singularity is cloaked by a horizonat a sufficiently high temperature. In this paper we derive the system ofsecond-order differential equations necessary to find such a solution for$Q^{1,1,1}$. We also find solutions to this system in perturbation theory thatis valid when the Hawking temperature of the horizon is very high.
