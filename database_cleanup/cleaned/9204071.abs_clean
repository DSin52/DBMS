We construct a manifestly $N=(4,0)$ world-sheet supersymmetric twistor-likeformulation of the $D=6$ Green-Schwarz superstring, using the principle ofdouble (target-space and world-sheet) Grassmann analyticity. The superstringaction contains two Lagrange multiplier terms and a Wess-Zumino term. They arewritten down in the analytic subspace of the world-sheet harmonic $N=(4,0)$superspace, the target manifold being too an analytic subspace of the harmonic$D=6\;\; N=1$ superspace. The kappa symmetry of the $D=6$ superstring isidentified with a Kac-Moody extension of the world-sheet $N=(4,0)$superconformal symmetry. It can be enlarged to include the whole world-sheetreparametrization group if one introduces the appropriate gauge Beltramisuperfield into the action. To illustrate the basic features of the new $D=6$superstring construction, we first give some details about the simpler (alreadyknown) twistor-like formulations of $D=3, N=(1,0)$ and $D=4, N=(2,0)$superstrings.
