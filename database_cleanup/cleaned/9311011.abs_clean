It has previously been proved that the lowest order supersymmetric WKBapproximation reproduces the exact bound state spectrum of shape invariantpotentials. We show that this is not true for a new, recently discovered classof shape invariant potentials and analyse the reasons underlying this breakdownof the usual proof.
