In this paper we consider the influence of transplanckian physics on the CMBRanisotropies produced by inflation. We consider a simple toy model that allowsfor analytic calculations and argue on general grounds, based on ambiguities inthe choice of vacuum, that effects are expected with a magnitude of the orderof $H/\Lambda$, where $H$ is the Hubble constant during inflation and $\Lambda$the scale for new physics, e.g. the Planck scale.
