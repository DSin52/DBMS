Comments: 6 pages, 4 figures

The renormalized Feynman propagator for a scalar field in the background of acosmic dispiration (a disclination plus a screw dislocation) is derived,opening an window to investigate vacuum polarization effects around a cosmicstring with dislocation, as well as in the bulk of an elastic solid carrying adispiration. The use of the propagator is illustrated by computing themean-square field fluctuation. Connections with a closely related background,namely the spacetime of a spinning cosmic string, are briefly addressed.
