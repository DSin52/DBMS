Supergravity theory in $2+\epsilon$ dimensions is studied. It is invariantunder supertransformations in 2 and 3 dimensions. One-loop divergence isexplicitly computed in the background field method and a nontrivial fixed pointis found. In quantizing the supergravity, a gauge fixing condition is devisedwhich explicitly isolates conformal and superconformal modes. Therenormalization of the gravitationally dressed operators is studied and theiranomalous dimensions are computed. Problems to use the dimensional reductionare also examined.
