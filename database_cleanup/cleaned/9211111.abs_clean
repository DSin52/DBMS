Title: Quantum Inverse Scattering Method. Selected Topics

Comments: 36 pages

SystemsFour lectures given at Nankai Institute of Mathematics, Tianjin, China, 5--13April 1991 present an elementary introduction into the quantum integrablemodels aimed for mathematical physicists and mathematicians. The stress is madeon the algebraic aspects of the theory and the problem of determining thespectrum of quantum integrals of motion. The XXX magnetic chain is used as thebasic example. Two lectures are devoted to a detailed exposition of theFunctional Bethe Ansatz --- a new technique alternative to the Algebraic BetheAnsatz --- and its relation to the separation of variable method. A possibilityto extend FBA to the $SL(3)$ is discussed.
