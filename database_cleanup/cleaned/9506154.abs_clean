Title: A metric of Yukawa potential as an exact solution to the field equations

of general relativityComments: Latex 4 pages (some changes in notation, and a discussion on a

repulsive term that may be related to the charge of a particle)It is shown that, by defining a suitable energy momentum tensor, the fieldequations of general relativity admit a line element of Yukawa potential as anexact solution. It is also shown that matter that produces strong force may benegative, in which case there would be no Schwarzschild-like singularity
