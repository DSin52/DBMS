Title: A thermal instability for positive brane cosmological constant in the

Randall-Sundrum cosmologiesAuthors: Stephon Alexander, Yi Ling and Lee Smolin

effective 4d cosmological constant is changed. References are addedJournal-ref: Phys.Rev. D65 (2002) 083503

We describe a novel dynamical mechanism to radiate away a positive fourdimensional cosmological constant, in the Randall-Sundrum cosmologicalscenario. We show that there are modes of the bulk gravitational field forwhich the brane is effectively a mirror. This will generally give rise to anemission of thermal radiation from the brane into the bulk. The temperatureturns out to be nonvanishing only if the effective four dimensionalcosmological constant is positive. In any theory where the four dimensionalvacuum energy is a function of physical degrees of freedom, there is then amechanism that radiates away any positive four dimensional cosmologicalconstant.
