{}From the cyclic quantum dilogarithm the shift operator is constructed with$q$ is a root of unit and the representation is given for the current algebraintroduced by Faddeev $et ~al$. It is shown that the theta-function isfactorizable also in this case by using the star-square equation of theBaxter-Bazhanov model.
