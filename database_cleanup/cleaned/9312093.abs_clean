We discuss geometrical aspects of Higgs systems and Toda field theory in theframework of the theory of vector bundles on Riemann surfaces of genus greaterthan one. We point out how Toda fields can be considered as equivalent to Higgssystems -- a connection on a vector bundle $E$ together with anEnd($E$)--valued one form both in the standard and in the Conformal Affinecase. We discuss how variations of Hodge structures can arise in such aframework and determine holomorphic embeddings of Riemann surfaces into locallyhomogeneous spaces, thus giving hints to possible realizations of$W_n$--geometries. }
