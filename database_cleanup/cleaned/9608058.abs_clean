We present a method to perform renormalized perturbation calculation in gaugetheories with chiral fermions. We find it proper to focus directly on theWard-Takahashi identities, relegating dimensional regularization into asupplementary and secondary role. We show with the example of the Abelian-Higgstheory how to handle amplitudes involving fermions, particularly how to handlethe matrix $\gamma_5$. As a demonstration of our method of renormalization, weevaluate the radiative corrections of the triangular anomaly in theAbelian-Higgs theory with appropriate number of chiral fermions. This anomalyamplitude is calculated without any regularization and is found to vanish.
