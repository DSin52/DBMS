Title: Matrix Models as Integrable Systems

Comments: 60 pages, LaTeX. Presented at Banff Conference, Banff, Canada, 15-23

August 1994.The theory of matrix models is reviewed from the point of view of its relationto integrable hierarchies. Determinantal formulas, relation to conformal fieldmodels and the theory of Generalized Kontsevich model are discussed in somedetail. Attention is also paid to the group-theoretical interpretation of$\tau$-functions which allows to go beyond the restricted set of the(multicomponent) KP and Toda integrable hierarchies.
