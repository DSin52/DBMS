We study the low energy string effective action with an exponential typedilaton potential and vanishing torsion in a Bianchi type I space-timegeometry. In the Einstein and string frames the general solution of thegravitational field equations can be expressed in an exact parametric form.Depending on the values of some parameters the obtained cosmological models canbe generically divided into three classes, leading to both singular andnonsingular behaviors. The effect of the potential on the time evolution of themean anisotropy parameter is also considered in detail, and it is shown that aBianchi type I Universe isotropizes only in the presence of a dilaton fieldpotential or a central deficit charge.
