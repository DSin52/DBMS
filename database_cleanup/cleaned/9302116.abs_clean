We perform a perturbative analysis of the Aharonov-Bohm problem to one loopin a field-theoretic formulation, and show that contact interactions arenecessary for renormalizability. In general, the classical scale invariance ofthis problem is broken quantum mechanically. There exists however a criticalpoint for which this anomaly disappears.
