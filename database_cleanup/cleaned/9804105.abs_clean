One-instanton predictions are obtained from the Seiberg-Witten curve derivedfrom M-theory by Landsteiner and Lopez for the Coulomb branch of N=2supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory with a matter hypermultiplet in theantisymmetric representation. Since this cubic curve describes a Riemannsurface that is non-hyperelliptic, a systematic perturbation expansion about ahyperelliptic curve is developed, with a comparable expansion for theSeiberg-Witten differential. Calculation of the period integrals of the SWdifferential by the method of residues of D'Hoker, Krichever, and Phong enablesus to compute the prepotential explicitly to one-instanton order. It is shownthat the one-instanton predictions for SU(2), SU(3), and SU(4) agree withpreviously available results. For SU(N), N > 4, our analysis provides explicitpredictions of a curve derived from M-theory at the one-instanton level infield theory.
