Title: Algebraic and Geometric Structure of the Integrable Models recently

Proposed by CalogeroComments: 12 pages , Latex , No Figures , IPM preprint 96

SystemsWe show that the integrability of the dynamical system recently proposed byCalogero and characterized by the Hamiltonian $ H = \sum_{j,k}^{N} p_j p_k\{\lambda + \mu cos [ \nu ( q_j - q_k)] \} $ is due to a simple algebraicstructure . It is shown that the integrals of motion are related to theCasimiar invariants of of the $su(1,1)$ algebra. Our method shows clearly howthese types of systems can be generalized .
