We identify a string theory counterpart of the dilatonic Melvin D=4background describing a "magnetic flux tube" in low-energy field theory limit.The corresponding D=5 bosonic string model containing extra compactKaluza-Klein dimension is a direct product of the D=2 Minkowski space and a D=3conformal sigma model. The latter is a singular limit of the [SL(2,R) x R]/Rgauged WZW theory. This implies, in particular, that the dilatonic Melvinbackground is an exact string solution to all orders in \a'. Moreover, the D=3model is formally related by an abelian duality to a flat space with anon-trivial topology. The conformal field theory for the Melvin solution isexactly solvable (and for special values of magnetic field parameter isequivalent to CFT for a $Z_N$ orbifold of 2-plane times a circle) and shouldexhibit tachyonic instabilities.
