We show how to obtain the two-dimensional black hole action by dimensionalreduction of the three-dimensional Einstein action with a non-zero cosmologicalconstant. Starting from the Chern-Simons formulation of 2+1 gravity, we obtainthe 1+1 dimensional gauge formulation given by Verlinde. Remarkably, theproposed reduction shares the relevant features of the formulation of Cangemiand Jackiw, without the need for a central charge in the algebra. We show howthe Lagrange multipliersin these formulations appear naturally as the remnantsof the three dimensional connection associated to symmetries that have beenlostin the dimensional reduction. The proposed dimensional reduction involves ashift in the three dimensional connection whose effect is to make the length ofthe extra dimension infinite.
