Title: Notes on Lagrangean and Hamiltonian Symmetries

Comments: 7 pages, LaTeX

The Hamiltonization of local symmetries of the form $\delta q^A =\ea{R_a}^A(q,\dot q)$ or $\delta q^A = \dot\ea{R_a}^A (q,\dot q)$ for arbitraryLagrangean model $L(q^A,\dot q^A)$ is considered. We show as the initialsymmetries are transformed in the transition from $L$ to first order action,and then to the Hamiltonian action $S_H=\int{\rm d}\tau(p_A\dotq^A-H_0-v^\alpha\Phi_\alpha)$, where $\Phi_\alpha$ are the all (first andsecond class) primary constraints. An exact formulae for local symmetries of$S_H$ in terms of the initial generators ${R_a}^A$ and all primary constraints$\Phi_\alpha$ are obtained.
