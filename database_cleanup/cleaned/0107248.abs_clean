We consider a real Lagrangian off-critical submodel describing the solitonsector of the so-called conformal affine $sl(3)^{(1)}$ Toda model coupled tomatter fields (CATM). The theory is treated as a constrained system in thecontext of Faddeev-Jackiw and the symplectic schemes. We exhibit the parentLagrangian nature of the model from which generalizations of the sine-Gordon(GSG) or the massive Thirring (GMT) models are derivable. The dual descriptionof the model is further emphasized by providing the relationships betweenbilinears of GMT spinors and relevant expressions of the GSG fields. In thisway we exhibit the strong/weak coupling phases and the (generalized)soliton/particle correspondences of the model. The $sl(n)^{(1)}$ case is alsooutlined.
