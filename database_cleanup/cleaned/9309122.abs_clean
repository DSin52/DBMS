Renormalization in quantum statistics in the presence of a charge associatedto a spontaneously broken symmetry is discussed for the scalar field model. Incontrast to the case of non-broken symmetry, the renormalization masscounterterm depends on the chemical potential. We argue that this is connectedto the ill-defined character of the charge operator.
