We study string-gas cosmology in dilaton gravity, inspired by the fact thatit naturally arises in a string theory context. Our main interest is thethermodynamical treatment of the string-gas and the resulting implications forthe cosmology. Within an adiabatic approximation, thermodynamical equilibriumand a small, toroidal universe as initial conditions, we numerically solve thecorresponding equations of motions in two different regimes describing theand (ii) an almost-radiation dominated regime, which includes the leadingcorrections due to the lightest Kaluza Klein and winding modes, with two scalefactors. The scale factor in the Hagedorn regime exhibits very slow timeevolution with nearly constant energy and negligible pressure. By contrast, incase (ii) we find interesting cosmological solutions where the large dimensionscontinue to expand and the small ones are kept undetectably small.
