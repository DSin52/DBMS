We compute the elliptic genera of orbifolds associated with $N=2$super--conformal theories which admit a Landau-Ginzburg description. Theidentification of the elliptic genera of the macroscopic Landau-Ginzburgorbifolds with those of the corresponding microscopic $N=2$ orbifolds furthersupports the conjectured identification of these theories. For $SU(N)$Kazama-Suzuki models the orbifolds are associated with certain $\IZ_p$subgroups of the various coset factors. Based on our approach we alsoconjecture the existence of "$E$-type" variants of these theories, theirelliptic genera and the corresponding Landau-Ginzburg potentials.
