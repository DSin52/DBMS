Title: N=4 supersymmetric integrable systems

Comments: 12 pages, LaTeX, Talk given at International Seminar "Supersymmetry

And Quantum Field Theory", dedicated to the memory of Dmitrij Volkov(Kharkov, Ukraine) January 5-7, 1997 (to be published in Proceedings)I give an overview of recent progress in constructing the KdV, mKdV and NLStype hierarchies with extended N=4 supersymmetry.
