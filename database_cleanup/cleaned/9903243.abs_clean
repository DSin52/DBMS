We study the decoupling effects in one-loop corrected N=1 supersymmetrictheory with gauge neutral chiral superfields, by calculating the one-loopcorrected effective Lagrangian that involves light and heavy fields with themass scale M, and subsequently eliminating heavy fields by their equations ofmotion. In addition to new non-renormalizable couplings, we determine the termsthat grow as log(M) and renormalize the fields and couplings in the effectivefield theory, in accordance with the decoupling theorem. However, in a theoryderived from superstring theory, these terms can significantly modify lowenergy predictions for the effective couplings of light fields. For example, ina class of heterotic superstring vacua with an anomalous U(1) the vacuumrestabilization introduces such decoupling effects which in turn correct thelow energy predictions for certain couplings by 10-50%.
