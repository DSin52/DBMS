There are two general irreversibility theorems for the renormalization groupsecond one, by Forte and Latorre, relies on the properties of the stress-tensortrace, and has been recently questioned by Osborn and Shore. We start byestablishing under what assumptions this second theorem can still be valid.Then it is compared with the entropic theorem and shown to be essentiallyequivalent. However, since the irreversible function of the (corrected)Forte-Latorre theorem is non universal (whereas the relative entropy of theother theorem is universal), it needs the additional step of renormalization.On the other hand, the irreversibility theorem is only guaranteed to beunambiguous if the integral of the stress-tensor trace correlator is finite,which happens for free theories only in dimension smaller than four.
