Taking the St\"uckelberg Lagrangian associated with the abelian self-dualmodel of P.K. Townsend et al as a starting point, we embed this mixed first-and second-class system into a pure first-class system by followingsystematically the generalized Hamiltonian approach of Batalin, Fradkin andTyutin. The resulting Lagrangian possesses an extended gauge invariance andprovides a non-trivial example for a general Lagrangian approach to unravellingthe full set of local symmetries of a Lagrangian.
