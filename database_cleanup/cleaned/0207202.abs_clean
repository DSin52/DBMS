Title: Effective Lagrangians for Scalar Fields and Finite Size Effects in Field

TheoryAuthors: M. I. Caicedo and N. F. Svaiter

We discuss the approach of effective field theory on a d-dimensionalEuclidean space in a scalar theory with two different mass scales in thepresence of flat surfaces. Then considering Dirichlet and Neumann boundaryconditions, we implement the renormalization program in the lambda phi^{4}theory in a region bounded by two parallel hyperplanes in the one-loopapproximation.
