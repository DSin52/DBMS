Some aspects of correlation functions in N=4 SYM are discussed. Using N=4harmonic superspace we study two and three-point correlation functions whichare of contact type and argue that these contact terms will not affect thenon-renormalisation theorem for such correlators at non-coincident points. Wethen present a perturbative calculation of a five-point function at two loopsin N=2 harmonic superspace and verify that it reproduces the derivative of thepreviously found four-point function with respect to the coupling. Thecalculation of this four-point function via the five-point function turns outto be significantly simpler than the original direct calculation. Thiscalculation also provides an explicit construction of an N=2 component of anN=4 five-point nilpotent covariant that violates U(1)_Y symmetry.
