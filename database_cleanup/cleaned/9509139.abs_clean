We apply The Batalin-Tyutin constraint formalism of converting a second classsystem into a first class system for the rotational quantisation of the SU(2)Skyrme model. We obtain the first class constraint and the Hamiltonian in theextended phase space. The vacuum functional is constructed and evaluated in theunitary gauge and a multiplier dependent gauge. Finally, we discuss thespectrum of the extended theory. The use of the BT formalism on the collectivecoordinates quantisation of the SU(2) Skyrme model leads an additional term inthe usual quantum Hamiltonian that can improve the phenomenology predicted bythe Skyrme model.
