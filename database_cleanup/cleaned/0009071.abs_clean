The holographic principle is represented as the well-known de Alfaro, Fubiniand Furlan correspondence between the generating functional for the Greenfunctions of the Euclidean quantum field theory in $D$ dimensions and the Gibbsaverage for the classical statistical mechanics in $D+1$ dimensions. Thiscorrespondence is used to explain the origin of quantum anomalies and theirreversibility in the classical theory. The holographic mapping of a classicalstring field theory onto a local quantum field theory is outlined.
