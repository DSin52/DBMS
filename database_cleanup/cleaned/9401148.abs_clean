The recently proposed generalized field method for solving the masterequation of Batalin and Vilkovisky is applied to a gauge theory of quadraticLie algebras in 2-dimensions. The charge corresponding to BRST symmetry derivedfrom this solution in terms of the phase space variables by using the Noetherprocedure, and the one found due to the BFV-method are compared and found tocoincide. $W_3$ algebra, formulated in terms of a continuous variable isemploied in the mentioned gauge theory to construct a $W_3$ topologicalgravity. Moreover, its gauge fixing is briefly discussed.
