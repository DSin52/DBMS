proceedings of the workshop Gauge Theory, Applied Supersymmetry and QuantumGravity, Imperial College, London 1996We find the comlete solution to ten-dimensional supergravity coupled to athree-form field strength, given the ``standard ansatz" for the fields, andshow that in addition to the well-known elementary and solitonic (heterotic)string solutions, one of the possibilities is an (unstable) elementary type Istring solution.
