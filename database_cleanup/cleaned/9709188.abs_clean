Title: On Graceful Exit in String Cosmology with Pre-Big Bang Phase

Authors: Aram A. Saharian

Comments: 24 pages, Latex, 2 figures included

We analyze the problem of graceful exit from superinflationary pre-big bangphase of string cosmology within the context of lowest-order string effectiveaction. The previous no go theorems are generalized for the case when highergenus terms of general form and additional matter fields are included. It isshown that the choice of the E-frame essentially simplifies the consideration.For the example of pure gravi-dilaton case the comparison of E-frame and stringframe approaches, based on phase space analysis, is carried out.
