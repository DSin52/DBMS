Title: Non-perturbative Enhanced Gauge Symmetries in the Gimon-Polchinski

OrientifoldComments: 14 pages, harvmac

We study the enhanced gauge symmetries at constant couplings in the modulispace of the Gimon-Polchinski Orientifold. We show that whenever there is asingularity of E_6, E_7 and E_8 type we get enhanced gauge symmetry U(5), U(6)and U(8) respectively. This is due to the additional twisting involved in thedefinition of the Gimon-Polchiniski orientifold.
