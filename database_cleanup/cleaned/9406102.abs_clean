To receive figures pleasesend request to gcleaver@ohstpy.bitnetThe implications of string theory for understanding the dimension ofdecompactified spacetime are discussed. Results from a computer model designedto simulate expansion of the early universe during the string dominated phaseare presented. This model focuses on the effects of string winding modes oninflation and is based on the theory of random walks. We demonstrate that ourdecompactified four-dimensional spacetime can be explained by the proper choiceof initial conditions.
