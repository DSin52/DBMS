Global issues of the Poisson-Lie T-duality are addressed. It is shown thatoriented open strings propagating on a group manifold $G$ are dual to $D$-brane$D$-branes coincide with the symplectic leaves of the standard Poissonstructure induced on the dual group $\ti G$ by the dressing action of the group$G$. T-duality maps the momentum of the open string into the mutual distance ofthe $D$-branes in the pair. The whole picture is then extended to the fullmodular space $M(D)$ of the Poisson-Lie equivalent $\si$-models which is thespace of all Manin triples of a given Drinfeld double.T-duality rotates thezero modes of pairs of $D$-branes living on targets belonging to $M(D)$. Inthis more general case the $D$-branes are preimages of symplectic leaves incertain Poisson homogeneous spaces of their targets and, as such, they areeither all even or all odd dimensional.
