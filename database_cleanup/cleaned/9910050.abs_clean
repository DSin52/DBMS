A number of arguments exists that the "minimal" BPS wall width in large Nsupersymmetric gluodynamics vanishes as 1/N. There is a certain tension betweenthis assertion and the fact that the mesons coupled to the gluino condensatehave masses which do not scale with N. To reconcile these facts we argue thatthere should exist additional soliton-like states with masses scaling as N. TheBPS walls must be "made" predominantly of these heavy states which are coupledto the gluino condensate stronger than the conventional mesons. The tension ofthe BPS wall junction scales as N^2, which serves as an additional argument infavor of the 1/N scaling of the wall width. The heavy states can be thought ofas solitons of the corresponding closed string theory. They are related tocertain fivebranes in the M-theory construction. We study the issue of the wallwidth in toy models which capture some features of supersymmetric gluodynamics.We speculate that special hadrons with mass scaling as N should also exist inthe large N limit of non-supersymmetric gluodynamics.
