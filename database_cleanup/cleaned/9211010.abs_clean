We review recent progresses in the study of factorized resonance scatteringS-matrices. The resonance amplitudes are introduced through a suitableanalytical continuation of the ADE Toda S-matrices. By using the thermodynamicBethe ansatz approach we are able to compute the ground state energy, whichdescribes a rich pattern of flows interpolating between the central charges ofthe coset models based on the ADE Lie algebras. We also present the simplestresonance ``$\phi^3$'' scattering model and discuss its relation with new flowsin non-unitary minimal models. Further generalizations are discussed in termsof certain asymptotic conditions in a family of ``resonance'' functionalhierarchies.
