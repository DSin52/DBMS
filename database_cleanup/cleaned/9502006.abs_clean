4-dimensional black hole is investigated at one-loop level, in the large masslimit of the black hole, making use of the conformal techniques related to theoptical metric. The quadratic and logarithmic divergences as well as a finitepart associated with the first quantum correction to the entropy are obtainedat a generic temperature. It is argued that, at the Hawking temperature, thehorizon divergences of the internal energy should cancel. Some comments on thedivergences of the entropy are also presented.
