In this paper we investigate the vacuum expectation values of energy-momentum tensor for conformally coupled scalar field in the standard parallelplate geometry with Dirichlet boundary conditions and on background of planardomain wall case. First we calculate the vacuum expectation values ofenergy-momentum tensor by using the mode sums, then we show that correspondingproperties can be obtained by using the conformal properties of the problem.The vacuum expectation values of energy-momentum tensor contains two termswhich come from the boundary conditions and the the gravitational background.In the Minkovskian limit our results agree with those obtained in [3].
