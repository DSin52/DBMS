In a recent essay, we discussed the possibility of using polymer sizing tomodel the collapse of a single, long excited string to a black hole. In thisletter, we apply this idea to bring further support to string/black holecorrespondence. In particular, we reproduce Horowitz and Polchinki's resultsfor self-gravitating fundamental strings and speculate on the nature of thequantum degrees of freedom of black holes in string theory.
