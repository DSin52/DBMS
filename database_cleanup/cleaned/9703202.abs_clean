In first-quantized string theory, spacetime symmetries are described by innerautomorphisms of the underlying conformal field theory. In this paper we usethis approach to illustrate the Higgs effect in string theory. We considerstring propagation on M^{24,1} \times S^1, where the circle has radius R, andstudy SU(2) symmetry breaking as R moves away from its critical value. We finda gauge-covariant equation of motion for the broken-symmetry gauge bosons andthe would-be Goldstone bosons. We show that the Goldstone bosons can beeliminated by an appropriate gauge transformation. In this unitary gauge, theGoldstone bosons become the longitudinal components of massive gauge bosons.
