We study the evolution of cosmic strings taking into account the frictionalforce due to the surrounding radiation. We consider small perturbations onstraight strings, oscillation of circular loops and small perturbations oncircular loops. For straight strings, friction exponentially suppressesperturbations whose co-moving scale crosses the horizon before cosmologicaltime $t_*\sim \mu^{-2}$ (in Planck units), where $\mu$ is the string tension.Loops with size much smaller than $t_*$ will be approximately circular at thetime when they start the relativistic collapse. We investigate the possibilitythat such loops will form black holes. We find that the number of black holeswhich are formed through this process is well bellow present observationallimits, so this does not give any lower or upper bounds on $\mu$. We alsoconsider the case of straight strings attached to walls and circular holes thatcan spontaneously nucleate on metastable domain walls.
