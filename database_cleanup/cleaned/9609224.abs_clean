Seminar On High Energy Physics Problems, Dubna, 2-7 September, 1996We discuss the bound states of the massive Thirring model. Here, the periodicboundary condition equations for the Bethe ansatz solutions are numericallysolved. It is found that the massive Thirring model has only one bound stateand the bound state spectrum as the function of the coupling constant agreeswith that of infinite momentum frame prescription by Fujita and Ogura. Bosonboson states (2p$-$2h states) appear only as the continuum spectrum withoutmaking any bound states.Further, the finite size correction to the vacuum energy is estimated. Theevaluated central charge is found to be close to unity.
