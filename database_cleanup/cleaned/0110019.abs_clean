Title: Moving D$_2$-brane in the Noncommutative Spacetime

Comments: 12 pages, Latex, no figure

In this paper we study the noncommutativity of a moving membrane withbackground fields. The open string variables are analyzed. Some scaling limitsare studied. The unitarity of the corresponding field theory is discussed. Theconditions for equivalence of noncommutativity of the $T$-dual theory in therest frame and noncommutativity of the original theory in the moving frame areobtained.
