We study aspects of gauge theory on tori which are a consequences of Moritaequivalence. In particular we study the behavior of gauge theory onnoncommutative tori for arbitrarily close rational values of Theta. For suchvalues of Theta, there are Morita equivalent descriptions in terms ofYang-Mills theories on commutative tori with very different magnetic fluxes andrank. In order for the correlators of open Wilson lines to depend smoothly onTheta, the correlators of closed Wilson lines in the commutative Yang-Millstheory must satisfy strong constraints. If exactly satisfied, these constraintsgive relations between small and large N gauge theories. We verify that theseconstraints are obeyed at leading order in the 1/N expansion of pure 2-d QCDand of strongly coupled N=4 super Yang-Mills theory.
