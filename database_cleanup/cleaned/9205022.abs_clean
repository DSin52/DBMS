In most attempts to compute the Hartle-Hawking ``wave function of thethe path integral is evaluated in a saddle point approximation, and only theleading (least action) extremum is taken into account. In (2+1)-dimensionalgravity with a negative cosmological constant, the second assumption is shownimportant single contribution to the path integral, topologically inequivalentinstantons with larger actions occur in great enough numbers to predominate.One can thus say that in 2+1 dimensions --- and possibly in 3+1 dimensions aswell --- entropy dominates action in the gravitational path integral.
