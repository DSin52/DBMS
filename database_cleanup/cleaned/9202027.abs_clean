The QHE is studied in the context of a CFT. An effective field of $N$``spins" associated with the cyclotron motion of particles is taken as an orderparameter from which an effective Hamiltonian may be defined. This effectiveHamiltonian describes the COM motion of the $N$ particles (with coupling$\kappa_0$) together with a current-current interaction (of strength$\kappa_1$). Such a system gives rise to a CFT in the large $N$ limit when$\kappa_0 = \kappa_1$. The Laughlin wavefunction is derived from this CFT as an$N'$-point correlation function of winding state vertex operators.
