We study supersymmetric intersecting configurations of D-branes with B-fieldbackgrounds. Noncommutative D-brane or M-brane pairs can intersectsupersymmetrically over (p-1)-brane, as well as over (p-2)-brane like ordinarybranes. d=10 and d=11 supergravity solutions are obtained and the supersymmetryprojection rule is examined. As an application we study a noncommutativeD7-brane probe in noncommutative D3-brane background, intersecting atnoncommutative plane, which describes BPS baryons of noncommutative gaugetheory in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence.
