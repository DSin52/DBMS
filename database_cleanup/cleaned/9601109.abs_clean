The supersymmetric action of type IIA D=10 superstring in N=2a, D=10supergravity background can be derived by double dimensional reduction of theaction of supermembrane coupled to D=11 supergravity. We demonstrate that thebackground Ramond-Ramond fields appear in the resulting superstring action withan extra factor of exponential of the dilaton.
