Authors: L. Bergamin and P. Minkowski

Comments: 20 pages, LaTeX, 1 figure. v2

general discussion of the topicWe introduce a new class of models describing dynamically brokensupersymmetric theories at low energies. Our approach is a directgeneralization of the known supersymmetric non-linear sigma models, but allowsin contrast to the latter the description of dynamical supersymmetry breakingby non-perturbative non-semiclassical effects. It is especially useful withinthe context of quantum effective actions and the associated concept of symmetrybreaking as a hysteresis effect.
