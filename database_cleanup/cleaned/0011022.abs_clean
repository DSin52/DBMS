For massless quenched QED in three dimensions, we evaluate a non-perturbativeexpression for the fermion propagator which agrees with its two loopperturbative expansion in the weak coupling regime. This calculation is carriedout by making use of the Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin transformations. Anyimproved construction of the fermion-boson vertex must make sure that thesolution of the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the fermion propagator reproducesthis result. For two different gauges, we plot the fermion propagator againstmomentum. We then make a comparison with a similar plot, using the earlierexpression for the fermion propagator, which takes into account only the oneloop result.
