We consider a generalized three-dimensional theory of gravity which isspecified by two fields, the graviton and the dilaton, and one parameter. Thistheory contains, as particular cases, three-dimensional General Relativity andthree-dimensional String Theory. Stationary black hole solutions are generatedfrom the static ones using a simple coordinate transformation. The stationaryblack holes solutions thus obtained are locally equivalent to the correspondingstatic ones, but globally distinct. The mass and angular momentum of thestationary black hole solutions are computed using an extension of the Reggeand Teitelboim formalism. The causal structure of the black holes isdescribed.
