There has been some controversies at the large $N$ behaviour of the 2DYang-Mills and chiral 2D Yang-Mills theories. To be more specific, is there aone parameter family of minima of the free energy in the strong region, or theminimum is unique. We show that there is a missed equation which, added to theknown equations, makes the minimum unique.
