Title: Infrared region of QCD and confining strings

Authors: R.Parthasarathy

Comments: 20 pages; LATEX file

Gauge field configurations appropriate for the infrared region of QCD areproposed in a submanifold of $su(3)$. Some properties of the submanifold arepresented. Using the usual action for QCD, in the absense of quarks,confinement of these configurations is realized as in the London theory ofMeissner effect. Choosing a representation for the monopole field strength, astring action corresponding to the effective gauge theory action in theinfrared region, is obtained. This confining string action contains theNambu-Goto term, extrinsic curvature action and the Euler characteristic of thestring world sheet.
