Recently, the free energy of the target space mean field (TSMF) matrix modelhas been calculated in the low temperature phase, order-by-order in a lowtemperature expansion. The TSMF model is a matrix model whose discrete targetspace has an infinite coordination number, and whose free energy assumes auniversal form, corresponding to baby universes joined into a tree. Here thefree energy is summed to all orders, and expressed through a transcendentalalgebraic equation, using which we analyze the critical phenomena that occur inthe TSMF model. There are two critical curves, at which the matter and thegeometry become critical, and for which the critical exponents are alpha = 1/2and gamma_str = -1/2, respectively. There is a bicritical point where thecurves meet, at which gamma_str = +1/3.
