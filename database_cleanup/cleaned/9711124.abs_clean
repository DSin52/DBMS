We study D-branes on three-dimensional orbifold backgrounds that admittopologically distinct resolutions differing by flop transitions. We show thatthese distinct phases are part of the vacuum moduli space of the superYang-Mills gauge theory describing the D-brane dynamics. In this way weestablish that D-branes --- like fundamental strings --- allow for physicallysmooth topology changing transitions.
