We show that the Kazakov-Migdal (K-M) induced gauge model in $d$ dimensionsdescribes the high temperature limit of ordinary lattice gauge theories in$d+1$ dimensions. The matter fields are related to the Polyakov loops, whilethe spatial gauge variables become the gauge fields of the K-M model. Thisinterpretation of the K-M model is in agreement with some recent results inhigh temperature lattice QCD.
