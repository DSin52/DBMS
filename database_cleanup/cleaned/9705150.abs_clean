N=2 supersymmetric quantum black holes in the heterotic S-T-U model arepresented. In particular three classes of axion-free quantum black holes withhalf the N=2, D=4 supersymmetries unbroken are considered. First, these quantumblack holes are investigated at generic points in moduli space. Then linearizednon-abelian black holes are investigated representing a subset of non-abelianblack hole solutions at critical points of perturbative gauge symmetryenhancement in moduli space. It is shown that the entropy of linearizednon-abelian black holes can be obtained, starting at non-critical points inmoduli space, by continuous variation of the moduli and a proper identificationof the non-abelian charges.
