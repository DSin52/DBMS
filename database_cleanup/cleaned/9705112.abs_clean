Title: Intermediate Volumes and the Role of Instantons

Comments: 7p LaTeX, 3 figs. Talk at the workshop "New non-perturbative methods

and quantization on the light cone", Les Houches, 24 Feb-7 March, 1997We review recent results for the low-lying glueball spectrum on thethree-sphere in intermediate volumes that incorporate instanton effects. Thelatter are implemented through boundary conditions on the fundamental domainobtained by minimising the norm of the gauge field along the gauge orbit.Non-perturbative corrections due to the boundary conditions in field space areseen to be crucial.
