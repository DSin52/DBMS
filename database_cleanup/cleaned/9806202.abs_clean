Recently proposed by Hwang, Marnelius and Saltsidis zeta regularization ofbasic commutators in string theories is generalized to the string models withnon-trivial vacuums. It is shown that implementation of this regularizationimplies the cancellation of dangerous terms in the commutators between Virasorogenerators, which break Jacobi identity.
