We investigate a near-horizon geometry of NS5-branes wrapping on a Riemannsurface, which asymptotically approaches to linear dilaton backgrounds. Weconcretely find a fully localized solution of the near-horizon geometry ofintersecting NS5-branes. We also discuss a relation to a description ofLandau-Ginzburg theories.
