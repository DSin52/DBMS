Title: Four-Dimensional N=1 Super Yang-Mills Theory from an M-Theory Orbifold

Authors: Charles F. Doran, Michael Faux and Burt A. Ovrut

Comments: Explanatory paragraph/footnote added to introduction

Gravitational and gauge anomalies provide stringent constraints on whichsubset of chiral models can effectively describe M-theory at low energy. Inthis paper, we explicitly construct an abelian orbifold of M-theory to obtainan N=1, chiral super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions, using anomalymatching to determine the entire gauge and representation structure. The modeldescribed in this paper is the simplest four dimensional model which one canconstruct from M-theory compactified on an abelian orbifold withoutfreely-acting involutions. The gauge group is SO(12) x SU(8) x SU(2) x SU(2) xU(1).
