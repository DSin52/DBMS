We compute the boundary entropies for the allowed boundary conditions of theSU(2)-invariant principal chiral model at level k=1. We used the reflectionfactors determined in a previous work. As a by-product we obtain somemiscellaneous results such as the ground-state energy for mixed boundaryconditions as well as the degeneracies of the Kondo model in the underscreenedand exactly screened cases. All these computations are in perfect agreementwith known results.
