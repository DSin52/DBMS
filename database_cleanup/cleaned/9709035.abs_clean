For background gauge field configurations reducible to the form Amu = (A3,A(x)) where A3 is a constant, we provide an elementary derivation of therecently obtained result for the exact induced Chern-Simons (CS) effectiveaction in QED3 at finite temperature. The method allows us to extend the resultin the Dorey-Mavromatos model of parity-conserving planar superconductivity,thereby justifying their argument for flux quantization in the model; to theinduced CS term for a tau-dependent flux; and to the term of second order inA(x) (and all orders in A3) in the effective action.
