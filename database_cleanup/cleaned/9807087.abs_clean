We study relations between some topics in number theory and supersymmetricblack holes. These relations are based on the ``attractor mechanism'' of N=2supergravity. In IIB string compactification this mechanism singles out certain``attractor varieties.'' We show that these attractor varieties are constructedfrom products of elliptic curves with complex multiplication for N=4 and N=8compactifications. The heterotic dual theories are related to rationalconformal field theories. In the case of N=4 theories U-duality inequivalentbackgrounds with the same horizon area are counted by the class number of aquadratic imaginary field. The attractor varieties are defined over fieldsclosely related to class fields of the quadratic imaginary field. We discusssome extensions to more general Calabi-Yau compactifications and explorefurther connections to arithmetic including connections to Kronecker'sJugendtraum and the theory of modular heights. The paper also includes a shortreview of the attractor mechanism. A much shorter version of the papersummarizing the main points is the companion note entitled ``Attractors andArithmetic'' (hep-th/9807056).
