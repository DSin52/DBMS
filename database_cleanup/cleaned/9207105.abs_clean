If an evaporating black hole does not settle down to a non radiating remnant,a description by a semi classical Lorentz metric must contain either a nakedsingularity or what we call a thunderbolt, a singularity that spreads out toinfinity on a spacelike or null path. We investigate this question in thecontext of various two dimensional models that have been proposed. We find thatif the semi classical equations have an extra symmetry that make them solvablein closed form, they seem to predict naked singularities but numericalcalculations indicate that more general semi classical equations, such as theoriginal CGHS ones give rise to thunderbolts. We therefore expect that the semiclassical approximation in four dimensions will lead to thunderbolts. Weinterpret the prediction of thunderbolts as indicating that the semi classicalapproximation breaks down at the end point of black hole evaporation, and wewould expect that a full quantum treatment would replace the thunderbolt with aburst of high energy particles. The energy in such a burst would be too smallto account for the observed gamma ray bursts.
