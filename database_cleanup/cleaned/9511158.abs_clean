We discuss a relation between two-loop bosonic worldline Green functionswhich are obtained by Schmidt and Schubert in two different parametrizations ofa two-loop worldline. These Green functions are transformed into each other bysome transformation rules based on reparametrizations of the proper time andworldline modular parameters.
