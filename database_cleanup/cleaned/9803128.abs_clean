A canonical realization of the BMS (Bondi-Metzner-Sachs) algebra is given onthe phase space of the classical real Klein-Gordon field .By assuming the finiteness of the generators of the Poincar\'e group, it isshown that a countable set of conserved quantities exists (supertranslations);this set transforms under a particular Lorentz representation, which isuniquely determined by the requirement of having an invariant four-dimensionalsubspace, which corresponds to the Poincar\'e translations. This Lorentzrepresentation is infinite-dimensional, non unitary, reducible andindecomposable. Its representation space is studied in some detail. Itdetermines the structure constants of the infinite-dimensional canonicalalgebra of the Poincar\'e generators together with the infinite set of the newconserved quantities.It is shown that this algebra is isomorphic with that of the BMS group.
