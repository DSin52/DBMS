We study the dynamical symmetry algebra of the N-body Calogero modeldescribing the structure of degenerate levels and demonstrate that the algebrais intrisically polynomial. We discuss some general properties of an algebra ofS_N-symmetric operators acting on the S_N-symmetric subspace of the Fock spacefor any statistical parameter \nu. In the bosonic case (\nu=0) we find thealgebra of generators for every N. For \nu\neq 0, we explicitly reproduce thefinite algebra for the 4-particle model, demonstrating some general features ofour construction.
