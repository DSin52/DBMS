We present a version of ten-dimensional IIA supergravity containing a 9-formpotential for which the field equations are equivalent to those of thestandard, massless, IIA theory for vanishing 10-form field strength, $F_{10}$,and to those of the `massive' IIA theory for non-vanishing $F_{10}$. We exhibita multi 8-brane solution of this theory which preserves half the supersymmetry.We propose this solution as the effective field theory realization of theDirichlet 8-brane of type IIA superstring theory.
