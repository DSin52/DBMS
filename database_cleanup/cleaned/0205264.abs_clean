The space of couplings of a given theory is the arena of interest in thisarticle. Equipped with a metric ansatz akin to the Fisher information matrix inthe space of parameters in statistics (similar metrics in physics are theZamolodchikov metric or the O'Connor--Stephens metric) we investigate thegeometry of theory space through a study of specific examples. We then lookinto renormalisation group flows in theory space and make an attempt tocharacterise such flows via its isotropic expansion, rotation and shear.Consequences arising from the evolution equation for the isotropic expansionare discussed. We conclude by pointing out generalisations and pose some openquestions.
