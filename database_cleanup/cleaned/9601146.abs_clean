Using a numerical implementation of the ADHMN construction, we compute thefields and energy densities of a charge three monopole with tetrahedralsymmetry and a charge four monopole with octahedral symmetry. We then constructa one parameter family of spectral curves and Nahm data which represent chargefour monopoles with tetrahedral symmetry, which includes the monopole withoctahedral symmetry as a special case. In the moduli space approximation, thisfamily describes a novel kind of four monopole scattering and we use ournumerical scheme to construct the energy density at various times during themotion.
