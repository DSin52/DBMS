Title: Solvable Models in Two-Dimensional N=2 Theories

Comments: 20 pages (LaTeX), Contribution to the Proceedings of ``Statistical

Mechanics and Quantum Field Theory'', May 94, USCN=2 supersymmetric field theories in two dimensions have been extensivelystudied in the last few years. Many of their properties can be determined alongthe whole renormalization group flow, like their coupling dependence andsoliton spectra. We discuss here several models which can be solved completely,when the number of superfields is taken to be large, by studying theirtopological-antitopological fusion equations. These models are the CPN model,sigma models on Grassmannian manifolds, and certain perturbed $N=2$ Minimalmodel.
