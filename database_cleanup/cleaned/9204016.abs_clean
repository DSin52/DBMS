We deduce the $sl_{3}$ Toda realization of classical $W_3$ symmetry on twoscalar fields in a geometric way, proceeding from a nonlinear realization ofsome associate higher-spin symmetry $W_{3}^{\infty}$. The Toda equations arerecognized as the constraints singling out a two-dimensional fully geodesicsubspace in the initial coset space of $W_{3}^{\infty}$. The proposed geometricapproach can be extended to other nonlinear algebras and integrable systems.
