The electroweak phase transition in the magnetic and hypermagnetic fields isstudied in the Standard Model on the base of investigation of symmetrybehaviour within the consistent effective potential of the scalar and magneticfields at finite temperature. It includes the one-loop and daisy diagramcontributions. All discovered fundamental fermions and bosons are taken intoconsideration with their actual masses. The Higgs boson mass is chosen to be inthe energy interval 75 GeV $\le m_H \le$ 115 GeV. The effective potentialcalculated is real at sufficiently high temperatures due to mutual cancellationof the imaginary terms entering the one-loop and the daisy diagram parts.Symmetry behaviour shows that neither the magnetic nor the hypermagnetic fielddoes not produce the sufficiently strong first order phase transition. For thefield strengths $H, H_Y$ $\ge 10^{23}$ G the electroweak phase transition is ofsecond order at all. Therefore, baryogenesis does not survive in the StandardModel in smooth magnetic fields. The problems on generation of the fields athigh temperature and their stabilization are also discussed in a consistentway. In particular, it is determined that the nonabelian component of themagnetic field $ (gH)^{1/2} \sim g^{4/3}T$ has to be produced spontaneously. Toinvestigate the stability problem the $W$-boson mass operator in the magneticfield at high temperature is calculated in one-loop approximation. Thecomparison with results obtained in other approaches is done.
