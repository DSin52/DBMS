We show that all supersymmetric Type IIA D-branes can be constructed as boundstates of a certain number of unstable non-supersymmetric Type IIA D9-branes.This string-theoretical construction demonstrates that D-brane charges in TypeIIA theory on spacetime manifold $X$ are classified by the higher K-theorygroup $K^{-1}(X)$, as suggested recently by Witten. In particular, the systemof $N$ D0-branes can be obtained, for any $N$, in terms of sixteen Type IIAD9-branes. This suggests that the dynamics of Matrix theory is contained in thephysics of magnetic vortices on the worldvolume of sixteen unstable D9-branes,described at low energies by a U(16) gauge theory.
