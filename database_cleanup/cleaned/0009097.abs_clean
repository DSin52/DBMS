The use of the mass term of the gauge field as a gauge fixing term, which wasdiscussed by Zwanziger, Parrinello and Jona-Lasinio in a large mass limit, isrelated to the non-linear gauge by Dirac and Nambu. We have recently shown thatthis use of the mass term as a gauge fixing term is in fact identical to theconventional local Faddeev-Popov formula without taking a large mass limit, ifone takes into account the variation of the gauge field along the entire gaugeorbit. This suggests that the classical massive vector theory, for example,could be re-interpreted as a gauge invariant theory with a gauge fixing termadded in suitably quantized theory.As for massive gauge particles, the Higgs mechanics, where the mass term isgauge invariant, has a more intrinsic meaning. We comment on severalimplications of this observation.
