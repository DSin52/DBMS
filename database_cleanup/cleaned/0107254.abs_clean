Properties of the domain wall (kink) solution in the 5 dimensionalRandall-Sundrum model are examined both {\it analytically} and {\itnumerically}. The configuration is derived by the bulk Higgs mechanism. Wefocus on 1) the convergence property of the solution, 2) the stableness of thesolution, 3) the non-singular property of the Riemann curvature, 4) thebehaviours of the warp factor and the Higgs field. It is found that the bulkcurvature changes the sign around the surface of the wall. We also present somecosmological term dominated case. Both solutions have the (naked) curvaturesingularity. We can regard the domain wall solution as a singularity resolutionof the exact solutions.
