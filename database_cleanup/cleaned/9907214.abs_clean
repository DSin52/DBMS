We consider the N=2 supersymmetric Born-Infeld action and compute one-loopdivergences quantizing the theory in N=1 superspace. We find that in thepresence of non constant curvature the theory is not renormalizable. Thestructure of the $(\alpha')^4$ counterterm, proportional to derivatives of thecurvature, is consistent with effective action calculations from superstringtheory.
