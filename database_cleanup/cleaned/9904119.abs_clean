A family of connections on the space of couplings for a renormalizable fieldtheory is defined. The connections are obtained from a Levi-Civita connection,for a metric which is a generalisation of the Zamolodchikov metric in twodimensions, by adding a family of tensors which are solutions of therenormalization group equation for the operator product expansionco-efficients. The connections are torsion free, but not metric compatible ingeneral. The renormalization group flows of N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Millstheory in four dimensions and the O(N)-model in three dimensions, in the large$N$ limit, are analysed in terms of parallel transport under these connections.
