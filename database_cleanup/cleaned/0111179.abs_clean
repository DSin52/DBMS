We summarize some recent progress in constructing four-dimensionalsupersymmetric chiral models from Type II orientifolds. We present theconstruction a supersymmetric Standard-like Model and a supersymmetric GUTmodel to illustrate the new features of this approach and its connection to Mtheory on compact, singular G_2 holonomy spaces. The Standard-like modelpresented is the first example of a three-family supersymmetic orientifoldmodel with the Standard Model as part of the gauge structure. We also discussthe connection of how chiral fermions arise in this class of models with recentresults of M theory compactified on G_2 holonomy spaces.
