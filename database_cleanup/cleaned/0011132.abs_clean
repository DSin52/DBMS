An algebraic method is used to work out the mass spectra and symmetrybreaking patterns of general vacuum states in N=2 supersymmetric SU(n)Chern-Simons-Higgs systems with the matter fields being in the adjointrepresentation. The approach provides with us a natural basis for fields, whichwill be useful for further studies in the self-dual solutions and quantumcorrections. As the vacuum states satisfy the SU(2) algebra, it is notsurprising to find that their spectra are closely related to that of angularmomentum addition in quantum mechanics. The analysis can be easily generalizedto other classical Lie groups.
