In the framework of heterotic M-theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold'times' an interval, the relation between geometry and four-flux is derived{\it beyond first order}. Besides the case with general flux which cannot bedescribed by a warped geometry one is naturally led to consider two specialtypes of four-flux in detail. One choice shows how the M-theory relationbetween warped geometry and flux reproduces the analogous one of the weaklycoupled heterotic string with torsion. The other one leads to a {\it quadratic}dependence of the Calabi-Yau volume with respect to the orbifold directionwhich avoids the problem with negative volume of the first order approximation.As in the first order analysis we still find that Newton's Constant is boundedfrom below at just the phenomenologically relevant value. However, the bounddoes not require an {\it ad hoc} truncation of the orbifold-size any longer.Finally we demonstrate explicitly that to leading order in $\kappa^{2/3}$ noCosmological Constant is induced in the four-dimensional low-energy action.This is in accord with what one can expect from supersymmetry.
