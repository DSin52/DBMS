The leading and the subleading Landau singularities in affine Toda fieldtheories are examined in some detail. Formulae describing the subleading simplepole structure of box diagrams are given explicitly. This leads to a new andnontrivial test of the conjectured exact S-matrices for these theories. We showthat to the one-loop level the conjectured S-matrices of the $A_n$ Toda familyreproduce the correct singularity structure, leading as well as subleading, ofthe field theoretical amplitudes. The present test has the merit of beingindependent of the details of the renormalisations.
