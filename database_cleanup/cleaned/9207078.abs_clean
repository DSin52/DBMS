The ring structure of Lian-Zuckerman states for $(q,p)$ minimal modelscoupled to gravity is shown to be ${\cal R}={\cal R}_0\otimes {\bf C}[w,w^{-1}]$ where ${\cal R}_0$ is the ring of ghost number zero operatorsgenerated by two elements and $w$ is an operator of ghost number $-1$. Someexamples are discussed in detail. For these models the currents are alsodiscussed and their algebra is shown to contain the Virasoro algebra.
