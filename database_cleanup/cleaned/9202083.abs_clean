Title: The General Class of String Theories on Orbifolds

Authors: Makoto Sakamoto and Masayoshi Tabuse

Comments: 35 pages

We investigate the following three consistency conditions for constructingunder twist operators, ii) the duality of amplitudes and iii) modularinvariance of partition functions. It is shown that this investigation makes itpossible to obtain the general class of consistent orbifold models, whichincludes a new class of orbifold models.
