A. Contains new results. 24 pages, Plain Tex, uses phyzzx as input fileAiming towards understanding the question of the discrete states in thelight-cone gauge in the theory of two-dimensional strings with a linearbackground charge term, we study the path-integral formulation of the theory.In particular, by gauge fixing Polyakov's path-integral expression for the 2-dstrings, we show that the light-cone gauge-fixed generating functional is thesame as the conformal gauge-fixed one and is critical for the same value of thebackground charge (Q=2 $\sqrt 2 $). Since the equivalence is shown at thegenerating functional level, one expects that the spectra of the two theoriesare the same. The zero modes of the ratio of the determinants are brieflyanalyzed and it is shown that only the constant mode survives in thisformulation. This is an indication that the discrete states may lie in thesezero modes. This result is not particular to the light-cone gauge, but it holdsfor the conformal gauge as well.
