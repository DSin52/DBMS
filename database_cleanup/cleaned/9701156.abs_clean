A scaling hypothesis for the n-particle spectral densities of the O(3)nonlinear sigma-model is described. It states that for large particle numbersthe n-particle spectral densities are ``self-similar'' in being basicallyrescaled copies of a universal shape function. This can be viewed as a2-dimensional, but non-perturbative analogue of the KNO scaling in QCD.Promoted to a working hypothesis, it allows one to compute the two pointfunctions at ``all'' energy or length scales. In addition, the values of twonon-perturbative constants (needed for a parameter-free matching of theperturbative and the non-perturbative regime) are determined exactly.
