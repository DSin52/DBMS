The method of analytic continuation is used to find exact integral equationsfor a selection of finite-volume energy levels for the non-unitary minimalmodels $M_{2,2N+3}$ perturbed by their $\varphi_{13}$ operators. The N=2 caseis studied in particular detail. Along the way, we find a number of generalresults which should be relevant to the study of excited states in othermodels.
