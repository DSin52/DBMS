The non-commutative version of the euclidean $g^2\phi^4$ theory isconsidered. By using Wilsonian flow equations the ultraviolet renormalizabilitycan be proved to all orders in perturbation theory. On the other hand, theinfrared sector cannot be treated perturbatively and requires a resummation ofthe leading divergencies in the two-point function. This is analogous to whatis done in the Hard Thermal Loops resummation of finite temperature fieldtheory. Next-to-leading order corrections to the self-energy are computed,resulting in $O(g^3)$ contributions in the massless case, and $O(g^6\log g^2)$in the massive one.
