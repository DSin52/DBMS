Exploiting Virasoro constraints on the effective finite-volume partitionfunction, we derive generalized Leutwyler-Smilga spectral sum rules of theDirac operator to high order. By introducing $N_v$ fermion species of equalmasses, we next use the Virasoro constraints to compute two (low-mass andlarge-mass) expansions of the partially quenched chiral condensate through thereplica method of letting $N_v \to 0$. The low-mass expansion can only bepushed to a certain finite order due to de Wit-'t Hooft poles, but thelarge-mass expansion can be carried through to arbitrarily high order. Resultsagree exactly with earlier results obtained through both Random Matrix Theoryand the supersymmetric method.
