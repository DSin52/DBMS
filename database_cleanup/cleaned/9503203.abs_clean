Title: Curiosities on Free Fock Spaces

Comments: 9 pages, plain TeX, no figures

We consider some curious aspects of single-species free Fock spaces, such asnovel bosonization and fermionization formulae and relations to variousphysical properties of bosonic particles. We comment on generalizations ofthese properties to physically more interesting many-species free Fock spaces.
