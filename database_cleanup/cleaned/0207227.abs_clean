Given the path of a point particle, one can relate its acceleration and, ingeneral, its kinematics to the curvature scalars of its trajectory. Using this,a general Ansatz is made for the Yang Mills connection corresponding to anon-Abelian point source. The Yang Mills field equations are then solvedoutside the position of the point source under physically reasonableconstraints such as finite total energy flux and finite total color charge. Thesolutions contain the Trautman solution; moreover two of them are exact whereasone of them is found using a series expansion in 1/R, where R is the retardeddistance. These solutions are new and, in their most general form, are notgauge equivalent to the original Trautman solution.
