Recent understanding of {\cal N}=1* supersymmetric theory (mass deformed{\cal N}=4) has made it possible to find an exact superpotential which encodesthe properties of the different phases of the theory. We consider thissuperpotential as an illustrative example for the source of a nontrivial scalarpotential for the string theory dilaton and study its properties. Thesuperpotential is characterized by the rank of the corresponding gauge group(N) and integers p,q,k labelling the different massive phases of the theory.For generic values of these parameters, we find the expected runaway behaviourof the potential to vanishing string coupling. But there are alsosupersymmetric minima at weak coupling stabilizing the dilaton field. Aninteresting property of this potential is that there is a proliferation ofsupersymmetric vacua in the confining phases, with the number of vacuaincreasing with N and leading to a kind of staircase potential. For a range ofparameters, it is possible to obtain realistic values for the gauge coupling.
