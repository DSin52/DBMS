We investigate the geometry of the moduli spaces of dual electric andmagnetic N=1 supersymmetric field theories. Using the SU(N_c) gauge group as aguideline we show that the electric and magnetic moduli spaces coincide for asuitable choice of the Kahler potential of the magnetic theory. We analyse theKahler structure of the dual moduli spaces.
