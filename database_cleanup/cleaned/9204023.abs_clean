Title: Superfield Realizations of $N=2$ Super-$W_3$

Authors: E.Ivanov and S.Krivonos

Comments: 8 pages

We present a manifestly $N=2$ supersymmetric formulation of $N=2$ super-$W_3$algebra (its classical version) in terms of the spin 1 and spin 2supercurrents. Two closely related types of the Feigin-Fuchs representation forgenerating $N=2$ extended $U(1)$ Kac-Moody algebras and via two free chiralspin 0 superfields. We also construct a one-parameter family of $N=2$ superBoussinesq equations for which $N=2$ super-$W_3$ provides the secondhamiltonian structure.
