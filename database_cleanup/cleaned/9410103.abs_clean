The Hamiltonian actions for extreme and non-extreme black holes are comparedand contrasted and a simple derivation of the lack of entropy of extreme blackholes is given. In the non-extreme case the wave function of the black holedepends on horizon degrees of freedom which give rise to the entropy. Thoseadditional degrees of freedom are absent in the extreme case.
