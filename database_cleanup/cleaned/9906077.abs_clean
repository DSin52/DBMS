The complete solution to the massive Rarita-Schwinger field equation inanti-de Sitter space is constructed, and used in the AdS/CFT correspondence tocalculate the correlators for the boundary conformal field theory. It is foundthat when no condition is imposed on the field solution, there appear twodifferent boundary conformal field operators, one coupling to aRarita-Schwinger field and the other to a Dirac field. These two operators areseen to have different scaling dimensions, with that of the spinor-coupledoperator exhibiting non-analytic mass dependence.
