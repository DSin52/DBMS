We derive the basic correlation functions of twist fields coming fromarbitrary twisted sectors in symmetric $Z_N$ orbifold conformal field theories,keeping all the admissible marginal perturbations, in particular thosecorresponding to the antisymmetric tensor background field. This allows athorough investigation of modular symmetries in this type of stringcompactification. Such a study is explicitly carried out for the groupgenerated by duality transformations. Thus, apart from being ofphenomenological use, our couplings are also interesting from the mathematicalpoint of view as they represent automorphic functions for a large class ofdiscrete groups.
