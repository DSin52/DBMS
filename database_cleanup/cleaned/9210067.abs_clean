two dimensionsAuthors: J. Hietarinta

Comments: 4 pages, LaTeX

We describe how the complete solution to the two-dimensional constant quantumYang-Baxter equation [J. Hietarinta, Phys. Lett. A165,245(1992)] was found.(Talk presented at the XIX International Colloquium on Group TheoreticalMethods in Physics.)
