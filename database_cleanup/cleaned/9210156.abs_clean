This TASI lecture covers the material in hep-th/9205026. It reviewed thetheory of effective strings, with particular emphasis on the manner in whichLorentz invariance is represented. The quantum properties of an example of aneffective string are derived from the underlying field theory. A comparison ismade with what one would expect if one assumed that quantum effective stringswere governed by fundamental string actions such as the Nambu-Goto or thePolyakov actions. It is shown that the requirements on dimensions forconsistent quantizations of fundamental strings imply no contradictions foreffective strings.
