Title: Brane-like States in Superstring Theory and the Dynamics of non-Abelian

Gauge TheoriesComments: 16 pages, TeX

We propose a string-theoretic ansatz describing the dynamics of SU(N)Yang-Mills theories in the limit of large N in D=4. The construction uses in acrucial way open-string vertex operators that describe non-perturbative branedynamics. According to our proposal, various gauge theories are described bystring theories with the same action, but with different measures in thefunctional integral. The choice of measure defines the gauge group, as well asthe effective space-time dimension of the resulting gauge theory.
