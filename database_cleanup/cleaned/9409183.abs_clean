We quantize the self-dual massive theory by using the Batalin-TyutinHamiltonian method, which systematically embeds second class constraint systeminto first class one in the extended phase space by introducing the new fields.Through this analysis we obtain simultaneously the St\"uckelberg scalar termrelated to the explicit gauge-breaking effect and the new type of Wess-Zuminoaction related to the Chern-Simons term.
