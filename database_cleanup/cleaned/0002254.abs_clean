Using the local potential approximation of the exact renormalization group(RG) equation, we show the various domains of values of the parameters of theO(1)-symmetric scalar Hamiltonian. In three dimensions, in addition to theusual critical surface $S_{c}$ (attraction domain of the Wilson-Fisher fixedpoint), we explicitly show the existence of a first-order phase transitiondomain $S_{f}$ separated from $S_{c}$ by the tricritical surface $S_{t}$(attraction domain of the Gaussian fixed point). $S_{f}$ and $S_{c}$ are twodistinct domains of repulsion for the Gaussian fixed point, but $S_{f}$ is notthe basin of attraction of a fixed point. $S_{f}$ is characterized by anendless renormalized trajectory lying entirely in the domain of negative valuesof the $\phi ^{4}$-coupling. This renormalized trajectory exists also in fourdimensions making the Gaussian fixed point ultra-violet stable (and the$\phi_{4}^{4}$ renormalized field theory asymptotically free but with a wrongsign of the perfect action). We also show that very retarded classical-to-Isingcrossover may exist in three dimensions (in fact below four dimensions). Thiscould be an explanation of the unexpected classical critical behavior observedin some ionic systems.
