We address the conjecture that at the tachyonic vacuum open strings gettransformed into closed strings. We show that it is possible in the context ofboundary string field theory to interpolate between the conventional openstring theory, characterized by having the D25 brane as the boundary state, andan off-shell (open) string theory where the boundary state is identified withthe closed string vacuum, where holomorphic and antiholomorphic modes decoupleand where bulk vertex operator correlation functions are identical to those ofthe closed string.
