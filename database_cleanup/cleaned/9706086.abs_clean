We consider the XXZ model in the infinite volume limit with spin half quantumspace and higher spin auxiliary space. Using perturbation theory arguments, werelate the half infinite transfer matrices of this class of models to certain$U_q(\hat{sl_2})$ intertwiners introduced by Nakayashiki. We construct themonodromy matrices, and show that the one with spin one auxiliary space givesrise to the L operator.
