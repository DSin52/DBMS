New recent results in supersymmetric gauge theories based on holomorphy andsymmetry considerations are extended to the case where the gauge couplingconstant is given by the real part of a chiral superfield. We assume here thatits dynamics can be described by an effective quantum field theory. Then itsvacuum expectation value is a function of the other coupling constants, viewedas chiral background superfields. This functional dependence can be determinedexactly and satisfies highly non-trivial consistency checks.
