The infrared dynamics in the (3+1)-dimensional supersymmetric andnon-supersymmetric Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in a constant magnetic field isstudied. While at strong coupling the dynamics in these two models isessentially different, it is shown that the models become equivalent at weakcoupling. In particular, at weak coupling, as the strength of the magneticfield goes to infinity, both the supersymmetric and non-supersymmetricNambu-Jona-Lasinio models are reduced to a continuum set of independent(1+1)-dimensional Gross-Neveu models, labeled by the coordinates in the planeperpendicular to the magnetic field. The relevance of these results forcosmological models based on supersymmetric dynamics is pointed out.
