International Symposium `Quantum Theory and Symmetries' (Goslar, 18-22 July1999), H.-D. Doebner, V.K. Dobrev, J.-D. Hennig and W. Luecke, edsThe foundations of time asymmetric quantum theory are reviewed and areapplied to the construction of relativistic Gamow vectors. Relativistic Gamowvectors are obtained from the resonance pole of the S-matrix and furnish anirreducible representation of the Poincare' semigroup. They have all theproperties needed to represent relativistic quasistable particles and can beused to fix the definition of mass and width of relativistic resonances likethe Z-boson. Most remarkably, they have only a semigroup time evolution intothe forward light cone---expressing time asymmetry on the microphysical level.
