A new approach to the quantization of the relativistic kink - model aroundthe solitonic solution is developed on the ground of the collective coordinatesmethod. The corresponding effective action is proved to be the action of thenonminimal $d=1+1$ point - particle with curvature. It is shown that uponcanonical quantization this action yields the spectrum of kink - solutionobtained firstly with the help of the WKB - quantization.
