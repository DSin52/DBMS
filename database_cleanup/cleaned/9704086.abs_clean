Title: A Proposal for the Wrapped Transverse Five Brane in M(atrix) Theory

Comments: 7 pages in phyzzx

We propose a state in 5+1 super Yang-Mills theory which corresponds to thewrapped transverse five brane of M(atrix) theory on $T^5$. This state is amagnetic flux quantized in units of $1/g_6^2$ through a plane defined by oneside of the box and a new direction which is not manifest.
