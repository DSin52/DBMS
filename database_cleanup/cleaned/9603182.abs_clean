We compute the exact string vacuum backgrounds corresponding to thenon-compact coset theory $SU(2,1)/SU(2)$. The conformal field theory defined bythe level $k= 4$ results in a five dimensional singular solution thatfactorizes in an asymptotic region as the linear dilaton solution and a $S^3$model. It presents two abelian compact isometries that allow to reinterpretingit from a four dimensional point of view as a stationary and magneticallycharged space-time resembling in some aspects the Kerr-Newman solution ofgeneral relativity. The $k=\frac{13}{7}$ theory on the other hand describes acosmological solution that interpolates between a singular phase at short timesand a $S^1 \times S^2$ universe after some planckian times.
