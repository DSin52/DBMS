An exact representation of the Euclidean fermion determinant in twodimensions for centrally symmetric, finite-ranged Abelian background fields isderived. Input data are the wave function inside the field's range and thescattering phase shift with their momenta rotated to the positive imaginaryaxis and fixed at the fermion mass for each partial-wave. The determinant'sasymptotic limit for strong coupling and small fermion mass forsquare-integrable, unidirecitonal magnetic fields is shown to depend only onthe chiral anomaly. The concept of duality is extended from one to two-variablefields, thereby relating the two-dimensional Euclidean determinant for a classof background magnetic fields to the pair production probability in fourdimensions for a related class of electric pulses. Additionally, the``diamagnetic'' bound on the two-dimensional Euclidean determinant is relatedto the negative sign of dImS_eff/dm^2 in four dimensions in the strongcoupling, small mass limit, where S_eff is the one-loop effective action.
