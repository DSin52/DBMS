Quantum mechanical potentials satisfying the property of shape invariance arewell known to be algebraically solvable. Using a scaling ansatz for the changeof parameters, we obtain a large class of new shape invariant potentials whichare reflectionless and possess an infinite number of bound states. They can beviewed as q-deformations of the single soliton solution corresponding to theRosen-Morse potential. Explicit expressions for energy eigenvalues,eigenfunctions and transmission coefficients are given. Included in ourpotentials as a special case is the self-similar potential recently discussedby Shabat and Spiridonov.
