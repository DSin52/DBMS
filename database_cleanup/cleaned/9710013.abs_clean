When an asymptotically non-free theory possesses a mass parameter, theultraviolet (UV) renormalon gives rise to non-perturbative contributions todimension-four operators and dimensionless couplings, thus has a similar effectas the instanton. We illustrate this phenomenon in O(N) symmetric massive$\lambda\phi^4$ model in the $1/N$ expansion. This effect of UV renormalon isbriefly compared with non-perturbative corrections in the magnetic picture ofthe Seiberg-Witten theory.
