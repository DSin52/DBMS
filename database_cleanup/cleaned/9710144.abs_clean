Making use of the duality transformation, we derive in the Londons' limit ofthe Abelian Higgs Model string representation for the 't Hooft loop averagedefined on the string world-sheet, which yields the values of two coefficientfunctions parametrizing the bilocal correlator of the dual field strengthtensors. The asymptotic behaviours of these functions agree with the onesobtained within the Method of Vacuum Correlators in QCD in the lowest order ofperturbation theory. We demonstrate that the bilocal approximation to theMethod of Vacuum Correlators is an exact result in the Londons' limit, i.e. allthe higher cumulants in this limit vanish. We also show that at largedistances, apart from the integration over metrics, the obtained stringeffective theory (which in this case reduces to the nonlinear massive axionicsigma model) coincides with the low-energy limit of the dual version of 4Dcompact QED, the so-called Universal Confining String Theory. We derive stringtension of the Nambu-Goto term and the coupling constant of the rigidity termfor the obtained string effective theory and demonstrate that the latter one isalways negative, which means the stability of strings, while the positivenessof the former is confirmed by the present lattice data. These data enable us tofind the Higgs boson charge and the vacuum expectation value of the Higgsfield, which model QCD best of all. We also study dynamics of the weight factorof the obtained string representation for the 't Hooft average in the loopspace. In conclusion, we obtain string representation for the partitionfunction of the correlators of an arbitrary number of Higgs currents, by virtueof which we rederive the structure of the bilocal correlator of the dual fieldstrength tensors, which yields the surface term in the string effective action.
