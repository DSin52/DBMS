The condition of vanishing of static force on a q-brane probe in thegravitational background produced by another p-brane is used to give a simplederivation of the pair-wise intersection rules which govern the construction ofBPS combinations of branes. These rules, while implied also by supersymmetryconsiderations, thus have purely bosonic origin. Imposing the no-forcerequirement makes possible to add branes `one by one' to construct compositeBPS configurations (with zero binding energy) of 2-branes and 5-branes in D=11and of various p-branes in D=10. The advantage of this elementary approach isits universality, i.e. the cases of different dimensions and different types ofbranes (e.g., NS-NS, R-R and `mixed' combinations of NS-NS and R-R branes inD=10) are all treated in the same way.
