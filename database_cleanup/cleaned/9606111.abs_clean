Title: Exact Multiplets of Spontaneously Broken Discrete Global Symmetries

Example of $N=2$ Susy QCDAuthors: Adel Bilal and Frank Ferrari (ENS Paris)

International Sakharov Conference, Moscow, May 1996, based on a talk given byA.BIn these notes, we emphasize the r\^ole of spontaneous broken global discretesymmetries acting on the moduli space of $N=2$ susy Yang-Mills theories andshow how they can be used, together with the BPS condition, as a spectrumgenerating symmetry. In particular, in the strong-coupling region, all BPSstates come in multiplets of this broken symmetry. This played a key r\^ole inthe determination of the strong-coupling spectra.
