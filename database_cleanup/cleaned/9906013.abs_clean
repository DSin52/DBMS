The super 0-brane and GS superstring actions on AdS$_2 \times S^2$ backgroundwith 2-form flux are constructed by supercoset approach. We find the super0-brane action contains two parameters which are interpreted as the electricand magnetic charges of the super 0-brane. The obtained super 0-brane actiondescribes the BPS saturated dyonic superparticle moving on AdS$_2 \times S^2$background. The WZ action contains the required coupling with 2-form flux. ForGS superstring, we find the string action on AdS$_2 \times S^2$ takes the sameform as those in AdS$_3 \times S^3$ and AdS$_5 \times S^5$ with RR fieldbackground.
