We resolve the controversy on the stability of the monopole condensation inthe one-loop effective action of SU(2) QCD by calculating the imaginary part ofthe effective action with two different methods at one-loop order. Our resultconfirms that the effective action for the magnetic background has no imaginarypart but the one for the electric background has a negative imaginary part.This assures that the monopole condensation is indeed stable, but the electricbackground becomes unstable due to the pair-annihilation of gluons.
