We present simple models which exhibit some of the remarkable featuresexpected to hold for the as yet unknown non-perturbative formulation of stringfor the full theory; (b) perturbative ground states (local minima of theaction) having the characteristics of spaces of different dimension; (c)duality transformations between large- and small-coupling expansions; and (d)perturbative excitations of these ground states which can be interpreted asstring worldsheets or p-brane worldvolumes. In this context we formulate gaugetheories on arbitrary graphs and speculate concerning actions for graphs whichin a continuum and/or thermodynamic limit might be related to theEinstein-Hilbert action.
