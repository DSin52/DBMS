Using gauge theory and functional integral methods, we derive concreteexpressions for the partition functions of BF theory and the U(1|1) model ofRozansky and Saleur on $\Sigma x S^{1}$, both directly and using equivalenttwo-dimensional theories. We also derive the partition function of a certainnon-abelian generalization of the U(1|1) model on mapping tori and hence obtainexplicit expressions for the Ray-Singer torsion on these manifolds. Extensionsof these results to BF and Chern-Simons theories on mapping tori are alsodiscussed. The topological field theory actions of the equivalenttwo-dimensional theories we find have the interesting property of dependingexplicitly on the diffeomorphism defining the mapping torus while the quantumfield theory is sensitive only to its isomorphism class defining the mappingtorus as a smooth manifold.
