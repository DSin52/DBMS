We discuss the issue of renormalization and the derivation of effectiveinteractions for light-cone Hamiltonians in the context of large-N scalarmatrix models with $\Phi^3$ interactions. For various space-time dimensions $D\geq 3$, we deduce appropriate mass, coupling constant, and wavefunctionrenormalizations which are necessary for finiteness of the Hamiltonian atleading order. We also outline how higher order corrections may be derivedwithin this framework, and discuss the relevance of this approach in thelight-cone quantization of gauge theories.
