The perturbative analysis of models of open and closed superstrings presentsa number of surprises. For instance, variable numbers of antisymmetric tensorsensure their consistency via generalized Green-Schwarz cancellations and anovel type of singularity occurs in their moduli spaces. All these features arerelated, in one way or another, to the presence of boundaries on the worldsheet or, equivalently, of extended objects (branes) interacting with the bulktheory in space time. String dualities have largely widened the interest inthese models, that exhibit a wealth of generic non-perturbative features ofString Theory.
