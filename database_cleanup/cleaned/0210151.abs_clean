02.40.-k, 11.10.Kk, 11.15.-q, 11.90.+tAbelian duality on the closed three-dimensional Riemannian manifold M isdiscussed. Partition functions for the ordinary U(1) gauge theory andcircle-valued scalar field theory on M are explicitly calculated and compared.circle-valued scalar free field theory, quantum field theory on Riemannianmanifold.
