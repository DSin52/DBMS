A geometric interpretation of quantum self-interacting string field theory isgiven. Relations between various approaches to the second quantization of aninteracting string are described in terms of the geometric quantization. Analgorithm to construct a quantum nonperturbative interacting string fieldtheory in the quantum group formalism is proposed. problems of a metricbackground (in)dependence are discussed.
