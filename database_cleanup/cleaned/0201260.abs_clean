Title: Dual Brane Pairs, Chains and the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy

Authors: Axel Krause

Comments: 12 pages, 1 figure

Dual Euclidean brane pairs of type II String- and M-Theory wrapping atwo-sphere are used to express the D=4 Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of anon-rotating D=4 spacetime in terms of a product of the branes' Nambu-Gotoactions. For this we identify the sphere with the event-horizon of the D=4spacetime. Working in the strongly-coupled regime, we propose to relate aEuclidean brane's tension to the inverse of a smallest volume unit. The ensuingdiscretization of the branes' worldvolumes makes it possible to consider longchains. By counting their number we can reproduce the D=4 Bekenstein-Hawkingentropy and its logarithmic correction.
