We discuss the Penrose limit of the Chamseddine-Volkov BPS selfgravitatingmonopole in four dimensional N=4 supergravity theory with non-abelian gaugemultiplets. We analyze the properties of the resulting supersymmetric pp-wavesolutions when various Penrose limits are considered. Apart from the usualrescaling of coordinates and fields we find that a rescaling of the gaugecoupling constant to zero is required, rendering the theory abelian. We alsostudy the Killing spinor equations showing an enhancement of thesupersymmetries preserved by the solutions and discuss the embedding of thepp-wave solution in $d=10$ dimensions.
