A continuum of monopole, dyon and black hole solutions exist in theEinstein-Yang-Mills theory in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. Theirstructure is studied in detail. The solutions are classified by non-Abelianelectric and magnetic charges and the ADM mass. The stability of the solutionswhich have no node in non-Abelian magnetic fields is established. There existcritical spacetime solutions which terminate at a finite radius, and haveuniversal behavior. The moduli space of the solutions exhibits a fractalstructure as the cosmological constant approaches zero.
