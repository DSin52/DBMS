AspectsAuthors: L.D. Paniak and R.J. Szabo

Comments: 28 pages AMSTeX; Based on invited lectures given by the second author

at the ``2nd Summer School in Modern Mathematical Physics'', September 1-122002, Kopaonik, Yugoslavia; To be published in the proceedings by BelgradeInstitute of PhysicsThese notes comprise the first of two articles devoted to the construction ofexact solutions of noncommutative gauge theory in two spacetime dimensions.This first part deals solely with the classical theory on a noncommutativetorus. Topics covered include a mathematical introduction to the geometry ofthe noncommutative torus, the definition, properties and symmetries ofnoncommutative Yang-Mills theory, and the complete solution of the classicalfield equations.
