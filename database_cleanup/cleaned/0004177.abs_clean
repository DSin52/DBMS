(2+1)-regular static black hole solutions with a nonlinear electric field arederived. The source to the Einstein equations is an energy momentum tensor ofnonlinear electrodynamics, which satisfies the weak energy conditions and inthe weak field limit becomes the (2+1)-Maxwell field tensor. The derived classof solutions is regular; the metric, curvature invariants and electric fieldare regular everywhere. The metric becomes, for a vanishing parameter, the(2+1)-static charged BTZ solution. A general procedure to derive solutions forthe static BTZ (2+1)-spacetime, for any nonlinear Lagrangian depending on theelectric field is formulated; for relevant electric fields one requires thefulfillment of the weak energy conditions.
