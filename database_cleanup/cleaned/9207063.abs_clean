States in the absolute (semi-relative) cohomology but not in the relativecohomology are examined through the component decomposition of the string fieldtheory action for the 2-D string. It is found that they are auxiliary fieldswithout kinetic terms, but are important for instance in the master equationfor the Ward-Takahashi identities. The ghost structure is analyzed in theSiegel gauge, but it is noted that the absolute (semi-relative) cohomologystates are lost.
