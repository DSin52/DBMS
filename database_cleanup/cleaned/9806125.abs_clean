In the framework of the conjectured duality relation between large $N$ gaugetheory and supergravity the spectra of masses in large $N$ gauge theory can bedetermined by solving certain eigenvalue problems in supergravity. In thispaper we study the eigenmass problem given by Witten as a possibleapproximation for masses in QCD without supersymmetry. We place a particularemphasis on the treatment of the horizon and related boundary conditions. Weconstruct exact expressions for the analytic expansions of the wave functionsboth at the horizon and at infinity and show that requiring smoothness at thehorizon and normalizability gives a well defined eigenvalue problem. We showfor example that there are no smooth solutions with vanishing derivative at thehorizon. The mass eigenvalues up to $m^{2}=1000$ corresponding to smoothnormalizable wave functions are presented. We comment on the relation of ourwork with the results found in a recent paper by Cs\'aki et al.,hep-th/9806021, which addresses the same problem.
