We consider a fibrillar medium with a continuous distribution of two-levelatoms coupled to quantized electromagnetic fields. Perturbation theory isdeveloped based on the current algebra satisfied by the atomic operators. Theone-loop corrections to the dispersion relation for the polaritons and thedielectric constant are computed. Renormalization group equations are derivedwhich demonstrate a screening of the two-level splitting at higher energies.Our results are compared with known results in the slowly varying envelope androtating wave approximations. We also discuss the quantum sine-Gordon theory asan approximate theory.
