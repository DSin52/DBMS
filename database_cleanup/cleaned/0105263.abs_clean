We study four kinds of 1/4 BPS solutions in massive IIA supergravitycorresponding to D8-D0-F1, D8-D2, D8-D4 and D8-D6-NS5 systems. We show thatthese solutions are reproduced without making nontrivial assumptions by usingsupersymmetry conditions. D8-D2 and D8-D4 solutions are represented by harmonicfunctions, as usual, while the other two are represented by solutions ofnon-linear differential equations. Because these four solutions can be treatedin almost identical ways, we mainly focus on the D8-D6-NS5 systems. We firstdiscuss D6-NS5 solutions with uniform mass parameters. Then, we introduceD8-branes as domain walls by connecting two solutions with different values ofthe mass parameter. We also discuss boundary conditions and supersymmetry ondomain walls.
