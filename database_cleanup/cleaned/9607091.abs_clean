We compute the non-perturbative superpotential in $F$-theory compactificationto four dimensions on a complex three-fold $\P^1\times S$, where $S$ is arational elliptic surface. In contrast to examples considered previously, thesuperpotential in this case has interesting modular properties; it isessentially an $E_8$ theta function.
