Recent advances in string theory have highlighted the need for reliablenumerical methods to calculate correlators at strong coupling in supersymmetrictheories. We present a calculation of the correlator <0|T^{++}(r)T^{++}(0)|0>in N=1 SYM theory in 2+1 dimensions. The numerical method we use issupersymmetric discrete light-cone quantization (SDLCQ), which preserves thesupersymmetry at every order of the approximation and treats fermions andbosons on the same footing. This calculation is done at large $N_c$. For smalland intermediate r the correlator converges rapidly for all couplings. At smallr the correlator behaves like 1/r^6, as expected from conformal field theory.At large r the correlator is dominated by the BPS states of the theory. Thereis, however, a critical value of the coupling where the large-r correlator goesto zero, suggesting that the large-r correlator can only be trusted to somefinite coupling which depends on the transverse resolution. We find that thiscritical coupling grows linearly with the square root of the transversemomentum resolution.
