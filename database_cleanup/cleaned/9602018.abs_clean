A method is suggested for the calculation of the DeWitt-Seeley-Gilkey (DWSG)coefficients for the operator $\sqrt{-\nabla^2 + V(x)}$ basing on ageneralization of the pseudodifferential operator technique. The lowest DWSGcoefficients for the operator $\sqrt{-\nabla^2} + V(x)$ are calculated by usingthe method proposed. It is shown that the method admits a generalization to thecase of operators of the type $(-\nabla^2 + V(X))^{1/{\rm m}}$, where m is anarbitrary rational number. A more simple method is proposed for the calculationof the DWSG coefficients for the case of strictly positive operators under thesign of root. By using this method, it is shown that the problem of thecalculation of the DWSG coefficients for such operators is exactly solvable.Namely, an explicit formula expressing the DWSG coefficients for operators withroot through the DWSG coefficients for operators without root is deduced.
