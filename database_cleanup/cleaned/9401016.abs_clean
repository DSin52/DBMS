Title: The universal Vassiliev-Kontsevich invariant for framed oriented links

Comments: 24 pages

We give a generalization of the Reshetikhin-Turaev functor for tangles to geta combinatorial formula for the universal Vassiliev-Kontsevich invariant offramed oriented links which is coincident with the Kontsevich integral. Theuniversal Vassiliev-Kontsevich invariant is constructed using the Drinfeldassociator. We prove the uniqueness of the Drinfeld associator. As a corollaryone gets the rationality of the Kontsevich integral. Many properties of theuniversal Vassiliev-Kontsevich invariant are established. Connections toquantum group invariants and to multiple zeta values are discussed.
