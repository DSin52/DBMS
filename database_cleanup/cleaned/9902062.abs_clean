A regular method is suggested for constructing vortex-like solutions withcylindrical symmetry in the Skyrme-Einstein chiral model. The method is basedon the expansion of metric and field functions in power series with respect tothe two small parameters entering the model. The length mass density of thevortex is estimated.
