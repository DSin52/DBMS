We introduce topological magnetic field in two-dimensional flat space, whichadmits a solution of scalar monopole that describes the nontrivial topology. Inthe Chern-Simons gauge field theory of anyons, we interpret the anyons as thequasi-particles composed of fermions and scalar monopoles in such a form thateach fermion is surrounded by infinite number of scalar monopoles. It is themonopole charge that determines the statistics of anyons. We re-analyze theconventional arguments of the connection between topology and statistics inthree-dimensional space, and find that those arguments are based on the globaltopology, which is relatively trivial compared with the monopole structure.Through a simple model, we formulate the three-dimensional anyon fieldusing infinite number of Dirac's magnetic monopoles that change the ordinaryspacetime topology. The quasi-particle picture of the three-dimensional anyonsis quite similar to that of the usual two-dimensional anyons. However, theexotic statistics there is not restricted to the usual fractional statistics,but a functional statistics.
