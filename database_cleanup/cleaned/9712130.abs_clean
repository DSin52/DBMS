We suggest that M-theory could be non-perturbatively equivalent to a localquantum field theory. More precisely, we present a ``renormalizable'' gaugetheory in eleven dimensions, and show that it exhibits various propertiesexpected of quantum M-theory, most notably the holographic principle ofmacroscopically large space-time (and the inertia of low-energy excitations) isgenerated by a large number of ``partons'' in the microscopic theory. We arguethat at low energies in large eleven dimensions, the theory should beeffectively described by eleven-dimensional supergravity. This effectivedescription breaks down at much lower energies than naively expected, preciselywhen the system saturates the Bekenstein bound on energy density. We show thatthe number of partons scales like the area of the surface surrounding thesystem, and discuss how this holographic reduction of degrees of freedomaffects the cosmological constant problem. We propose the holographic fieldtheory as a candidate for a covariant, non-perturbative formulation of quantumM-theory.
