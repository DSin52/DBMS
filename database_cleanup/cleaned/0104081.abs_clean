We argue that eleven dimensional supergravity can be described by anon-linear realisation based on the group E_{11}. This requires a formulationof eleven dimensional supergravity in which the gravitational degrees offreedom are described by two fields which are related by duality. We show theexistence of such a description of gravity.
