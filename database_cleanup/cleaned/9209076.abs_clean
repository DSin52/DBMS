Quantum groups play a role of symmetries of integrable theories in twodimensions. They may be detected on the classical level as Poisson-Liesymmetries of the corresponding phase spaces. We discuss specifically theWess-Zumino-Witten conformally invariant quantum field model combining twochiral parts which describe the left- and right-moving degrees of freedom. Onone hand side, the quantum group plays the role of the symmetry of the chiralcomponents of the theory. On the other hand, the model admits a latticeregularization (in the Minkowski space) in which the current algebra symmetryof the theory also becomes quantum, providing the simplest example of a quantumgroup symmetry coupling space-time and internal degrees of freedom. We developa free field approach to the representation theory of the lattice $sl(2)$-basedcurrent algebra and show how to use it to rigorously construct an exactsolution of the quantum $SL(2)$ WZW model on lattice.
