We develop a method to compute the one-loop effective action ofnoncommutative U(1) gauge theory based on the bosonic worldline formalism, andderive compact expressions for N-point 1PI amplitudes. The method, resemblingperturbative string computations, shows that open Wilson lines emerge as agauge invariant completion of certain terms in the effective action. The termsinvolving open Wilson lines are of the form reminiscent of closed stringexchanges between the states living on the two boundaries of a cylinder. Theyare also consistent with recent matrix theory analysis and the results fromnoncommutative scalar field theories with cubic interactions.
