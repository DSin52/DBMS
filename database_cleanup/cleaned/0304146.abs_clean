Title: Knotlike Cosmic Strings in The Early Universe

Authors: Yi-shi Duan and Xin Liu

In this paper, the knotlike cosmic strings in the early universe arediscussed. We derive the cosmic string structures from the non-zero torsiontensor, and reveal that these strings are just created from the zero points ofcomplex scalar quintessence field. In these strings we mainly study theknotlike configurations, and have constructed a new topological invariant forthem. It is also shown that this invariant is just the total sum of all theself-linking and all the linking numbers of the knotlike strings family, andthat this invariant is preserved in the branch processes during the evolutionof cosmic strings.
