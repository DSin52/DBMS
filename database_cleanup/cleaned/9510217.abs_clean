Lattice discretizations of continuous manifolds are common tools used in avariety of physical contexts. Conventional discrete approximations, however,cannot capture all aspects of the original manifold, notably its topology. Inthis paper we discuss an approximation scheme due to Sorkin which correctlyreproduces important topological aspects of continuum physics. Theapproximating topological spaces are partially ordered sets (posets), thepartial order encoding the topology. Now, the topology of a manifold $M$ can bereconstructed from the commutative C*-algebra $\cc(M)$ of continuous functionsdefined on it. In turn, this algebra is generated by continuous probabilitydensities in ordinary quantum physics on $M$. The latter also serve to specifythe domains of observables like the Hamiltonian. For a poset, the role of thisalgebra is assumed by a noncommutative C$^*$-algebra $\ca $. This fact makesany poset a genuine `noncommutative' (`quantum') space, in the sense that thealgebra of its `continuous functions' is a noncommutative C$^*$-algebra. Wetherefore also have a remarkable connection between finite approximations toquantum physics and noncommutative geometries. We use this connection todevelop various approximation methods for doing quantum physics using $\ca$.
