We present the Generalized Borel Transform (GBT). This new approach allowsone to obtain approximate solutions of Laplace/Mellin transform valid in both,perturbative and non perturbative regimes. We compare the results provided bythe GBT for a solvable model of quantum mechanics with those provided bystandard techniques, as the conventional Borel sum, or its modified versions.We found that our approach is very efficient for obtaining both the low and thehigh energy behavior of the model.
