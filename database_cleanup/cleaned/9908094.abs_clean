We construct the effective action of certain exotic branes in the Type IItheories which are not predicted by their spacetime supersymmetry algebras. Weanalyze in detail the case of the NS-7B brane, S-dual to the D7-brane, andthe KK-8A brane (obtained by reduction of the M-theory Kaluza-Klein monopoleand M9-brane, respectively). The NS-7B brane carries charge with respect to theS-dual of the RR 8-form, which we identify as a non-local combination of theelectric-magnetic duals of the axion and the dilaton. The study of itseffective action agrees with previous results in the literature showing that ittransforms as an SL(2,Z) triplet together with the D7-brane. We discuss whythis brane is not predicted by the Type IIB spacetime supersymmetry algebra. Inparticular we show that the modular transformation relating the D7 and NS-7Bbrane solutions can be undone by a simple coordinate transformation in the twodimensional transverse space, equivalent to choosing a different region toparametrize the SL(2,Z) moduli space. We discuss a similar relation between theD6 and KK-6A branes and the D8 and KK-8A branes.
