Title: Diffeomorphism-invariant generalized measures on the space of

connections modulo gauge transformationsComments: 23 pages

The notion of a measure on the space of connections modulo gaugetransformations that is invariant under diffeomorphisms of the base manifold isimportant in a variety of contexts in mathematical physics and topology. At theformal level, an example of such a measure is given by the Chern-Simons pathintegral. Certain measures of this sort also play the role of states in quantumgravity in Ashtekar's formalism. These measures define link invariants, or moregenerally multiloop invariants; as noted by Witten, the Chern-Simons pathintegral gives rise to the Jones polynomial, while in quantum gravity thisobservation is the basis of the loop representation due to Rovelli and Smolin.Here we review recent work on making these ideas mathematically rigorous, andgive a rigorous construction of diffeomorphism-invariant measures on the spaceof connections modulo gauge transformations generalizing the recent work ofAshtekar and Lewandowski. This construction proceeds by doing lattice gaugetheory on graphs analytically embedded in the base manifold.
