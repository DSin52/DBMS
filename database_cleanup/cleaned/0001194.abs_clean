The multidimensional N=4 supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY QM) isconstructed and the various possibilities for partial supersymmetry breakingare discussed. It is shown that quantum mechanical models with one quarter, onehalf and three quarters of unbroken(broken) supersymmetries can exist in theframework of the multidimensional N=4 SUSY QM.
