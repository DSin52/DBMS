The study of brane-antibrane configurations in string theory leads to theunderstanding of supersymmetric D$p$-branes as the bound states of higherdimensional branes. Configurations of pairs brane-antibrane do admit in anatural way their description in terms of K-theory. We analyze configurationsof brane-antibrane at fixed point orbifold singularities in terms ofequivariant K-theory as recently suggested by Witten. Type I and IIB fivebranesand small instantons on ALE singularities are described in K-theoretic termsand their relation to Kronheimer-Nakajima construction of instantons is alsoprovided. Finally the D-brane charge formula is reexamined in this context.
