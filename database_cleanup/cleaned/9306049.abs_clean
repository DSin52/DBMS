We discuss a class of transfer matrix built by a particular combination ofisomorphic and non-isomorphic GL(N) invariant vertex operators. We construct aconformally invariant magnet co nstituted of an alternating mixture of GL(N)``spins'' operators at different order of represent ation. The correspondingcentral charge is calculated by analysing the low temperature beha viour of theassociated free energy. We also comment on possible extensions of our resultsfor more general classes of mixed systems.
