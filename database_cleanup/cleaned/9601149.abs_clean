Title: Non-canonical Quantization of a Quadratic Constrained System

Authors: M. Arik and G. Unel

Comments: LaTeX, 11 pages

We propose an alternative to Dirac quantization for a quadratic constrainedsystem. We show that this solves the Jacobi identity violation problem occuringin the Dirac quantization case and yields a well defined Fock space. Byrequiring the uniqueness of the ground state, we show that for non-constrainedsystems this approach gives the same results as Dirac quantization.
