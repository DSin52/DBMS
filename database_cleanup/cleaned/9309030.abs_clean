We investigate the seven-sphere as a group-like manifold and its extension toa Kac-Moody-like algebra. Covariance properties and tensorial composition ofspinors under $S^7$ are defined. The relation to Malcev algebras isestablished. The consequences for octonionic projective spaces are examined.Current algebras are formulated and their anomalies are derived, and shown tobe unique (even regarding numerical coefficients) up to redefinitions of thecurrents. Nilpotency of the BRST operator is consistent with one particularexpression in the class of (field-dependent) anomalies. A Sugawara constructionis given.
