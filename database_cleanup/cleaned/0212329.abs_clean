Title: Noncommutative Nonlinear Supersymmetry

Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Subhash Rajpoot

Comments: 18 pages, no figures, the misleading expression "D=2,3,4 and 6 (mod

8)" in Abstract, the main text and Concluding Remarks corrected, and onereference [21] addedWe present noncommutative nonlinear supersymmetric theories. The firstexample is a non-polynomial Akulov-Volkov-type lagrangian with noncommutativenonlinear global supersymmetry in arbitrary space-time dimensions. The secondexample is the generalization of this lagrangian to Dirac-Born-Infeldlagrangian with nonlinear supersymmetry realized in dimensions D=2,3,4, 6 and10.
