We investigate non-commutative differential calculus on the supersymmetricversion of quantum space where the non-commuting super-coordinates consist ofbosonic as well as fermionic (Grassmann) coordinates. Multi-parametric quantumdeformation of the general linear supergroup, $GL_q(m|n)$, is studied and theexplicit form for the ${\hat R}$-matrix, which is the solution of theYang-Baxter equation, is presented. We derive the quantum-matrix commutationrelation of $GL_q(m|n)$ and the quantum superdeterminant. We apply theseresults for the $GL_q(m|n)$ to the deformed phase-space of supercoordinates andtheir momenta, from which we construct the ${\hat R}$-matrix of q-deformedorthosymplectic group $OSp_q(2n|2m)$ and calculate its ${\hat R}$-matrix. Somedetailed argument for quantum super-Clifford algebras and the explictexpression of the ${\hat R}$-matrix will be presented for the case of$OSp_q(2|2)$.
