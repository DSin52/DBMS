We consider unitary Virasoro minimal models on the disk with Cardy boundaryconditions and discuss deformations by certain relevant boundary operators,analogous to tachyon condensation in string theory. Concentrating on the leastrelevant boundary field, we can perform a perturbative analysis ofrenormalization group fixed points. We find that the systems always flowtowards stable fixed points which admit no further (non-trivial) relevantperturbations. The new conformal boundary conditions are in general given bysuperpositions of 'pure' Cardy boundary conditions.
