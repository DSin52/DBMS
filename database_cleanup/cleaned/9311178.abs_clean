prep CERN-TH-7106/93In this revised version we correct some mistakes, realizing the supersymmetryalgebra on the exact S matrix, taking into account several phase factros. Westudy the constraint imposed by supersymmetry on the exact $S$-matrix of$\Complex P^{n-1}$ model, and compute a non-trivial phase factor in therelation between the $S$-matrix and one of the supersymmetry generators. Wediscuss several features connected with the physical interpretation of theresult. The supersymmetry current is studied in such context as well, and wefind some operators appearing in the conservation equation of the supersymmetrycurrent that might be connected with such phase factors. The relation with theliterature on the subject is also discussed. hep-th/yymmnnn
