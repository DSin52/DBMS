We study generic features related to matter contents and flat directions in$Z_{2n}$ orbifold models. It is shown that $Z_{2n}$ orbifold models havemassless conjugate pairs, $R$ and $\overline R$, in certain twisted sectors aswell as one of untwisted subsectors. Using these twisted sectors, $Z_{2n}$orbifold models are classified into two types. Conjugate pairs, $R$ and$\overline R$, lead to $D$-flatness as $\langle R \rangle = \langle \overline R\rangle \neq 0$. We investigate generic superpotentials derived from orbifoldmodels so as to show that this direction is indeed a flat direction.
