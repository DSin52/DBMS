We study a three-dimensional gauge theory obtained from the dimensionalreduction of a D4-brane worldvolume theory in the background of space-timemoduli. An SL(3) symmetry in this theory, which acts on fields as well ascoupling constants, is identified. By comparing the energies with the stringtensions, we show that certain 1/2 supersymmetric classical solutions of thistheory can be identified as SL(3,Z) multiplets of type II strings in eightdimensions. Results are then generalized to the non-linear Born-Infeld action.We also discuss the possibility of 1/8 BPS states in this theory and theirrepresentations in terms of string networks.
