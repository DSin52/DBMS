We propose Seiberg-Witten geometry for N=2 gauge theory with gauge group$E_6$ with massive $N_f$ fundamental hypermultiplets. The relevant manifold isdescribed as a fibration of the ALE space of $E_6$ type. It is observed thatthe fibering data over the base ${\bf CP}^1$ has an intricate dependence onhypermultiplet bare masses.
