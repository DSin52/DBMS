Cosmological models that are locally consistent with general relativity andthe standard model in which an object transported around the universe undergoesP, C and CP transformations, are constructed. This leads to generalization ofthe gauge fields that describe electro-weak and strong interactions byenlarging the gauge groups to include anti-unitary transformations. Gedankenexperiments show that if all interactions obey Einstein causality then P, C andCP cannot be violated in these models. But another model, which would violatecharge superselection rule even for an isolated system, is allowed. It issuggested that the fundamental physical laws must have these discretesymmetries which are broken spontaneously, or they must be non causal.
