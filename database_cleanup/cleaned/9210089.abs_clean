Darboux coordinates are constructed on rational coadjoint orbits of thepositive frequency part $\wt{\frak{g}}^+$ of loop algebras. These are given bythe values of the spectral parameters at the divisors corresponding toeigenvector line bundles over the associated spectral curves, defined within agiven matrix representation. A Liouville generating function is obtained incompletely separated form and shown, through the Liouville-Arnold integrationmethod, to lead to the Abel map linearization of all Hamiltonian flows inducedby the spectral invariants. Serre duality is used to define a naturalsymplectic structure on the space of line bundles of suitable degree over apermissible class of spectral curves, and this is shown to be equivalent to theKostant-Kirillov symplectic structure on rational coadjoint orbits. The generalconstruction is given for $\frak{g}=\frak{gl}(r)$ or $\frak{sl}(r)$, withreductions to orbits of subalgebras determined as invariant fixed point setsunder involutive automorphisms. The case $\frak{g=sl}(2)$ is shown to reproducethe classical integration methods for finite dimensional systems defined onquadrics, as well as the quasi-periodic solutions of the cubically nonlinearSchr\"odinger equation. For $\frak{g=sl}(3)$, the method is applied to thecomputation of quasi-periodic solutions of the two component coupled nonlinearSchr\"odinger equation.
