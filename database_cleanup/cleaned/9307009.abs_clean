Title: Flat structure for the simple elliptic singularity of type $\widetilde

{\bf E_6}$ and Jacobi formComments: 6 pages

TheoryIn order to construct the inverse mapping of the period mapping for theprimitive form for the semi-universal deformation of a simple ellipticsingularity, K.Saito introduced in [5] the ``flat structure'' for the extendedaffine root system. In section 3, we construct explicitly the flat thetainvariants in the case of type $E_6$ using the Jacobi form introduced byWirthm\"uller [7]. Combining the results of Kato [3], Noumi [4] (explicitdescription of the flat coordinates), this gives an answer to Jacobi'sinversion problem (up to linear isomorphism) of this period mapping for asimple elliptic singularity of type $\tilde E_6$ (see also [6]). The detailswill be published elsewhere.
