A graded generalization of the Z_k parafermionic current osp(1|2)/U(1) cosetconformal field theory. The structure of the parafermionic highest-weightmodules is analyzed and the dimensions of the fields of the theory aredetermined. A free field realization of the graded parafermionic system isobtained and the structure constants of the current algebra are found. Althoughthe theory is not unitary, it presents good reducibility properties.
