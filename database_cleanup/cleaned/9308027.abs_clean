It has been known for some time that there are many inequivalentquantizations possible when the configuration space of a system is a cosetspace G/H. Viewing this classical system as a constrained system on the groupG, we show that these inequivalent quantizations can be recovered from ageneralization of Dirac's approach to the quantization of such a constrainedsystem within which the classical first class constraints (generating theH-action on G) are allowed to become anomalous (second class) when quantizing.The resulting quantum theories are characterized by the emergence of aYang-Mills connection, with quantized couplings, and new 'spin' degrees ofincluding a new account of how spin can be described within a path-integralformalism, and how on S^4 chiral spin degrees of {}freedom emerge, coupled to aBPST instanton.
