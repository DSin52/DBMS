Motivated by possible applications to condensed matter systems, in this paperwe construct U(N) noncommutative Chern-Simons (NCCS) action for a disc and fora double-layer geometry, respectively. In both cases, gauge invariance severelyconstrains the form of the NCCS action. In the first case, it is necessary tointroduce a group-valued boson field with a non-local chiral boundary action,whose gauge variation cancels that of the bulk action. In the second case, thecoefficient matrix $K$ in the double U(N) NCCS action is restricted to be ofthe form with all the matrix elements being the same integer $k$. We suggestthat this double NCCS theory with U(1) gauge group describes the so-calledHalperin $(kkk)$ state in a double-layer quantum Hall system. Possible physicalconsequences are addressed.
