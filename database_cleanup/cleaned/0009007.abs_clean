We write down the Yang-Mills partition function and the average Wilson loopin terms of local gauge-invariant variables being the six components of themetric tensor of dual space. The Wilson loop becomes the trace of the paralleltransporter in curved space, else called the gravitational holonomy. We showthat the external coordinates mapping the 3d curved space into a flat 6d spaceplay the role of glueball fields, and there is a natural mechanism for the massgap generation.
