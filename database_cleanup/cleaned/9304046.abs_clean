We propose a new formulation of the $D=3$ type II superstring which ismanifestly invariant under both target-space $N=2$ supersymmetry and worldsheet$N=(1,1)$ super reparametrizations. This gives rise to a set of twistor(commuting spinor) variables, which provide a solution to the two Virasoroconstraints. The worldsheet supergravity fields are shown to play the r\^ole ofauxiliary fields.
