A classification scheme of hadrons is proposed on the basis of the divisionalgebra H of quaternions and an appropriate geometry. This scheme suggestsstrongly to understand flavour symmetry in another manner than from standardsymmetry schemes. In our approach, we do not start from `exact' symmetry groupslike SU(2) \times SU(2) chiral symmetry and impose various symmetry breakingmechanisms which collide with theorems wellknown from quantum field theory. Onthe contrary, the approximate symmetry properties of the hadron spectrum at lowenergies, usually classified by `appropriately' broken compact flavour groups,emerge very naturally as a low energy reduction of the noncompact (dynamical)symmetry group Sl(2,H). This quaternionic approach not only avoids most of thewellknown conceptual problems of Chiral Dynamics but it also allows for ageneral treatment of relativistic flavour symmetries as well as it yields adirect connection towards classical relativistic symmetry.
