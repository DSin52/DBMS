A supersymmetric formulation of the classical action of interacting chargedand neutral fermions with arbitrary anomalous magnetic moment is considered.This formulation generalizes the known action for scalar charged particlesinvestigated in papers by Fokker, Schwarzschild, Tetrode, Wheeler and Feynman.The superfield formulation of the electrodynamics of the Maxwellsupermultiplet, constructed from the world coordinates of charged or neutralfermions is carried out basing on the proposed action.
