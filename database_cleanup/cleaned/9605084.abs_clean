In order to construct a massive tensor theory with a smooth massless limit,we apply two kinds of gauge-fixing procedures, Nakanishi's one and the BRS one,to two models of massive tensor field. The first is of the Fierz-Pauli (FP)type, which describes a pure massive tensor field; the other is of theadditional-scalar-ghost (ASG) type, which includes a scalar ghost in additionto an ordinary tensor field. It is shown that Nakanishi's procedure caneliminate massless singularities in both two models, while the BRS procedureregularizes the ASG model only. The BRS-regularized ASG model is most promisingin constructing a complete nonlinear theory.
