We consider the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalism describing free\k-relativistic particles with their four-momenta constrained to the\k-deformed mass shell. We study the modifications of the formalism whichfollow from the introduction of space coordinates with nonvanishing Poissonbrackets and from the redefinitions of the energy operator. The quantummechanics of free \k-relativistic particles and of the free \k-relativisticoscillator is also presented. It is shown that the \k-relativistic oscillatordescribes a quantum statistical ensemble with finite Hagedorn temperature. Therelation to a \k-deformed Schr\"odinger quantum mechanics in which the timederivative is replaced by a finite difference derivative is also discussed.
