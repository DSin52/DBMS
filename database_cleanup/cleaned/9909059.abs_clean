Closed string dynamics in the presence of noncommutative Dp-branes isinvestigated. In particular, we compute bulk closed string two-point scatteringamplitudes; the bulk space-time geometries encoded in the amplitudes are shownto be consistent with the recently proposed background space-time geometriesdual to noncommutative Yang-Mills theories. Three-point closed stringabsorption/emission amplitudes are obtained to show some features ofnoncommutative Dp-branes, such as modified pole structures and exponentialphase factors linearly proportional to the external closed string momentum.
