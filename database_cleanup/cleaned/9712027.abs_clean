Title: Comment on the Bound State Problem in N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theory

Comments: latex

We re-examine the threshold bound state problem on the wrong sign Taub-Nutspace; the metric on which describes the relative moduli space of wellseparated BPS monopoles. The quantum mechanics gives rise to a continuousfamily of threshold bound states, in distinction to the unique one found on theAtiyah-Hitchin metric.
