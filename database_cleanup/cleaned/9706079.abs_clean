I attempt to analyse the next-to-leading-order non-holomorphic contributionto the Wilsonian low-energy effective action in the four-dimensional N=2 gaugetheories with matter, from the manifestly N=2 supersymmeric point of view, byusing the harmonic superspace. The perturbative one-loop correction is found tobe in agreement with the N=1 superfield calculations of de Wit, Grisaru andRocek. The previously unknown coefficient in front of this non-holomorphiccorrection is calculated. A special attention is devoted to the N=2superconformal gauge theories, whose one-loop non-holomorphic contribution islikely to be exact, even non-perturbatively. This leading (one-loop)non-holomorphic contribution to the LEEA of the N=2 superconformally invariantgauge field theories is calculated, and it does not vanish, similarly to thecase of the N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory.
