The holographic principle is studied in the context of a $n+1$ dimensionalradiation dominated closed Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. Theradiation is represented by a conformal field theory with a large centralcharge. Following recent ideas on holography, it is argued that the entropydensity in the early universe is bounded by a multiple of the Hubble constant.The entropy of the CFT is expressed in terms of the energy and the Casimirenergy via a universal Cardy formula that is valid for all dimensions. A newpurely holographic bound is postulated which restricts the sub-extensiveentropy associated with the Casimir energy. Unlike the Hubble bound, the newbound remains valid throughout the cosmological evolution. When the new boundis saturated the Friedman equation exactly coincides with the universal Cardyformula, and the temperature is uniquely fixed in terms of the Hubble parameterand its time-derivative.
