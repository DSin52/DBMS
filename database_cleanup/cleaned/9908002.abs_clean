A covariant spinor representation of $iosp(d,2/2)$ is constructed for thequantization of the spinning relativistic particle. It is found that, withappropriately defined wavefunctions, this representation can be identified withthe state space arising from the canonical extended BFV-BRST quantization ofthe spinning particle with admissible gauge fixing conditions after acontraction procedure. For this model, the cohomological determination ofphysical states can thus be obtained purely from the representation theory ofthe $iosp(d,2/2)$ algebra.
