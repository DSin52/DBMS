IAGRG--XVIII (Matscience, Madras, India (Feb. 15-17, 1996))A recent generalisation of the Raychaudhuri equations for timelike geodesiccongruences to families of $D$ dimensional extremal, timelike, Nambu--Gotosurfaces embedded in an $N$ dimensional Lorentzian background is reviewed.Specialising to $D=2$ (i.e the case of string worldsheets) we reduce theequation for the generalised expansion $\theta _{a}, (a =\sigma,\tau)$ to asecond order, linear, hyperbolic partial differential equation which resemblesa variable--mass wave equation in $1+1$ dimensions. Consequences, such as ageneralisation of geodesic focussing to families of worldsheets as well asexactly solvable cases are explored and analysed in some detail. Severalpossible directions of future research are also pointed out.
