We quantize the chiral Schwinger Model by using the Batalin-Tyutin formalism.We show that one can systematically construct the first class constraints andthe desired involutive Hamiltonian, which naturally generates all secondaryconstraints. For $a>1$, this Hamiltonian gives the gauge invariant Lagrangianincluding the well-known Wess-Zumino terms, while for $a=1$ the correspondingLagrangian has the additional new type of the Wess-Zumino terms, which areirrelevant to the gauge symmetry.
