Title: Local symmetry in the Kazakov-Migdal gauge model

Authors: D.V.Boulatov

Comments: 5 pages, latex, NBI-HE-92-62

The spectrum of observables in the induced lattice gauge model proposedrecently by V.A.Kazakov and A.A.Migdal obeys the local-confinement selectionrule. The underlying local continuous symmetry cannot be spontaneously brokenwithin the model.
