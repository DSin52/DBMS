Title: The Hypermultiplet in N = 2 Superspace

Comments: 12 pages, no figures, standard latex

Global N=2 supersymmetry in four dimensions with a Fayet-Sohniushypermultiplet and a complex central charge is studied in N = 2 superspace. Itis shown how to construct the complete expansion of the hypermultiplet withrespect to the central charge. In addition the low-energy effective action isdiscussed and it is shown that the `kernel' of the Lagrangian only needs anintegration over a `small' superspace to construct a supersymmetric action.
