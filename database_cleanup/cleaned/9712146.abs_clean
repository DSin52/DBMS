A compactification of the heterotic string is considered which describes aparticle propagating in the symmetric space M = SO(9,1;Z)\SO(9,1;R)/SO(9;R) ininteraction with excited states whose dynamics is (1+1)-dimensional. The modelappears to describe D-particle dynamics in type IIA string theory on M.
