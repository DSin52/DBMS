We present a manifestly supersymmetric procedure for calculating thecontributions from matter loops to the mixed K\"{a}hler-gauge and to the mixedK\"{a}hler- Lorentz anomalies in $N=1, D=4$ supergravity-matter systems. Weshow how this procedure leads to the well-known result for the mixedK\"{a}hler-gauge anomaly. For general supergravity-matter systems the mixedK\"{a}hler-Lorentz anomaly is found to contain a term proportional to ${\calR}^2$ with a background field dependent coefficient as well as termsproportional to $(C_{mnpq})^2$ and to the Gauss-Bonnet topological density. Webriefly comment on the relationship between the mixed K\"{a}hler-Lorentzanomaly and the moduli dependent threshold corrections to gravitationalcouplings in $Z_N$ orbifolds.
