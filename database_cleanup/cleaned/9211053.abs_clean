Using Watson's and the recursive equations satisfied by matrix elements oflocal operators in two-dimensional integrable models, we compute the formfactors of the elementary field $\phi(x)$ and the stress-energy tensor$T_{\mu\nu}(x)$ of Sinh-Gordon theory. Form factors of operators with higherspin or with different asymptotic behaviour can easily be deduced from them.The value of the correlation functions are saturated by the form factors withlowest number of particle terms. This is illustrated by an application of theform factors of the trace of $T_{\mu\nu}(x)$ to the sum rule of the$c$-theorem.
