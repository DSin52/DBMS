We investigate non-Abelian gauge theories within a Wilsonian RenormalisationGroup approach. The cut-off term inherent in this approach leads to a modifiedWard identity (mWI). It is shown that this mWI is compatible with the flow andthat the full effective action satisfies the usual Ward identity (WI). Theuniversal 1-loop beta-function is derived within this approach and theextension to the 2-loop level is briefly outlined.
