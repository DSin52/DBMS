We discuss the BRST cohomologies of the invariants associated with thedescription of classical and quantum gravity in four dimensions, using theAshtekar variables. These invariants are constructed from several BRSTcohomology sequences. They provide a systematic and clear characterization ofnon-local observables in general relativity with unbroken diffeomorphisminvariance, and could yield further differential invariants for four-manifolds.The theory includes fluctuations of the vierbein fields, but there exits anon-trivial phase which can be expressed in terms of Witten's topologicalquantum field theory. In this phase, the descent sequences are degenerate, andthe corresponding classical solutions can be identified with the conformallyself-dual sector of Einstein manifolds. The full theory includes fluctuationswhich bring the system out of this sector while preserving diffeomorphisminvariance.
