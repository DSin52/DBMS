Title: Super-D0-branes at the endpoints of fundamental superstring

of interacting brane systemComments: 12 pages, LATEX, contribution to the Proceedings of the International

Seminar ''Supersymmetries and Quantum Symmetries' (SQS'99, 27-31 July, 1999)We present a supersymmetric action functional for the coupled system of anopen fundamental superstring and super-D0-branes attached to (identified with)the string endpoints. As a preliminary step the geometrical actions for a freesuper-D0-brane and a free type IIA superstring have been built. The purebosonic limits of the action for the coupled system and of the equations ofmotion are discussed in some detail.
