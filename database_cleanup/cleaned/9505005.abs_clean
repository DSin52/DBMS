We study two-dimensional U($N$) and SU($N$) gauge theories with a topologicalterm on arbitrary surfaces. Starting from a lattice formulation we derive thecontinuum limit of the action which turns out to be a generalisation of theheat kernel in the presence of a topological term. In the continuum limit wecan reconstruct the topological information encoded in the theta term. In thetopologically trivial cases the theta term gives only a trivial shift to theground state energy but in the topologically nontrivial ones it remains to becoupled to the dynamics in the continuum. In particular for the U($N$) gaugegroup on orientable surfaces it gives rise to a phase transition at $\theta=\pi$, similar to the ones observed in other models. Using the equivalence of 2dQCD and a 1d fermion gas on a circle we rewrite our result in the fermioniclanguage and show that the theta term can be also interpreted as an externalmagnetic field imposed on the fermions.
