We review the different proposals which have so far been made for theholographic principle and the related entropy bounds and classify them into thestrong, null and weak forms. These are analyzed, with the aim of discoveringwhich may hold at the level of the full quantum theory of gravity. We find thatonly the weak forms, which constrain the information available to observers onboundaries, are implied by arguments using the generalized second law. Thestrong forms, which go further and posit a bound on the entropy in spacelikeregions bounded by surfaces, are found to suffer from serious problems, whichgive rise to counterexamples already at the semiclassical level. The null form,proposed by Fischler, Susskind, Bousso and others, in which the bound is on theentropy of certain null surfaces, appears adequate at the level of a bound onthe entropy of matter in a single background spacetime, but attempts to includethe gravitational degrees of freedom encounter serious difficulties. Only theweak form seems capable of holding in the full quantum theory.The conclusion is that the holographic principle is not a relationshipgeometry vrs boundary theories and measures of information. Instead, it is theassertion that in a fundamental theory the first set of concepts must becompletely reduced to the second.
