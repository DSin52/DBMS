We present a set of quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians which can be written as$F=2,3,...\, .$ This new construction, which we call {\it fractional}\/supersymmetric quantum mechanics, is realized in terms of \pg\ variablessatisfying $\t^F=0$. Furthermore, in a pseudo-classical context, we describe{\it fractional}\/ supersymmetry transformations as the $F^{\,\rm th}$ roots oftime translations, and provide an action invariant under such transformations.
