We consider target space duality transformations for heterotic sigma modelsand strings away from renormalization group fixed points. By imposing certainconsistency requirements between the T-duality symmetry and renormalizationgroup flows, the one loop gauge beta function is uniquely determined, withoutany diagram calculations. Classical T-duality symmetry is a valid quantumsymmetry of the heterotic sigma model, severely constraining itsrenormalization flows at this one loop order. The issue of heterotic anomaliesand their cancelation is addressed from this duality constraining viewpoint.
