The geometry of antisymmetric fields with nontrivial transitions over a basemanifold is described in terms of exact sequences of cohomology groups. Thisformulation leads naturally to the appearance of nontrivial topological chargesassociated to the periods of the curvature of the antisymmetric fields. Therelation between the partition functions of dual theories is carefully studiedunder the most general assumptions, and new topological factors related to zeromodes and the Ray Singer torsion are found.
