It is shown that many modes of the gravitational field exist only inside thehorizon of an extreme black hole in string theory. At least in certain cases,the number of such modes is sufficient to account for the Bekenstein-Hawkingentropy. These modes are associated with sources which carry Ramond-Ramondcharge, and so may be viewed as the strong coupling limit of D-branes. Althoughthese sources naturally live at the singularity, they are well defined andgenerate modes which extend out to the horizon. This suggests that theinformation in an extreme black hole is not localized near the singularity orthe horizon, but extends between them.
