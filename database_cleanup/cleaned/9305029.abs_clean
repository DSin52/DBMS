Multiloop superstring amplitudes are calculated in the explicit form by thesolution of Ward identities. A naive generalization of Belavin-Knizhnik theoremto the superstring is found to be incorrect since the period matrix turns outto be depended on the spinor structure over the terms proportional to oddmoduli.These terms appear because fermions mix bosons under the two-dim.supersymmetry transformations. The closed, oriented superstring turns out to befinite, if it possesses the ten-dimensional supersymmetry, as well as thetwo-dimentional one.This problem needs a further study.
