302-329The Heisenberg double of a Hopf algebra may be regarded as a quantum analogueof the cotangent bundle of a Lie group. Quantum duality principle describesrelations between a Hopf algebra, its dual, and their Heisenberg double in away which extends both the theory of coadjoint orbits and the classical Fouriertransform. We also describe the twisted Heisenberg double which is relevant forthe study of nontrivial deformations of the quantized universal envelopingalgebras.
