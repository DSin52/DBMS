It is shown that the Type IIA superstring compactified on $K3$ has a smoothstring soliton with the same zero mode structure as the heterotic stringcompactified on a four torus, thus providing new evidence for a conjecturedexact duality between the two six-dimensional string theories. The chiralworldsheet bosons arise as zero modes of Ramond-Ramond fields of the IIA stringtheory and live on a signature $(20,4)$ even, self-dual lattice. Stable, finiteloops of soliton string provide the charged Ramond-Ramond states necessary forenhanced gauge symmetries at degeneration points of the $K3$ surface. It isalso shown that Type IIB strings toroidally compactified to six dimensions havea multiplet of string solutions with Type II worldsheets.
