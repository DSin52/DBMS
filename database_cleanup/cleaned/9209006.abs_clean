The Adler-Kostant-Symes $R$-bracket scheme is applied to the algebra ofand its two modifications, known as nonstandard integrable models. All threehierarchies are shown to be equivalent and connection is established in theform of a symplectic gauge transformation. This construction results in a newrepresentation of the W-infinity algebras in terms of 4 bosonic fields.
