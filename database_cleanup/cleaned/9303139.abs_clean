The theory of matrix models is reviewed from the point of view of itsrelation to integrable hierarchies. Discrete 1-matrix, 2-matrix, ``conformal''(multicomponent) and Kontsevich models are considered in some detail, togetherwith the Ward identites (``W-constraints''), determinantal formulas andcontinuum limits, taking one kind of models into another. Subtle points anddirections of the future research are also discussed.
