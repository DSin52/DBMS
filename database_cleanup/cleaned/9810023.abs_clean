We investigate BPS properties of the charged soliton solutions of D-braneworldvolume theory, which is described by the supersymmetric Dirac-Born-Infeldaction, by means of the N=2 target-space supersymmetry algebra. Our resultsagree with those obtained previously. We also extend our BPS analysis to thecase where axion background exists.
