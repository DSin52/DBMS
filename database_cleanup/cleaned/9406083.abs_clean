prepared for 27th International Conference on High Energy Physics, Glasgow,20-27 July 1994A particle which lives in a d-dimensional ordinary and a d-dimensionalGrassmann space manifests itself in an ordinary four-dimensional subspace as aspinor, a scalar or a vector with charges. Operators of the Lorentztransformations and translations in both spaces form the super- Poincar\' ealgebra. It is the super-Pauli-Ljubanski vector which generates spinors.Vielbeins and spin connections with the Lorentz index larger than or equal tofive may manifest in a four-dimensional subspace as an electromagnetic, a weakand a colour field.
