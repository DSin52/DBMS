We perform a completely perturbative matrix model calculation of the physicallow-energy quantities of the N=2 U(N) gauge theory. Within the matrix modelframework we propose a perturbative definition of the periods a_i in terms ofcertain tadpole diagrams, and check our conjecture up to first order in thegauge theory instanton expansion. The prescription does not require knowledgeof the Seiberg-Witten differential or curve. We also compute the N=2prepotential F(a) perturbatively up to the first-instanton level findingagreement with the known result.
