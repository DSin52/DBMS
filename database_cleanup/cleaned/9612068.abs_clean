A new, configuration-space picture of a formalism of group quantization, theGAQ formalism, is presented in the context of a previous, algebraicgeneralization. This presentation serves to make a comprehensive discussion inwhich other extensions of the formalism, particularly to incorporate gaugesymmetries, are developed as well. Both images are combined in order toanalyse, in a systematic manner and with complete generality, the case oflinear fields (abelian current groups). To ilustrate these developments weparticularize them for several fields and, in particular, we carry out thequantization of the abelian Chern-Simons models over an arbitrary closedsurface in detail.
