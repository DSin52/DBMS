We give a path integral prescription for the pair correlation function ofWilson loops lying in the worldvolume of Dbranes in the bosonic open and closedstring theory. The results can be applied both in ordinary flat spacetime inthe critical dimension d or in the presence of a generic background for theLiouville field. We compute the potential between heavy nonrelativistic sourcesin an abelian gauge theory in relative collinear motion with velocity v =tanh(u), probing length scales down to r_min^2 = 2 \pi \alpha' u. We predict auniversal -(d-2)/r static interaction at short distances. We show that thevelocity dependent corrections to the short distance potential in the bosonicstring take the form of an infinite power series in the dimensionless variablesz = r_min^2/r^2, uz/\pi, and u^2.
