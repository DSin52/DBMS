Title: The Nappi-Witten example and gravitational waves

Authors: C. Duval, Z. Horv\'ath, P.A. Horv\'athy

The vanishing of the anomaly in the recent example of Nappi and Witten,constructed from the Wess-Zumino-Witten model based on a certain non-semisimplegroup, follows from a more general result valid for gravitational waves. Theconstruction of the metric is explained.}
