We study the energy density of two distinct fundamental monopoles in SU(3)and Sp(4) theories with an arbitrary mass ratio. Several special limits of thegeneral result are checked and verified. Based on the analytic expression ofenergy density the coefficient of the internal part of the moduli space metricis also computed, which gives it a nice "mechanical" interpretation. We theninvestigate the interaction energy density for both cases. By analyzing thecontour of the zero interaction energy density we propose a detailed picture ofwhat happens when one gets close to the massless limit. The study of theinteraction energy density also sheds light on the formation of the non-Abeliancloud.
