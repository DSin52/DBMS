Title: AdS/CFT Correspondence and Supersymmetry

Authors: V.K. Dobrev

Comments: 22 pages, LaTeX2e; Lectures at the 1st Summer School in Modern

Mathematical Physics, Sokobanja, Yugoslavia, 13-25.8.2001; to appear in theProceedings of the SchoolWe use the group-theoretic interpretation of the AdS/CFT correspondence whichwe proposed earlier in order to lift intertwining operators acting betweenboundary conformal representations to intertwining operators acting betweenbulk conformal representations. Further, we present the classification of thepositive energy (lowest weight) unitary irreducible representations of the D=6superconformal algebras $osp(8^*/2N)$.
