Title: D-branes in PP-wave light cone string field theory

Authors: B. Chandrasekhar and Alok Kumar

Comments: 30 pages, correction in eqn. (4.28), few equations (appendix),

Comments (p.17-18) and a reference (no. 58) added, typo is corrected in eqn.(4.5)The cubic interaction vertex and the dynamical supercharges are constructedfor open strings ending on D7-branes, in light-cone superstring field theory inPP-wave background. In this context, we write down the symmetry generators inoriginating from the eight transverse directions in the PP-wave background anduse the expressions to explicitly construct the vertex at the level of stringyzero modes. The results are further generalized to include all the stringyexcitations as well.
