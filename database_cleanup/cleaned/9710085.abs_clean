Authors: Sergei V. Ketov (ITP, University of Hannover)

Comments: 45 pages, LaTeX, 6 figures, macros included; a few references added,

conclusion expandedExact solutions to the low-energy effective action of the four-dimensional,N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories with matter (including N=2 super-QCD) areharmonic superspace, and (iii) M theory. The emphasis is made on thefoundations of all three approaches and their relationship.
