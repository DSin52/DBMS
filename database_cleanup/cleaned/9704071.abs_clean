Gotay showed that a representation of the whole Poisson algebra of the torusgiven by geometric quantization is irreducible with respect to the most naturalovercomplete set of observables. We study this representation and argue that itcannot be considered as physically acceptable. In particular, classicallybounded observables are quantized by operators with unbounded spectrum.Effectively, the latter amounts to lifting the constraints that compactify bothdirections in the torus.
