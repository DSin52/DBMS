Preprint QMW-PH-94-7, Stanford University Preprint SU-ITP-94-8We discuss stationary supersymmetric bosonic configurations of theEinstein-Maxwell theory embedded in $N=2$ supergravity. Some of theseconfigurations, including the Kerr-Newman solutions with $m = |q|$ andarbitrary angular momentum per unit mass $a$, exhibit naked singularities.However, $N=2$ supergravity has trace anomaly. The nonvanishing anomalousenergy-momentum tensor of these Kerr-Newman solutions violates a consistencycondition for a configuration to admit unbroken supersymmetry. Thus, the traceanomaly of this theory prevents the supersymmetric solutions from exhibitingnaked singularities.
