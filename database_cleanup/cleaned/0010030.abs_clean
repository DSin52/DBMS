The correlation functions of two-dimensional anyon fields in a KMS-state arestudied. For T=0 the $n$-particle wave functions of noncanonical fermions oflevel $\alpha$, $\alpha$ odd, are shown to be of Laughlin type of order$\alpha$. For $T>0$ they are given by a simple finite-temperaturegeneralization of Laughlin's wave function. This relates the first and secondquantized pictures of the fractional quantum Hall effect.
