We analyze large gauge invariance in combined nonabelian and thermal QFT andtheir physical consequences for D=3 effective actions. After briefly reviewingthe structure of bundles and large gauge transformations that arise innon-simply connected 3-manifolds and gauge groups, we discuss their connectionsto Chern-Simons terms and Wilson-Polyakov loops. We then provide an invariantcharacterization of the ``abelian'' fluxes encountered in explicit computationsof finite temperature effective actions. In particular we relate, and provideexplicit realizations of, these fluxes to a topological index that measures theobstruction to global diagonalization of the loops around compactified time. Wealso explore the fate of, and exhibit some everywhere smooth, largetransformations for non-vanishing index in various topologies.
