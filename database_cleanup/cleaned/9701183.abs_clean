We study the critical behavior of the D (2<D<4) dimensional Gross-Neveu modelwith a Thirring interaction, where a vector-vector type four-fermi interactionis on equal terms with a scalar-scalar type one. By using inversion method upto the next-to-leading order of 1/N expansion, we construct a gauge invarianteffective potential. We show the existence of the chiral order phasetransition, and determine explicitly the critical surface. It is observed thatthe critical behavior is mainly controlled by the Gross-Neveu coupling g. Thecritical surface can be divided into two parts by the surface g=1 which is thecritical coupling in the Gross-Neveu model at the 1/N next-to-leading order,and the form of the critical surface is drastically change at g=1. Comparisonwith the Schwinger-Dyson(SD) equation is also discussed. Our result is almostthe same as that derived in the SD equation. Especially, in the case of pureGross-Neveu model, we succeed in deriving exactly the same critical line as theone derived in the SD equation.
