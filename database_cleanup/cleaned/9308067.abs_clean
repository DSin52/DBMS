We analyse the interacting theory of charged fermions, scalars,pseuso-scalars and photons propagating in 2-dimensional curved spacetime indetail. For certain values of the coupling constants the theory reduces to thegauged Thirring model and for others the Schwinger model incurved spacetime. Itis shown that the interaction of the fermions with the pseudo-scalars shieldsthe electromagnetic interaction, and that the non-minimal coupling of thescalars to the gravitational field amplifies the Hawking radiation. We solvethe finite temperature and density model by using functional techniques and inparticular derive the exact equation of state. The explicit temperature andcurvature dependence of the chiral condensate is found. When theelectromagnetic field is switched off the model reduces to a conformal fieldtheory. We determine the physically relevant expectation values and conformalweights of the fundamental fields in the theory.
