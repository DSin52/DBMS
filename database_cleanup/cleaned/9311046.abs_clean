Title: Critical O(N) - vector nonlinear sigma - models

structureAuthors: Klaus Lang, Werner Ruehl

Comments: 16 pages, Latex. To appear in the Proceedings of the XXII Conference

on Differential Methods in Theoretical Physics, Ixtapa, Mexico, September20-24, 1993The classification of quasi - primary fields is outlined. It is proved thatthe only conserved quasi - primary currents are the energy - momentum tensorand the O(N) - Noether currents. Derivation of all quasi - primary fields andthe resolution of degeneracy is sketched. Finally the limits d=2 and d=4 of thespace dimension are discussed. Whereas the latter is trivial the former is onlyalmost so.
