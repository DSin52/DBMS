The computation of the microcanonical density of states for a string gas in afinite volume needs a one by one count because of the discrete nature of thespectrum. We present a way to do it using geometrical arguments in phase space.We take advantage of this result in order to obtain the thermodynamicalmagnitudes of the system. We show that the results for an open universe exactlycoincide with the infinite volume limit of the expression obtained for the gasin a box. For any finite volume the Hagedorn temperature is a maximum one, andthe specific heat is always positive. We also present a definition of pressurecompatible with R-duality seen as an exact symmetry, which allows us to make astudy on the physical phase space of the system. Besides a maximum temperaturethe gas presents an asymptotic pressure.
