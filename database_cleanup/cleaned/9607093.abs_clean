A new $N=1$ superfield theory in $D=4$ flat superspace is suggested. Itdescribes dynamics of supergravity compensator and can be considered as alow-energy limit for $N=1$, $D=4$ superfield supergravity. The theory is shownto be renormalizable in infrared limit and infrared free. A quantum effectiveaction is investigated in infrared domain.
