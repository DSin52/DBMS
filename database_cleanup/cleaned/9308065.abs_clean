Title: Regular representations of affine Kac-Moody algebras

Authors: B. Feigin and S. Parkhomenko

Comments: plain TEX, 13 pages

In this paper we investigate one Wakimoto-type construction of affineKac-Moody algebras. We obtain a version of the regular representation, on whichthe affine algebra acts from the left and from the right with the sum of levelsequal to minus two dual Coxeter numbers.
