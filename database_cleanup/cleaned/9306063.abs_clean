In this paper the $c=1$ matrix model deformed by a $1/x^{2}$ piece isdiscussed. Tachyon correlation functions are calculated up to genus two usingmethods similar to those for the undeformed case. The possible connection withthe two dimensional black hole is also considered. In particular, restrictionson naked singularities imposed by the matrix model are found.
