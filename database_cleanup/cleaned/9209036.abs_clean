We propose a generalization of the collective field theory hamiltonian,including interactions between the original bosonic collective field $w_0 (z)$and supplementary fields ${\bar w}_j (z)$ realizing classically a $w_\infty$algebra. The latter are then shown to represent a 3--dimensional topologicalfield theory. This generalization follows from a conjectured representation ofthe $W_{1 + \infty}$ algebra of bilinear fermion operators underlying theoriginal matrix model. It provides an improved bosonization scheme for $1+1$dimensional fermion theories.
