On the base of the notion of N=2 abelian Yang-Mills supergeometry withconstant curvature, we propose an off-shell formulation for the massiveq-hypermultiplet and complex $\omega$-hypermultiplet in the standard harmonicsuperspase without central charge variables. The corresponding superpropagatorsare derived.
