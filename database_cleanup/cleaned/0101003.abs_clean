AdS/CFT induced quantum dilatonic brane-world where 4d boundary is flat or deSitter (inflationary) or Anti-de Sitter brane is considered. The classicalbrane tension is fixed but boundary QFT produces the effective brane tensionvia the account of corresponding conformal anomaly induced effective action.This results in inducing of brane-worlds in accordance with AdS/CFT set-up aswarped compactification. The explicit, independent construction of quantumIt is demonstrated their complete equivalency for all quantum cosmologicalbrane-worlds under discussion, including several examples of classicalbrane-world black holes. This is different from quantum corrected 4d dilatonicgravity where de Sitter solution exists in Einstein but not in Jordan (string)frame. The role of quantum corrections on massive graviton perturbations aroundAnti-de Sitter brane is briefly discussed.
