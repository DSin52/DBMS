Approximation only by derivative (or more generally momentum) expansions,combined with reparametrization invariance, turns the continuousrenormalization group for quantum field theory into a set of partialdifferential equations which at fixed points become non-linear eigenvalueequations for the anomalous scaling dimension $\eta$. We review how theseequations provide a powerful and robust means of discovering and approximatingnon-perturbative continuum limits. Gauge fields are briefly discussed.Particular emphasis is placed on the r\^ole of reparametrization invariance,and the convergence of the derivative expansion is addressed.
