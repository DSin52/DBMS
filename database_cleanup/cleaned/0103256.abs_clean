We find the moduli space of multi-solitons in noncommutative scalar fieldtheories at large theta, in arbitrary dimension. The existence of a non-trivialmoduli space at leading order in 1/theta is a consequence of a Bogomolnyi boundobeyed by the kinetic energy of the theta=infinity solitons. In two spatialdimensions, the parameter space for k solitons is a Kahler de-singularizationof the symmetric product (R^2)^k/S_k. We exploit the existence of this moduliand T^2. However, we show that tori of area less than or equal to (2 pi theta)do not admit stable solitons. In four dimensions the moduli space provides anexplicit Kahler resolution of (R^4)^k/S_k. In general spatial dimension 2d, weshow it is isomorphic to the Hilbert scheme of k points in C^d, which for d > 2(and k > 3) is not smooth and can have multiple branches.
