The theory of non-linear realizations is used to derive the dynamics of thebranes of M theory. A crucial step in this procedure is to use the enlargedautomorphism group of the supersymmetry algebra recently introduced. The fieldstrengths of the worldvolume gauge fields arise as some of the Goldstone fieldsassociated with this automorphism group. The relationship to the superembeddingapproach is given.
