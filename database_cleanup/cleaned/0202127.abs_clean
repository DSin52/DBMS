We interpret cosmological evolution holographically as a renormalisationgroup flow in a dual Euclidean field theory, as suggested by the conjectureddS/CFT correspondence. Inflation is described by perturbing around theinfra-red fixed point of the dual field theory. The spectrum of the cosmicmicrowave background radiation is determined in terms of scaling violations inthe field theory. The dark energy allows similar, albeit less predictive,considerations. We discuss the cosmological fine-tuning problems from theholographic perspective.
