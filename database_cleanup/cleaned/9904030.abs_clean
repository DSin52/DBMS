Title: On mass-dependent subtraction and removal of the ambiguity in QED

renormalizationComments: 30 pages, latex, 4 figures

The QED renormalization is restudied by using a mass-dependent subtractionwhich is performed at a time-like renormalization point. The subtractionexactly respects necessary physical and mathematical requirements such as thegauge symmetry, the Lorentz- invariance and the mathematical convergence.Therefore, the renormalized results derived in the subtraction scheme arefaithful and have no ambiguity. Especially, it is proved that the solution ofthe renormalization group equation satisfied by a renormalized wave function,propagator or vertex can be fixed by applying the renormalization boundarycondition and of the form as given in the Feynman rules and, thus, an exactS-matrix element can be expressed in the form as written in the tree diagramapproximation provided that the coupling constant and the fermion mass arereplaced by their effective ones. In the one-loop approximation, the effectivecoupling constant and the effective fermion mass obtained by solving theirrenormalization group equations are given in rigorous and explicit expressionswhich are suitable in the whole range of distance. and exhibit physicallyreasonable asymptotic behaviors.
