In this comment on the recently published paper ``Global monopole inAsymptotically dS/ AdS Spacetime'' [Phys. Rev. D66 (2002), 107701], wereconsider global monopoles in asymptotic de Sitter/ Anti- de Sitterspace-time. In comparison to the mentioned publication, we find that theintroduction of a cosmological constant can not render a positive mass of theglobal monopole. Moreover, we find (confirmed by our numerical analysis) adifferent asymptotic behaviour of the metric functions.
