There exists a widely spread notion that gravitational effects can stronglyviolate global symmetries. It may lead to many important consequences. We willargue, in particular, that nonperturbative gravitational effects in the axiontheory lead to a strong violation of CP invariance unless they are suppressedby an extremely small factor 10^{-82}. One could hope that this problemdisappears if one represents the global symmetry of a pseudoscalar axion fieldas a gauge symmetry of the Ogievetsky-Polubarinov-Kalb-Ramond antisymmetrictensor field. We will show, however, that this gauge symmetry does not protectthe axion mass from quantum corrections. The amplitude of gravitational effectsviolating global symmetries could be strongly suppressed by e^{-S}, where S isthe action of a wormhole which may eat the global charge. Unfortunately, in awide variety of theories based on the Einstein theory of gravity the actionappears to be fairly small, S = O(10). However, we have found that theexistence of wormholes and the value of their action are extremely sensitive tothe structure of space on the nearly Planckian scale. We consider severalexamples (Kaluza-Klein theory, conformal anomaly, R^2 terms) which show thatmodifications of the Einstein theory on the length scale l ~ 10 M_P^{-1} maystrongly suppress violation of global symmetries. We have found also that instring theory there exists an additional suppression of topology change by thefactor e^{-{8\pi^2\over g^2}}. This effect is strong enough to save the axiontheory for the natural values of the stringy gauge coupling constant.
