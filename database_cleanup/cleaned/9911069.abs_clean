The electrogravity transformation is applied to the three-dimensionalEinstein field equations to obtain new multi-parameter families of black holesolutions. The Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole is shown to be aspecial case of one of these families. The causal structure, associated matter,as well as the mechanical and thermodynamical properties of some of thesolutions are discussed.
