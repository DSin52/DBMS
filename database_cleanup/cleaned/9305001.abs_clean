It is shown that it is possible to measure the Schr\"odinger wave of a singlequantum system. This provides a strong argument for associating physicalreality with a quantum state of a single system in sharp contrast with theusual approach in which the physical meaning of a quantum state is related onlyto an ensemble of identical systems. An apparent paradox between measurabilityof a quantum state of a single system and the relativistic causality isresolved.
