As a toy model to search for Hamiltonian formalism of the $AdS/CFT$correspondence, we examine a Hamiltonian formulation of the $AdS_2/CFT_1$correspondence emphasizing unitary representation theory of the symmetry. Inthe course of a canonical quantization of the bulk scalars, a particularisomorphism between the unitary irreducible representations in the bulk andboundary theories is found. This isomorphism defines the correspondence offield operators. It states that field operators of the bulk theory are fieldoperators of the boundary theory by taking their boundary values in a due way.The Euclidean continuation provides an operator formulation on the hyperboliccoordinates system. The associated Fock vacuum of the bulk theory is located atthe boundary, thereby identified with the boundary CFT vacuum. Thecorrespondence is interpreted as a simple mapping of the field operators actingon this unique vacuum. Generalization to higher dimensions is speculated.
