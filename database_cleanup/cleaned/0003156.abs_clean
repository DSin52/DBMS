PASCOS 99, Lake Tahoe, CA December 10-16 1999I contemplate the possibility that the mismatch between the maximallysymmetric point (the free fermionic point) and the strictly self-dual point inthe Narain moduli space plays a role in the string vacuum selection. The roleof self-duality in the recent formulation of quantum mechanics from anequivalence postulate, and the new perspective that it offers on thefoundations of quantum gravity and the origin of mass, are discussed.
