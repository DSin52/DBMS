An exact conformal field theory describing a four dimensional singular stringbackground is obtained by chiral gauging a $U(1)$ subgroup along withtranslations in $R$ of an $SL(2,R)\times R$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model. It isshown that the target space-time describes a four dimensional black membrane.Furthermore various duality transformed solutions are constructed. These arealso shown to correspond to various forms of four dimensional black membranes.
