We consider two model field theories on a noncommutative plane that havesmooth commutative limits. One is the single-component fermion theory withquartic interaction that vanishes identically in the commutative limit. Theother is a scalar-fermion theory, which extends the scalar field theory withquartic interaction by adding a fermion. We compute the bound state energiesand the two particle scattering amplitudes exactly.
