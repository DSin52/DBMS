In the spirit of classic works of Wilson on the renormalization group andoperator product expansion, a new framework for the study of the theory spaceof euclidean quantum field theories has been introduced. This formalism isparticularly useful for elucidating the structure of the short-distanceexpansions of the $n$-point functions of a renormalizable quantum field theorynear a non-trivial fixed point. We review and apply this formalism in the studyof the scaling limit of the two dimensional massive Ising model.Renormalization group analysis and operator product expansions determine allthe non-analytic mass dependence of the short-distance expansion of thecorrelation functions. An extension of the first order variational formula tohigher orders provides a manifestly finite scheme for the perturbativecalculation of the operator product coefficients to any order in parameters. Aperturbative expansion of the correlation functions follows. We implement thisscheme for a systematic study of correlation functions involving two spinoperators. We show how the necessary non-trivial integrals can be calculated.As two concrete examples we explicitly calculate the short-distance expansionof the spin-spin correlation function to third order and the spin-spin-energydensity correlation function to first order in the mass. We also discuss theapplicability of our results to perturbations near other non-trivial fixedpoints corresponding to other unitary minimal models.
