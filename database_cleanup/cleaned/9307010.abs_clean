The requirements of conformal invariance for two and three point functionsfor general dimension $d$ on flat space are investigated. A compact grouptheoretic construction of the three point function for arbitrary spin fields ispresented and it is applied to various cases involving conserved vectoroperators and the energy momentum tensor. The restrictions arising from theassociated conservation equations are investigated. It is shown that there are,for general $d$, three linearly independent conformal invariant forms for thethree point function of the energy momentum tensor, although for $d=3$ thereare two and for $d=2$ only one. The form of the three point function is alsodemonstrated to simplify considerably when all three points lie on a straightline. Using this the coefficients of the conformal invariant point functionsare calculated for free scalar and fermion theories in general dimensions andfor abelian vector fields when $d=4$. Ward identities relating three and twopoint functions are also discussed. This requires careful analysis of thesingularities in the short distance expansion and the method of differentialregularisation is found convenient. For $d=4$ the coefficients appearing in theenergy momentum tensor three point function are related to the coefficients ofthe two possible terms in the trace anomaly for a conformal theory on a curvedspace background.
