Title: Division Algebras, (1,9)-Space-Time, Matter-Antimatter Mixing

Authors: Geoffrey Dixon

Comments: 9 pages, BRX TH-315

The tensor product of the division algebras, which is a kernel for thestructure of the Standard Model, is also a root for the Clifford algebra of(1,9)-space-time. A conventional Dirac Lagrangian, employing the (1,9)-Diracoperator acting on the Standard Model hyperfield, gives rise to matter intoantimatter transitions not mediated by any gauge field. These transitions areeliminated by restricting the dependencies of the components of the hyperfieldon the extra six dimensions, which appear in this context as a complex triple.
