SystemsWe are investigating the properties of vacuum and boundary states in the CFTof free bosons under the conformal transformation. We show that transformedvacuum (boundary state) is given in terms of tau-functions of dispersionless KP(Toda) hierarchies. Applications of this approach to string field theory isconsidered. We recognize in Neumann coefficients the matrix of secondderivatives of tau-function of dispersionless KP and identify surface stateswith the conformally transformed vacuum of free field theory.
