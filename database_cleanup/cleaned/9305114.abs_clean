We present a ``natural finitization'' of the fermionic q-series (certaingeneralizations of the Rogers-Ramanujan sums) which were recently conjecturedto be equal to Virasoro characters of the unitary minimal conformal fieldtheory (CFT) M(p,p+1). Within the quasi-particle interpretation of thefermionic q-series this finitization amounts to introducing an ultravioletcutoff, which -- contrary to a lattice spacing -- does not modify the lineardispersion relation. The resulting polynomials are conjectured (proven, forp=3,4) to be equal to corner transfer matrix (CTM) sums which arise in thecomputation of order parameters in regime III of the r=p+1 RSOS model ofAndrews, Baxter, and Forrester. Following Schur's proof of the Rogers-Ramanujanidentities, these authors have shown that the infinite-lattice limit of the CTMsums gives what later became known as the Rocha-Caridi formula for the Virasorocharacters. Thus we provide a proof of the fermionic q-series representationfor the Virasoro characters for p=4 (the case p=3 is ``trivial''), in additionto extending the remarkable connection between CFT and off-critical RSOSmodels. We also discuss finitizations of the CFT modular-invariant partitionfunctions.
