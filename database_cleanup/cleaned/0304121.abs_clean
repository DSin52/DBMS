All consistent interactions in a three-dimensional theory with tensor gaugefields of degrees two and three are obtained by means of the deformation of thesolution to the master equation combined with cohomological techniques. Thelocal BRST cohomology of this model allows the deformation of the Lagrangianaction, accompanying gauge symmetries and gauge algebra. The relationship withthe Chern--Simons theory is discussed.
