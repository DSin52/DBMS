Using Wilson-Polchinski renormalization group equations, we give a simple newproof of decoupling in a $\phi^4$-type scalar field theory involving two realscalar fields (one is heavy with mass $M$ and the other light). Then, to allorders in perturbation theory, it is shown that effects of virtual heavyparticles up to the order $1/M^{2N_0}$ can be systematically incorporated intolight-particle theory via effective local vertices of canonical dimension atmost $4+2N_0$. The couplings for vertices of dimension $4+2N$ are of order$1/M^{2N}$ and are systematically calculable. All this is achieved throughintuitive dimensional arguments without resorting to complicated graphicalarguments or convergence theorems.
