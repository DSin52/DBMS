We give a complete analysis of the projective unitary irreduciblerepresentations of the Poincar\'e group in 1+2 dimensions applying Mackeytheorem and using an explicit formula for the universal covering group of theLorentz group in 1+2 dimensions. We provide explicit formulae for allrepresentations.
