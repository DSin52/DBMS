We discuss higher loop corrections to gauge coupling renormalization in thecontext of gauge coupling unification via Kaluza-Klein thresholds. We show thatin the case N=1 supersymmetric compactifications the one-loop thresholdcontributions are dominant, while the higher loop correction are subleading.This is due to the fact that at heavy Kaluza-Klein levels the spectrum as wellas the interactions are N=2 supersymmetric. In particular, we give twodifferent arguments leading to this result - one is field theoretic, while thesecond one utilizes the power of string perturbation techniques. To illustrateour discussions we perform explicit two-loop computations of variouscorrections to gauge couplings within this framework. We also remark onphenomenological applications of our discussions in the context of TeV-scalebrane world.
