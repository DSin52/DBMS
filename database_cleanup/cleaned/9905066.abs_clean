The moduli space of charge k SU(2) BPS monopoles is diffeomorphic to themoduli space of degree k rational maps between Riemann spheres. In this note wedescribe a numerical algorithm to compute the monopole fields and energydensity from the rational map. The results for some symmetric examples arepresented.
