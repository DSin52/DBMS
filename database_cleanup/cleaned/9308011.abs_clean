Title: Two-Dimensional Black Hole and Nonperturbative String Theory

Authors: Avinash Dhar

Comments: 28p, TIFR-TH-93/34

We discuss the interpertation of the $c=1$ matrix model as two-dimensionalstring theory in a dilaton-black hole background. The nonperturbativeformulation of $c=1$ matrix model in terms of an integrable model ofnonrelativistic fermions enables us to study the quantum fate of the classicalblack hole singularity. We find that the classical singularity is wiped out byquantum corrections when summed to all orders.
