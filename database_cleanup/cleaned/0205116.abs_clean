Using the Nahm transform we investigate doubly periodic charge one SU(2)instantons with radial symmetry. Two special points where the Nahm zero modeshave softer singularities are identified as constituent locations. To supportthis picture, the action density is computed analytically and numericallywithin a two dimensional slice containing the two constituents. For particularvalues of the parameters the torus can be cut in half yielding two copies of atwisted charge 1/2 instanton. Such objects comprise a single constituent.
