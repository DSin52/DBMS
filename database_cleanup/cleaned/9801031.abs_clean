The algebraic structure of Thermo Field Dynamics lies in the $q$-deformationof the algebra of creation and annihilation operators. Doubling of the degreesof freedom, tilde-conjugation rules, and Bogoliubov transformation for bosonsand fermions are recognized as algebraic properties of $h_{q}(1)$ and of$h_{q}(1|1)$, respectively.
