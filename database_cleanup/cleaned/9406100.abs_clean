We demonstrate that the large-N expansion of Wilson loop expectation valuesin SO(N) and Sp(N) Yang-Mills theory on orientable and nonorientable surfaceshas a natural description as a weighted sum over covers of the given surface.The sum takes the form of the perturbative expansion of an open string theory.The derivation makes contact with the classification of branched covers byGabai and Kazez. Comparison with the analogous results for the chiral sectorsof QCD_2 is instructive for both cases.
