Form factor sequences of an integrable QFT can be defined axiomatically assolutions of a system of recursive functional equations, known as ``form factorequations''. We show that their solution can be replaced with the study of therepresentation theory of a novel algebra F(S). It is associated with a givenTTS algebra as a subalgebra. (ii) Form factors arise as thermal vector statesover F(S) of temperature 1/2\pi. The thermal ground states are incorrespondence to the local operators of the QFT. (iii) The underlying `finitetemperature structure' is indirectly related to the ``Unruh effect'' in Rindlerspacetime. In F(S) it is manifest through modular structures (j,\delta) in thesense of algebraic QFT, which can be implemented explicitly in terms of the TTSgenerators.
