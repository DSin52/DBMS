The action for a relativistic free particle of mass $m$ receives acontribution $-mds$ from a path segment of infinitesimal length $ds$. Usingthis action in a path integral, one can obtain the Feynman propagator for aspinless particle of mass $m$. If one of the effects of quantizing gravity isto introduce a minimum length scale $L_P$ in the spacetime, then one wouldexpect the segments of paths with lengths less than $L_P$ to be suppressed inthe path integral. Assuming that the path integral amplitude is invariant underthe `duality' transformation $ds\to L_P^2/ds$, one can calculate the modifiedFeynman propagator. I show that this propagator is the same as the one obtainedspacetime interval $(x-y)^2$ to $(x-y)^2+L_P^2$. This equivalence suggests adeep relationship between introducing a `zero-point-length' to the spacetimeand postulating invariance of path integral amplitudes under dualitytransformations.
