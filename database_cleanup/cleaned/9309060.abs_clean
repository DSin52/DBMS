78712, to appear in J. Physics AThe topology of the non-adiabatic parameter space bundle is discussed forevolution of exact cyclic state vectors in Berry's original example of splitangular momentum eigenstates. It turns out that the change in topology occursat a critical frequency. The first Chern number that classifies these bundlesis proportional to angular momentum. The non-adiabatic principal bundle overthe parameter space is not well-defined at the critical frequency.
