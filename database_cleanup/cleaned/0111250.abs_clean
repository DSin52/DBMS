Title: Parity Doubling, Zitterbewegung, and Rest Mass for Spin 1

Laboratory)Comments: This paper shows how a generalization of Dirac's method of generating

a finite velocity, hence nonzero mass, of a spin 1/2 particle built out ofmassless components works also for spin-1 particles, without any need tointroduce spin-zero companionsA 6-component "wave function" (not field, but S-matrix interpretable) for amassive spin-1 particle parallels the Dirac "chirality-doubled" 4-componentwave function for a spin-1/2 particle, by pairing two wave functions for samespin but opposite "handedness". The correlated "opposite-parity" pair ofcomplex 3-vectors defines a fluctuating spin-correlated lightlike ``internalvelocity" as well as an independent "external rapidity". Extension fromfermions to vector bosons of the velocity-fluctuation ("zitterbewegung")interpretation of rest mass weakens theoretical motivation for elementaryscalar bosons.
