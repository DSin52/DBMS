We consider the non-relativistic effective field theory of ``extreme blackholes'' in the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with an arbitrary dilatoncoupling. We investigate finite-temperature behavior of gas of ``extreme blackholes'' using the effective theory. The total energy of the classical many-bodysystem is also derived.
