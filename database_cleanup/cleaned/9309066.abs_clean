ICTP Summer School on String Theory and Related Topics, July, 1993)An infinite number of topological conformal algebras with varying centralcharges are explicitly shown to be present in $2d$ gravity (treated both in theconformal gauge and in the light-cone gauge) coupled to minimal matter. Thecentral charges of the underlying $N=2$ theory in two different gauge choicesare generically found to be different. The physical states in these theoriesare briefly discussed in the light of the $N=2$ superconformal symmetry.
