We consider noncommutative {\cal N}=4 supersymmetric U(N) Yang-Mills theory.Using the {\cal N}=1 superfield formalism and the background field method wecompute one-loop four point contributions to the effective action and comparethe result with the field theory limit from open string amplitudes in thepresence of a constant B-field.
