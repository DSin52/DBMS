We develop a systematic method of directly embedding supermembrane wrappedaround a circle into matrix string theory. Our purpose is to study connectionbetween matrix string and membrane from an entirely 11 dimensional point ofview. The method does neither rely upon the DLCQ limit nor upon stringdualities. In principle, this enables us to construct matrix string theory witharbitrary backgrounds from the corresponding supermembrane theory. As asimplest application of the formalism, the matrix-string action with a 7 branebackground (Kaluza-Klein Melvin solution) with nontrivial RR vector field isgiven.
