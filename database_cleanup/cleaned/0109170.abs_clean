We study IIB string theory on the orbifold R^8/Gamma with discrete torsionwhere Gamma is an arbitrary subgroup of U(4). We extend some previously knownidentities for discrete torsion in abelian groups to nonabelian groups. Weconstruct explicit formulas for a large class of fractional D-brane states andprove that the physical states are classified by projective representations ofthe orbifold group as predicted originally by Douglas. The boundary states arefound to be linear combinations of Ishibashi states with the coefficients beingcharacters of the projective representations.
