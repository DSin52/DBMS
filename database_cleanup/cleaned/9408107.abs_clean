A computer program has been developed which generates Feynman graphsautomatically for scattering and decay processes in non-Abelian gauge theory ofhigh-energy physics. A new acceleration method is presented for both generatingand eliminating graphs. This method has been shown to work quite efficientlyfor any order of coupling constants in any kind of theoretical model. A utilityprogram is also available for drawing generated graphs. These programs consistof the most basic parts of the GRACE system, which is now used to automaticallycalculate tree and one-loop processes.
