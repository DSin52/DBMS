A complete proof of the No-ghost Theorem for bosonic and fermionic stringtheories on AdS_3, or the group manifold of SU(1,1), is given. It is then shownthat the restriction on the spin (in terms of the level) that is necessary toobtain a ghost-free spectrum corresponds to the stringy exclusion principle ofMaldacena and Strominger.
