A recently proposed method for the characterization and analysis of localequilibrium states in relativistic quantum field theory is applied to a simplemodel. Within this model states are identified which are locally (but notglobally) in thermal equilibrium and it is shown that their local thermalproperties evolve according to macroscopic equations. The largest space-timeregions in which local equilibrium states can exist are timelike cones. Thus,although the model does not describe dissipative effects, such states fix in anatural manner a time direction. Moreover, generically they determine adistinguished space-time point where a singularity in the temperature (a hotbang) must have occurred if local equilibrium prevailed thereafter. The resultsillustrate how the breaking of the time reflection symmetry at macroscopicscales manifests itself in a microscopic setting.
