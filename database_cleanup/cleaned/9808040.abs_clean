We discuss the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) cohomology and Hodgedecomposition theorem for the two dimensional free U(1) gauge theory. Inaddition to the usual BRST charge, we derive a local, conserved and nilpotentco(dual)-BRST charge under which the gauge-fixing term remains invariant. Weexpress the Hodge decomposition theorem in terms of these charges and theLaplacian operator. We take a single photon state in the quantum Hilbert spaceand demonstrate the notion of gauge invariance, no-(anti)ghost theorem,transversality of photon and establish the topological nature of this theory byexploiting the concepts of BRST cohomology and Hodge decomposition theorem. Infact, the topological nature of this theory is encoded in the vanishing of theLaplacian operator when equations of motion are exploited. On the twodimensional compact manifold, we derive two sets of topological invariants withrespect to the conserved and nilpotent BRST- and co-BRST charges and expressthe Lagrangian density of the theory as the sum of terms that are BRST- andco-BRST invariants. Mathematically, this theory captures together some of thekey features of both Witten- and Schwarz type of topological field theories.
