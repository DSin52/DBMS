Title: S-Branes, Negative Tension Branes and Cosmology

Authors: F. Quevedo, G. Tasinato and I. Zavala

Comments: 10 pages. Talks given at

Conference on Supersymmetry and Unification of Fundamental Interactions'',DESY, Hamburg, Germany, 17-23 June 2002, and ``The 1st InternationalConference on String Phenomenology'', Oxford, July 6 - 11, 2002. ReferencesaddedA general class of solutions of string background equations is studied andits physical interpretations are presented. These solutions correspond togeneralizations of the standard black p-brane solutions to surfaces withcurvature k=-1,0. The relation with the recently introduced S-branes isprovided. The mass, charge, entropy and Hawking temperature are computed,illustrating the interpretation in terms of negative tension branes. Theircosmological interpretation is discussed as well as their potential instabilityunder small perturbations.
