An application of the Newman-Penrose dyad formalism for description oftensionless (null) string dynamics in 4D Minkowski spacetime is studied in abackground of antisymmetric fields. We present a special class of backgroundantisymmetric fields which admits exact solutions of the null string motionequations and formulate a sufficient condition of the absence of interaction ofa null string with such fields.
