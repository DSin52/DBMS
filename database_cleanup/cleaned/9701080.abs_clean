Using the general notions of Batalin, Fradkin, Fradkina and Tyutin to convertsecond class systems into first class ones, we present a gauge invariantformulation of the massive Yang-Mills theory by embedding it in an extendedphase space. The infinite set of correction terms necessary for obtaining theinvolutive constraints and Hamiltonian is explicitly computed and expressed ina closed form. It is also shown that the extra fields introduced in thecorrection terms are exactly identified with the auxiliary scalars used in thegeneralized St\"uckelberg formalism for converting a gauge noninvariantLagrangian into a gauge invariant form.
