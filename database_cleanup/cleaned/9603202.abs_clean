We rewrite the 1+1 Dirac equation in light cone coordinates in twosignificant forms, and solve them exactly using the classical calculus offinite differences. The complex form yields ``Feynman's Checkerboard''---aweighted sum over lattice paths. The rational, real form can also beinterpreted in terms of bit-strings.
