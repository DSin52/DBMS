We investigate several models of coupled scalar fields that present discreteZ_2, Z_2 x Z_2, Z_3 and other symmetries. These models support topologicaldomain wall solutions of the BPS and non-BPS type. The BPS solutions arestable, but the stability of the non-BPS solutions may depend on the parametersthat specify the models. The BPS and non-BPS states give rise to bags, and alsoto three-junctions that may allow the presence of networks of topologicaldefects. In particular, we show that the non-BPS defects of a specific modelthat engenders the Z_3 symmetry give rise to a stable regular hexagonal networkof domain walls.
