It is shown that there is no chirally symmetric vacuum state in the {cal N}=1supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The values of the gluino condensate and thevacuum energy density are found out through a direct instanton calculation. Aqualitative picture of domain wall properties is presented, and a newexplanation of the phenomenon of strings ending on the wall is proposed.
