We construct intersecting D5-brane orbifold models that yield the(non-supersymmetric) standard model up to vector-like matter andcharged-singlet scalars.The models are constrained by the requirement that twisted tadpoles cancel,and that the gauge boson coupled to the weak hypercharge $U(1)_Y$ does not geta string-scale mass via a generalised Green-Schwarz mechanism. Gauge couplingconstant ratios close to those measured are easily obtained for reasonablevalues of the parameters, consistently with having the string scale close tothe electroweak scale, as required to avoid the hierarchy problem.
