Title: Heisenberg quantization for the systems of identical particles and the

Pauli exclusion principle in noncommutative spacesComments: 8 pages, 1 figure

We study the Heisenberg quantization for the systems of identical particlesin noncommtative spaces. We get fermions and bosons as a special cases of ourargument, in the same way as commutative case and therefore we conclude thatthe Pauli exclusion principle is also valid in noncommutative spaces.
