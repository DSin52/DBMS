Comments: 4 pages, Latex, uses cargese.cls, proceedings of Cargese Summer

School on "Progress in String Theory and M theory"We review open descendants of non-supersymmetric type IIB asymmetricorbifolds with zero cosmological constant. We find that supersymmetry remainsunbroken on the branes at all mass levels, whereas it is broken in the bulk.
