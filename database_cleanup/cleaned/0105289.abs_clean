Authors: B. de Wit, A. Marshakov

Comments: Contributions to the proceedings of the workshop `Classical and

Quantum Integrable Systems' Protvino, 2001. To appear in Theor. Math. PhysicsJournal-ref: Theor.Math.Phys. 129 (2001) 1504-1510; Teor.Mat.Fiz. 129 (2001)

230-238We consider the associativity (or WDVV) equations in the form they appear inSeiberg-Witten theory and prove that they are covariant under genericelectric-magnetic duality transformations. We discuss the consequences of thiscovariance from various perspectives.
