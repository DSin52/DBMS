Title: Supersymmetric Scattering in Two Dimensions

Amsterdam)Comments: 3 pages, wstwocl.sty, epsfig.sty, talk delivered at the HEP95

Conference of the EPS, Brussels, July/August 1995We briefly review results on two-dimensional supersymmetric quantum fieldtheories that exhibit factorizable particle scattering. Our particular focus ison a series of $N\!=\!1$ supersymmetric theories, for which exact $S$-matriceshave been obtained. A Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) analysis for thesetheories has confirmed the validity of the proposed $S$-matrices and haspointed at an interesting `folding' relation with a series of $N\!=\!2$supersymmetric theories.
