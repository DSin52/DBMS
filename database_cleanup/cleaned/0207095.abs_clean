in the manuscriptApplied to the electroweak interactions, the theory of Lie algebra extensionssuggests a mechanism by which the boson masses are generated without resourceto spontaneous symmetry breaking. It starts from a gauge theory without anyadditional scalar field. All the couplings predicted by the Weinberg-Salamtheory are present, and a few others which are nevertheless consistent withinthe model.
