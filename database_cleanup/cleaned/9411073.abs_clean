Closed expressions for the Green function and amplitude of the scalarparticle scattering in the external gravitational field $g_{\mu\nu}(x)$ arefound in the form of functional integrals. It is shown that, as compared withthe scattering on the vector potential, the tensor character of thegravitational field leads to a more rapid increase of the cross section withincreasing energy. Discrete energy levels of particles are obtained in theNewton potential.
