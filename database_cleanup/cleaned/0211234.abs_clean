Title: Seiberg Duality in Matrix Models II

Authors: Bo Feng and Yang-Hui He

Comments: 11 pages

In this paper we continue the investigation, within the context of theDijkgraaf-Vafa Programme, of Seiberg duality in matrix models as initiated inhep-th/0211202, by allowing degenerate mass deformations. In this case, thereare some massless fields which remain and the theory has a moduli space. Withthis illustrative example, we propose a general methodology for performing therelevant matrix model integrations and addressing the corresponding fieldtheories which have non-trivial IR behaviour, and which may or may not havetree-level superpotentials.
