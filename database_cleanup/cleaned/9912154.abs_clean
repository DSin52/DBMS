We study the action of picture-changing and spectral flow operators on aground ring of ghost number zero operators in the chiral BRST cohomology of theclosed N=2 string and describe an infinite set of symmetry charges acting onphysical states. The transformations of physical string states are comparedwith symmetries of self-dual gravity which is the effective field theory of theclosed N=2 string. We derive all infinitesimal symmetries of the self-dualgravity equations in 2+2 dimensional spacetime and introduce an infinitehierarchy of commuting flows on the moduli space of self-dual metrics. Thedependence on moduli parameters can be recovered by solving the equations ofthe SDG hierarchy associated with an infinite set of abelian symmetriesgenerated recursively from translations. These non-local abelian symmetries areshown to coincide with the hidden abelian string symmetries responsible for thevanishing of most scattering amplitudes. Therefore, N=2 string theory"predicts" not only self-dual gravity but also the SDG hierarchy.
