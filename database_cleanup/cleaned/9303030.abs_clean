The Laughlin states for $N$ interacting electrons at the plateaus of thefractional Hall effect are studied in the thermodynamic limit of large $N$. Itis shown that this limit leads to the semiclassical regime for these states,thereby relating their stability to their semiclassical nature. The equivalentproblem of two-dimensional plasmas is solved analytically, to leading order for$N\to\infty$, by the saddle point approximation - a two-dimensional extensionof the method used in random matrix models of quantum gravity and gaugetheories. To leading order, the Laughlin states describe classical droplets offluids with uniform density and sharp boundaries, as expected from the Laughlin``plasma analogy''. In this limit, the dynamical $W_\infty$-symmetry of thequantum Hall states expresses the kinematics of the area-preservingdeformations of incompressible liquid droplets.
