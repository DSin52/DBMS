In a recent work, the consequences of quantizing a real scalar field $\Phi$according to generalized ``quon'' statistics in a dynamically evolving curvedspacetime (~which, prior to some initial time and subsequent to some latertime, is flat~) were considered. Here a similar calculation is performed; thistime we quantize $\Phi$ via the Calogero-Vasiliev oscillator algebra, describedby a real parameter $\nu > -1/2$. It is found that both conservation ( $\nu\rightarrow \nu$ ) and anticonservation ( $\nu \rightarrow - \nu$ ) ofstatistics is allowed. We find that for mathematical consistency the Bogoliubovcoefficients associated with the $i$'th field mode must satisfy $|\alpha_i |^2
