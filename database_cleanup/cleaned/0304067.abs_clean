Authors: Yu. M. Zinoviev

Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX 2e, no figures

In this paper we give explicit first order Lagrangian formulation for mixedsymmetry tensor fields \Phi_{[\mu\nu],\alpha}, T_{[\mu\nu\alpha],\beta} andR_{[\mu\nu],[\alpha\beta]}. We show that such Lagrangians could be written in avery suggestive form similar to the well known tetrad formalism in gravity.Such description could simplify the investigations of possible interactions forthese fields. Some examples of interactions are given.
