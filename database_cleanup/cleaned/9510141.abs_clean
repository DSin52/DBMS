We introduce the self-dual abelian gauged $O(3)$ sigma models where theMaxwell and Chern-Simons terms constitute the kinetic terms for the gaugefield. These models have quite rich structures and various limits. Our modelsare found to exhibit both symmetric and broken phases of the gauge group. Wediscuss the pure Chern-Simons limit in some detail and study rotationallysymmetric solitons.
