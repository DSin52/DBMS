Using the algebraic geometry method of Berenstein et al (hep-th/0005087), wereconsider the derivation of the non commutative quintic algebra${\mathcal{A}}_{nc}(5)$ and derive new representations by choosing differentsets of Calabi-Yau charges ${C_{i}^{a}}$. Next we extend these results tohigher $d$ complex dimension non commutative Calabi-Yau hypersurface algebras${\mathcal{A}}_{nc}(d+2)$. We derive and solve the set of constraint eqscarrying the non commutative structure in terms of Calabi-Yau charges anddiscrete torsion. Finally we construct the representations of${\mathcal{A}}_{nc}(d+2) $ preserving manifestly the Calabi-Yau condition $\sum_{i}C_{i}^{a}=0$ and give comments on the non commutative subalgebras.
