Title: Spinons and parafermions in fermion cosets

Authors: D.C.Cabra

Comments: 6 pages, Latex file. Invited talk at International Seminar dedicated

to the memory of D.V.Volkov, Kharkov, January 5-7, 1997We introduce a set of gauge invariant fermion fields in fermionic cosetmodels and show that they play a very central role in the description ofseveral Conformal Field Theories (CFT's). In particular we discuss the explicitrealization of primaries and their OPE in unitary minimal models, parafermionfields in $Z_k$ CFT's and that of spinon fields in $SU(N)_k, k=1$Wess-Zumino-Witten models (WZW) theories. The higher level case ($k>1$) will bebriefly discussed. Possible applications to QHE systems and spin-ladder systemsare addressed.
