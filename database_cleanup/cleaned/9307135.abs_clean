Title: The Wigner-Weyl formalism and the semi-classical relativistic

approximationAuthors: J. Mourad

Comments: 6 pages

The relativistic semi-classical approximation for a free massive particle isstudied using the Wigner-Weyl formalism. A non-covariant Wigner function isproposed using the Newton-Wigner position operator. The perturbative solutionfor the time evolution is found. Causality is found to be perturbativelyrespected.
