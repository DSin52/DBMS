Recent results of Trudinger on Isoperimetric Inequalities for non-convexbodies are applied to the gravitational collapse of a lightlike shell ofmatter to form a black hole. Using some integral identities for co-dimensiontwo surfaces in Minkowski spacetime, the area $A$ of the apparent horizon isshown to be bounded above in terms of the mass $M$ by the $16 \pi G^2 M^2$,which is consistent with the Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis. The results holdin four spacetime dimensions and above.
