failed to recognize W(2,8) at c=-3164/23 and c=-712/7 as members of theminimal series of the Casimir algebras WE_7 resp. WE_8. This lead to somemisleading side-remarks in the abstract, the conclusion, and in particular,the introductionJournal-ref: Phys.Lett. B308 (1993) 42-50

In 2D conformal quantum field theory, we continue a systematic study ofW-algebras with two and three generators and their highest weightrepresentations focussing mainly on rational models. We review the known factsabout rational models of W(2,\delta)-algebras. Our new rational models ofW-algebras with two generators all belong to one of the known series. Themajority of W-algebras with three generators -including the new onesconstructed in this letter- can be explained as subalgebras or truncations ofCasimir algebras. Nonetheless, for one solution of W(2,4,6) we reveal somefeatures that do not fit into the pattern of Casimir algebras or orbifoldsthereof. This shows that there are more W-algebras than those predicted fromCasimir algebras (or Toda field theories). However, most of the known rationalconformal field theories belong to the minimal series of some Casimir algebra.
