Characteristics of Abelian dyon - fermion bound system, parity - violatingeffects, a new series of energy spectra, effects related to the non - vanishingelectric dipole moment, feature of spin orientation etc, are analyzed andcompared with hydrogen - like atom. These analyses explore possibility of a newapproach of searching for dyons under bound condition.
