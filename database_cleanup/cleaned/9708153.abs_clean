Title: Symmetries for generating string cosmologies

Authors: E. J. Copeland, James E. Lidsey and David Wands

Comments: Substantially extended version with new sections on further

symmetries and anisotropic cosmological solutions. New title. To appear inPhysical Review D. 13 pages, LaTeX, no figuresWe discuss the symmetry properties of the low-energy effective action of thetype IIB superstring that may be employed to derive four-dimensional solutions.A truncated effective action, compactified on a six-torus, but including bothNeveu/Schwarz-Neveu/Schwarz and Ramond-Ramond field strengths, can be expressedas a non-linear sigma model which is invariant under global SL(3,R)transformations. This group contains as a sub-group the SL(2,R) symmetry of theten-dimensional theory and a discrete Z2 reflection symmetry which leads to afurther SL(2,R) sub-group. The symmetries are employed to analyse a generalclass of spatially homogeneous cosmological solutions with non-trivialRamond-Ramond fields.
