We present an alternative N=2 supergravity multiplet coupled to n copies ofvector multiplets and n' copies of hypermultiplets in five dimensions. Oursupergravity multiplet contains a single antisymmetric tensor and a dilaton,which are natural Neveu-Schwarz massless fields in superstring theory. Theabsence of the explicit Chern-Simons terms in our lagrangian deletes thenon-trivial constraints on the couplings of vector multiplets in theconventional formulation. The scalars in the vector multiplets form thesigma-model for the coset SO(n,1) / SO(n), like those in the vector multipletscoupled to N=1 supergravity in nine dimensions, while the scalars in thehypermultiplets form that for the quaternionic Kahler manifold Sp(n',1) /Sp(n') X Sp(1). We also perform the gauging of the SO(2) subgroup of the Sp(1)= SL(2,R) automorphism group of N=2 supersymmetry. Our result is alsogeneralized to singular 5D space-time as in the conventional formulation, as apreliminary for supersymmetric Randall-Sundrum brane world scenario.
