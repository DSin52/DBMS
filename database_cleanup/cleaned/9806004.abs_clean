In the context of the bulk-boundary correspondence we study the correlationfunctions arising on a boundary for different types of boundary conditions. Themost general condition is the mixed one interpolating between the Neumann andDirichlet conditions. We obtain the general expressions for the correlators ona boundary in terms of Green's function in the bulk for the Dirichlet, Neumannand mixed boundary conditions and establish the relations between thecorrelation functions. As an instructive example we explicitly obtain theboundary correlators corresponding to the mixed condition on a plane boundary$R^d$ of a domain in flat space $R^{d+1}$. The phases of the boundary theorywith correlators of the Neumann and Dirichlet types are determined. Theboundary correlation functions on sphere $S^d$ are calculated for the Dirichletdomain in flat space $R^{d+1}$ and when it is a boundary at infinity of Anti-DeSitter space $AdS_{d+1}$. For massless in the bulk theory the Neumanncorrelator on the boundary of AdS space is shown to have universal logarithmicbehavior in all AdS spaces. In the massive case it is found to be finite at thecoinciding points. We argue that the Neumann correlator may have a dualtwo-dimensional description. The structure of the correlators obtained, theirconformal nature and some recurrent relations are analyzed. We identify theDirichlet and Neumann phases living on the boundary of AdS space and discusstheir evolution when the location of the boundary changes from infinity to thecenter of the AdS space.
