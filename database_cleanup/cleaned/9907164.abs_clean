F-theory on K3 admits non-BPS states that are represented as string junctionsextending between 7-branes. We classify the non-BPS states which are guaranteedto be stable on account of charge conservation and the existence of a region ofmoduli space where the 7-branes supporting the junction can be isolated fromthe rest of the branes. We find three possibilities; the 7-brane configurationsO7-plane, whose stable non-BPS state was identified before, (ii) the exoticaffine E_1 algebra, whose stable non-BPS state seems to be genuinelynon-perturbative, and, (iii) the affine E_2 algebra representing a D7-branenear a pair of O7-planes. As a byproduct of our work we construct explicitlyall 7-brane configurations that can be isolated in a K3. These includenon-collapsible configurations of affine type.
