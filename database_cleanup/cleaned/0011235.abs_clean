(2001) 908-945A plausible physical interpretation of the renormalizability condition isgiven. It is shown that renormalizable quantum field theories describe suchsystems wherein the tendency to collapse associated with vacuum fluctuations ofattractive forces is suppressed by vacuum fluctuations of kinetic energy.Relaying on the classification of topological types of evolution of pointparticles and analysing the problem of the fall to the centre, we obtain ageneral criterion for preventability of collapse which states that the spectrumof the Hamiltonian must be bounded from below. The holographic principle isused to explain the origin of anomalies and make precise the relation betweenthe renormalizability and the reversibility.
