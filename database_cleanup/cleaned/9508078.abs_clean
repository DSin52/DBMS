A large class of four-dimensional supersymmetric ground states of closedsuperstrings with a non-zero mass gap are constructed. For such ground stateswe turn on chromo-magnetic fields as well as curvature. The exact spectrum asfunction of the chromo-magnetic fields and curvature is derived. We examine thebehavior of the spectrum, and find that there is a maximal value for themagnetic field $H_{\rm max}\sim M_{\rm planck}^2$. At this value all statesthat couple to the magnetic field become infinitely massive and decouple. Wealso find tachyonic instabilities for strong background fields of the order${\cal O}(\mu M_{\rm planck})$ where $\mu$ is the mass gap of the theory.Unlike the field theory case, we find that such ground states become stableagain for magnetic fields of the order ${\cal O}(M^2_{\rm planck})$. Theimplications of these results are discussed.
