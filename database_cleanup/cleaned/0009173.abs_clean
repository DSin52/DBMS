Zero-point fluctuations in quantum fields give rise to observable forcesbetween material bodies, the so-called Casimir forces. In this lecture Ipresent some results of the theory of the Casimir effect, primarily formulatedin terms of Green's functions. There is an intimate relation between theCasimir effect and van der Waals forces. Applications to conductors anddielectric bodies of various shapes will be given for the cases of scalar,electromagnetic, and fermionic fields. The dimensional dependence of the effectthe Casimir effect and the phenomenon of sonoluminescence?
