Many string theories contain states which are not BPS, but are stable due tocharge conservation. In many cases the description of these states in thestrong coupling limit remains unknown despite the existence of a weakly coupleddual theory. However, we show that in some cases duality symmetries in stringtheory do enable us to identify these states in the strong coupling limit andcalculate their masses. We also speculate that in some of the other cases themissing states might arise from non-supersymmetric analog of D0-branes.
