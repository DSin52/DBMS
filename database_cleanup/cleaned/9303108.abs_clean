We derive the recursive equations for the form factors of the local hermitianoperators in the Bullough-Dodd model. At the self-dual point of the theory, theform factors of the fundamental field of the Bullough-Dodd model are equal tothose of the fundamental field of the Sinh-Gordon model at a specific value ofthe coupling constant.
