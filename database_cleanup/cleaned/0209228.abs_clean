We develop an unhiggsing procedure for finding the D-brane probe world volumegauge theory for blowups of geometries whose gauge theory data are known. Asspecific applications we unhiggs the well-studied theories for the cone overthe third del Pezzo surface. We arrive at what we call pseudo del Pezzos andthese will constitute a first step toward the understanding of higher, nontoric del Pezzos. Moreover, our methods and results give further support fortoric duality as well as obtaining superpotentials from global symmetryconsiderations.
