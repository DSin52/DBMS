Title: Modified mode-expansion on a BPS wall related to the nonlinear

realizationComments: LaTeX file, 21 pages, no figures

We propose a modified mode-expansion of the bulk fields in a BPS domain wallbackground to obtain the effective theory on the wall. The broken SUSY isnonlinearly realized on each mode defined by our mode-expansion. Our workclarifies a relation between two different approaches to derive the effectivetheory on a BPS wall, {\it i.e.} the nonlinear realization approach and themode-expansion approach. We also discuss a further modification that respectsthe Lorentz and $U(1)_R$ symmetries broken by the wall.
