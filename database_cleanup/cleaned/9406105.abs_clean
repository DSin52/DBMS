We consider the Schwarz-Sen spectrum of elementary electrically chargedmassive $N_R=1/2$ states of the four-dimensional heterotic string and show themaximum spin $1$ supermultiplets to correspond to extreme black hole solutions.The $N_L=1$ states and $N_L>1$ states (with vanishing left-moving internalmomentum) admit a single scalar-Maxwell description with parameters $a=\sqrt 3$or $a=1$, respectively. The corresponding solitonic magnetically chargedspectrum conjectured by Schwarz and Sen on the basis of $S$-duality is alsodescribed by extreme black holes.
