The recently derived current algebra of classical non-linear sigma models onarbitrary Riemannian manifolds is extended to include the energy-momentumtensor. It is found that in two dimensions the energy-momentum tensor$\theta_{\mu\nu}$, the Noether current $j_\mu$ associated with the globalsymmetry of the theory and the composite field $j$ appearing as the coefficientof the Schwinger term in the current algebra, together with the derivatives of$j_\mu$ and $j$, generate a closed algebra. The subalgebra generated by thelight-cone components of the energy-momentum tensor consists of two commutingcopies of the Virasoro algebra, with central charge $\, c\!=\!0 $, reflectingthe classical conformal invariance of the theory, but the current algebra partand the semidirect product structure are quite different from the usualKac-Moody / Sugawara type construction.
