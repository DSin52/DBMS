Intertwiners between \ade lattice models are presented and the general theoryadjacency matrices, at the level of the cell calculus intertwining the facealgebras and at the level of the row transfer matrices. A convenient graphicalrepresentation of the intertwining cells is introduced. The utility of theintertwining relations in studying the spectra of the \ade models isemphasized. In particular, it is shown that the existence of an intertwinerimplies that many eigenvalues of the \ade row transfer matrices are exactly incommon for a finite system and, consequently, that the corresponding centralcharges and scaling dimensions can be identified.
