The relativistic model with two types of planar fermions interacting with theChern-Simons and Maxwell fields is applied to the study of anyonsuperconductor. It is demonstrated, that the Meissner effect can be realized inthe case of the simultaneous presence of the fermions with a different magneticmoment interactions. Under the certain conditions there occures an extraplateau at the magnetization curve. In the order under consideration thespectrum of the electromagnetic field excitations contains the long-rangeinteraction and one massive "photon" state.
