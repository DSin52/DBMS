We compute the gauge field functional integral giving the scalar product ofthe SU(2) Chern-Simons theory states on a Riemann surface of genus > 1. Theresult allows to express the higher genera partition functions of the SU(2)WZNW conformal field theory by explicit finite dimensional integrals. Ourcalculation may also shed new light on the functional integral of the Liouvilletheory.
