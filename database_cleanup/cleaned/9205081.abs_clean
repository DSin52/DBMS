An exact multimonopole solution of heterotic string theory is presented. Thesolution is constructed by a modification of the 't Hooft ansatz for afour-dimensional instanton. An analogous solution in Yang-Mills field theorysaturates a Bogomoln'yi bound and possesses the topology and far field limit ofa multimonopole configuration, but has divergent action near each source. Inthe string solution, however, the divergences from the Yang-Mills sector areprecisely cancelled by those from the gravity sector. The resultant action isfinite and easily computed. The Manton metric on moduli space for thescattering of two string monopoles is found to be flat to leading order in theimpact parameter, in agreement with the trivial scattering predicted by a testmonopole calculation.
