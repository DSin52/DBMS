Special Kahler manifolds are defined by coupling of vector multiplets to$N=2$ supergravity. The coupling in rigid supersymmetry exhibits similarfeatures. These models contain $n$ vectors in rigid supersymmetry and $n+1$ insupergravity, and $n$ complex scalars. Apart from exceptional cases they aredefined by a holomorphic function of the scalars. For supergravity thisfunction is homogeneous of second degree in an $(n+1)$-dimensional projectivespace. Another formulation exists which does not start from this function, butfrom a symplectic $(2n)$- or $(2n+2)$-dimensional complex space. Symplectictransformations lead either to isometries on the manifold or to symplecticreparametrizations. Finally we touch on the connection with specialquaternionic and very special real manifolds, and the classification ofhomogeneous special manifolds.
