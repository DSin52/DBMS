The supermembrane in light-cone gauge gives rise to a supersymmetric quantummechanics system with SU(N) gauge symmetry when the group of area preservingdiffeomorphisms is suitably regulated. de Wit, Marquard and Nicolai showed howeleven-dimensional Lorentz generators can be constructed from these degrees offreedom at the classical level. In this paper, these considerations areextended to the quantum level and it is shown the algebra closes to leadingnontrivial order at large N. A proposal is made for extending these results toMatrix theory by realizing longitudinal boosts as large N renormalization grouptransformations.
