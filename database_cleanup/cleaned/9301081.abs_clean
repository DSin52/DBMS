To study the behavior of the Kazakov-Migdal at large N the quenched momentumprescription with constraints for treating the large N limit of gauge theoriesis used. It is noted that it leads to a quartic dependence of an action onunitary matrix instead of a quadratic dependence discussed in previousconsiderations. Therefore the model is not exactly solvable in the weakcoupling limit. An approximation procedure for investigation of the model isoutlined. In this approximation an indication to a phase transition for $d<4,8$with $\beta_{cr}=\frac{1}{d-4,8}$ is obtained.
