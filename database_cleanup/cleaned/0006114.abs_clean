In this paper we study the one-loop shift in the coupling constant in anoncommutative pure U(N) Chern-Simons gauge theory in three dimensions. Theone-loop shift is shown to be a constant proportional to $N$, independent ofnoncommutativity parameters, and non-vanishing for U(1) theory. Possiblephysical and mathematical implications of this result are discussed.
