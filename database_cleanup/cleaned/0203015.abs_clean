Karpacz Winter School of Theoretical Physics, February 2001, eds. J.Lukierski and J. Rembielinski (AIP Conference Proceedings, vol. 589)Standard superspace Feynman diagram rules give one estimate of the onset ofultraviolet divergences in supergravity and super Yang-Mills theories. Newertechniques motivated by string theory but which also make essential use ofunitarity cutting rules give another in certain cases. We trace the differenceto the treatment of higher-dimensional gauge invariance in supersymmetrictheories that can be dimensionally oxidized to pure supersymmetric gaugetheories.
