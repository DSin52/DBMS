For general finite temperature different from the Hawking one there appears awell known conical singularity in the Euclidean classical solution ofgravitational equations. The method of regularizing the cone by regular surfaceis used to determine the curvature tensors for such a metrics. This allows oneto calculate the one-loop matter effective action and the correspondingone-loop quantum corrections to the entropy in the framework of the pathintegral approach of Gibbons and Hawking. The two-dimensional andfour-dimensional cases are considered. The entropy of the Rindler space isshown to be divergent logarithmically in two dimensions and quadratically infour dimensions that coincides with results obtained earlier. For the eternal2D black hole we observe finite, dependent on the mass, correction to theentropy. The entropy of the 4D Schwarzschild black hole is shown to possess anadditional (in comparison with the 4D Rindler space) logarithmically divergentcorrection which does not vanish in the limit of infinite mass of the blackhole. We argue that infinities of the entropy in four dimensions arerenormalized by the renormalization of the gravitational coupling.
