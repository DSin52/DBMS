We study the massive Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics of massive,Dirac fermions, in 1+1 dimensions; with space compactified to a circle. In thelimit that transitions to fermion--anti-fermion pairs can be neglected, westudy the full ground state. We focus on the effect of instantons which mediatetunnelling transitions in the induced potential for the dynamical degree offreedom in the gauge field.
