We consider decoupling in the context of an effective quantum field theory oftwo scalar fields with well separated mass scales and a $Z_2\times Z_2$symmetry. We first prove, using Wilson's exact renormalization group equation,that the theory is renormalizable, in the same way that we showed in a previouspaper that theories with a single mass scale were renormalizable. We then statethe full theory may be approximated arbitrarily closely by an effective theoryof the light particle alone, with naturalness scale the heavy particle mass. Wealso compare our formulation of effective field theory with the moreconventional local formulation.
