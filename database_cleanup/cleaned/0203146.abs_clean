Generalised Scherk-Schwarz reductions in which compactification on a circleis accompanied by a twist with an element of a global symmetry G typically leadto gauged supergravities and are classified by the monodromy matrices, up toconjugation by the global symmetry. For compactifications of IIB supergravityon a circle, G=SL(2,R) and there are three distinct gauged supergravities thatresult, corresponding to monodromies in the three conjugacy classes of SL(2,R).There is one gauging of the compact SO(2) subgroup of the SL(2,R) and twodistinct gaugings of non-compact SO(1,1) subgroups, embedded differently inSL(2,R). The non-compact gaugings can be obtained from the compact one via ananalytic continuation of the kind used in D=4 gauged supergravities. For thesuperstring, the monodromy must be in SL(2,Z), and the distinct theoriescorrespond to SL(2,Z) conjugacy classes. The theories consist of two infiniteclasses with quantised mass parameter m=1,2,3,..., three exceptional theoriescorresponding to elliptic conjugacy classes, and a set of sporadic theoriescorresponding to hyperbolic conjugacy classes.
