We present a formal supersymmetric solution of type IIB supergravitygeneralizing previously known solutions corresponding to D3 branes togeometries without an orthogonal split between parallel and transversedirections. The metric is given implicitly as one with respect to which acertain connection is compatible. The case of the deformed conifold isdiscussed in detail.
