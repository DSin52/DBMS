Title: A hint of renormalization

Authors: B. Delamotte

Comments: 16 pages

An elementary -- hopefully pedagogical -- introduction to perturbativerenormalization and renormalization group is presented. No prior knowledge offield theory is necessary since the body of the article never refers to anyparticular physical theory. This allows, in particular, to disentangle what isspecific to field theory and what is intrinsic to renormalization. A copiousconclusion aims at linking the general arguments and results seen in the textto real phenomena encountered both in particle physics and statisticalmechanics.
