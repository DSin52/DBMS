1146-1151The pseudoclassical hamiltonian and action of the $D=2n$ dimensional Diracparticle with anomalous magnetic moment interacting with the externalelectromagnetic field is found. The Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation of motionfor the Pauli-Lubanski vector is deduced. The canonical quantization of $D=2n$dimensional Dirac spinning particle with anomalous magnetic moment in theexternal electromagnetic field is carried out in the gauge which allows todescribe simultaneously particles and antiparticles (massive and massless)already at the classical level. Pseudoclassical Foldy-Wouthuysen transformationis used to obtain canonical (Newton-Wigner) coordinates and in terms of thisvariables the theory is quantized. The connection of this quantization with thedeGroot and Suttorp's description of Dirac particle with anomalous magneticmoment in the external electromagnetic field is discussed.
