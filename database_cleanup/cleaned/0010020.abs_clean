Title: Boundary Dynamics of Higher Dimensional Chern-Simons Gravity

Authors: J. Gegenberg (U. of New Brunswick) and G. Kunstatter (U. of Winnipeg)

Comments: 10 pages, LaTeX, to appear in the Fradkin Memorial Conference

Proceedings, requires style file esfconf.styWe review the relevance to the black hole entropy problem of boundarydynamics in Chern-Simons gravity. We then describe a recent derivation of theaction induced on the four dimensional boundary in a five dimensionalChern-Simons gravity theory with gauge invariant, anti-deSitter boundaryconditions.
