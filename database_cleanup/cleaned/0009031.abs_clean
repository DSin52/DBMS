We study the radiative corrections to the Chern-Simons mass term at two loopsin 2+1 dimensional quantum electrodynamics at finite temperature. We show that,in contrast to the behavior at zero temperature, thermal effects lead to a nonvanishing contribution at this order. Using this result, as well as the largegauge Ward identity for the leading parity violating terms in the static limit,we determine the leading order parity violating effective action in this limitat two loops, which generalizes the one-loop effective action proposed earlier.
