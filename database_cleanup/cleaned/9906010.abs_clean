We calculate the vacuum expectation values of local fields for thetwo-parameter family of integrable field theories introduced and studied byFateev. Using this result we propose an explicit expression for the vacuumexpectation values of local operators in parafermionic sine-Gordon models andin integrable perturbed SU(2) coset conformal field theories.
