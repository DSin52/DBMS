We construct a class of solutions to the Einstein's equations for dimensionsgreater than or equal to six. These solutions are characterized by anon-trivial warp factor and possess a non-compact extra dimension. We study indetail a simple model in six dimensions containing two four branes. One of eachbrane's four spatial directions is compactified. The hierarchy problem isresolved by the enormous difference between the warp factors at the positionsof the two branes, with the standard model fields living on the brane withsmall warp factor. Both branes can have positive tensions. Their positions, andthe size of the compact dimension are determined in terms of the fundamentalparameters of the theory by a combination of two independent and comparableeffects---an anisotropic contribution to the stress tensor of each brane fromquantum fields living on it and a contribution to the stress tensor from a bulkscalar field. One overall fine tuning of the parameters of the theory isrequired ---that for the cosmological constant.
