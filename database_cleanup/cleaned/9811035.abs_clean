We consider the type 0 theories, obtained from the closed NSR string by adiagonal GSO projection which excludes space-time fermions, and study theD-branes into these theories. The low-energy dynamics of N coincident D-branesis governed by a U(N) gauge theory coupled to adjoint scalar fields. It istempting to look for the type 0 string duals of such bosonic gauge theories inthe background of the R-R charged p-brane classical solutions. This results ina picture analogous to the one recently proposed by Polyakov (hep-th/9809057).One of the serious problems that needs to be resolved is the closed stringtachyon mode which couples to the D-branes and appears to cause an instability.We study the tachyon terms in the type 0 effective action and argue that thebackground R-R flux provides a positive shift of the (mass)^2 of the tachyon.Thus, for sufficiently large flux, the tachyonic instability may be cured,removing the most basic obstacle to constructing the type 0 duals ofnon-supersymmetric gauge theories. We further find that the tachyon acquires anexpectation value in presence of the R-R flux. This effect is crucial forbreaking the conformal invariance in the dual description of the 3+1dimensional non-supersymmetric gauge theory.
