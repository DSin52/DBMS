We construct a bicovariant differential calculus on the quantum group$GL_q(3)$, and discuss its restriction to $[SU(3) \otimes U(1)]_q$. The$q$-algebra of Lie derivatives is found, as well as the Cartan-Maurerequations. All the quantities characterizing the non-commutative geometry of$GL_q(3)$ are given explicitly.
