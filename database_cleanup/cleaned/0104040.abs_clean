We compute the spectral index for scalar perturbations generated in aprimordial inflationary model. In this model, the transition of theinflationary phase to the radiative era is achieved through the decay of thecosmological term leading a second order phase transition and thecharacteristics of the model allow to implement a set of initial conditionswhere the perturbations display a thermal spectrum when they emerge from thehorizon. The obtained value for the spectral index is equal to 2, a result thatdepends very weakly on the various parameters of the model and on the initialconditions used.
