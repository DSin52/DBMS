1099-4300We review some results on the connection among supergravity central charges,BPS states and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. In particular, N=2 supergravity infour dimensions is studied in detail. For higher N supergravities we just givean account of the general theory specializing the discussion to the N=8 casewhen one half of supersymmetry is preserved. We stress the fact that forextremal supergravity black holes the entropy formula is topological, that isthe entropy turns out to be a moduli independent quantity and can be written interms of invariants of the duality group of the supergravity theory.
