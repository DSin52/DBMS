Title: On the Exact Quantum Integrability of the Membrane

Comments: 35 pages; Revised Tex file; some minor details have been added

The exact quantum integrability problem of the membrane is investigated. Itis found that the spherical membrane moving in flat target spacetimebackgrounds is an exact quantum integrable system for a particular class of$SU(\infty)$ Yang-Mills theory to one temporal dimension. Crucial ingredientsare the exact integrability property of the $3D~SU(\infty)$ continuous Todatheory and its associated dimensionally-reduced $SU(\infty)$ Toda $molecule$equation whose symmetry algebra is the $U_\infty$ algebra obtained from adimensional-reducion of the $W_\infty \oplus {\bar W}_\infty$ algebras that actnaturally on the original $3D$ continuous Toda theory. The $U_\infty$ algebrais explicitly constructed in terms of exact quantum solutions of the quantizedcontinuous Toda equation. Highest weight irreducible representations of the$W_\infty$ algebras are also studied in detail. Continuous and discrete energylevels are both found in the spectrum . Other relevant topics are discussed inthe conclusion.
