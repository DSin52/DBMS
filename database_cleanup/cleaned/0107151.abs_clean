We generate by computer a basis of invariants for the fundamentalrepresentations of the exceptional Lie groups E(6) and E(7), up to degree 18.We discuss the relevance of this calculation for the study of supersymmetricgauge theories, and revisit the self-dual exceptional models. We study thechiral ring of G(2) to degree 13, as well as a few classical groups. Thehomological dimension of a ring is a natural estimator of its complexity andprovides a guideline for identifying theories that have a good chance to beamenable to a solution.
