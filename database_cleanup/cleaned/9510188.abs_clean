Distance BehaviourComments: 7 pages, latex

For fields that vary slowly on the scale of the lightest mass the logarithmof the vacuum functional can be expanded as a sum of local functionals. ForYang-Mills theory the leading term in the expansion dominates large distanceeffects and leads to an area law for the Wilson loop. However, this expansioncannot be expected to converge for fields that vary more rapidly. By studyingthe analyticity of the vacuum functional under scale transformations we showhow to re-sum this series so as to reconstruct the vacuum functional forarbitrary fields.
