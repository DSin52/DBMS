We study the decay of unstable D$p$-branes when the world-volume gauge fieldis turned on. We obtain the relevant Dp-brane boundary state with electric andmagnetic fields by boosting and rotating the rolling tachyon boundary state ofa D(p-1)-brane and then T-dualizing along one of the transverse directions. Asimple recipe to turn on the gauge fields in the boundary state is given. Wefind that the effect of the electric field is to parametrically enhancecoupling of closed string oscillation modes along the electric field directionand provide an intuitive understanding of the result in the T-dualized picture.We also analyze the system by using the effective field theory and compare theresult with the boundary state approach.
