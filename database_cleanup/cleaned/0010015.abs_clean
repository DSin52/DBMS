Effects 2000'', Paris September 2000, references addedThe arcane ADHM construction of Yang-Mills instantons can be very naturallyunderstood in the framework of D-brane dynamics in string theory. In thispoint-of-view, the mysterious auxiliary symmetry of the ADHM constructionarises as a gauge symmetry and the instantons are modified at short distanceswhere string effects become important. By decoupling the stringy effects, onecan recover all the instanton formalism, including the all-important volumeform on the instanton moduli space. We describe applications of the instantoncalculus to the AdS/CFT correspondence and higher derivative terms in theD3-brane effective action. In these applications, there is an interestingrelation between instanton partition functions, the Euler characteristic ofinstanton moduli space and modular symmetry. We also describe how it is nowpossible to do multi-instanton calculations in gauge theory and we resolve anold puzzle involving the gluino condensate in supersymmetric QCD.
