The vacuum correlations of the gravitational field are highly non-trivial tobe defined and computed, as soon as their arguments and indices do not belongto a background but become dynamical quantities. Their knowledge is essentialhowever in order to understand some physical properties of quantum gravity,like virtual excitations and the possibility of a continuum limit for latticetheory. In this review the most recent perturbative and non-perturbativeadvances in this field are presented. (To appear on Riv. Nuovo Cim.)
