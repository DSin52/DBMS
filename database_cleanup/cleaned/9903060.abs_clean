Authors: R.Parthasarathy

Comments: 10 pages, LATEX file

The finite gauge transformation, in the submanifold of su(3) introduced inhep-th/9902027, is found to be linear in the gauge functions ${\omega}^a$'s. Inthis manner, a parameterization of SU(3) in terms of a single real octet vector${\omega}^a$ is achieved. Under this finite transformation, those gauge fieldssatisfying $D^{ab}_{\mu}{\omega}^b = 0$, remain unchanged. A geometric meaningto the submanifold in terms of rotations in E8 is presented.
