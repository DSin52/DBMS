Classical 1/4 BPS configurations consist of 1/2 BPS dyons which arepositioned by competing static forces from electromagnetic and Higgs sectors.These forces do not follow the simple inverse square law, but can be encoded insome low energy effective potential between fundamental monopoles of distincttypes. In this paper, we find this potential, by comparing the exact 1/4 BPSbound from a Yang-Mills field theory with its counterpart derived from lowenergy effective dynamics of monopoles. Our method is generalized to arbitrarygauge groups and to arbitrary BPS monopole/dyon configurations. The resultingeffective action for 1/4 BPS states is written explicitly, and shown to bedetermined entirely by the geometry of multi-monopole moduli spaces. We alsoexplore its natural supersymmetric extension.
