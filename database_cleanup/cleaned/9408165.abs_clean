A real representation theory of real Clifford algebra has been studied infurther detail, especially in connection with Fierz identities. As itsapplication, we have constructed real octonion algebras as well as relatedoctonionic triple system in terms of 8-component spinors associated with theClifford algebras $C(0,7)$ and $C(4,3)$.
