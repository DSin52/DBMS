Title: On K3-Thurston 7-manifolds and their deformation space

with remarks on general K3T and M-theory compactificationComments: 39 pages

M-theory suggests the study of 11-dimensional space-times compactified onsome 7-manifolds. From its intimate relation to superstrings, one possibleclass of such 7-manifolds are those that have Calabi-Yau threefolds asboundary. In this article, we construct a special class of such 7-manifolds,named as {\it K3-Thurston} (K3T) 7-manifolds. The factor from the K3 part ofthe deformation space of these K3T 7-manifolds admits a K\"{a}hler structure,while the factor of the deformation space from the Thurston part admits aspecial K\"{a}hler structure. The latter rings with the nature of the scalarmanifold of a vector multiplet in an N=2 $d=4$ supersymmetric gauge theory.Remarks and examples on more general K3T 7-manifolds and issues to possibleinterfaces of K3T to M-theory are also discussed.
