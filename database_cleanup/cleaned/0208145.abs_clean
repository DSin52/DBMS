The double-tensor multiplet naturally appears in type IIB superstringcompactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds, and is dual to the universalhypermultiplet. We revisit the calculation of instanton corrections to thelow-energy effective action, in the supergravity approximation. We derive aBogomolny'i bound for the double-tensor multiplet and find new instantonsolutions saturating the bound. They are characterized by the topologicalcharges and the asymptotic values of the scalar fields in the double-tensormultiplet.
