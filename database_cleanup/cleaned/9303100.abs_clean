We study the integral representation for the exact solution tononperturbative $c le 1$ string theory. A generic solution is determined by twofunctions $W(x)$ and $Q(x)$ which behaive at infinity like $x^p$ and $x^q$respectively. The integral model for arbitrary $(p,q)$ models is derived whichexplicitely demonstrates $p-q$ duality of minimal models coupled to gravity. Wediscuss also the exact solutions to string equation and reduction condition andpresent several explicit examples.
