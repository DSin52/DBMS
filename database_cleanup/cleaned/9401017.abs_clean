We study quantum intergrable systems of interacting particles from the pointof view, proposed in our previous paper. We obtain Calogero-Moser andSutherland systems as well their Ruijsenaars relativistic generalization by aHamiltonian reduction of integrable systems on the cotangent bundles oversemi-simple Lie algebras, their affine algebras and central extensions of loopgroups respectively. The corresponding 2d field theories form a tower ofdeformations. The top of this tower is gauged G/G WZW model on a cylinder withinserted Wilson line in appropriate representation.
