We find all possible static embeddings of a 4-brane in any dimension-6spacetime with 4-dimensional Poincare symmetry and a negative cosmologicalconstant, subject to orbifolding across the brane. Our new solutions allowintersecting branes at an angle determined by a new dynamical parameter. Acollection of branes intersecting in one 3-brane allows an arbitrary excessangle that can be related to a vacuum density along the intersection. The3-brane must be stabilized by additional fine-tuned interactions. We also notethat localization of gravity is tied to the approximate fine tuning of thebrane tensions.
