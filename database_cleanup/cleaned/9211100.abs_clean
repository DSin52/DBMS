expurgated some typos.)The connection between Rational Conformal Field Theory (RCFT), $N=2$ massivesupersymmetric field theory, and solvable Interaction Round the Face (IRF)lattice models is explored here. Specifically, one identifies the fusion ringswith the chiral rings. The theories so obtained are conjectured, and largelyshown, to be integrable. A variety of examples and the structure of the metricin moduli space are given. The kink scattering theory is given by the Boltzmannweights of an IRF model, which is built entirely in terms of the conformal dataof the original RCFT. This procedure produces all solvable IRF models in termsof projection operators of the RCFT. The soliton structure and their scatteringamplitudes are described. A host of new rational conformal field theories areconstructed generalizing most, if not all, of the known ones.
