Tensor calculation of suffix-contraction is carried out by a C-program.Tensors are represented graphically, and the algorithm makes use of thetopology of graphs. Classical and quantum gravity, in the weak-fieldperturbative approach, is a special interest. Examples of the leading ordercalculation of some general invariants such as $R_{\mn\ls}R^{\mn\ls}$ aregiven. Application to Weyl anomaly calculation is commented.
