Utilizing AdS/CFT correspondence in M-theory, an example of interacting d=3conformal field theories and renormalization group flow between them ispresented. Near-horizon geometry of N coincident M2-branes located on a conicalsingularity on eight-dimensional hyperk\"ahler manifold or manifold withSpin(7) holonomy is, in large-N limit, AdS4*X7, where X7 is seven-sphere withsquashing. Deformation from round $\S_7$ to squashed one is known to lead tospontaneous breaking of N=8 local supersymmetry in gauged AdS4 supergravity toN=1, 0. Via AdS/CFT correspondence, it is interpreted as renormalization groupflow from SO(5)*SO(3) symmetric UV fixed point to SO(8) symmetric IR fixedpoint. Evidences for the interpretation are found both from supergravity scalarpotential and existence of interpolating static domain-wall thereof, and fromconformal dimensions of relevant chiral primary operator at each fixed point.
