In this contribution we review some recent work on the non-commutativegeometry of branes on group manifolds. In particular, we show how fuzzy spacesarise in this context from an exact world-sheet description and we sketch theconstruction of a low-energy effective action for massless open string modes.The latter is given by a combination of a Yang-Mills and a Chern-Simons likefunctional on the fuzzy world-volume. It can be used to study condensation onvarious brane configurations in curved backgrounds.
