Finite quantum field theories may be constructed from the most generalrenormalizable quantum field theory by forbidding, order by order in theperturbative loop expansion, all ultraviolet-divergent renormalizations of thephysical parameters of the theory. The relevant finiteness conditions resultingfrom this requirement relate all dimensionless couplings in the theory. Atfirst sight, Yukawa couplings which are equivalent to the generators of someClifford algebra with identity element represent a very promising type ofsolutions of the condition for one-loop finiteness of the Yukawa couplings.However, under few reasonable and simplifying assumptions about theirparticular structure, these Clifford-like Yukawa couplings prove to be inconflict with the requirements of one- and two-loop finiteness of the gaugecoupling and of the absence of gauge anomalies, at least for all simple gaugegroups up to and including rank 8.
