We construct the supercurrent multiplet that contains the energy-momentumtensor of the (2,0) tensor multiplet. By coupling this multiplet of currents tothe fields of conformal supergravity, we first construct the linearizedsuperconformal transformations rules of the (2,0) Weyl multiplet. Next, weconstruct the full non-linear transformation rules by gauging thesuperconformal algebra OSp(8^*|4). We then use this result to construct thefull equations of motion of the tensor multiplet in a conformal supergravitybackground. Coupling N+5 copies of the tensor multiplet to conformalsupergravity and imposing a geometrical constraint on the scalar fields whichfixes the conformal symmetry, we obtain the coupling of (2,0) Poincaresupergravity to N tensor multiplets in which the physical scalars parametrizethe coset SO(N,5)/(SO(N) x SO(5)).
