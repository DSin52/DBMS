We give a formula for the derivatives of a correlation function of compositeoperators with respect to the parameters (i.e., the strong fine structureconstant and the quark mass) of QCD in four-dimensional euclidean space. Theformula is given as spatial integration of the operator conjugate to aparameter. The operator product of a composite operator and a conjugateoperator has an unintegrable part, and the formula requires divergentsubtractions. By imposing consistency conditions we derive a relation betweenthe anomalous dimensions of the composite operators and the unintegrable partof the operator product coefficients.
