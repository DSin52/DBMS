We consider two-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to matter in thetemporal gauge, using the Polyakov path integral. We show that the integrationover the metric can be explicitly performed under some plausible assumptions.We also discuss that the critical dimensions in string theory may not bedetermined in the temporal gauge.
