We introduce a new class of gauge field theories in any complex dimension,based on algebra-valued (p,q)-forms on complex n-manifolds. These theories areholomorphic analogs of the well-known Chern-Simons and BF topological theoriesdefined on real manifolds. We introduce actions for different specialholomorphic BF theories on complex, Kahler and Calabi-Yau manifolds anddescribe their gauge symmetries. Candidate observables, topological invariantsand relations to integrable models are briefly discussed.
