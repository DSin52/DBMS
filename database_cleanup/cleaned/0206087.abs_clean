Within a toroidal orbifold framework, we exhibit intersecting brane-worldconstructions of flipped SU(5) \times U(1) GUT models with various numbers ofgenerations, other chiral matter representations and Higgs representations. Weexhibit orientifold constructions with integer winding numbers that yield 8 ormore conventional SU(5) generations, and orbifold constructions with fractionalwinding numbers that yield flipped SU(5) \times U(1) models with just 3conventional generations. Some of these models have candidates for the 5 and{\bar 5} Higgs representations needed for electroweak symmetry breaking, butnot for the 10 and {\bar 10} representations needed for GUT symmetry breaking.We have also derived models with complete GUT and electroweak Higgs sectors,but these have undesirable extra chiral matter.
