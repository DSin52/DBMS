of Quantum Theory", (World Scientific, Singapore), Proceedings of theInternational Symposium, Columbia, SC, USA., Dec. 1992)The non-perturbative solution to the strong CP problem with magneticmonopoles as originally proposed by the author is described. It is shown thatthe gauge orbit space with gauge potentials and gauge tranformations restrictedon the space boundary and the globally well-defined gauge subgroup in gaugetheories with a $\theta$ term has a monopole structure if there is a magneticmonopole in the ordinary space. The Dirac's quantization condition then ensuresthat the vacuum angle $\theta$ in the gauge theories must be quantized to havea well-defined physical wave functional. The quantization rule for $\theta$ isderived as $\theta=0, 2\pi/n~(n\neq 0)$ with n being the topological charge ofthe magnetic monopole. Therefore, the strong CP problem is automatically solvedwith the existence of a magnetic monopole of charge $\pm 1$ with $\theta=\pm2\pi$. This is also true when the total magnetic charge of monopoles are verylarge ($|n|\geq 10^92\pi$). The fact that the strong CP violation can be onlyso small or vanishing may be a signal for the existence of magnetic monopolesand the universe is open.
