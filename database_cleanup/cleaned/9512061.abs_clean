We derive double dimensional reduction/oxidation in a framework where it isapplicable to describe general non-static (and anisotropic) $p$-branesolutions. Given this procedure, we are able to relate the dynamicalinteraction potential for parallel extremal $p$-branes in $D$ dimensions tothat for extremal black holes in $D-p$ dimensions. In particular, we find thatto leading order the potential vanishes for all $\kappa$-symmetric $p$-branes.
