A complete global analysis of spatially-flat, four-dimensional cosmologiesderived from the type IIA string and M-theory effective actions is presented.A non--trivial Ramond-Ramond sector is included. The governing equations arewritten as a dynamical system. Asymptotically, the form fields are dynamicallynegligible, but play a crucial role in determining the possible intermediatebehaviour of the solutions (i.e. the nature of the equilibrium points). Theonly past-attracting solution (source in the system) may be interpreted in theeleven-dimensional setting in terms of flat space. This source is unstable tothe introduction of spatial curvature.
