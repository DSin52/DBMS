Title: Anomalies and Renormalization of BFYM Theory

Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B406 (1997) 66-69

The (perturbative) renormalization properties of the BF formulation ofYang-Mills gauge models are shown to be identical to those of the usual, secondorder formulation. This result holds in any number of spacetime dimensions andis a direct consequence of cohomological theorems established by G. Barnich, F.Brandt and the author (Commun.Math.Phys., 174 (1995) 57).
