We perform an exact renormalization-group analysis of one-dimensional 4-stateclock models with complex interactions. Our aim is to provide a simple explicitillustration of the behavior of the renormalization-group flow in a systemexhibiting a rich phase diagram. In particular we study the flow in thevicinity of phase transitions with a first-order character, a matter that hasbeen controversial for years. We observe that the flow is continuous andsingle-valued, even on the phase transition surface, provided that therenormalized Hamiltonian exist. The characteristics of such a flow are inagreement with the Nienhuis-Nauenberg standard scenario, and in disagreementwith the ``discontinuity scenario'' proposed by some authors and recentlydisproved by van Enter, Fern\'andez and Sokal for a large class of models (withreal interactions). However, there are some points in the space of interactionsfor which a renormalized Hamiltonian cannot be defined. This pathologicalbehavior is similar, and in some sense complementary, to the one pointed out byGriffiths, Pearce and Israel for Ising models. We explicitly see that if thetransformation is truncated so as to preserve a Hamiltonian description, theresulting flow becomes discontinuous and multivalued at some of these points.This suggests a possible explanation for the numerical results that motivatedthe ``discontinuity scenario''.
