We give the definition and explore the algebraic structure of a class ofquantum symmetries, called topological symmetries, which are generalizations ofsupersymmetry in the sense that they involve topological invariants similar tothe Witten index. A topological symmetry (TS) is specified by an integer n>1,which determines its grading properties, and an n-tuple of positive integers(m_1,m_2,...,m_n). We identify the algebras of supersymmetry, p=2parasupersymmetry, and fractional supersymmetry of order n with those of theZ_2-graded TS of type (1,1), Z_2-graded TS of type (2,1), and Z_n-graded TS oftype (1,1,...,1), respectively. We also comment on the mathematicalinterpretation of the topological invariants associated with the Z_n-graded TSof type (1,1,...,1). For n=2, the invariant is the Witten index which can beidentified with the analytic index of a Fredholm operator. For n>2, there are nindependent integer-valued invariants. These can be related to differences ofthe dimension of the kernels of various products of n operators satisfyingcertain conditions.
