curved spacetime''Authors: Frank Antonsen, Karsten Bormann

Comments: standard LaTeX, 4 pages

We extend recent work by Elizalde et al. to incorporate curvatures which arenot small and backgrounds which are not just $S^2\times R^2, S^1\times S^1\times R^2$. Some possible problems in their paper is also pointed out.
