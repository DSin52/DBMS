Title: Nonlocal action for long-distance modifications of gravity theory

Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX

We construct the covariant nonlocal action for recently suggestedlong-distance modifications of gravity theory motivated by the cosmologicalconstant and cosmological acceleration problems. This construction is based onthe special nonlocal form of the Einstein-Hilbert action explicitly revealingthe fact that this action within the covariant curvature expansion begins withcurvature-squared terms.
