to be published in Phys. Lett. ASystemsGeneralisations of the familiar Euler top equations in three dimensions areproposed which admit a sufficiently large number of conservation laws to permitintegrability by quadratures. The usual top is a classical analogue of the Nahmequations. One of the examples discussed here is a seven-dimensional Euler top,which arises as a classical counterpart to the eight-dimensional self-dualequations which are currently believed to play a role in new developments instring theory.
