The process of collision of two parallel domain walls in a supersymmetricmodel is studied both in effective Lagrangian approximation and by numericalsolving of the exact classical field problem. For small initial velocities wefind that the walls interaction looks like elastic reflection with some delay.It is also shown that in such approximation internal parameter of the wall maybe considered as a time-dependent dynamical variable.
