Elliptic diagonal solutions for the reflection matrices associated to theelliptic $R$ matrix of the eight vertex free fermion model are presented. Theylead through the second derivative of the open chain transfer matrix to an XYhamiltonian in a magnetic field which is invariant under a quantum deformedClifford--Hopf algebra.
