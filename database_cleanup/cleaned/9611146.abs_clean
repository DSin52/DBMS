An M-brane and anti-M-brane scheme is proposed to study nonextremal 4D and 5Dblack holes. The improved nonextremal intersecting M-brane solutions proposedhere, involve two sets of harmonic functions. The constraints among thepressures are found, and new features in the M-brane and anti-M-brane pictureare demonstrated, which resolve the discrepancy in the number of freeparameters in the D-brane picture. In terms of the ``numbers'' of M-branes andanti-M-branes, the prefactors of the entropies are found to be modelindependent, and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy assumes the duality invariantform which is consistent with the microscopic explanation of the black holeentropy.
