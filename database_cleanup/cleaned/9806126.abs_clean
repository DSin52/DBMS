Title: U-duality and Network Configurations of Branes

Authors: Alok Kumar and Subir Mukhopadhyay

Comments: 26 pages, Latex, Title and Text modified (minor modifications), to

appear in Int. Jour. Mod. Phys. AWe explicitly write down the invariant supersymmetry conditions for braneswith generic values of moduli and U-duality charges in various space-timedimensions $D \leq 10$. We then use these results to obtain new BPS states,corresponding to network type structure of such branes.
