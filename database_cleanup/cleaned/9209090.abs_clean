We present a new method to find solutions of the Virasoro master equationsfor any affine Lie algebra $\widehat{g}$. The basic idea is to consider firstthe simplified case of an In\"on\"u-Wigner contraction $\widehat{g}_c$ of$\widehat{g}$ and to extend the Virasoro constructions of $\widehat{g}_c$ to$\widehat{g}$ by a perturbative expansion in the contraction parameter. Themethod is then applied to the orthogonal algebras, leading to fixed-levelmulti-parameter Virasoro constructions, which are the generalisations of theone-parameter Virasoro construction of $\widehat{su}(2)$ at level four.
