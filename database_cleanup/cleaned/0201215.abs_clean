The microscopic origin of black hole entropy remains one of the moreintriguing open questions in theoretical physics. A subplot in this drama isthe renowned Cardy-Verlinde formula, which uses two-dimensional conformalformalism to explain the entropy of an arbitrary-dimensional black hole. Inthis paper, by exploiting the AdS/CFT and black hole-string dualities, we areable to provide a physical picture for this paradoxical behavior. Following arecent study by Haylo (in a dS context), we show that the dual CFT for anasymptotically AdS spacetime actually conforms to a string-like description.Moreover, we demonstrate that this stringy CFT is directly related to a stringthat lives on the stretched horizon of an AdS-Schwarzschild-like black hole. Infact, after an appropriate renormalization, these two boundary theories areshown to be thermodynamically equivalent.
