Title: Symplectic structure of electromagnetic duality

Comments: 18 pages, Revtex

We develop an electromagnetic symplectic structure on the space-time manifoldby defining a Poisson bracket in terms of an invertible electromagnetic tensorF_{\mu\nu}. Moreover, we define electromagnetic symplectic diffeomorphisms byimposing a special condition on the electromagnetic tensor. This conditionimplies a special constraint on the Levi-Civita tensor. Then, we expressgeometrically the electromagnetic duality by defing a dual local coordinatessystem.
