Title: Supersymmetric extensions of affine Toda theories

Authors: A. Opfermann

Comments: latex, 13 pages

It is shown that all affine Toda theories admit (1,0) supersymmetricextensions. The construction is based on classical Lie algebras andsupersymmetric massive sigma models. The supersymmetrized affine Toda theorieshave a unique, supersymmetric vacuum, their mass matrix is well defined andtheir energy functional is positive semi-definite.
