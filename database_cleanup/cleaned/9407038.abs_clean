Title: On the constrained KP hierarchy

Authors: L.A.Dickey

Comments: 7pp, LaTeX

An explanation for the so-called constrained hierarhies is presented bylinking them with the symmetries of the KP hierarchy. While the existence ofordinary symmetries (belonging to the hierarchy) allows one to reduce the KPhierarchy to the KdV hierarchies, the existence of additional symmetries allowsto reduce KP to the constrained KP.
