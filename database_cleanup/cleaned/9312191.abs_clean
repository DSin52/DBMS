In the context of two-dimensional quantum cosmology, we consider thepath-integral of a string on annulus which contains the Liouville field andconformal matter fields. We show that, in the transition amplitude of thestring universe, the non-zero modes of the fields are all cancelled out onlywhen we take the $c=1$ conformal matter field and impose the Neumann boundarycondition on the system. The transition amplitude obtained obeys theminisuperspace Wheeler-DeWitt equation. In our treatment, the modular parameteron annulus plays the role of time variable to integrate out.
