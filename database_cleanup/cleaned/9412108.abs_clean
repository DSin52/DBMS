We propose a spinon basis for the integrable highest weight modules of$\hsltw$ at levels $k\geq1$, and discuss the underlying Yangian symmetry.Evaluating the characters in this spinon basis provides new quasi-particle typeexpressions for the characters of these integrable modules, and explicitlyexhibits the structure of an RSOS times a Yangian part, known \eg from$S$-matrix results. We briefly discuss generalizations to other groups and moregeneral conformal field theories.
