Comments: 19 pages, harvmac, amssym and epsf macros, 3 postscript figures

We investigate the low energy structure of the Kahler potential in SUSY QCDwith Nf=Nc+1 quark flavors. Since this theory's moduli space is everywheresmooth, a systematic power series expansion of its Kahler potential can bedeveloped in terms of confined meson and baryon fields. Perturbation theory inthe supersymmetric sigma model based upon a momentum expansion consistent withnaive dimensional analysis and 1/Nf power counting exhibits some similaritieswith ordinary QCD chiral perturbation theory along with several keydifferences. We compute meson and baryon wavefunction renormalization as wellas Kahler potential operator mixing to leading nontrivial order. We also deducethe asymptotic dependence of the lowest dimension operators' coefficients uponmoduli space location along flat directions where the theory is Higgsed down toNf-1=(Nc-1)+1 SUSY QCD. Although an exact form for the confining phase Kahlerpotential remains unknown, we find that some detailed Kahler sector informationcan nevertheless be derived from first principles.
