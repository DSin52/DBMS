The point-splitting regularization technique for composite operators isdiscussed in connection with anomaly calculation. We present a pedagogical andself-contained review of the topic with an emphasis on the technical details.We also develop simple algebraic tools to handle the path ordered exponentialinsertions used within the covariant and non-covariant version of thepoint-splitting method. The method is then applied to the calculation of thechiral, vector, trace, translation and Lorentz anomalies within diverseversions of the point-splitting regularization and a connection between theresults is described. As an alternative to the standard approach we use theidea of deformed point-split transformation and corresponding Ward-Takahashiidentities rather than an application of the equation of motion, which seems tosave the complexity of the calculations.
