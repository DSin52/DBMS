The relationship between the entropy of de Sitter (dS) Schwarzschild spaceand that of the CFT, which lives on the brane, is discussed by usingFriedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) equations and Cardy-Verlinde formula. Thecosmological constant appears on the brane with time-like metric in dSSchwarzschild background. On the other hand, in case of the brane withspace-like metric in dS Schwarzschild background, the cosmological constant ofthe brane does not appear because we can choose brane tension to cancel it. Weshow that when the brane crosses the horizon of dS Schwarzschild black hole,both for time-like and space-like cases, the entropy of the CFT exactly agreeswith the black hole entropy of 5-dimensional AdS Schwarzschild background as ithappens in the AdS/CFT correspondence.
