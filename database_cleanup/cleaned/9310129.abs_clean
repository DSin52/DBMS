A new Langevin equation with a field-dependent kernel is proposed to dealwith bottomless systems within the framework of the stochastic quantization ofParisi and Wu. The corresponding Fokker-Planck equation is shown to be adiffusion-type equation and is solved analytically. An interesting connectionbetween the solution with the ordinary Feynman measure, which in this case isnot normalizable, is clarified.
