We show how non-near horizon p-brane theories can be obtained from twoembedding constraints in a flat higher dimensional space with 2 timedirections. In particular this includes the construction of D3 branes from aflat 12-dimensional action, and M2 and M5 branes from 13 dimensions. Theworldvolume actions are determined by constant forms in the higher dimension,reduced to the usual expressions by Lagrange multipliers. The formulationaffords insight in the global aspects of the spacetime geometries and makescontact with recent work on two-time physics.
