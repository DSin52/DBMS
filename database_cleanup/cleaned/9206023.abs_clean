A truncation of string field theory is compared with the duality invarianteffective action of $D=4, N=4$ heterotic strings to cubic order. The threestring vertex must satisfy a set of compatibility conditions. Any cyclic threestring vertex is compatible with the $D=4, N=4$ effective field theory. Theeffective actions may be useful in understanding the non--polynomial structureand the underlying symmetry of covariant closed string field theory, and inaddressing issues of background independence. We also discuss the effectiveaction and string field theory of the $N=2$ string.
