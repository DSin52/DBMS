We begin a classification of the symmetry algebras arising on configurationsof type IIB [p,q] 7-branes. These include not just the Kodaira symmetries thatoccur when branes coalesce into a singularity, but also algebras associated toother physically interesting brane configurations that cannot be collapsed. Wedemonstrate how the monodromy around the 7-branes essentially determines thealgebra, and thus 7-brane gauge symmetries are classified by conjugacy classesof the modular group SL(2,Z). Through a classic map between the modular groupand binary quadratic forms, the monodromy fixes the asymptotic charge formwhich determines the representations of the various (p,q) dyons in probeD3-brane theories. This quadratic form also controls the change in the algebraduring transitions between different brane configurations. We give a unifieddescription of the brane configurations extending the D_N, E_N andArgyres-Douglas H_N series beyond the Kodaira cases. We anticipate theappearance of affine and indefinite infinite-dimensional algebras, which weexplore in a sequel paper.
