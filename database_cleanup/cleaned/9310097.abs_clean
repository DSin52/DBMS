Based on the representation theory of the $q$-deformed Lorentz and Poincar\'esymmeties $q$-deformed relativistic wave equation are constructed. The mostimportant cases of the Dirac-, Proca-, Rarita-Schwinger- and Maxwell- equationsare treated explicitly. The $q$-deformed wave operators look structurally likethe undeformed ones but they consist of the generators of a non-commu\-ta\-tiveMinkowski space. The existence of the $q$-deformed wave equations together withprevious existence of the $q$-deformed wave equations together with previousresults on the representation theory of the $q$-deformed Poincar\'e symmetrysolve the $q$-deformed relativistic one particle problem.
