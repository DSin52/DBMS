We review known exact classical solutions in (bosonic) string theory. Themain classes of solutions are `cosets' (gauged WZW models), `plane wave'-typebackgrounds (admitting a covariantly constant null Killing vector) and`$F$-models' (backgrounds with two null Killing vectors generalising the`fundamental string' solution). The recently constructed $D=4$ solutions withMinkowski signature are given explicitly. We consider various relations betweenthese solutions and, in particular, discuss some aspects of the dualitysymmetry.
