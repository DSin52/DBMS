251-266In harmonic superspace, the classical equations of motion of $D=4, N=2$supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory for Minkowski and Euclidean spaces areanalyzed. We study dual superfield representations of equations and subsidiaryconditions corresponding to classical SYM-solutions with different symmetries.In particular, alternative superfield constructions of self-dual and staticsolutions are described in the framework of the harmonic approach.
