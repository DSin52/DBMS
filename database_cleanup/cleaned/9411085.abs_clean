We give evidence, by use of the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz approach, of theexistence of both massive and massless behaviours for the $\phi_{2,1}$perturbation of the $M_{3,5}$ non-unitary minimal model, thus resolvingapparent contradictions in the previous literature. The two behaviourscorrespond to changing the perturbing bare coupling constant from real valuesto imaginary ones. Generalizations of this picture to the whole class ofnon-unitary minimal models $M_{p,2p\pm 1}$, perturbed by their least relevantoperator lead to a cascade of flows similar to that of unitary minimal modelsperturbed by $\phi_{1,3}$. Various aspects and generalizations of thisphenomenon and the links with the Izergin-Korepin model are discussed.
