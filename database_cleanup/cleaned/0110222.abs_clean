Stability of massive antisymmetric tensor fields with the Chern-Simons typeaction in anti de Sitter spacetime is studied. It is found that there exists acomplete set of solutions whose energy is conserved and positive definite ifthe mass is positive. Scalar products of the solutions are shown to bewell-defined and conserved. In contrast to the previously studied scalar fieldcase there is no other set of stable solutions with a different kind ofboundary condition.
