The equations of motion and junction conditions for a gravi-dilaton braneworld scenario are studied in the string frame. It is shown that they allowKasner-like solutions on the brane, which makes the dynamics of the brane verysimilar to the low curvature phase of pre-big bang cosmology. Analogies anddifferences of this scenario with the Randall-Sundrum one and with the standardbulk pre-big bang dynamics are also discussed.
