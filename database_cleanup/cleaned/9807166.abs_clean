Title: Supersymmetric Domain Walls (New Exact Results in Supersymmetric

Gluodynamics)Authors: M. Shifman

Comments: Talk at the VI International Symposium on Particles, Strings and

Cosmology (PASCOS-98) March 22-29, 1998, Boston, and at the III InternationalWorkshop "Continuous Advances in QCD", April 16-19, 1998, Minneapolis. Latex,10 pages, no figuresSupersymmetric domain walls are reviewed. The main emphasis is made onsaturated walls in strongly coupled gauge theories. The central charge of theN=1 superalgebra appears in supersymmetric gluodynamics as a quantum anomaly. Ialso consider some rather unusual general features of supersymmetric domainwalls.
