The non-perturbative canonical quantization of the N=1 supergravity with thenon-zero cosmological constant is studied using the Ashtekar formalism. Asemi-classical wave function is obtained and it has the form of the exponentialof the N=1 supersymmetric extension of the Chern-Simons functional. The N=1supergravity in the Robertson-Walker universe is also examined and someanalytic solutions are obtained. (We omit all graphs in the following LaTexfile.)
