The classical Yang--Mills equations are analyzed within the geometricalframework of an effective gravity theory. Exact analytical solutions arederived for the cylindrically symmetric configurations of the coupled gauge andisoscalar fields. It turns out that there is an infinite family of solutionsparametrized by two real parameters, one of which determines the asymptoticbehavior of fields near the symmetry axis and in infinity, while the secondlocates the singularity. These configurations have a simple pole at a finitevalue of the radial coordinate, and physically they represent ``thickstring''-like objects which possess the confinement properties. It isdemonstrated that the particles with gauge charge cannot move classically andquantum mechanically out of the interior region. Such an objects are thusdirect analogues of the ``black string'' gravitational configurations reportedrecently in the literature.
