We propose a class of purely elastic scattering theories generalising thestaircase model of Al. B. Zamolodchikov, based on the affine Toda fieldtheories for simply-laced Lie algebras g=A,D,E at suitable complex values oftheir coupling constants. Considering their Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatzequations, we give analytic arguments in support of a conjecturedrenormalisation group flow visiting the neighbourhood of each W_g minimal modelin turn.
