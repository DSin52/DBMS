We give a systematic method to generate two types of zero-norm states in theold covariant first quantized (OCFQ) spectrum of open bosonic string. Zero-normstates up to the fourth massive level and general formulas of some zero-normtensor states at an arbitrary mass level are calculated. On-shell Wardidentities generated by zero-norm states can then be used to express thestringy scattering amplitudes of the degenerate lower spin propagating statesin terms of those of higher spin propagating states at each fixed mass level.This decoupling phenomenon is, in contrast to Gross's high-energy symmetries,valid to \QTR{em}{all} energy. As examples, we explicitly demonstrate thisstringy phenomenon up to the fourth massive level (spin-five), which justifiesthe calculation of two other previous approaches based on the massiveworldsheet sigma-model and Witten's string field theory (WSFT).
