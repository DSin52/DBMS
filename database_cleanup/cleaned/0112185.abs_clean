We study the spectrum of density fluctuations of Fractional Hall Fluids inthe context of the noncommutative hidrodynamical model of Susskind. We showthat, within the weak-field expansion, the leading correction to thenoncommutative Chern--Simons Lagrangian (a Maxwell term in the effectiveaction,) destroys the incompressibility of the Hall fluid due to strong UV/IReffects at one loop. We speculate on possible relations of this instabilitywith the transition to the Wigner crystal, and conclude that calculationswithin the weak-field expansion must be carried out with an explicitultraviolet cutoff at the noncommutativity scale. We point out that thenoncommutative dipoles exactly match the spatial structure of theHalperin--Kallin quasiexcitons. Therefore, we propose that the noncommutativeformalism must describe accurately the spectrum at very large momenta, providedno weak-field approximations are made. We further conjecture that thenoncommutative open Wilson lines are `vertex operators' for the quasiexcitons.
