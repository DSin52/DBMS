The realization of ${\cal N}=2$ four dimensional super Yang-Mills theories interms of a single Dirichlet fivebrane in type IIB string theory is considered.A classical brane computation reproduces the full quantum low energy effectiveaction. This result has a simple explanation in terms of mirror symmetry.
