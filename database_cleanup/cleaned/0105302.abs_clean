Comments: Latex, 17 pages, added references, corrected typos

Linear recursion relations for the instanton corrections to the effectiveprepotential are derived for N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories with onehypermultiplet in the adjoint representation of SU(N) using the Calogero-Moserparameterization of the Seiberg-Witten spectral curves. S-duality properties ofthe Calogero-Moser parameterization and conjectures on the Seiberg-Wittenspectral curves generalized to arbitrary simply laced classical gauge groupsare also discussed.
