Authors: J. Rasmussen and M. Weis

Comments: 4 pages in LaTeX, NBI-HE-94-46

A new topology is proposed on the space of holonomy equivalence classes ofloops, induced by the topology of the space $\Sigma$ in which the loops areembedded. The possible role for the new topology in the context of the work byAshtekar et al. is discussed.
