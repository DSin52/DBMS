We discuss Stochastic Quantization of $d$=3 dimensional non-AbelianChern-Simons theory. We demonstrate that the introduction of an appropriateregulator in the Langevin equation yields a well-defined equilibrium limit,thus leading to the correct propagator. We also analyze the connection between$d$=3 Chern-Simons and $d$=4 Topological Yang-Mills theories showing theequivalence between the corresponding regularized partition functions. We studythe construction of topological invariants and the introduction of anon-trivial kernel as an alternative regularization.
