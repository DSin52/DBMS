We discuss supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory dimensionally reduced to zerodimensions and evaluate the SU(2) and SU(3) partition functions by Monte Carlomethods. The exactly known SU(2) results are reproduced to very high precision.Our calculations for SU(3) agree closely with an extension of a conjecture dueto Green and Gutperle concerning the exact value of the SU(N) partitionfunctions.
