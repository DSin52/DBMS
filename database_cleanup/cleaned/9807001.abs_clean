Title: Hungry Volterra equation, multi boson KP hierarchy and Two Matrix Models

Comments: 13 pages, LaTeX

SystemsWe consider the hungry Volterra hierarchy from the view point of the multiboson KP hierarchy. We construct the hungry Volterra equation as theB\"{a}cklund transformations (BT) which are not the ordinary ones. We call them``fractional '' BT. We also study the relations between the (discrete time)hungry Volterra equation and two matrix models. From this point of view westudy the reduction from (discrete time) 2d Toda lattice to the (discrete time)hungry Volterra equation.
