Title: Hidden Symmetry of the Racah and Clebsch-Gordan Problems for the Quantum

Algebra sl_q(2)Comments: 12 pages

The Askey-Wilson algebra $AW(3)$ with three generators is shown to serve as ahidden symmetry algebra underlying the Racah and (new) generalizedClebsch-Gordan problems for the quantum algebra $sl_q(2)$. On the base of thishidden symmetry a simple method to calculate corresponding coefficients interms of the Askey-Wilson polynomials is proposed.
