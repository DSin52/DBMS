We present a second order gravity action which consists of ordinary Einsteinaction augmented by a first-order, vector like, Chern-Simons quasi topologicalterm. This theory is ghost-free and propagates a pure spin-2 mode. It isdiffeomorphism invariant, although its local Lorentz invariance has beenspontaneuosly broken. We perform the light-front (LF) analysis for both thelinearized system and the exact curved model. In constrast to the 2+1 canonicalanalysis, in the quasi LF coordinates the differential constraints can besolved. Its solution is presented here.
