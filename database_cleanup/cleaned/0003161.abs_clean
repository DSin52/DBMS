Supersymmetric Ward identity for the low energy effective action in thestandard background gauge is derived for {\it arbitrary} trajectories ofsupergravitons in Matrix Theory. In our formalism, the quantum-correctedsupersymmetry transformation laws of the supergravitons are directly identifiedin closed form, which exhibit an intricate interplay between supersymmetry andgauge (BRST) symmetry. As an application, we explicitly compute thetransformation laws for the source-probe configuration at 1-loop and confirmthat supersymmetry fixes the form of the action completely, including thenormalization, to the lowest order in the derivative expansion.
