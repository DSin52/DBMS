Title: Magnetic backgrounds and tachyonic instabilities in closed string theory

Comments: 12 pages, latex. Contribution to the proceedings of the 10-th Tohwa

references addedWe discuss some aspects of closed superstrings in Melvin-type magneticbackgrounds. A 2-parameter family of such NS-NS backgrounds are exactlysolvable as weakly coupled string models with the spectrum containing tachyonicmodes. Magnetic field allows one to interpolate between free superstringtheories with periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions for the space-timefermions around some compact direction, and, in particular, between type 0 andtype II string theories. Using ``9-11'' flip, this interpolation can beextended to M-theory and may be used to study the issue of tachyon in type 0string theory. We review, following hep-th/0104238, related duality proposals,and, in particular, consider a description of type 0 theory in terms ofM-theory in a curved magnetic flux background in which the type 0 tachyonappears to correspond to a state in $d=11$ supergravity fluctuation spectrum.
