We examine the relation between two known classes of solutions of thesine--Gordon equation, which are expressed by theta functions on hyperellipticRiemann surfaces. The first one is a consequence of the Fay's trisecantidentity. The second class exists only for odd genus hyperelliptic Riemannsurfaces which admit a fixed--point--free automorphism of order two. We showthat these two classes of solutions coincide. The hyperelliptic surfacescorresponding to the second class appear to be double unramified coverings ofthe Riemann surfaces corresponding to the first class of solutions. We alsodiscuss the soliton limits of these solutions.
