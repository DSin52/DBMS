We analyze gauge parameter dependence by using an algebraic method whichrelates the gauge parameter dependence of Green functions to an enlargedSlavnov-Taylor identity. In the course of the renormalization it turns out thatgauge parameter dependence of physical parameters is already restricted at thelevel of Green functions. In a first step we consider the on-shell conditionswhich we find to be in complete agreement with these restrictions to all ordersof perturbation theory. The fixing of the coupling, however, is much moreinvolved outside the complete on-shell scheme. In the Abelian Higgs model weprove that this fixing can be properly chosen by requiring the Ward identity ofgauge invariance to hold in its tree form to all orders of perturbation theory.
