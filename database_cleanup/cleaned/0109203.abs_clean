Title: Exterior Differentials in Superspace and Poisson Brackets of Diverse

Grassmann ParitiesAuthors: D.V. Soroka and V.A. Soroka

Comments: 5 pages, LATEX 2.09. The talk at the 9th International Conference on

Supersymmetry and Unification of Fundamental Interactions (SUSY'01, JINR,Dubna, Russia, 11-17 June, 2001). To be published in the Proceedings of thisConference. Correction of misprintsIt is shown that two definitions for the exterior differential in superspace,giving the same exterior calculus, when applied to the Poisson bracket lead tothe different results. Examples of the even and odd linear brackets,corresponding to semi-simple Lie groups, are given and their natural connectionwith BRST and anti-BRST charges is indicated.
