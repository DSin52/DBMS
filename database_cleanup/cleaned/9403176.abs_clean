We analyze the $t$-$J$ model using the ${\rm CP}^1$ representation for theslave operators (holons and spinons) which is particularly suited to study thephenomenon of the spin-charge separation in strongly correlated electronsystems. In particular, we show that for the one-dimensional $t$-$J$ modelbelow half-filling the low energy effective dynamics of the spin and chargedegrees of freedom is represented in the continuum limit by a ${\rm CP}^1$model with a topological term, minimally coupled to a massless Dirac field witha four-fermion interaction. The bosonic term of this action describes the spinwaves produced by the spinons, while the fermionic term represents the lowenergy charge excitations. This theory exhibits explicitly a local abeliangauge invariance.
