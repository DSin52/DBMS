We investigate the integrability of the SO(N) principal chiral model on ahalf-line, and find that mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary conditions (as wellas pure Dirichlet or Neumann) lead to infinitely many conserved chargesclassically in involution. We use an anomaly-counting method to show that atleast one non-trivial example survives quantization, compare our results withthe proposed reflection matrices, and, based on these, make some preliminaryremarks about expected boundary bound-states.
