Title: Skyrmions on the Two-Sphere

Authors: M. de Innocentis and R.S. Ward

Comments: 14 pages, 4 figures, to be published in Nonlinearity

We study static solutions of the Skyrme model on the two-sphere of radius L,for various choices of potential. The high-density Skyrmion phase correspondsto the ratio beta=L/(size of Skyrmion) being small, whereas the low-densityphase corresponds to beta being large. The transition between these two phases,and in particular the behaviour of a relevant order parameter, is examined.
