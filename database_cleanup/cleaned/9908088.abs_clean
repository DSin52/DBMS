We study the properties of M and F theory compactifications to three and fourdimensions with background fluxes. We provide a simple construction ofsupersymmetric vacua, including some with orientifold descriptions. Thesevacua, which have warp factors, typically have fewer moduli than conventionalCalabi-Yau compactifications. The mechanism for anomaly cancellation in theorientifold models involves background RR and NS fluxes. We consider in detailan orientifold of $K3\times T^2$ with background fluxes. After a combination ofT and S-dualities, this type IIB orientifold is mapped to a compactification ofthe SO(32) heterotic string on a non-Kahler space with torsion.
