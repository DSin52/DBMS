Talk presented by J.L. Petersen at the 29th Symposium Ahrenshop, BuckowAugust 29-September 2, 1995. A presentation is given of the free fieldrealization relevant to SL(2) WZW theories with a Hilbert space based onadmissible representations. It is known that this implies the presence of twoscreening charges, one involving a fractional power of a free field. We developthe use of fractional calculus for treating in general such cases. We deriveexplicit integral representations of $N$-point conformal blocks. We show thatthey satisfy the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations and we prove how they arerelated to minimal conformal blocks via a formulation of hamiltonian reductionadvocated by Furlan, Ganchev, Paunov and Petkova.
