We resolve the mixing of the scalar operators of naive dimension 4 belongingto the representation 20' of the SU(4) R-symmetry in N=4 SYM. We compute theorder g^2 corrections to their anomalous dimensions and show the absence ofinstantonic contributions thereof. Ratios of the resulting expressions areirrational numbers, even in the large N limit where, however, we observe theexpected decoupling of double-trace operators from single-trace ones. Webriefly comment on the generalizations of our results required in order to makecontact with the double scaling limit of the theory conjectured to beholographically dual to type IIB superstring on a pp-wave.
