I study the Ward identities of the $w_\infty$ symmetry of the two-dimensionalstring theory. It is found that, not just an isolated vertex operator, but alsoa number of vertex operators colliding at a point can produce local chargenon-conservation. The structure of all such contact terms is determined. As anapplication, I calculate all the non-vanishing bulk tachyon amplitudes directlythrough the Ward identities for a Virasoro subalgebra of the $w_\infty$.
