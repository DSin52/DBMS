Title: Type IIB Theory on Half-flat Manifolds

Authors: Sebastien Gurrieri and Andrei Micu

Comments: 15 pages, no figures

In this note we derive the low-energy effective action of type IIB theorycompactified on half-flat manifolds and we show that this precisely coincideswith the low-energy effective action of type IIA theory compactified on aCalabi-Yau manifold in the presence of NS three-form fluxes. We provide in thisway a further check of the recently formulated conjecture that half-flatmanifolds appear as mirror partners of Calabi-Yau manifolds when NS fluxes areturned on.
