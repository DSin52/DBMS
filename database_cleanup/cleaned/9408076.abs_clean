The strong coupling physics of two dimensional gravity at $C=7$, $13$, $19$is deciphered, by building up on previous works along the same line (for arecent review, of the background material, see hep-th/9408069). It is shownthat chirality becomes deconfined. The string suceptibility is derived, andfound to be real contrary to the continuation of the KPZ formula. TopologicalLiouville string theories (without transverse degree of freedom) areexplicitely solved. Altough they involve strongly coupled gravity, they sharemany features with the standard matrix models.
