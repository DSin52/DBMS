The Skyrme model is a classical field theory which has topological solitonsolutions. These solitons are candidates for describing nuclei, with anidentification between the numbers of solitons and nucleons. We have computednumerically, using two different minimization algorithms, minimum energyconfigurations for up to 22 solitons. We find, remarkably, that the solutionsfor seven or more solitons have nucleon density isosurfaces in the form ofpolyhedra made of hexagons and pentagons. Precisely these structures arise,though at the much larger molecular scale, in the chemistry of carbon shells,where they are known as fullerenes.
