Title: Asymptotic Factorisation of the Ground-State for SU(N)-invariant

Supersymmetric Matrix-ModelsAuthors: D. Hasler, J. Hoppe

We give a simple - straightforward and rigorous - derivation that when theeigenvalues of one of the $d=9 (5,3,2)$ matrices in the SU(N) invariantsupersymmetric matrix model become large (and well separated from each other)the ground-state wavefunction (resp. asymptotic zero-energy solution of thecorresponding differential equation) factorizes, for all $N>1$, into a productof supersymmetric harmonic oscillator wavefunctions (involving the`off-diagonal' degrees of freedom) and a wavefunction $\psi$ that isannihilated by the free supercharge formed out of all `diagonal' (Cartansub-algebra) degrees of freedom.
