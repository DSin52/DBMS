For non-abelian non-supersymmetric gauge theories, generic dual theories havebeen constructed. In these theories the couplings appear inverted. However,they do not possess a Yang-Mills structure but rather are a kind of non-linearsigma model. It is shown that for a topological gravitational model an analogto this duality exists.
