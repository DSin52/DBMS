Authors: Soo-Jong REY (Seoul National University)

Comments: 16 pages, ReVTex

Collective coordinate quantization of Dirichlet branes is discussed.Utilizing Polchinski's combinatoric rule, semiclassical D-brane wave functionalis given in proper-time formalism. D-brane equation of motion is thenidentified with renormalization group equation of defining Dirichlet openstring theory. Quantum mechanical size of macroscopically charged D-brane isillustrated and striking difference from ordinary field theory BPS particle isemphasized.
