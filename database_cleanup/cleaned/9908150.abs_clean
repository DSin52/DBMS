We study the formation of BTZ black holes by the collision of pointparticles. It is shown that the Gott time machine, originally constructed forthe case of vanishing cosmological constant, provides a precise mechanism forblack hole formation. As a result, one obtains an exact analytic understandingof the Choptuik scaling.
