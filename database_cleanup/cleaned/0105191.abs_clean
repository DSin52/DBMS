In this paper we try to construct noncommutative Yang-Mills theory forgeneric Poisson manifolds. It turns out that the noncommutative differentialcalculus defined in an old work is exactly what we need. Using this calculus,we generalize results about the Seiberg-Witten map, the Dirac-Born-Infeldaction, the matrix model and the open string quantization for constant B fieldto non-constant background with H=0.
