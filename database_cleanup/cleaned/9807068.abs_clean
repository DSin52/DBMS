In this paper we describe a new type of topological defect, called a homiliastring, which is stabilized via interactions with the string network. Usinganalytical and numerical techniques, we investigate the stability and dynamicsof homilia strings, and show that they can form stable electroweak strings. InSU(2)xU(1) models of symmetry breaking the intersection of two homilia stringsis identified with a sphaleron. Due to repulsive forces, the homilia stringsseperate, resulting in sphaleron annihilation. It is shown that electroweakhomilia string loops cannot stabilize as vortons, which circumvents the adversecosmological problems associated with stable loops. The consequences for GUTscale homilia strings are also discussed.
