Though screened at large distances, a point-like electric charge can stillparticipate in a long-range electromagnetic interaction in the Higgs phase,namely that with the Aharonov-Bohm field produced by a localized magnetic flux.We show that this follows from the fact that the screening charge, induced inthe presence of a Higgs condensate, does not interact with the Aharonov-Bohmfield. The same phenomenon occurs, if a Chern-Simons term is incorporated inthe action. This observation provides a physical basis for the recentlyproposed classification of the superselection sectors of this model in terms ofa quasi-Hopf algebra.
