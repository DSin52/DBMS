This is a general introduction to duality in field theories. The existenceand breaking of global symmetries is used as a guideline to systematicallyprove duality between different field theories. Systems discussed includeabelian and non-abelian T-duality in string theory, abelian and nonabelianbosonization, and duality for massless and massive antisymmetric tensor fieldtheories in arbitrary number of dimensions. Open questions regarding thesetechniques are also discussed. (Lectures given at 33rd Karpacz Winter School
