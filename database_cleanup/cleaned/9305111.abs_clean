We construct a model of gravity in 1+1 spacetime dimensions in which thesolutions approach the Schwarzschild metric at large $r$ and de Sitter spacefar inside the horizon. Our model may be viewed as a two dimensionalapplication of the `Limiting Curvature Construction' recently proposed by twoof the authors.
