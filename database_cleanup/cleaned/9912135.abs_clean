We extend our recent discussion of four-dimensional black holes bound to atwo-brane to include a negative cosmological constant on the brane. We findthat for large masses, the solutions are precisely BTZ black holes on thebrane, and BTZ `black strings' in the bulk. For smaller masses, there arelocalized black holes which look like BTZ with corrections that fall offexponentially. We compute when the maximum entropy configuration changes fromthe black string to the black hole. We also present exact solutions describingrotating black holes on two-branes which are either asymptotically flat orasymptotically $AdS_3$. The mass and angular momentum on the brane agree withthat in the bulk.
