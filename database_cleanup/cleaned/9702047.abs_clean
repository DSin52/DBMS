DirectionComments: 10 pages, uses revtex macro, Talk given at the International Workshop

on Perspectives of Strong Coupling Gauge Theories (SCGT96), November 1996,Nagoya, JapanA guiding principle to determine the Kaehler potential in the low energyeffective theory of the supersymmetric chiral gauge theory with no flatdirection is proposed. The guiding principle is applied to the SU(5) gaugetheory with chiral superfields in the 5* and 10 representation, and the lowenergy effective theory is consistently constructed. The spontaneoussupersymmetry breaking takes place in the low energy effective theory asexpected. The particle mass spectrum in the low energy is explicitlycalculated.
