The Casimir energy, free energy and Casimir force are evaluated, at arbitraryfinite temperature, for a dilute dielectric ball with uniform velocity of lightinside the ball and in the surrounding medium. In particular, we investigatethe classical limit at high temperature. The Casimir force found is repulsive,as in previous calculations.
