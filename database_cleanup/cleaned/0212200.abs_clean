We study the impact of topological phase transitions of the internalCalabi-Yau threefold on the space-time geometry of five-dimensional extremalblack holes and black strings. For flop transitions and SU(2) gauge symmetryenhancement we show that solutions can always be continued and that thebehaviour of metric, gauge fields and scalars can be characterized in a modelindependent way. Then we look at supersymmetric solutions which describe nakedsingularities rather than geometries with a horizon. For black strings we showthat the solution cannot become singular as long as the scalar fields takevalues inside the Kahler cone. For black holes we establish the same result forthe elliptic fibrations over the Hirzebruch surfaces F_0, F_1, F_2. These threemodels exhibit a behaviour similar to the enhancon, since one runs into SU(2)enhancement before reaching the apparent singularity. Using the propercontinuation inside the enhancon radius one finds that the solution is regular.
