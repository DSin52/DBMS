We demonstrate the equivalence of Virasoro constraints imposed on continuumlimit of partition function of Hermitean 1-matrix model and the Ward identitiesof Kontsevich's model. Since the first model describes ordinary $d = 2$ quantumgravity, while the second one is supposed to coincide with Witten's topologicalgravity, the result provides a strong implication that the two models areindeed the same.
