Conformal field theories with correlation functions which have logarithmicsingularities are considered. It is shown that those singularities imply theexistence of additional operators in the theory which together with ordinaryprimary operators form the basis of the Jordan cell for the operator $L_{0}$.An example of the field theory possessing such correlation functions is given.
