We show that there is (p-1)(p'-1) dimensional semi-relative BRST cohomologyat each non-positive ghost number in the (p,p') minimal conformal field theorycoupled to two dimensional quantum gravity. These closed string states arerelated to currents and symmetry charges of `exotic' ghost number. Weinvestigate the symmetry structure generated by the most conventional currents(those of vanishing total ghost number), and make a conjecture about theextended algebra which results from incorporating the currents at negativeghost number.
