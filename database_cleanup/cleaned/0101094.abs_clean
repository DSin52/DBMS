n-Dimensional pure gravity theory can be obtained as the effective theory ofan n+1 model (with non-compact extra dimension) where general n+1reparametrization invariance is explicitly broken in the extra dimension. Aswas pointed out in the literature, a necessary consistency condition for havinga non-vanishing four dimensional Newton constant is the normalizability in theextra dimension of the zero mass graviton. This, in turn, implies that gravitylocalization is produced around the local minima of a potential in the extradimension. We study gravity in the neighborhood of the soft ("thick") localminima.
