We examine the D-3 brane from the point of view of the double dimensionallyreduced M theory 5 brane on a torus. M-theory, IIB identifications areexplicitly constructed and a possible reformulation of the D-3 brane isdiscussed. The duality transformation of the reduced 3-brane necessary to makethe identification is discussed in detail.
