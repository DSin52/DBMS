Existence of breather (spatially localized, time periodic, oscillatory)solutions of the topological discrete sine-Gordon (TDSG) system, in the regimeof weak coupling, is proved. The novelty of this result is that, unlike thesystems previously considered in studies of discrete breathers, the TDSG systemdoes not decouple into independent oscillator units in the weak coupling limit.The results of a systematic numerical study of these breathers are presented,including breather initial profiles and a portrait of their domain of existencein the frequency-coupling parameter space. It is found that the breathers areuniformly qualitatively different from those found in conventional spatiallydiscrete systems.
