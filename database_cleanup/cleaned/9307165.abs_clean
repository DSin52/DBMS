The thermodynamics of vortices in the critically coupled abelian Higgs model,defined on the plane, are investigated by placing $N$ vortices in a region ofmoduli space for $N$ vortices, which is the same as that of $N$indistinguishable points on a torus, fibrates into a $CP_{N-1}$ bundle over theJacobi manifold of the torus. The volume of the moduli space is a product ofthe area of the base of this bundle and the volume of the fibre. These twovalues are determined by considering two 2-surfaces in the bundle correspondingto a rigid motion of a vortex configuration, and a motion around a fixed centreof mass. The partition function for the vortices is proportional to the volumeof the moduli space, and the equation of state for the vortices is $P(A-4\piN)=NT$ in the thermodynamic limit, where $P$ is the pressure, $A$ the area ofthe region of the plane occupied by the vortices, and $T$ the temperature.There is no phase transition.
