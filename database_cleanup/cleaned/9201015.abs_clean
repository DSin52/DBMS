It is shown explicitly, that a number of solutions for the background fieldequations of the string effective action in space-time dimension D can begenerated from any known lower dimensional solution, when background fieldshave only time dependence. An application of the result to the two dimensionalcharged black hole is presented. The case of background with more generalcoordinate dependence is also discussed.
