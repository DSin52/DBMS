Following the reasoning of Claudson and Halpern, it is shown that"fifth-time" stabilized quantum gravity is equivalent to Langevin evolution(i.e. stochastic quantization) between fixed non-singular, but otherwisearbitrary, initial and final states. The simple restriction to a fixed finalstate at $t_5 \rightarrow \infty$ is sufficient to stabilize the theory. Thisequivalence fixes the integration measure, and suggests a particularoperator-ordering, for the fifth-time action of quantum gravity. Results of anumerical simulation of stabilized, latticized Einstein-Cartan theory on somesmall lattices are reported. In the range of cosmological constant $\l$$<det(e)> \ne 0$; and 2) the negative free energy is large, possibly singular,in the vincinity of $\l = 0$. The second finding may be relevant to thecosmological constant problem.
