We consider the scaling Lee-Yang model. It corresponds to the uniqueperturbation of the minimal CFT model M(2,5). This is not a unitary model. Weused known expression for form factors in order to obtain a closed expressionfor a correlation function of a trace of energy-momentum tensor. Thisexpression is a determinant of an integral operator. Similar determinantrepresentation were proven to be useful not only for quantum correlationfunctions but also in matrix models.
