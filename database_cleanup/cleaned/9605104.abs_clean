We consider the RSOS S-matrices of the Phi(1,5) perturbed minimal modelswhich have recently been found in the companion paper [hep-th/9604098]. TheseS-matrices have some interesting properties, in particular, unitarity may bebroken in a stronger sense than seen before, while one of the three classes ofPhi(1,5) perturbations (to be described) shares the same Thermodynamic BetheAnsatz as a related Phi(1,2) perturbation. We test these new S-matrices by thestandard Truncated Conformal Space method, and further observe that in somecases the BA equations for two particle energy levels may be continued tocomplex rapidity to describe (a) single particle excitations and (b) complexeigenvalues of the Hamiltonian corresponding to non-unitary S-matrix elements.We make some comments on identities between characters in the two relatedmodels following from the fact that the two perturbed theories share the samebreather sector.
