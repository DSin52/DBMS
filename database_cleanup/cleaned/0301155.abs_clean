We discuss the instability of the Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective action (orits supersymmetric ground-state) with respect to higher order derivative terms.As such terms must be present in an effective action, the V-Y action alonecannot describe the dynamics of SYM consistently. We introduce an extension ofthis action, where all instabilities are removed by means of a much richerstructure of the Kaehler potential. We demonstrate that the dominantcontributions to the effective potential are determined by the non-holomorphicpart of the action and we prove that the non-perturbative ground-state can beequipped with stable dynamics. Making an expansion near the resultingground-state to second order in the derivatives never leads back to the resultby Veneziano and Yankielowicz. As a consequence new dynamical effects arise,which are interpreted as the formation of massive states in the boson sector(glueballs) and are accompanied by dynamical supersymmetry breaking. As thisregime of the dynamics is not captured by standard semi-classical analysis(instantons etc.), our results do not contradict these calculations butinvestigate the physics of the system beyond these approximations.
