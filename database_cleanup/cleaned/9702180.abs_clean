We discuss how N=1 dualities in four dimensions are geometrically realized bywrapping D-branes about 3-cycles of Calabi-Yau threefolds. In this setup theN=1 dualities for SU, SO and USp gauge groups with fundamental fields getmapped to statements about the monodromy and relations among 3-cycles ofCalabi-Yau threefolds. The connection between the theory and its dual requirespassing through configurations which are T-dual to the well-known phenomenon ofdecay of BPS states in N=2 field theories in four dimensions. We compare ourapproach to recent works based on configurations of D-branes in the presence ofNS 5-branes and give simple classical geometric derivations of various exoticdynamics involving D-branes ending on NS-branes.
