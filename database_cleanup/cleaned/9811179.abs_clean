In this paper, the metric on the moduli space of the k=1 SU(n) periodicinstanton -or caloron- with arbitrary gauge holonomy at spatial infinity isexplicitly constructed. The metric is toric hyperKaehler and of the formconjectured by Lee and Yi. The torus coordinates describe the residualU(1)^{n-1} gauge invariance and the temporal position of the caloron and canalso be viewed as the phases of n monopoles that constitute the caloron. The(1,1,..,1) monopole is obtained as a limit of the caloron. The calculation isperformed on the space of Nahm data, which is justified by proving theisometric property of the Nahm construction for the cases considered. Analternative construction using the hyperKaehler quotient is also presented. Theeffect of massless monopoles is briefly discussed.
