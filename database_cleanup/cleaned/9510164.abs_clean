Title: Supersymmetry Breaking In Orbifolds Compactifications

Comments: LATEX 6 pages. Previous file corrupted

Known mechanisms for breaking of supersymmetry at the level of string theoryimply that at least one of the internal dimensions has a very large size.Experimental detection of the associated light Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitationswould be a strong hint for the existence of string like elementary objects, asno consistent field theory describing them is known. We restrict the discussionto the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism in orbifold compactifications. For this case weinvestigate the quantum number of the lightest predicted KK states.
