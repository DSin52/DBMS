The problem of time and the quantization of three dimensional gravity in thestrong coupling regime is studied following path integral methods. The time isidentified with the volume of spacetime. We show that the effective actiondescribes an infinite set of massless relativistic particles moving in a curvedthree-dimensional target space, i.e. a tensionless 3-brane on a curvedbackground. If the cosmological constant is zero the target space is flat andthere is no ` ` graviton" propagation (i.e., $G[g_{ij} (2), g_{ij} (1)] = 0$).If the cosmological constant is different from zero, 3D gravity is bothclassical and quantum mechanically soluble. Indeed, we find the followingat $t=0$ showing the existence of a big-bang in this regime and ii) thepropagation amplitude between two geometries $<g_{ij} (2), t_2| g_{ij} (1),t_1>$ vanishes as $t \to 0$, suggesting that big-bang is suppressed quantummechanically. This result is also valid for $D>3$.
