Title: Schwinger terms, gerbes, and operator residues

Comments: Lectures given at the Banach Center symposium "Differential Geometry

and Mathematical Physics", May 15 - 23, 1995. This is an AMS-TEX file. 18output pagesThese notes explain recent developments concerning chiral anomalies andhamiltonian quantization, their relation to the theory of gerbes, andextensions of generalized loop algebras using the residue calculus ofpseudodifferential operators. The renormalization of the Dirac field, leadingto Schwinger terms in equal time commutation relations, is treated in amathematically rigorous manner. The same renormalization can be used to provethe existence of S-operator in background field problems.
