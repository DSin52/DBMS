The SO(2,10) covariant extension of M-theory superalgebra is considered, withthe aim to construct a correspondingly generalized M-theory, or 11dsupergravity. For the orbit, corresponding to the $11d$ supergravity multiplet,the simplest unitary representations of the bosonic part of this algebra, withsixth-rank tensor excluded, are constructed on a language of field theory in66d space-time. The main peculiarities are the presence of more than oneequation of motion and corresponding Lagrangians for a given field and that thegauge and SUSY invariances of the theory mean that the sum of variations ofthese Lagrangians (with different variations of the same field) is equal tozero.
