Employing Sen's picture of BPS states on a 3-brane probe world volume fieldtheory in a F-theory background. we determine some selection rules for theallowed spectrum in massless $N_{f}\leq 4$ SU(2) Seiberg-Witten theory. Thespectrum for any $N_f \leq 4$ is consistent with previous conjectures andanalysis.
