Randall-Sundrum model, which has a scalar field, is used to investigate thedomain structure of the extra dimension and to obtain a possible solution ofthe mass hierarchy problem. It is found that when the domain wall size iscomparable to that of domains, domains become unstable. To construct a reliabletheory, a region of physical parameter space, where domains are stable, isidentified. Analytic forms of field configurations are obtained by perturbativeexpansions in term of a small parameter that is approximately equal to therelative size of domain wall with respect to domains. By placing a single3-brane in one of the domain, one can solve the mass hierarchy problem.
