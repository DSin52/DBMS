Authors: G.W. Gibbons

Comments: 34 pages, no figures. This is the written version of a lecture

delivered at the Workshop on the Quantum Structure of Spacetime and theGeometric Nature of Fundamental Interactions held in Leuven from Sept 13th toSept 19th(2002) which is to appear in the Proceedings in a special issue ofQuantum and Classical GravityAfter a pedagogical review of elementary cosmology, I go on to discuss someobstacles to obtaining inflationary or accelerating universes in M/StringTheory. In particular, I give an account of an old No-Go Theorem to thiseffect. I then describe some recent ideas about the possible r\^ole of thetachyon in cosmology. I stress that there are many objections to a naiveinflationary model based on the tachyon, but there remains the possiblity thatthe tachyon was important in a possible pre-inflationary Open-String Erapreceding our present Closed String Era.
