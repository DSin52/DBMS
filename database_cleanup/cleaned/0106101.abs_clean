Warped compactification of the six-dimensional bulk with a negativecosmological constant is realized with a 4-brane along with an abelian gaugetheory. No fine tuning of couplings are needed to obtain the vanishingcosmological constant in four dimensions, as is the case for the bulk with apositive cosmological constant.
