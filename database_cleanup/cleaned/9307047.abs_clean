The non-relativistic theory is reviewed from apath-integral viewpoint. The group-theoretical underpinnings of relativisticfractional spin are discussed, then the path-integral quantization of spin andof massive fermions without using spinors is reviewed. The path integral for asystem of n relativistic particles with fractional spin is constructed, thespin-statistics relation and the Lorentz and Poincare' representation contentof physical states are discussed. Some problems in formulating a field theorywith fractional statistics are presented, and their resolution in the operatorcocycle approach is reviewed.
