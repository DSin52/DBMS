Hawking has shown that the emission of gravitational radiation cannot preventcircular loops of gauged cosmic strings from collapsing into black holes. Hereemission prevent circular loops of global cosmic strings from forming blackholes? Our results show that for every value of the string tension there is acertain critical size below which the circular loop does not collapse to form ablack hole. For GUT scale strings, this critical size is much larger than thecurrent horizon.
