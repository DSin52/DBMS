We note that in (2+1)-dimensional gauge theories with even number of masslessfermions, there is anomalous $Z_2$ symmetry if theory is regularized in aparity-invariant way. We then consider a parity invariant $U(1)_V\times U(1)_A$model, which induces a mutual Chern-Simons term in the effective action due to$Z_2$ anomaly. The effect of the discrete anomaly is studied in the inducedspin and in the dynamical fermion mass.
