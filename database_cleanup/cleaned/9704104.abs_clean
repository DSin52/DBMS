We discuss some aspects of the relation between space-time properties ofbranes in string theory, and the gauge theory on their worldvolume, for modelsinvariant under four supercharges in three and four dimensions. We show that asimple set of rules governing brane dynamics reproduces many features of gaugetheory. We study theories with $U(N_c)$, $SO(N_c)$ and $Sp(N_c)$ gauge groupsand matter in the fundamental and two index tensor representations, and use thebrane description to establish Seiberg's electric-magnetic duality for thesemodels.
