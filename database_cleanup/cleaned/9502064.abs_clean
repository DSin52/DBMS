Title: EXTENDED SUPERCONFORMAL SYMMETRY, FREUDENTHAL TRIPLE SYSTEMS AND GAUGED

WZW MODELSComments: Invited talk presented at the Gursey Memorial Conference I in

Istanbul, Turkiye (June 6-10, 1994). To appear in the proceedings of theconference. (21 pages. Latex document.)We review the construction of extended ( N=2 and N=4 ) superconformal algebrasover triple systems and the gauged WZW models invariant under them. The N=2superconformal algebras (SCA) realized over Freudenthal triple systems (FTS)admit extension to ``maximal'' N=4 SCA's with SU(2)XSU(2)XU(1) symmetry. Adetailed study of the construction and classification of N=2 and N=4 SCA's overFreudenthal triple systems is given. We conclude with a study andclassification of gauged WZW models with N=4 superconformal symmetry.
