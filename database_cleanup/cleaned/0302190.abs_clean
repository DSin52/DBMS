We investigate the correspondence between the D2-brane, which is described bythe abelian Born-Infeld action, and multiple D0-branes, which are done by thenonabelian Born-Infeld action. We construct effective actions for the fuzzycylinder, sphere and plane formed via D0-branes and compare these actions withthose for the cylindrical, spherical and planar D2-brane. We show that in thecontinuous limit, the effective actions for the fuzzy D0-branes preciselycoincide with those for the single D2-brane if both the fuzziness of theD0-brane and the area occupied per a unit of magnetic flux on the D2-brane areequal to $(2\pi\ell_s)^2$.
