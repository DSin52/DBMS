We show how the Hamiltonian lattice loop representation can be caststraightforwardly in the path integral formalism. The procedure is general forQED. We also analyze the non-Abelian Yang-Mills theory. The lattice loop pathintegral approach allows to knit together the power of statistical algorithmswith the transparency of the gauge invariant loop description. The resultsproduced by numerical simulations with the loop classical action for differentlattice models are discused.
