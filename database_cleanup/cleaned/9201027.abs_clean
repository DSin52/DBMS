Coset constructions in the framework of Chern-Simons topological gauge${U(1)_p\times U(1)_q\over U(1)_{p+q}}\cong U(1)_{pq(p+q)}$ with $p$ and $q$coprime integers, and ${SU(2)_m\times SU(2)_1\over SU(2)_{m+1}}$. In the lattercase it is shown that the Chern-Simons wave functionals can be identified witht he characters of the minimal unitary models, and an explicit representationof the knot (Verlinde) operators acting on the space of $c<1$ characters isobtained.
