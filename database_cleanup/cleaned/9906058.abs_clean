We develop an algorithm which can be used to exclude the existence ofclassical breathers (periodic finite energy solutions) in scalar fieldtheories, and apply it to several cases of interest. In particular, thetechnique is used to show that a pair of potentially periodic solutions of the3+1 Sine-Gordon Lagrangian, found numerically in earlier work, are notbreathers. These ``pseudo-breather states'' do have a signature in our method,which we suggest can be used to find similar quasi-bound state configurationsin other theories. We also discuss the results of our algorithm when applied tothe 1+1 Sine-Gordon model (which exhibits a well-known set of breathers), and$\phi ^4$ theory.
