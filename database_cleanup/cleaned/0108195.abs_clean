We describe low energy physics in the CFL and LOFF phases by means ofeffective lagrangians. In the CFL case we present also how to deriveexpressions for the parameters appearing in the lagrangian via weak couplingcalculations taking advantage of the dimensional reduction of fermion physicsaround the Fermi surface. The Goldstone boson of the LOFF phase turns out to bea phonon satisfying an anisotropic dispersion relation.
