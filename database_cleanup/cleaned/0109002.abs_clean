Title: Factorization method and the supersymmetric monopole harmonics

Authors: G. Andrei Mezincescu and Luca Mezincescu

We use the general $N = 1$ supersymmetric formulation of one dimensionalsigma models on non trivial manifolds and its subsequent quantization toformulate the classical and quantum dynamics of the $ N= 2 $ supersymmetriccharged particle moving on a sphere in the field of a monopole. Thefactorization method accommodated with the general covariance and it is used tointegrate the corresponding system.
