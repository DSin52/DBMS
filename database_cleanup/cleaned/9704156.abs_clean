We consider the absorption of higher angular momentum modes of scalars intoblack holes, at low energies, and ask if the resulting cross sections arereproduced by a D-brane model. To get the correct dependence on the volume ofthe compactified dimensions, we must let the absorbing element in the branemodel have a tension that is the geometric mean of the tensions of the D-stringand an effective stringlike tension obtained from the D-5-brane; this choice isalso motivated by T-duality. In a dual model we note that the correctdependence on the volume of the compact dimensions and the coupling arise ifthe absorbing string is allowed to split into many strings in the process ofabsorbing a higher angular momentum wave. We obtain the required energydependence of the cross section by carrying out the integrals resulting frompartitioning the energy of the incoming quantum into vibrations of the string.
