This paper addresses an issue essential to the study of hiddensupersymmetries (meaning here ones that do not close on the Hamiltonian) forone-dimensional non-linear supersymmetric sigma models. The issue relates toambiguities, due to partial integrations in superspace, both in the actualdefinition of these supersymmetries and in the Noether definition of theassociated supercharges. The unique consistent forms of both these definitionshave to be determined simultaneously by a process that adjusts the formerdefinitions so that the associated supercharges do indeed correctly generatethem with the aid of the canonical formalism. The paper explains andillustrates these matters and gives some new results.
