A procedure for reducing the functional integral of QED to an integral overbosonic gauge invariant fields is presented. Next, a certain averaging methodfor this integral, giving a tractable effective quantum field theory, isproposed. Finally, the current-current propagator and the chiral anomaly arecalculated within this new formulation. These results are part of our programmeof analyzing gauge theories with fermions in terms of local gauge invariants.
