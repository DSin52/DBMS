The Witten-Veneziano relation between the topological susceptibility of puregauge theories without fermions and the main contribution of the completetheory and the corresponding formula of Seiler and Stamatescu with theso-called contact term are discussed for the Schwinger model on a circle. Usingthe (Euclidean) path integral and the canonical (Hamiltonian) approaches atfinite temperatures we demonstrate that both formulae give the same result inthe limit of infinite volume and (or) zero temperature.
