We compute the effective action of QED at one loop order for an electricfield which points in the $\hat{z}$ direction and depends arbitrarily upon thelight cone time coordinate, $x^+ = (x^0 + x^3)/\sqrt{2}$. This calculationgeneralizes Schwinger's formula for the vacuum persistence probability in thepresence of a constant electric field.
