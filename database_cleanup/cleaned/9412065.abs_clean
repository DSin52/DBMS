Starting with exact solutions to string theory on curved spacetimes we obtaindeformations that represent gravitational shock waves. These may exist in thepresence or absence of sources. Sources are effectively induced by a tachyonfield that randomly fluctuates around a zero condensate value. It is shown thatat the level of the underlying conformal field theory (CFT) these deformationsare marginal and moreover all \a'-corrections are taken into account. Explicitresults are given when the original undeformed 4-dimensional backgroundscorrespond to tensor products of combinations of 2-dimensional CFT's, forinstance SL(2,R)/R \times SU(2)/U(1).
