We show that certain heterotic string amplitudes are given in terms ofcorrelators of the twisted topological (2,0) SCFT, corresponding to theinternal sector of the N=1 spacetime supersymmetric background. The genus gtopological partition function $F^g$ corresponds to a term in the effectiveaction of the form $W^{2g}$, where W is the gauge or gravitational superfield.We study also recursion relations related to holomorphic anomalies, showingthat, contrary to the type II case, they involve correlators of anti-chiralsuperfields. The corresponding terms in the effective action are of the form$W^{2g}\Pi^n$, where $\Pi$ is a chiral superfield obtained by chiral projectionof a general superfield. We observe that the structure of the recursionrelations is that of N=1 spacetime supersymmetry Ward identity. We give also asolution of the tree level recursion relations and discuss orbifold examples.
