Spacetime is modelled as a homogeneous manifold given by the classes ofunitary $\U(2)$ operations in the general complex operations $\GL(\C^2)$. Theresidual representations of this noncompact symmetric space of rank two arecharacterized by two continuous real invariants, one invariant interpreted as aparticle mass for a positive unitary subgroup and the second one for anindefinite unitary subgroup related to nonparticle interpretable interactionranges. Fields represent nonlinear spacetime $\GL(\C^2)/\U(2)$ by theirquantization and include necessarily nonparticle contributions in the timelikepart of their flat space Feynman propagator.
