We look at the string theory dual of the $\N=1^*$ theory, involving5--branes, which was recently proposed by Polchinski and Strassler\cite{PolStr}. We argue that SUGRA alone is not enough in order to obtain thecorrect screening and confinement behaviour of the various massive field theoryvacua, but that appropriate worldvolume phenomena of the 5--branes must beincluded. We therefore work within the SUGRA approximation, also taking intoaccount the brane dynamics, and classify all the SUGRA configurations. In thislevel of analysis, we find multiple valid configurations for every givenvacuum. We discuss some possible resolutions of this perplexing result. We alsoconsider the spectrum of asymptotic states, and discuss the global symmetriesof the SUGRA solution of the $\N=1^*$ theory and of the $\N=0^*$ theoryobtained from it by explicit supersymmetry breaking.
