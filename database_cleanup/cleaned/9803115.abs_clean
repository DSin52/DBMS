The effect of retardation on dynamical mass generation in is studied, in theimaginary time formalism. The photon porarization tensor is evaluated toleading order in 1/N (N is the number of flavours), and simple closed formexpressions are found for the fully retarded longitudinal and transversepropagators, which have the correct limit when T goes to zero. The resultingS-D equation for the fermion mass (at order 1/N) has an infrared divergenceassociated with the contribution of the transverse photon propagator; only thelongitudinal contribution is retained, as in earlier treatments. For solutionsof constant mass, it is found that the retardation reduces the value of theparameter r (the ratio of twice the mass to the critical temperature) fromabout 10 to about 6. The gap equation is then solved allowing for the mass todepend on frequency. It was found that the r value remained close to 6.Possibilities for including the transverse propagator are discussed.
