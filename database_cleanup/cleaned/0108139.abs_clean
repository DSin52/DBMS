Two simple proofs are presented for the first order virial expansion of theself-energy of a particle moving through a medium, characterised by temperatureand/or chemical potential(s). One is based on the virial expansion of theself-energy operator itself, while the other is on the analysis of its Feynmandiagrams in configuration space.
