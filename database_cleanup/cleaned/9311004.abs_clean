430-441We present a new application of affine Lie algebras to massive quantum fieldtheory in 2 dimensions, by investigating the $q\to 1$ limit of the q-deformedaffine $\hat{sl(2)}$ symmetry of the sine-Gordon theory, this limit occurringat the free fermion point. Working in radial quantization leads to aquasi-chiral factorization of the space of fields. The conserved charges whichgenerate the affine Lie algebra split into two independent affine algebras onthis factorized space, each with level 1 in the anti-periodic sector, and level$0$ in the periodic sector. The space of fields in the anti-periodic sector canbe organized using level-$1$ highest weight representations, if one supplementsthe $\slh$ algebra with the usual local integrals of motion. Introducing aparticle-field duality leads to a new way of computing form-factors in radialquantization. Using the integrals of motion, a momentum space bosonizationinvolving vertex operators is formulated. Form-factors are computed as vacuumexpectation values in momentum space.
