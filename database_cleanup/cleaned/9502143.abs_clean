We consider a formulation of N=1 D=3,4 and 6 superparticle mechanics, which ismanifestly supersymmetric on the worldline and in the target superspace. Forthe construction of the action we use only geometrical objects thatcharacterize the embedding of the worldline superspace into the targetsuperspace, such as target superspace coordinates of the superparticle andtwistor components. The action does not contain the Lagrange multipliers whichmay cause the problem of infinite reducible symmetries, and, in fact, is aworldline superfield generalization of the supertwistor description ofsuperparticle dynamics.
