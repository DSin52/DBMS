Using the recently proposed formalism for Lambda<0 quantum gravity in 2+1dimensions we study the process of black hole production in a collision of twopoint particles. The creation probability for a BH with a simplest topologyinside the horizon is given by the Liouville theory 4-point function projectedon an intermediate state. We analyze in detail the semi-classical limit ofsmall AdS curvatures, in which the probability is dominated by the exponentialof the classical Liouville action. The probability is found to be exponentiallysmall. We then argue that the total probability of creating a horizon given bythe sum of probabilities of all possible internal topologies is of order unity,so that there is no exponential suppression of the total production rate.
