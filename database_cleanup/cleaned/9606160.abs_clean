Title: Mini-Instantons in SU(2) Gauge Theory

Authors: Vincenzo Branchina and Janos Polonyi

Comments: 10 pg

The effects of instantons close to the cut-off is studied in four dimensionalSU(2) gauge theory with higher order derivative terms in the action. It isfound in the framework of the dilute instanton gas approximation that theconvergence of the topological observables requires non-universal betafunction.
