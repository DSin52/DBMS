The thermodynamics of d5 AdS BHs with positive, negative or zero curvaturespatial section in higher derivative (HD) gravity is described. HD contributionto free energy may change its sign which leads to more complicated regime forHawking-Page phase transitions. Some variant of d5 HD gravity is dual to ${\calN}=2$ $Sp(N)$ SCFT up to the next-to-leading order in large $N$. Then,according to Witten interpretation the stable AdS BH phase corresponds todeconfinement while global AdS phase corresponds to confinement. Unlike toEinstein gravity in HD theory the critical $N$ appears. It may influence thephase transition structure. In particulary, what was confining phase above thecritical value becomes the deconfining phase below it and vice-versa.
