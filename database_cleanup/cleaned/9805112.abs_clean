In the mapping from four-dimensional gauge theories to string theory in $AdS$space, many features of gauge theory can be described by branes wrapped indifferent ways on $\S^5$, $\RP^5$, or subspaces thereof. These include abaryon vertex coupling N external charges in the fundamental representationof SU(N), a bound state of $k$ gluons in SO(2k) gauge theory, strings coupledto external charges in the spinor representation of the gauge group, and domainwalls across which the low energy gauge group changes.
