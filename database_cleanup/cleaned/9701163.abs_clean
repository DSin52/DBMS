Comments: 13 pages, figures, uses procsla,epsf,epsfig; Talk given at the 12th

Italian Conference on General Relativity and Gravitational Physics, Rome,September 1996The role of Bertotti-Robinson geometry in the attractor mechanism of extremalblack holes is described for the case of N = 2 supersymmetry. Its implicationfor a model-independent derivation of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula isdiscussed.
