In this paper we show how two dimensional electron systems can be modeled bystrings interacting with D-branes. The dualities of string theory allow severaldescriptions of the system. These include descriptions in terms of solitons inthe near horizon D6-brane theory, non-commutative gauge theory on a D2-brane,the Matrix Theory of D0-branes and finally as a giant graviton in M-theory. Thesoliton can be described as a D2-brane with an incompressible fluid ofD0-branes and charged string-ends moving on it. Including an NS5 brane in thesystem allows for the existence of an edge with the characteristic masslesschiral edge states of the Quantum Hall system.
