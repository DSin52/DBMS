We study the quantum theory of 1+1 dimensional dilaton gravity, which is aninteresting toy model of the black hole dynamics. The functional measures areexplicitly evaluated and the physical state conditions corresponding to theHamiltonian and the momentum constraints are derived. It is pointed out thatthe constraints form the Virasoro algebra without central charge. In ADMformalism the measures are very ambiguous, but in our formalism they areexplicitly defined. Then the new features which are not seen in ADM formalismcome out. A singularity appears at $\df^2 =\kappa (>0) $, where $\kappa=(N-51/2)/12 $ and $ N$ is the number of matter fields. Behind the singularitythe quantum mechanical region $\kappa > \df^2 >0 $ extends, where the sign ofthe kinetic term in the Hamiltonian constraint changes. If $\kappa <0 $, thesingularity disappears. We discuss the quantum dynamics of black hole and thengive a suggestion for the resolution of the information loss paradox. We alsoargue the quantization of the spherically symmetric gravitational system in 3+1dimensions. In appendix the differences between the other quantum dilatongravities and ours are clarified and our status is stressed.
