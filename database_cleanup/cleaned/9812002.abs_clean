An attempt is made at a systematic approach to anomaly matching problem innon-Abelian electric-magnetic duality in N=1 supersymmetric QCD. A strategy weemploy is somewhat analogous to anomaly analyses in grand unified models wherethe anomaly cancellation becomes more transparent if one embeds SU(5)multiplets into a multiplet of (anomaly-free) SO(10). A complication arises inthe treatment of $U^{AF}_{R}(1)^{3}$ matching where $U^{AF}_{R}(1)$ isanomaly-free $R$ symmetry. It is noted that a relatively systematic analysis ofthe anomaly matching is possible if one considers the formal breaking sequenceSU(\tilde{N}_{c})_{c}$ with $N_{f}= N_{c}+ \tilde{N}_{c}$, where $N_{f}$ standsfor the number of massless quarks.
