After reviewing the main characteristics of the spacetime of acceleratinguniverses driven by a quintessence scalar field with constant equation of state$\omega$, we investigate in this paper the classical stability of such spacesto cosmological perturbations, particularizing in the case of a closed geometryand equation of state $\omega=-2/3$. We conclude that this space is classicallystable and conjecture that accelerating universes driven by quintessentialfields have "no-hair".
