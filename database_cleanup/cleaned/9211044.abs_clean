In a scalar field theory, when the tree level potential admits brokensymmetry ground states, the quantum corrections to the static effectivepotential are complex. (The imaginary part is a consequence of an instabilitytowards phase separation and the static effective potential is not a relevantquantity for understanding the dynamics). Instead, we study here the equationsof motion obtained from the one loop effective action for slow rollover out ofequilibrium.We considering the case in which a scalar field theory undergoes a rapidphase transition from $T_i>T_c$ to $T_f<T_c$. We find that, for slow rolloverinitial conditions (the field near the maximum of the tree level potential),the process of phase separation controlled by unstable long-wavelengthfluctuations introduces dramatic corrections to the dynamical evolution of thefield. We find that these effects slow the rollover even further
