We present a picture of confinement based on representation of quarks aspointlike topological defects. The topological charge carried by quarks andconfined in hadrons is explicitly constructed in terms of Yang - Millsvariables. In 2+1 dimensions we are able to construct a local complex scalarfield $V(x)$, in terms of whichthe topological charge is $Q=-\frac{i}{4\pi}\intd^2x \epsilon_{ij}\partial_i(V^*\partial_i V -c.c.)$. The VEV of the field $V$in the confining phase is nonzero and the charge is the winding numbercorresponding to homotopy group $\pi_1(S^1)$. Qurks carry the charge $Q$ andtherefore are topological solitons. The effective Lagrangian for $V$ is derivedin models with adjoint and fundamental quarks. In 3+1 dimensions the explicitexpression for $V$ and therefore a detailed picture is not available. However,assuming the validity of the same mechanism wepoint out several interestingqualitative consequences. We argue that in the Georgi - Glashow model or anygrand unified model the photon (in the Higgs phase) should have a smallnonperturbative mass and $W^\pm$ should be confined although with small stringtension.
