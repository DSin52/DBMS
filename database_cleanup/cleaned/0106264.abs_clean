We consider the use of interpolating gauges (with a gauge function (F[A;alpha]) in gauge theories to connect the results in a set of different gauges in thepath-integral formulation. We point out that the results for physicalobservables are very sensitive to the epsilon term that we have to add to dealwith singularities and thus cannot be left out of a discussion ofgauge-independence generally. We further point out, with reasons, that the factthat we can ignore this term in the discussion of gauge independence whilevarying of the gauge parameter in Lorentz-type covariant gauges is an exceptionrather than a rule . We show that generally gauge-independence requires thatthe epsilon-term has to be varied with alpha. We further show that if we make anaive use of the epsilon term -i\int d^{4}x[{1/2}A^{2}-\bar{c}c]) (that isappropriate for the Feynman gauge) for general interpolating gauges witharbitrary parameter values [i.e.alpha], we cannot preserve gauge independence[except when we happen to be in the infinitesimal neighborhood of theLorentz-type gauges]. We show with an explicit example that for such a naiveuse of an epsilon-term, we develop serious pathology in the path-integral asalpha is/are varied. We point out that correct way to fix the epsilon-term in apath-integral in a non-Lorentz gauge is by connecting the path-integral to theLorentz-gauge path-integral with correct epsilon-term as has been done usingthe finite field-dependent BRS transformations in recent years.
