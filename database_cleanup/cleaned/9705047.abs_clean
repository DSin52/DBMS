We show that a particular many-matrix model gives rise, upon hamiltonianreduction, to a multidimensional version of the Calogero-Sutherland model andits spin generalizations. Some simple solutions of these models aredemonstrated by solving the corresponding matrix equations. A connection ofthis model to the dimensional reduction of Yang-Mills theories to(0+1)-dimensions is pointed out. In particular, it is shown that the low-energydynamics of D0-branes in sectors with nontrivial fermion content is that ofspin-Calogero particles.
