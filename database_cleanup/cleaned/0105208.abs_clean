We present supersymmetry breaking four dimensional orientifolds of type IIAstrings. The compact space is a torus times a four dimensional orbifold. Theorientifold group reflects one direction in each torus. RR tadpoles arecancelled by D6-branes intersecting at angles in the torus and in the orbifold.The angles are chosen such that supersymmetry is broken. The resulting fourdimensional theories contain chiral fermions. The tadpole cancellationconditions imply that there are no non-abelian gauge anomalies. The models alsocontain anomaly-free U(1) factors.
