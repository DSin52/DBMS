The Wilson discretization of the dimensionally reduced supersymmetricYang-Mills theory is constructed. This gives a lattice version of the matrixmodel of M-theory. An SU(2) model is studied numerically in the quenchedapproximation for D=4. The system shows canonical scaling in the continuumlimit. A clear signal for a prototype of the "black hole to strings" phasetransition is found. The pseudocritical temperature is determined and thetemperature dependence of the total size of the system is measured in bothphases. Further applications are outlined.
