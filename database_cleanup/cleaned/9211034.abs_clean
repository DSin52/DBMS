Dilogarithm identities for the central charges and conformal dimensions existfor at least large classes of rational conformally invariant quantum fieldtheories in two dimensions. In many cases, proofs are not yet known but thenumerical and structural evidence is convincing. In particular, close relationsexist to fusion rules and partition identities. We describe some examples andideas, and present some conjectures useful for the classification of conformaltheories. The mathematical structures seem to be dual to Thurston's program forthe classification of 3-manifolds.
