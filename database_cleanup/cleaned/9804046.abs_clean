We investigate the SO(10)-unification model in a Lie algebraic formulation ofnoncommutative geometry. The SO(10)-symmetry is broken by a 45-Higgs and theMajorana mass term for the right neutrinos (126-Higgs) to the standard modelstructure group. We study the case that the fermion masses are as general aspossible, which leads to two 10-multiplets, four 120-multiplets and twoadditional 126-multiplets of Higgs fields. This Higgs structure differsconsiderably from the two Higgs multiplets 16 \otimes 16^* and 16^c \otimes16^* used by Chamseddine and Fr\"ohlich. We find the usual tree-levelpredictions of noncommutative geometry m_W=(1/2)m_t, \sin^2\theta_W=(3/8) andg_2=g_3 as well as m_H \leq m_t.
