We review some of the uses of Whitham hierarchies in the context of thetheory of the prepotential in N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories. We focus onthe structure of the contact terms in the twisted topological theory, and onthe connection between Whitham hierarchies and the u-plane integrals for higherrank gauge groups, trying to put together the different approaches involved ininterpretation of the slow times as supersymmetry breaking parameters, and thenew techniques to extract instanton corrections using the RG equations writtenin terms of theta functions.
