I develop a formalism for solving topological field theories explicitly, inthe case when the explicit expression of the instantons is known. I solvetopological Yang-Mills theory with the $k=1$ Belavin {\sl et al.} instanton andtopological gravity with the Eguchi-Hanson instanton. It turns out that naivelyempty theories are indeed nontrivial. Many unexpected interesting hiddenquantities (punctures, contact terms, nonperturbative anomalies with or withoutgravity) are revealed. Topological Yang-Mills theory with $G=SU(2)$ is not justDonaldson theory, but contains a certain {\sl link} theory. Indeed, local andnon-local observables have the property of {\sl marking} cycles. Fromtopological gravity one learns that an object can be considered BRST exact onlyif it is so all over the moduli space ${\cal M}$, boundary included. Being BRSTexact in any interior point of ${\cal M}$ is not sufficient to make anamplitude vanish. Presumably, recursion relations and hierarchies can be foundto solve topological field theories in four dimensions, in particulartopological Yang-Mills theory with $G=SU(2)$ on ${\bf R}^4$ and topologicalgravity on ALE manifolds.
