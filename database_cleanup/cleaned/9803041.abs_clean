Open branes ending on other branes, which may be referred to as the hostbranes, are studied in the superembedding formalism. The open brane, host braneand the target space in which they are both embedded are all taken to besupermanifolds. It is shown that the superspace constraints satisfied by theopen brane are sufficient to determine the corresponding superspace constraintsfor the host branes, whose dynamics are determined by these constraints. As abyproduct, one also obtains information about the boundary of the open branepropagating in the host brane.
