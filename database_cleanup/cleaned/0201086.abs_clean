Title: Integer- and Non-Integer-Shift of the Chern-Simons Coupling under a

Local Higher Covariant Derivative RegulatorAuthors: Koh-ichi Nittoh

The Chern-Simons coupling shift is calculated within the framework of thehybrid regularization based on a local higher covariant derivative regulator.When the Yang-Mills term is present in the theory the well-know integer-shiftis obtained, but is absent, the shift value is non-integer. These results showa possibility that a non-integer-shift can be derived using a local highercovariant derivative and also suggest that the Yang-Mills term plays animportant role in the integer-shift of the Chern-Simons coupling.
