We discuss a model of a conformal p-brane interacting with the world volumemetric and connection. The purpose of the model is to suggest a mechanism bywhich gravity coupled to p-branes leads to the formation of structure ratherthan homogeneity in spacetime. Furthermore, we show that the formation ofstructure is accompanied by the appearance of a multivalued cosmologicalconstant, i.e., one which may take on different values in different domains, orcells, of spacetime. The above results apply to a broad class of non lineargravitational lagrangians as long as metric and connection on the p-branemanifold are treated as independent variables.
