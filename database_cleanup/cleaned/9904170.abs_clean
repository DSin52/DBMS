electrons and photonsAuthors: S. Ulrych

Comments: 29 pages, no figures, no tables

A new relativistic description of quantum electrodynamics is presented.Guideline of the theory is the Klein-Gordon equation, which is reformulated toconsider spin effects. This is achieved by a representation of relativisticvectors with a space-time algebra made up of Pauli matrices and hyperbolicnumbers. The algebra is used to construct the differential operator of theelectron as well as the photon wave equation. The properties of free electronand photon states related to this wave equation are investigated. Interactionsare introduced as usual with the minimal substitution of the momentumoperators. It can be shown that the new wave equation is equivalent to thequadratic form of the Dirac equation. Furthermore, the Maxwell equations can bederived from the corresponding wave equation for photons.
