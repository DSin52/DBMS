We establish a relation between the classical non-linear Schr\"odingerequation and the KP hierarchy, and we extend this relation to the quantum caseby defining a quantum KP hierarchy. We present evidence that an integrablehierarchy of equations is obtained by quantizing the first Hamiltonianstructure of the KdV equation. The connection between infinite-dimensionalalgebras and integrable models is discussed.
