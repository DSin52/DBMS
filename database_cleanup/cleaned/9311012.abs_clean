We consider a class of $2+D$ - dimensional string backgrounds with a targetspace metric having a covariantly constant null Killing vector and flat`transverse' part. The corresponding sigma models are invariant under $D$abelian isometries and are transformed by $O(D,D)$ duality into modelsbelonging to the same class. The leading-order solutions of the conformalinvariance equations (metric, antisymmetric tensor and dilaton), as well as theaction of $O(D,D)$ duality transformations on them, are exact, i.e. are notmodified by $\a'$-corrections. This makes a discussion of different space-timerepresentations of the same string solution (related by $O(D,D|Z)$ dualitysubgroup) rather explicit. We show that the $O(D,D)$ duality may connect curved$2+D$-dimensional backgrounds with solutions having flat metric but, ingeneral, non-trivial antisymmetric tensor and dilaton. We discuss severalparticular examples including the $2+D=4$ - dimensional background that wasrecently interpreted in terms of a WZW model.
