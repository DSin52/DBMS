The Weyl anomaly in the Holographic Renormalisation Group as implementedusing Hamilton-Jacobi language is studied in detail. We investigate thebreakdown of the descent equations in order to isolate the Weyl anomaly of thedual field theory close to the (UV) fixed point. We use the freedom of addingfinite terms to the renormalised effective action in order to bring theanomalies in the expected form. We comment on different ways of describing thebare and renormalised schemes, and on possible interpretations of the descentequations as describing the renormalisation group flow non-perturbatively. Wefind that under suitable assumptions these relations may lead to a class ofc-functions.
