The so-called ``massive 11-dimensional supergravity'' theory gives, for oneKilling vector, Romans' massive 10-dimensional supergravity in 10 dimensions,for two Killing vectors an Sl(2,Z) multiplet of massive 9-dimensionalsupergravity theories that can be obtained by standard generalized dimensionalreduction type IIB supergravity and has been shown to contain a gaugedsupergravity. We consider a straightforward generalization of this theory tothree Killing vectors and a 3\times 3 symmetric mass matrix and show that itgives an Sl(3,Z) multiplet of 8-dimensional supergravity theories that containan SO(3) gauged supergravity which is, in some way, the dual to the one foundby Salam and Sezgin by standard generalized dimensional reduction.
