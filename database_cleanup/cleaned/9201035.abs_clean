The method of separation of variables is shown to apply to both the classicaland quantum Neumann model. In the classical case this nicely yields thelinearization of the flow on the Jacobian of the spectral curve. In the quantumcase the Schr\"odinger equation separates into one--dimensional equationsbelonging to the class of generalized Lam\'e differential equations.
