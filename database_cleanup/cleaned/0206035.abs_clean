The most popular noncommutative field theories are characterized by a matrixparameter theta^(mu,nu) that violates Lorentz invariance. We consider thesimplest algebra in which the theta-parameter is promoted to an operator andLorentz invariance is preserved. This algebra arises through the contraction ofa larger one for which explicit representations are already known. We formulatea star product and construct the gauge-invariant Lagrangian forLorentz-conserving noncommutative QED. Three-photon vertices are absent in thetheory, while a four-photon coupling exists and leads to a distinctivephenomenology.
