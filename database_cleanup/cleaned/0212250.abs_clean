An indication for the existence of a collective Myers solution in thenon-abelian D0-brane Born-Infeld action is the presence of a tachyonic mode influctuations around the standard diagonal background. We show that thiscomputation for non-abelian D0-branes in curved space has the geometricinterpretation of computing the eigenvalues of the geodesic deviation operatorfor U(N)-valued coordinates. On general grounds one therefore expects ageometric Myers effect in regions of sufficiently negative curvature. Weconfirm this by explicit computations for non-abelian D0-branes on a sphere anda hyperboloid. For the former the diagonal solution is stable, but not so forthe latter. We conclude by showing that near the horizon of a Schwarzschildblack hole one also finds a tachyonic mode in the fluctuation spectrum,signaling the possibility of a near-horizon gravitationally induced Myerseffect.
