428-434We translate effectively our earlier quantum constructions to the classicallanguage and using Yang-Baxterisation of the Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajanalgebra are able to construct Lax operators and associated $r$-matrices ofclassical integrable models. Thus new as well as known lattice systems ofdifferent classes are generated including new types of collective integrablemodels and canonical models with nonstandard $r$ matrices.
