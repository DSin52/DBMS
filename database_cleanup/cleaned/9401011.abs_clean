We study the problem of covariant separation between first and second classconstraints for the $D=10$ Brink-Schwarz superparticle. Opposite to thesupersymmetric light-cone frame separation, we show here that there is aLorentz covariant way to identify the second class constraints such that,however, supersymmetry is broken. Consequences for the $D=10$ superstring arebriefly discussed.
