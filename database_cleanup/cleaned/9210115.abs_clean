The geometry of supermanifolds provided with $Q$-structure (i.e. with oddvector field $Q$ satisfying $\{ Q,Q\} =0$), $P$-structure (odd symplecticstructure ) and $S$-structure (volume element) or with various combinations ofthese structures is studied. The results are applied to the analysis ofBatalin-Vilkovisky approach to the quantization of gauge theories. Inparticular the semiclassical approximation in this approach is expressed interms of Reidemeister torsion.
