The $G/G$ gauged supergroup valued WZNW theory is considered. It is shownthat for $G=\OSP$, the $G/G$ theory tensoring a ($b$, $c$, $\beta$, $\gamma$)system is equivalent to the non-critical fermionic theory. The relation betweenintegral or half integral moded affine superalgebra and its reduced theory, theNS or R superconformal algebra, is discussed in detail. The physical statespace, i.e. the BRST semi-infinite cohomology, is calculated, for the$\OSP/\OSP$ theory.
