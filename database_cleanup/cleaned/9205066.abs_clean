A kind of topological field theory is proposed as a candidate to describe theglobal structure of the 2-form Einstein gravity with or without a cosmologicalconstant. Indeed in the former case, we show that a quantum state in thecandidate gives an exact solution of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. The BRSTquantization based on the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky (BFV) formalism is carriedout for this topological version of the 2-form Einstein gravity.
