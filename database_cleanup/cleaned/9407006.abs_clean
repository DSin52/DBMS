We consider the anomalies of $W_\infty$ gravity in the context ofpath-integralquantization. We derive the ghost-loop anomalies to all orders in$\hbar$ directly from the path-integral measure by the Fujikawa method. We alsoshow that in the matter sector the higher-loop anomalies can be obtained byimplementation of the Wess-Zumino consistency condition using the one-loopanomaly. Cancellation of the anomalies between these two sectors then leavesthe theory anomaly-free.
