It is argued that the formal rules of correspondence between localobservation procedures and observables do not exhaust the entire physicalcontent of generally covariant quantum field theory. This result is obtained byexpressing the distinguishing features of the local kinematical structure ofquantum field theory in the generally covariant context in terms of atranslocal structure which carries the totality of the nonlocal kinematicalinformations in a local region. This gives rise to a duality principle at thedynamical level which emphasizes the significance of the underlying translocalstructure for modelling a minimal algebra around a given point. We discuss theemergence of classical properties from this point of view.
