We obtain first order equations that determine a supersymmetric kink solutionin five-dimensional N=8 gauged supergravity. The kink interpolates between anexterior anti-de Sitter region with maximal supersymmetry and an interioranti-de Sitter region with one quarter of the maximal supersymmetry. One eighthof supersymmetry is preserved by the kink as a whole. We interpret it asdescribing the renormalization group flow in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory brokento an N=1 theory by the addition of a mass term for one of the three adjointchiral superfields. A detailed correspondence is obtained between fields ofbulk supergravity in the interior anti-de Sitter region and composite operatorsof the infrared field theory. We also point out that the truncation used tofind the reduced symmetry critical point can be extended to obtain a new N=4gauged supergravity theory holographically dual to a sector of N=2 gaugetheories based on quiver diagrams.We consider more general kink geometries and construct a c-function that ispositive and monotonic if a weak energy condition holds in the bulk gravitytheory. For even-dimensional boundaries, the c-function coincides with thetrace anomaly coefficients of the holographically related field theory inlimits where conformal invariance is recovered.
