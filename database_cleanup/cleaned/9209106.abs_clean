The coupling of a dilaton to the $SU(2)$-Yang-Mills field leads tointeresting non-perturbative static spherically symmetric solutions which arestudied by mixed analitical and numerical methods. In the abelian sector of thetheory there are finite-energy magnetic and electric monopole solutions whichsaturate the Bogomol'nyi bound. In the nonabelian sector there exist acountable family of globally regular solutions which are purely magnetic buthave zero Yang-Mills magnetic charge. Their discrete spectrum of energies isbounded from above by the energy of the abelian magnetic monopole with unitmagnetic charge. The stability analysis demonstrates that the solutions aresaddle points of the energy functional with increasing number of unstablemodes. The existence and instability of these solutions are "explained" by theMorse-theory argument recently proposed by Sudarsky and Wald.
