By exploiting the correspondence between the Cardy boundary state in SU(2)group manifold and the BPS D3-brane configuration in the full asymptoticallyflat geometry of NS5-branes, we show that the Hanany-Witten effect in 10Dbackground is encoded in the Cardy boundary states. The two RR Page D0 chargesof the $n$-th spherical D2-brane due to the contraction to $e$ or ($-e$) isinterpreted, and attributed to the Hanany-Witten effect.
