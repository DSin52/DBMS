We show that the continuum limit of one-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric matrixmodels can be described by a two-dimensional interacting field theory of amassless boson and two chiral fermions. We interpret this field theory as atwo-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric theory of two chiral superfields, in whichone of the chiral superfields has a non-trivial vacuum expectation value.
