We study AdS/CFT correspondence in the case of AdS3. We obtain thestatistical entropy of the BTZ black hole in terms of the correct centralcharge and the conformal dimensions for the states corresponding to the BTZblack hole. We point out the difference between our method and the oldfashioned approaches based on SL(2,R) Wess-Zumino-Witten model or Liouvilletheory.
