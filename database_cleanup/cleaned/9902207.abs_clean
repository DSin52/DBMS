Gauging of space translations for nonrelativistic point particles in onedimension leads to general coordinate transformations with fixed Newtoniantime. The minimal gauge invariant extension of the particle velocity requiresthe introduction of two gauge fields whose minimal self interaction leads to aMaxwellian term in the Lagrangean. No dilaton field is introduced. We fix thegauge such that the residual symmetry group is the Galilei group. In case of aline the two-particle reduced Lagrangean describes the motion in a Newtoniangravitational potential with strength proportional to the energy. For particleson a circle with certain initial conditions we only have a collective rotationwith constant angular velocity.
