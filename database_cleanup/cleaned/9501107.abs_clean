Quantization of gauge theories on characteristic surfaces and in thelight-cone gauge is discussed. Implementation of the Mandelstam-Leibbrandtprescription for the spurious singularity is shown to require two distinct nullplanes, with independent degrees of freedom initialized on each. The relationof this theory to the usual light-cone formulation of gauge field theory, usinga single null plane, is described. A connection is established between thisformalism and a recently given operator solution to the Schwinger model in thelight-cone gauge.
