In the present paper the gauge-invariant formalism is developed forperturbations of the brane-world model in which our universe is realized as aboundary of a higher-dimensional spacetime. For the background model in whichthe bulk spacetime is $(n+m)$-dimensional and has the spatial symmetrycorresponding to the isometry group of a $n$-dimensional maximally symmetricspace, gauge-invariant equations are derived for perturbations of the bulkspacetime. Further for the case corresponding to the brane-world model in which$m=2$ and the brane is a boundary invariant under the spatial symmetry in theunperturbed background, relations between the gauge-invariant variablesdescribing the bulk perturbations and those for brane perturbations are derivedfrom Israel's junction condition under the assumption of $\ZR_2$ symmetry. Inparticular, for the case in which the bulk spacetime is a constant-curvaturespacetime, it is shown that the bulk perturbation equations reduce to a singlehyperbolic master equation for a master variable, and that the physicalcondition on the gauge-invariant variable describing the intrinsic stressperturbation of the brane yield a boundary condition for the master equationthrough the junction condition. On the basis of this formalism it is pointedout that it seems to be difficult to suppress brane perturbations correspondingto massive excitations for a brane motion giving a realistic expanding universemodel.
