We complete the proof of the ghost-dilaton theorem in string theory byshowing that the coupling constant dependence of the vacuum vertices appearingin the closed string action is given correctly by one-point functions of theghost-dilaton. To prove this at genus one we develop the formalism required toevaluate off-shell amplitudes on tori.
