Title: Inverting the Hamiltonian Reduction in String Theory

Comments: Talk presented at the 28th International Symposium on the Theory of

Elementary Particles, Wendisch-Rietz, September 1994It is well known that many interesting realisations of string theories can beobtained via hamiltonian reduction from WZW models. I want to point out thatstring theories do in certain cases also provide the recipe to reconstruct theambient space of the hamiltonian reduction, including Kac--Moody currents andthe associated ghosts. The procedure of reconstructing the Kac--Moody currentsis closely related to properties of matter+gravity multiplets in noncriticalstring theories. In application to KPZ gravity and its N=1 supersymmetricextension, the `inverted hamiltonian reduction' constructions serve toestablish relation with the DDK-type formalism for matter + gravity.
