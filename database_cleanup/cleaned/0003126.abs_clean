The class of the free relativistic covariant equations generated by thefractional powers of the D'Alambertian operator $(\square^{1/n})$ is studied.Meanwhile the equations corresponding to n=1 and 2 (Klein-Gordon and Diracequations) are local in their nature, the multicomponent equations forarbitrary n>2 are non-local. It is shown, how the representation of generalizedalgebra of Pauli and Dirac matrices looks like and how these matrices arerelated to the algebra of SU(n) group. The corresponding representations of thePoincar\'e group and further symmetry transformations on the obtained equationsare discussed. The construction of the related Green functions is suggested.
