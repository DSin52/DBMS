The renormalization algorithm based on regularization methods with tworegulators is analyzed by means of explicit computations. We show in particularthat regularization by higher covariant derivative terms can be complementedwith dimensional regularization to obtain a consistent renormalized4-dimensional Yang-Mills theory at the one-loop level. This shows that hybridregularization methods can be applied not only to finite theories, like \eg\Chern-Simons, but also to divergent theories.
