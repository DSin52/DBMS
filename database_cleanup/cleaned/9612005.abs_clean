Under certain conditions, imposed on the viscosity of the fluid, initial dataand the class of contours under consideration, the Cauchy problem with finitevalues of time for the loop equation in turbulence with Gaussian random forcesis solved by making use of the smearing procedure for the loop space functionalLaplacian. The solution obtained depends on the initial data and its functionalderivatives and on the potential of the random forces.
