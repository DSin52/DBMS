Title: The Mathematics of Fivebranes

Authors: R. Dijkgraaf

Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures, Lecture at ICM'98

Fivebranes are non-perturbative objects in string theory that generalizetwo-dimensional conformal field theory and relate such diverse subjects asmoduli spaces of vector bundles on surfaces, automorphic forms, ellipticgenera, the geometry of Calabi-Yau threefolds, and generalized Kac-Moodyalgebras.
