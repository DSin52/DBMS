The second derivatives of prepotential with respect to Whitham time-variablesin the Seiberg-Witten theory are expressed in terms of Riemann theta-functions.These formulas give a direct transcendental generalization of algebraic onesfor the Kontsevich matrix model. In particular case they provide an explicitderivation of the renormalization group (RG) equation proposed recently inpapers on the Donaldson theory.
