The null string's equations of motion and constraints in the Kerr spacetimeare given. We assume a generic ansatz for the null strings in the Kerrspacetime and we present the resulting solutions in quadratures. Some specificstring configurations, that follow from the generic one, are consideredseparately. In each case we also extract the corresponding solutions in theSchwarzschild spacetime.
