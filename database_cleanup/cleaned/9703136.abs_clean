Title: Les Houches Lectures on Fields, Strings and Duality

Comments: 152 pages, 31 epsf figures, latex

Notes of my 14 `lectures on everything' given at the 1995 Les Houches school.An introductory course in topological and conformal field theory, strings,gauge fields, supersymmetry and more. The presentation is more mathematicalthen usual and takes a modern point of view stressing moduli spaces, dualityand the interconnectedness of the subject. An apocryphal lecture on BPS statesand D-branes is added.
