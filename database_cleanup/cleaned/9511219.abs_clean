Path integral expressions for three canonical formalisms -- Ostrogradski'sone, constrained one and generalized one -- of higher-derivative theories aregiven. For each fomalism we consider both nonsingular and singular cases. It isshown that three formalisms share the same path integral expressions. Inpaticular it is pointed out that the generalized canonical formalism isconnected with the constrained one by a canonical transformation.
