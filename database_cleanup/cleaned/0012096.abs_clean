We give an off-shell formulation of the N=2 supersymmetric new nonlinearvector-tensor multiplet. Interactions arise in this model as a consequence ofgauging the central charge of the supersymmetry algebra, which in contrast toprevious models with local central charge is achieved without a coupling to avector multiplet. Furthermore, we present a new action formula that followsfrom coupling the N=2 linear multiplet to the vector-tensor multiplet.
