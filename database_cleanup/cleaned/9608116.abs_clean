We derive in the SCFT and low energy effective action frameworks thenecessary and sufficient conditions for supersymmetric cycles in exceptionalholonomy manifolds and Calabi-Yau 4-folds. We show that the Cayley cycles in$Spin(7)$ holonomy eight-manifolds and the associative and coassociative cyclesin $G_2$ holonomy seven-manifolds preserve half of the space-timesupersymmetry. We find that while the holomorphic and special Lagrangian cyclesin Calabi-Yau 4-folds preserve half of the space-time supersymmetry, the Cayleysubmanifolds are novel as they preserve only one quarter of it. We present somesimple examples. Finally, we discuss the implications of these supersymmetriccycles on mirror symmetry in higher dimensions.
