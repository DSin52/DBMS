A representation theory of the quantized Poincar\'e ($\kappa$-Poincar\'e)algebra (QPA) is developed. We show that the representations of this algebraare closely connected with the representations of the non-deformed Poincar\'ealgebra. A theory of tensor operators for QPA is considered in detail.Necessary and sufficient conditions are found in order for scalars to beinvariants. Covariant components of the four-momenta and the Pauli-Lubanskivector are explicitly constructed.These results are used for the constructionof some q-relativistic equations. The Wigner-Eckart theorem for QPA is proven.
