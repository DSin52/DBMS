We show that in a Randall-Sundrum II type braneworld, the vacuum exterior ofa spherical star is not in general a Schwarzschild spacetime, but hasradiative-type stresses induced by 5-dimensional graviton effects. Standardmatching conditions do not lead to a unique exterior on the brane because ofthese 5-dimensional graviton effects. We find an exact uniform-density stellarsolution on the brane, and show that the general relativity upper bound$GM/R<{4\over9}$ is reduced by 5-dimensional high-energy effects. The existenceof neutron stars leads to a constraint on the brane tension that is strongerthan the big bang nucleosynthesis constraint, but weaker than the Newton-lawexperimental constraint. We present two different non-Schwarzschild exteriorsthat match the uniform-density star on the brane, and we give a uniquenessconjecture for the full 5-dimensional problem.
