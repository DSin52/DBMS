We study matrix quantum mechanics at a finite temperature equivalent to onedimensional compactified string theory with vortex (winding) excitations. It isexplicitly demonstrated that the states transforming under non-trivial U(N)representations describe various configurations vortices and anti-vortices. Forexample, for the adjoint representation the Feynman graphs (representingdiscretized world-sheets) contain two faces with the boundaries wrapping aroundthe compactified target space which is equivalent to a vortex-anti-vortex pair.A technique is developed to calculate partition functions in a givenrepresentation for the standard matrix oscillator. It enables us to obtain thepartition function in the presence of a vortex-anti-vortex pair in the doublescaling limit using an analytical continuation to the upside-down oscillator.The Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition occurs in a similar way andat the same temperature as in the flat 2D space. A possible generalization ofour technique to any dimension of the embedding space is discussed.
