We construct a world-line representation for the fermionic one-loop effectiveaction with axial and also vector, scalar, and pseudo-scalar couplings. We usethis expression to compute a few selected scattering amplitudes. These allow usto verify that our method yields the same results as standard field theory. Inparticular, we are able to reproduce the chiral anomaly. Our starting point isthe second-order formulation for the Dirac fermion. We translate the secondorder expressions into a world-line action.
