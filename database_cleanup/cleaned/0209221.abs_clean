We study the spectral representation and dispersion relations that followfrom some basic assumptions and the reduced spacetime symmetries onnoncommutative (NC) space. Kinematic variables involving the NC parameterappear naturally as parametric variables in this analysis. When subtractionsare necessary to remove ultraviolet divergences, they are always made at thefixed values of these NC variables. This point is also illustrated by aperturbative analysis of self-energies. Our analysis of the reduced spacetimesymmetries suggests a weaker microcausality requirement. Starting from it, wemake a first attempt at dispersion relations for forward scattering. It turnsout that the attempt is hampered by a new unphysical region specified by agiven motion in the NC plane which does not seem to be surmountable using theusual tricks. Implications for a possible subtraction and renormalizationscheme for NC field theory in which the ultraviolet-infrared (UV/IR) mixing isremoved are also briefly commented on.
