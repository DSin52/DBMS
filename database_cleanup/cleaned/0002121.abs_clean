bounds corrected; bounds are not numerically smaller than Standard Modelphysics without further assumptions about the VEV of the dilaton. However,qualitative bound on curvature scale by bulk Kaluza-Klein scale unchangedJournal-ref: Phys.Rev. D62 (2000) 085003

We discuss maximally symmetric curved deformations of the flat domain wallsolutions of five-dimensional dilaton gravity that appeared in a recentapproach to the cosmological constant problem. By analyzing the bulk fieldconfigurations and the boundary conditions at a four-dimensional maximallysymmetric curved domain wall, we obtain constraints on such solutions. For aspecial dilaton coupling to the brane tension that appeared in recent works, wefind no curved deformations, confirming and extending slightly a result ofArkani-Hamed et al which was argued using a $Z_2$-symmetry of the solution. Formore general dilaton-dependent brane tension, we find that the curvature isbounded by the Kaluza-Klein scale in the fifth dimension.
