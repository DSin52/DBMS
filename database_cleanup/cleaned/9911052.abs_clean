Title: Super-p-brane actions from interpolating dualisations

Authors: Anders Westerberg and Niclas Wyllard

Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX2e. Based on talks given by A.W. at QFTHEP'99, Moscow,

27 May-2 June 1999, and at the Third annual meeting of the EU TMR network`Quantum aspects of gauge theories, supersymmetry and unification', Paris,1-7 September 1999We review a recently proposed method for constructing super-p-braneworld-volume actions. In this approach, starting from a democratic choice ofworld-volume gauge-fields guided by p-brane intersection rules, therequirements of kappa-symmetry and gauge invariance can be used to determinethe corresponding action. We discuss the application of the method to somecases of interest, notably the (p,q)-5-branes of type-IIB string theory in amanifestly S-duality covariant formulation.
