We study fractional branes in ${\CN}=2$ orbifold and ${\CN}=1$ conifoldtheories. Placing a large number $N$ of regular D3-branes at the singularityproduces the dual ${\bf AdS}_5\times X^5$ geometry, and we describe thefractional branes as small perturbations to this background. For the orbifolds,$X^5={\bf S}^5/\Gamma$ and fractional D3-branes excite complex scalars from thetwisted sector which are localized on the fixed circle of $X^5$. The resultingsolutions are given by holomorphic functions and the field-theoreticbeta-function is simply reproduced. For $N$ regular and $M$ fractionalD3-branes at the conifold singularity we find a non-conformal ${\cal N}=1$supersymmetric $SU(N+M)\times SU(N)$ gauge theory. The dual Type $\II$Bbackground is ${\bf AdS}_5\times {\bf T}^{1,1}$ with NS-NS and R-R 2-formfields turned on. This dual description reproduces the logarithmic flow ofcouplings found in the field theory.
