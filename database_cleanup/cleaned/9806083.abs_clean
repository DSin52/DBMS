The integrability of the one-dimensional (1D) fermion chain model isinvestigated in the framework of the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method (QISM).We introduce a new R-operator for the fermion chain model, which is expressedin terms of the fermion operators. The R-operator satisfies a new type of theYang-Baxter relation with fermionic L-operator. We derive the fermionicSutherland equation from the relation, which is equivalent to the fermionic Laxequation. It also provides a mathematical foundation of the boost operatorapproach for the fermion model. In fact, we obtain some higher conservedquantities of the fermion model using the boost operator.
