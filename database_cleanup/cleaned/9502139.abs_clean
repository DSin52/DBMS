The problem of the higher-loop contributions to the axial anomaly isreexamined by a new method. We demonstrate that these contributions depend onthe order of the calculations. If the divergence of the axial current bynonperturbative Fujikawa method is calculated first and then average it overthe photon field in the presence of an external photon source, a nonzerocontribution is obtained. However perturbative Feynman diagram method has anuncertainty. Depending on the order of the calculations above mentioned or zeroresults are obtained.
