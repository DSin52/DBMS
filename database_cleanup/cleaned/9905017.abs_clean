Title: Nonrenormalizability of (Last Hope) D=11 Supergravity, with a Terse

Survey of Divergences in Quantum GravitiesAuthors: S. Deser

Comments: Invited Lecture at Fundamental Interactions

Holes, Brussels, March 1999Before turning to the new result that D=11 supergravity is 2-loopnonrenormalizable, we give a very brief history of the ultraviolet problems ofordinary quantum gravity and of supergravities in general D.
