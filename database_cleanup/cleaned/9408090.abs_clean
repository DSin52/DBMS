The split involution quantization scheme, proposed previously for puresecond--class constraints only, is extended to cover the case of the presenceof irreducible first--class constraints. The explicit Sp(2)--symmetry propertyof the formalism is retained to hold. The constraint algebra generatingequations are formulated and the Unitarizing Hamiltonian is constructed.Physical operators and states are defined in the sense of the new equivalencecriterion that is a natural counterpart to the Dirac's weak equality concept asapplied to the first--class quantities.
