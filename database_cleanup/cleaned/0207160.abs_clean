Comments: 23 pages

Using the algebraic geometry method of Berenstein and Leigh for theconstruction of the toroidal orbifold (T^2 x T^2 x T^2) / (Z_2 x Z_2) withdiscrete torsion and considering local K3 surfaces, we present non-commutativeaspects of the orbifolds of product of K3 surfaces. In this way, the ordinarycomplex deformation of K3 can be identified with the resolution of stringysingularities by non-commutative algebras using crossed products. We giverepresentations and make some comments regarding the fractionation of branes.Illustrating examples are presented.
