Low-harmonic formulas for closed relativistic strings are given. Generalparametrizations are presented for the addition of second- and third-harmonicwaves to the fundamental wave. The method of determination of theparametrizations is based upon a product representation found for the finiteFourier series of string motion in which the constraints are automaticallysatisfied. The construction of strings with kinks is discussed, includingexamples. A procedure is laid out for the representation of kinks that arisefrom self-intersection, and subsequent intercommutation, for harmonicallyparametrized cosmic strings.
