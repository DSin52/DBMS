We study representations of the central extension of the Lie algebra ofdifferential operators on the circle, the W-infinity algebra. We obtaincomplete and specialized character formulas for a large class ofrepresentations, which we call primitive; these include all quasi-finiteirreducible unitary representations. We show that any primitive representationwith central charge N has a canonical structure of an irreduciblerepresentation of the W-algebra W(gl_N) with the same central charge and thatall irreducible representations of W(gl_N) with central charge N arise in thisway. We also establish a duality between "integral" modules of W(gl_N) andfinite-dimensional irreducible modules of gl_N, and conjecture their fusionrules.
