The evolution of a closed bosonic string is envisaged in the time-dependentbackground of its massless modes. A duality transformation is implemented onthe spatial component of string coordinates to obtain a dual string. It isshown that the evolution equations are manifestly $O(d,d)$ invariant. The treelevel string effective actions for the original and the dual string theory areshown to be equivalent.
