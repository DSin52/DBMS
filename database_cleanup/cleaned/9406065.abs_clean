Title: Invariants of 3-Manifolds Derived From Finite Dimensional Hopf Algebras

Comments: 33 pages

This paper studies invariants of 3-manifolds derived from certain fin itedimensional Hopf algebras. The invariants are based on right integrals forthese algebras. It is shown that the resulting class of invariants is distinctfrom the class of Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants.
