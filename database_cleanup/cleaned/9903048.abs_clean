An S-matrix analog is defined for anti-de Sitter space by constructing ``in''and ``out'' states that asymptote to the timelike boundary. A derivationparallel to that of the LSZ formula shows that this ``boundary S-matrix'' isgiven directly by correlation functions in the boundary conformal theory. Thisprovides a key entry in the AdS to CFT dictionary.
