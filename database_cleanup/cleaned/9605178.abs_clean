Several physics aspects of the Seiberg-Witten solution of N=2 supersymmetricYang-Mills theory with SU(2) gauge group, supplemented with a small mass termfor the "matter" fields which leads to an $N=1$ theory with confinement, arediscussed. The light spectrum of the theory is understood on the basis ofcurrent algebra relations, and CP invariance of the massless and massivetheories is studied. We find that in the massive (confining) theory the lowenergy physics has an exact CP symmetry, while in a generic vacuum in themassless theory CP invarince is spontaneously broken.
