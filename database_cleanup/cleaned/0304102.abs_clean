It is argued that free QFT can be defined on the event horizon of aSchwarzschild-like spacetime and that this theory is unitarily andalgebraically equivalent to QFT in the bulk (near the horizon). Under thatunitary equivalence the bulk hidden SL(2,R) symmetry found in a previous workbecomes manifest on the event horizon, it being induced by a group of horizondiffeomorphisms. The class of generators of that group can be enlarged toinclude a full Virasoro algebra of fields which are defined on the eventhorizon. These generators have a quantum representation in QFT on the eventhorizon and thus in the bulk.
