It is observed that a large class of $(2,2)$ string vacua with $n>5$superfields can be rewritten as Landau_Ginzburg orbifolds with discrete torsionand $n=5$. The naive geometric interpretation (if one exists) would be that ofa complex 3-fold, not necessarily K\"ahler but still with vanishing first Chernclass.
