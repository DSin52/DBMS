The most radical version of the holographic principle asserts that allinformation about physical processes in the world can be stored on its surface.This formulation is at odds with inflationary cosmology, which implies thatphysical processes in our part of the universe do not depend on the boundaryconditions. Also, there are some indications that the radical version of theholographic theory in the context of cosmology may have problems with unitarityand causality. Another formulation of the holographic principle, due toFischler and Susskind, implies that the entropy of matter inside thepost-inflationary particle horizon must be smaller than the area of thehorizon. Their conjecture was very successful for a wide class of open and flatuniverses, but it did not apply to closed universes. Bak and Rey proposed adifferent holographic bound on entropy which was valid for closed universes ofa certain type. However, as we will show, neither proposal applies to open,flat and closed universes with matter and a small negative cosmologicalconstant. We will argue, in agreement with Easther, Lowe, and Veneziano, thatwhenever the holographic constraint on the entropy inside the horizon is valid,it follows from the Bekenstein-Hawking bound on the black hole entropy. Theseconstraints do not allow one to rule out closed universes and other universeswhich may experience gravitational collapse, and do not impose any constraintson inflationary cosmology.
