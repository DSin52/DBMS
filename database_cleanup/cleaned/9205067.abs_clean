Title: Discussion of Self-Dual c=24 Conformal Field Theories

Authors: P.Montague

Comments: 19 pages

We discuss questions arising from the recent work of Schellekens, and alsofrom an earlier paper by Schellekens and Yankielowicz. We summariseSchellekens' results, and proceed to discuss the uniqueness of the c=24self-dual conformal field theory with no weight one states, i.e. the Monstermodule $V^\natural$. After introducing the concept of complementaryrepresentations, we examine $Z_2$-orbifold constructions in general, and thenproceed to apply our considerations firstly to the specific case of the FKSconstructions $H(\Lambda)$ and then to the reflection twisted theories$\widetilde H(\Lambda)$. Our techniques provide evidence for the existence ofseveral new theories beyond those proven to exist in previous work andconjectured to exist in Schellekens and Yankielowicz.
