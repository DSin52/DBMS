We construct the quantum BRST operators for a large class of superconformaland quasi--superconformal algebras with quadratic nonlinearity. The only freeparameter in these algebras is the level of the (super) Kac-Moody sector. Thenilpotency of the quantum BRST operator imposes a condition on the level. Wefind this condition for (quasi) superconformal algebras with a Kac-Moody sectorbased on a simple Lie algebra and for the $Z_2\times Z_2$--gradedsuperconformal algebras with a Kac-Mody sector based on the superalgebra$osp(N\vert 2M)$ or $s\ell(N+2\vert N)$.
