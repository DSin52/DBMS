Based on a methodological analysis of the effective action approach certainconceptual foundations of quantum field theory are reconsidered to establish aquest for an equation for the effective action. Relying on the functionalintegral formulation of Lagrangian quantum field theory a functional integralequation for the complete effective action is proposed which can be understoodas a certain fixed point condition. This is motivated by a critical attitudetowards the distinction artificial from an experimental point of view betweenclassical and effective action. While for free field theories nothing new isaccomplished, for interacting theories the concept differs from the establishedparadigm. The analysis of this new concept is concentrated on gauge fieldtheories treating QED as the prototype model. An approximative approach to thefunctional integral equation for the complete effective action of QED isexploited to obtain certain nonperturbative information about the quadratickernels of the action. As particular application the approximative calculationof the QED coupling constant $\alpha$ is explicitly studied. It is understoodas one of the characteristics of a fixed point given as a solution of thefunctional integral equation proposed. Finally, within the present approach thevacuum energy problem is considered and possible implications on the inducedgravity concept are contemplated.
