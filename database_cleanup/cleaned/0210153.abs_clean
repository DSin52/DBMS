We compute string field theory Hamiltonian matrix elements and compare themwith matrix elements of the dilatation operator in gauge theory. We get preciseagreement between the string field theory and gauge theory computations oncethe correct cubic Hamiltonian matrix elements in string field theory and aparticular basis of states in gauge theory are used. We proceed to compute thematrix elements of the dilatation operator to order g_2^2 in this same basis.This calculation makes a prediction for string field theory Hamiltonian matrixelements to order g_2^2, which have not yet been computed. However, our gaugetheory results precisely match the results of the recent computation by Pearsonet al. of the order g_2^2 Hamiltonian matrix elements of the string bit model.
