Houches schoolsA matrix model of an asymptotically free theory with a bound state is solvedusing a perturbative similarity renormalization group for hamiltonians. Aneffective hamiltonian with a small width, calculated including the first threeterms in the perturbative expansion, is projected on a small set of effectivebasis states. The resulting small hamiltonian matrix is diagonalized and theexact bound state energy is obtained with accuracy of order 10%. Then, a briefdescription and an elementary illustration are given for a related light-frontFock space operator method which aims at carrying out analogous steps forhamiltonians of QCD and other theories.
