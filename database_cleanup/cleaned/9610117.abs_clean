Taking into account a neutral massive scalar field minimally coupled togravity, in a Robertson-Walker metric, it is shown that when the final state isconnected with the initial one by means of a Bogoliubov transformation, whichdoes not include the single-mode rotation operator, the mean value of createdparticles is conserved. When the rotation operator is considered, it is stillpossible to use the approach of single-mode squeezed operators and get theentropy as the logarithm of the created particles.
