Title: Higgs Fields in Supersymmetrical Theory

Authors: Andrei M. Sukhov

Comments: 7 pages, LaTeX, no figure, no macros

The theory including interaction between Siegel and gauge multiplets leads tothe model of nonbreaking supersymmetry which contains massive scalar,four component fermion and gauge fields. The upper bound of Higgs boson mass isestimated as heaviest fermion mass. The idea to replace Higgs field by scalarsuperpartner or by auxiliary fields of corresponding supermultiplet isdiscussed.
