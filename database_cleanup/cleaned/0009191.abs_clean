It has been shown recently that the background independent open string fieldtheory provides an exact description of the tachyon condensation on unstableD-branes of bosonic string theory. In this analysis the overall normalisationof the action was chosen so that it reproduces the conjectured relationsinvolving tachyon condensation. In this paper we fix this normalisation bycomparing the on-shell three tachyon amplitude computed from the backgroundindependent open string field theory with the same amplitude computed from thecubic open string field theory, which in turn agrees with the result of thefirst quantised theory. We find that this normalisation factor is in preciseagreement with the one required for verifying the conjectured properties of thetachyon potential.
