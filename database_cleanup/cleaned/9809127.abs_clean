The Equivalence Principle (EP), stating that all physical systems areconnected by a coordinate transformation to the free one with vanishing energy,univocally leads to the Quantum Stationary HJ Equation (QSHJE). Trajectoriesdepend on the Planck length through hidden variables which arise as initialconditions. The formulation has manifest p-q duality, a consequence of theinvolutive nature of the Legendre transform and of its recently observedrelation with second-order linear differential equations. This reflects in anintrinsic psi^D-psi duality between linearly independent solutions of theSchroedinger equation. Unlike Bohm's theory, there is a non-trivial action evenfor bound states. No use of any axiomatic interpretation of the wave-functionis made. Tunnelling is a direct consequence of the quantum potential whichdiffers from the usual one and plays the role of particle's self-energy. TheQSHJE is defined only if the ratio psi^D/psi is a local self-homeomorphism ofthe extended real line. This is an important feature as the L^2 condition,which in the usual formulation is a consequence of the axiomatic interpretationof the wave-function, directly follows as a basic theorem which only uses thegeometrical gluing conditions of psi^D/psi at q=\pm\infty as implied by the EP.As a result, the EP itself implies a dynamical equation that does not requireany further assumption and reproduces both tunnelling and energy quantization.Several features of the formulation show how the Copenhagen interpretationhides the underlying nature of QM. Finally, the non-stationary higherdimensional quantum HJ equation and the relativistic extension are derived.
