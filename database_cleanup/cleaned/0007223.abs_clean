Brane world scenarios offer a way of setting the cosmological constant tozero after supersymmetry breaking provided there is a sufficient number ofadjustable integration constants/parameters. In the case of the Horava-Wittentheory compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold, we argue that it is difficult tofind enough freedom to get a zero (or small) cosmological constant aftersupersymmetry breaking.
