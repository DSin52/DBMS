This is intended to be a simple discussion of work done in collaboration withS. Cecotti, K. Intriligator and C. Vafa; and with H. Saleur. I discuss how $ TrF (-1)^F e^{-\beta H}$ can be computed exactly in any N=2 supersymmetric theoryin two dimensions. It gives exact information on the soliton spectrum of thetheory, and corresponds to the partition function of a single self-avoidingpolymer looped once around a cylinder of radius $\beta$. It is independent ofalmost all deformations of the theory, and satisfies an exact differentialequation as a function of $\beta$. For integrable theories it can also becomputed from the exact S-matrix. This implies a highly non-trivial equivalenceof a set of coupled integral equations with the classical sinh-Gordon and theaffine Toda equations.
