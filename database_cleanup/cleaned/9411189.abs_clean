This work proposes a natural extension of the Bargmann-Fock representation toa SUSY system. The main objective is to show that all essential structures ofthe n-dimensional SUSY oscillator are supplied by basic differentialgeometrical notions on an analytical R^n, except for the scalar product whichis the only additional ingredient. The restriction to real numbers implies onlya minor loss of structure but makes the essential features clearer. Inparticular, euclidean evolution is enforced naturally by identification withthe 1-parametric group of dilations.
