Title: Lagrangian description of N=2 minimal models as critical points of

Landau-Ginzburg theories.Authors: M.T. Grisaru and D. Zanon

Comments: Presented at the SMQFT conference at UCLA, May 1994. 10 pages, latex,

macros included.We discuss a two-dimensional lagrangian model with $N=2$ supersymmetrydescribed by a K\"{a}hler potential $K(X,\bar{X})$ and superpotential $gX^k$which explicitly exhibits renormalization group flows to infrared fixed pointswhere the central charge has a value equal that of the $N=2$, $A_{k-1}$ minimalcontradistinction to bosonic or $N=1$ models, no modification of the$\b$-function takes place.
