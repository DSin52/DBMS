We discuss Wick rotations in the context of gravity, with emphasis on anon-perturbative Wick rotation proposed in hep-th/0103186 mapping realLorentzian metrics to real Euclidean metrics in proper-time coordinates. As anapplication, we demonstrate how this Wick rotation leads to a correct answerfor a two dimensional non-perturbative path-integral.
