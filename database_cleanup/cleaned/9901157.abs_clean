Title: Elementary-Particle Propagation via 3-Scale ``Towers of Quartet Rings''

Within a Dyonic History LatticeComments: (Latex file, 10 pages)

Massless elementary-particle propagation is represented historically(cosmologically) through 3-scale ``towers of quartet rings'' within a latticeof magneto-electrodynamically communicating ``pre-events''. The lightlikeintervals within a ring of 4 pre-events (discrete ``closed string'') displaytransverse GUT-scale and longitudinal ``particle scale''. The lightlike(longitudinal) spacing between successive rings of a tower is at Planck scale.Ratio between GUT scale and Planck scale relates quantum-dynamically toelementary magnetic charge. Permutations of a ring quartet, in conjunction withLorentz-group representations, control elementary-particle quantum numbers.
