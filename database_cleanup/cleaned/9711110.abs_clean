Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B424 (1998) 322-327

Based on the relation to random matrix theory, exact expressions for allmicroscopic spectral correlators of the Dirac operator can be computed fromfinite-volume partition functions. This is illustrated for the case of$SU(N_c)$ gauge theories with $N_c\geq 3$ and $N_f$ fermions in the fundamentalrepresentation.
