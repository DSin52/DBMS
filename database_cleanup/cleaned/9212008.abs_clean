Title: Extending the Barnes-Rivers Operators to D=3 Topological Gravity

Authors: C. Pinheiro and G. O. Pires

Comments: Latex 10 pages

The spin-projector operators for symmetric rank-2 tensors are reassessed inconnection with the issue of topologically massive gravity. The originalproposal by Barnes and Rivers is generalised to account for D-dimensionalEinstein gravity and 3-dimensional Chern-Simons massive gravitation.
