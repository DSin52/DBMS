We study the scattering of fermions in a ``global monopole'' backgroundmetric. This is the four-dimensional analogue of the scattering on a cone inthree dimensions. The scattering amplitude is exactly obtained. We then studymassless fermion-dyon systems in such a background metric. The density of the$S$-wave fermion condensate is found to be given by a constant times the flatspace value of Callan and Rubakov.
