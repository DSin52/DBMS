We consider D-branes and orientifold planes embedded in non-compact(orbifolded) space-time. We point out that even in the non-compact cases we canturn on non-zero (quantized) NS-NS antisymmetric B-field. In particular, westudy the effect of the B-field on four dimensional large N gauge theories fromorientifolds. Thus, in theories with both D3- and D7-branes, the effect of thefrom 8 (which is the required number if the B-field is trivial) to 4. Thisresults in a different orientifold string theory, and, subsequently, thecorresponding large N gauge theory is also different. We explicitly constructlarge N gauge theories from orientifolds with non-zero B-field backgrounds with${\cal N}=2,1,0$ supersymmetries. These theories, just as their counterpartswithout the B-field, have the property that in the large N limit computation ofany M-point correlation function reduces to the corresponding computation inthe parent ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric theory with a unitary gauge group.
