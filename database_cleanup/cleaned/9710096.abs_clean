A system of gravity coupled to a 2-form gauge field, a dilaton and Yang-Millsfields in $2n$ dimensions arises from the (2,1) sigma model or string. Thefield equations imply that the curvature with torsion and Yang-Mills fieldstrength are self-dual in four dimensions, or satisfy generalised self-dualityequations in $2n$ dimensions. The Born-Infeld-type action describing thissystem is simplified using an auxiliary metric and shown to be classically Weylinvariant only in four dimensions. A dual form of the action is found (noisometries are required). In four dimensions, the dual geometry is self-dualgravity without torsion coupled to a scalar field. In $D>4$ dimensions, thedual geometry is hermitian and determined by a $D-4$ form potential $K$,generalising the K\"{a}hler potential of the four dimensional case, with thefundamental 2-form given by $\tilde J= i*\partial \bar \partial K$. Thecoupling to Yang-Mills is through a term $K\wedge tr (F\wedge F)$ and leads toa Uhlenbeck-Yau field equation $\tilde J^{ij}F_{ij}=0$.
