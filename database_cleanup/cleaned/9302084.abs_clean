Title: Combinatorial expression for universal Vassiliev link invariant

Comments: 20 pages

Journal-ref: Commun.Math.Phys. 168 (1995) 1-22

The most general R-matrix type state sum model for link invariants isconstructed. It contains in itself all R-matrix invariants and is a generatingfunction for "universal" Vassiliev link invariants. This expression is moresimple than Kontsevich's expression for the same quantity, because it isdefined combinatorially and does not contain any integrals, except for anexpression for "the universal Drinfeld's associator".
