Title: The Four Dimensional Green-Schwarz Mechanism and Anomaly Cancellation

ConditionsComments: 21 pages, latex

abelian factor for which the chiral matter content of the theory is anomalous$\sum_{f} q^f_A \neq 0 \neq \sum_{f} (q^f_A)^3$ ; ii) a nonanomalous factor$G$. In these models, the calculation of consistent gauge anomalies usuallyfound in the literature as a solution to the Zumino-Stora descent equations isreconsidered. Another solution of the descent equations that differs on theterms involving mixed gauge anomalies is presented on this paper. The origin oftheir difference is analysed, and using Fujikawa's formalism the second resultis argued to be the divergence of the usual chiral current. Invokingtopological arguments the physical equivalence of both solutions is explained,but only the second one can be technically called the consistent anomaly of aclassically invariant theory. The first one corresponds to the addition ofnoninvariant local counterterms to the action. A consistency check of theirphysical equivalence is performed by implementing the four dimensional stringinspired Green-Schwarz mechanism for both expressions. This is achieved addingslightly different anomaly cancelling terms to the original action, whosedifference is precisely the local counterterms mentioned before. The completeanomaly free action is therefore uniquely defined, and the resultingconstraints on the spectrum of fermion charges are the same. The Lorentzinvariance of the fermion measure in four dimensions forces the Lorentzvariation of the Green-Schwarz terms to cancel by itself, producing anadditional constraint usually overlooked in the literature. This often happenswhen a dual description of the theory is used without including all localcounterterms.
