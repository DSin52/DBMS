Title: Light-Cone Quantisation of Matrix Models at c>1

Authors: S.Dalley

Comments: 14 pages, PUPT-1410

The technique of (discretised) light-cone quantisation, as applied to matrixmodels of relativistic strings, is reviewed. The case of the c=2 non-criticalbosonic string is discussed in some detail to clarify the nature of thecontinuum limit. Futher applications for the technique are then outlined.
