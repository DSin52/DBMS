String theory in an exact plane wave background is explored. A new example ofsingularity in the sense of string theory for nonsingular spacetime metric ispresented. The 4-tachyon scattering amplitude is constructed. The spectrum ofstates found from the poles in the factorization turns out to be equivalent tothat of the theory in flat space-time. The massless vertex operator is obtainedfrom the residue of the first order pole.
