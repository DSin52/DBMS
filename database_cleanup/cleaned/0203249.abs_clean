We study the plane wave limit of $AdS_5\times S^5/Z_2$ which arises as thenear horizon geometry of D3-branes at an orientifold 7-plane in type I' theory.We analyze string theory in the resulting plane wave background which containsopen strings. We identify gauge invariant operators in the dual $Sp(N)$ gaugetheory with unoriented closed and open string states.
