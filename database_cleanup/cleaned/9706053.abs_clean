Title: On Deriving the Effective Interaction from the QCD-Lagrangian

Comments: Latex, 8 pages, 2 figures

The canonical front form Hamiltonian for non-Abelian SU(N) gauge theory in3+1 dimensions is mapped non-perturbatively on an effective Hamiltonian whichacts only in the Fock space of a quark and an antiquark. The approach is basedon the novel method of iterated resolvents and on discretized light-conequantization, driven to the continuum limit. It is free of the usualTamm-Dancoff truncations of the Fock space, rather the perturbative series areconsistently resumed to all orders in the coupling constant. Emphasis is put ondealing with the many-body aspects of gauge field theory. Important is that thehigher Fock-space amplitudes can be retrieved self-consistently from thesesolutions.
