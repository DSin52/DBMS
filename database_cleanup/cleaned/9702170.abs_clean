The exact factorisable quantum S-matrices are known for simply laced aswell as non-simply laced affine Toda field theories. Non-simply laced theoriesare obtained from the affine Toda theories based on simply laced algebras byfolding the corresponding Dynkin diagrams. The same process, called classical`reduction', provides solutions of a non-simply laced theory from the classicalsolutions with special symmetries of the parent simply laced theory. In thepresent note we shall elevate the idea of folding and classical reduction tothe quantum level. To support our views we have made some interestingobservations for S-matrices of non-simply laced theories and giveprescription for obtaining them through the folding of simply laced ones.
