We study scattering of noncommutative solitons in 2+1 dimensional scalarfield theory. In particular, we investigate a system of two solitons with leveln and n' (the (n,n')-system) in the large noncommutativity limit. We show thatthe scattering of a general (n,n')-system occurs at right angles in the case ofzero impact parameter. We also derive an exact Kahler potential and the metricof the moduli space of the (n,1)-system. We examine numerically the (n,1)scattering and find that the closest distance for a fixed scattering angle iswell approximated by a function a+b*sqrt{n} where a and b are some numericalconstants.
