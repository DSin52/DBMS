We study the renormalizability of (massive) topological QCD based on thealgebraic BRST technique by adopting a non-covariant Landau type gauge andmaking use of the full topological superalgebra. The most general local counterterms are determined and it is shown that in the presence of central chargesthe BRST cohomology remains trivial. By imposing an additional set of stabilityconstraints it is proven that the matter action of topological QCD isperturbatively finite.
