We consider static solutions of the sine-Gordon theory defined on a cylinder,which can be either periodic or quasi-periodic in space. They are described bythe different modes of a simple pendulum moving in an inverted effectivepotential and correspond to its libration or rotation. We review thedecomposition of the solutions into an oscillatory sum of alternating kinks andanti-kinks or into a monotonic train of kinks, respectively, using propertiesof elliptic functions. The two sectors are naturally related to each other by amodular transformation, whereas the underlying spectral curve of the model canbe used to express the energy of the static configurations in terms of contourintegrals \`a la Seiberg-Witten in either case. The stability properties arealso examined by means of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, where we find thatthe unstable configurations are associated to singular superpotentials, thusallowing for negative modes in the spectrum of small fluctuations.
