We study the relation between the group-algebraic approach and the dressingsymmetry one to the soliton solutions of the $A_n^{(1)}$ Toda field theory in1+1 dimensions. Originally solitons in the affine Toda models has been found byOlive, Turok and Underwood. Single solitons are created by exponentials ofelements which ad-diagonalize the principal Heisenberg subalgebra.Alternatively Babelon and Bernard exploited the dressing symmetry to reproducethe known expressions for the fundamental tau functions in the sine-Gordonmodel. In this paper we show the equivalence between these two methods toconstruct solitons in the $A_n^{(n)}$ Toda models.
