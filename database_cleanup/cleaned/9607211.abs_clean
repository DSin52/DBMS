Title: Field theory of the spinning electron

Comments: standard LaTeX file

We present here a field theory of the spinning electron, by writing down anew equation for the 4-velocity field v^mu (different from that of Diractheory), which allows a classically intelligible description of the electron.Moreover, we make explicit the noticeable kinematical properties of suchvelocity field (which also result different from the ordinary ones). At last,we analyze the internal zitterbewegung (zbw) motions, for both time-like andlight-like speeds. We adopt in this paper the ordinary tensorial language. Ourstarting point is the Barut-Zanghi classical theory for the relativisticelectron, which related spin with zbw. This paper is dedicated to the memory ofAsim O. Barut, who so much contributed to clarifying very many fundamentalissues of physics, and whose work constitutes a starting point of thesearticles.
