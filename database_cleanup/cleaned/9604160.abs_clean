We study the effective action in Euclidean Yang-Mills theory with a compactsimple gauge group in one-loop approximation assuming a covariantly constantgauge field strength as a background. For groups of higher rank and spacetimesof higher dimensions such field configurations have many independent colorcomponents taking values in Cartan subalgebra and many ``magnetic fields'' ineach color component. In our previous investigation it was shown that suchbackground is stable in dimensions higher than four provided the amplitudes of``magnetic fields'' do not differ much from each other. In present paper wecalculate exactly the relevant zeta-functions in the case of equal amplitudesof ``magnetic fields''. For the case of two ``magnetic fields'' with equalamplitudes the behavior of the effective action is studied in detail. It isshown that in dimensions $d=4,5,6,7$ $({\rm mod}\, 8)$, the perturbative vacuumis metastable, i.e., it is stable in perturbation theory but the effectiveaction is not bounded from below, whereas in dimensions $d=9,10,11$ $({\rmmod}\, 8)$ the perturbative vacuum is absolutely stable. In dimensions $d=8$$({\rm mod}\, 8)$ the perturbative vacuum is stable for small values ofcoupling constant but becomes unstable for large coupling constant leading tothe formation of a non-perturbative stable vacuum with nonvanishing ``magneticfields''. The critical value of the coupling constant and the amplitudes of thevacuum ``magnetic fields'' are evaluated exactly.
