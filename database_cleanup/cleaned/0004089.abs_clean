We provide general determinant formulae for all n-particle form factorsrelated to the trace of the energy momentum tensor and the analogue of theorder and disorder operator in the $SU(3)_2$-homogeneous Sine-Gordon model. Weemploy the form factors related to the trace of the energy momentum tensor inthe application of the c-theorem and find perfect agreement with the physicalpicture recently obtained by means of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. Forfinite resonance parameter we recover the expected WZNW-coset central chargeand for infinite resonance parameter the theory decouples into two freefermions.
