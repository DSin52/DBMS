We develop a matrix model for the SO(32) Heterotic string with certain Wilsonlines on the lightlike circle. This is done by using appropriate T-dualities.The method works for an infinite number of Wilson lines, but not for all. Thematrix model is the theory on the D-string of type I wrapped on a circle with aSO(32) Wilson line on the circle. The radius of the circle depends on theWilson line. This is a 1+1 dimensional O(N) theory on a circle. N depends notonly on the momentum around the lightlike circle but also on the winding andSO(32) quantum numbers of the state. Perspectives for obtaining a matrix modelfor all Wilson lines are discussed.
