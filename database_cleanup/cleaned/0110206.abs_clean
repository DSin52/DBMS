We develop a new formalism for the bosonic sector of low-energy heteroticstring theory toroidally compactified to three dimensions. This formalism isbased on the use of some single non-quadratic real matrix potential whichtransforms linearly under the action of subgroup of the three-dimensionalcharging symmetries. We formulate a new charging symmetry invariant approachfor the symmetry generation and straightforward construction of asymptoticallyflat solutions. Finally, using the developed approach and the establishedformal analogy between the heterotic and Einstein-Maxwell theories, weconstruct a general class of the heterotic string theory extremal solutions ofthe Israel-Wilson-Perjes type. This class is asymptotically flat and chargingsymmetry complete; it includes the extremal solutions constructed before andpossesses the non-trivial bosonic string theory limit.
