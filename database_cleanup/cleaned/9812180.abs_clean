We study properties of a scalar quantum field theory on two-dimensionalnoncommutative space-times. Contrary to the common belief that noncommutativityof space-time would be a key to remove the ultraviolet divergences, we showthat field theories on a noncommutative plane with the most naturalHeisenberg-like commutation relations among coordinates or even on anoncommutative quantum plane with $E_q(2)$-symmetry have ultravioletdivergences, while the theory on a noncommutative cylinder is ultravioletfinite. Thus, ultraviolet behaviour of a field theory on noncommutative spacesis sensitive to the topology of the space-time, namely to its compactness. Wepresent general arguments for the case of higher space-time dimensions and aswell discuss the symmetry transformations of physical states on noncommutativespace-times.
