In this paper we construct a class of random matrix ensembles labelled by areal parameter $\alpha \in (0,1)$, whose eigenvalue density near zero behaveslike $|x|^\alpha$. The eigenvalue spacing near zero scales like$1/N^{1/(1+\alpha)}$ and thus these ensembles are representatives of a {\emcontinous} series of new universality classes. We study these ensembles both inthe bulk and on the scale of eigenvalue spacing. In the former case we obtainformulas for the eigenvalue density, while in the latter case we obtainapproximate expressions for the scaling functions in the microscopic limitusing a very simple approximate method based on the location of zeroes oforthogonal polynomials.
