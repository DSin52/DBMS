We present a noncommutative version of a plane-wave solution to thegravitational field equations. We start with a given classical solution,admittedly rather simple, and construct an algebra and a differential calculuswhich supports the metric. In the particular solution presented as an examplethe 1-forms do not anticommute, to a degree which depends on the amplitude ofthe deviation of the metric from the standard Minkowski metric.
