We study the $c=1$ conformal field theory of a free compactified boson withradius $r=\sqrt{\beta}$ ($\beta$ is an integer). The Fock space of this bosonis constructed in terms of anyon vertex operators and each state is labeled byan infinite set of pseudo-momenta of filled particles in pseudo-Dirac sea. Wavefunction of multi anyon state is described by an eigenfunction of theCalogero-Sutherland (CS) model. The $c=1$ conformal field theory at$r=\sqrt{\beta}$ gives a field theory of CS model. This is a naturalgeneralization of the boson-fermion correspondence in one dimension toboson-anyon correspondence. There is also an interesting duality between anyonwith statistics $\theta=\pi/\beta$ and particle with statistics $\theta=\beta\pi$.
