The origin of non-renormalization theorems in field theories with globalsupersymmetry can be traced to the fact that supersymmetric actions can beviewed as the highest components of respective supermultiplets. Supersymmetricinteractions in particular can therefore be represented as supersymmetryvariations of lower dimensional field polynomials. We investigate here thisalgebraic structure in the context of the Wess-Zumino model and N=1 and N=2supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories.
