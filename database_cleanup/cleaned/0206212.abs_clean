We investigate the dynamics of gauge and scalar fields on unstable D-braneswith rolling tachyons. Assuming an FRW metric on the brane, we find a solutionof the tachyon equation of motion which is valid for arbitrary tachyonpotentials and scale factors. The equations of motion for a U(1) gauge fieldand a scalar field in this background are derived. These fields see aneffective metric which differs from the original FRW metric. The fieldequations receive large corrections due to the curvature of the effectivemetric as well as the time variation of the gauge coupling. The equations ofstate for these fields resemble those of nonrelativistic matter rather thanthose of massless particles.
