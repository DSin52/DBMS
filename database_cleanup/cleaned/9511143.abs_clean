Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B373 (1996) 76-80

We consider the supersymmetric WZNW model gauged in a manifestlysupersymmetric way. We find the BRST charge and the necessary condition fornilpotency. In the BRST framework the model proves to be a Lagrangianformulation of the supersymmetric coset construction, known as the N=1Kazama-Suzuki coset construction.
