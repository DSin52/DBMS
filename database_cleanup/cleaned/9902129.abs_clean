In this paper we construct several supersymmetric theories, including SU(N)gauge theory, on AdS_5 background. We discuss the proper definition of theKilling equation for the symplectic Majorana spinors required in AdS_5supersymmetric theories. We find that the symplectic Killing spinor equationinvolves a matrix M in the USp(2N) indices whose role was not recognizedpreviously. Using the correct Killing spinors we explicitly confirm that theparticle masses in the constructed theories agree with the predictions of theAdS/CFT correspondence. Finally, we establish correct O(d-1,2) isometrytransformations required to keep the Lagrangian invariant on AdS_d.
