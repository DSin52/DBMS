The $sl(2)$ affine Toda model coupled to matter (ATM) is shown to describevarious features, such as the spectrum and string tension, of the low-energyeffective Lagrangian of QCD$_{2}$ (one flavor and $N$ colors). Thecorresponding string tension is computed when the dynamical quarks are in the{\sl fundamental} representation of SU(N) and in the {\sl adjoint}representation of SU(2).
