Compactifications of type IIB string theory on AdS5 x X5, where X5 is anEinstein space, can have one-fourth or half maximal supersymmetry for certainchoices of X5. Some of these theories admit exotic domain walls arising from5-branes wrapping 2-cycles in X5. We explore the relationship among thesedomain walls, fractional branes and branes stretched on intervals. World-volumefluxes in the wrapped branes play an important role in the analysis. We drawsome parallels between the AdS background with exotic domain walls and N=1supersymmetric MQCD, and identify other extended objects on the AdS side in thedual brane construction. The process of brane creation is used to give analternate derivation of the relationship between fractional branes and braneson intervals.
