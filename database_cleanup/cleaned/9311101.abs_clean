Light front field theories are known to have the usual infra-red divergencesof the equal time theories, as wellas new `spurious' infra-red divergences. Theformar kind of IR divergences are usually treated by giving a small mass to thegauge particle. An alternative method to deal with these divergences is tocalculate the transition matrix elements in a coherent state basis. In thispaper we present, as a model calculation the lowest order correction to thethree point vertex in QED using a coherent state basis in the light coneformalism. The relevant transition matrix element is shown to be free of thetrue IR divergences up to $O(e^2)$.
