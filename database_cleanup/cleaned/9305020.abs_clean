In this paper we show that a relativistic membrane admits an equivalentrepresentation in terms of the Kalb-Ramond gauge field$F_{\mu\nu\rho}=\partial_{\,[\,\mu}B_{\nu\rho]}$ encountered in string theory.classical equations of motion derived from the Dirac-Nambu-Goto action, then itis always possible to find a differential form of {\it rank three}, satisfyingMaxwell-type equations. The converse proposition is also true. In the firstpart of the paper, we show that a relativistic membrane, regarded as amechanical system, admits a Hamilton-Jacobi formulation in which the H-Jfunction describing a family of classical membrane histories is given by$\displaystyle{F=dB=dS^1\wedge dS^2\wedge dS^3}$. In the second part of thepaper, we introduce a {\it new} lagrangian of the Kalb-Ramond type whichprovides a {\it first order} formulation for both open and closed membranes.Finally, for completeness, we show that such a correspondence can beestablished in the very general case of a p-brane coupled to gravity in aspacetime of arbitrary dimensionality.
