We discuss the Hawking radiation in the Higgs-Yukawa system and we showdynamical formation of a spherical domain wall around the black hole. Theformation of the spherical wall is a general property of the black hole whoseHawking temperature is equal to or greater than the energy scale of the system.The formation of the electroweak wall and that of the GUT wall are shown asrealistic cases. We also discuss a phenomenon of the spontaneous charging-up ofthe black hole. The Hawking radiation can charge-up the black hole itself bythe charge-transportation due to the spherical wall when C- and CP-violation inthe wall are assumed. The black hole with the electroweak wall can obtain alarge amount of the hyper charge.
