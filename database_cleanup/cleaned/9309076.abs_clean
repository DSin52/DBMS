The goal of this theory is toconstruct a ``vertex tensor category'' structure on the category of modules fora suitable vertex operator algebra. The notion of vertex tensor category isessentially a ``complex analogue'' of the notion of symmetric tensor category,and in fact a vertex tensor category produces a braided tensor category in anatural way. The theory applies in particular to many familiar ``rational''vertex operator algebras, including those associated with WZNW models, minimalmodels and the moonshine module. In this paper (Part I), we introduce thenotions of $P(z)$- and $Q(z)$-tensor product, where $P(z)$ and $Q(z)$ are twospecial elements of the moduli space of spheres with punctures and localcoordinates, and we present the fundamental properties and constructions of$Q(z)$-tensor products.
