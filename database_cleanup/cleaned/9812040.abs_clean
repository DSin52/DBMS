We give a simple and elegant proof of the Equivalence Theorem, stating thattwo field theories related by nonlinear field transformations have the same Smatrix. We are thus able to identify a subclass of nonrenormalizable fieldtheories which are actually physically equivalent to renormalizable ones. Ourstrategy is to show by means of the BRS formalism that the "nonrenormalizable"part of such fake nonrenormalizable theories, is a kind of gauge fixing, beingconfined in the cohomologically trivial sector of the theory.
