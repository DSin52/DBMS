Braided tensor products have been introduced by the author as a systematicway of making two quantum-group-covariant systems interact in a covariant way,and used in the theory of braided groups. Here we study infinite braided tensorproducts of the quantum plane (or other constant Zamolodchikov algebra). Itturns out that such a structure precisely describes the exchange algebra in 2Dquantum gravity in the approach of Gervais. We also consider infinite braidedtensor products of quantum groups and braided groups.
