We study a bosonic four--dimensional effective action corresponding to theheterotic string compactified on a 6--torus (dilaton--axion gravity with onevector field) on a curved space--time manifold possessing a time--like Killingvector field. Previously an existence of the $SO(2,3)\sim Sp(4, R)$ globalsymmetry ($U$--duality) as well as the symmetric space property of thecorresponding $\sigma$--model have been established following Neugebauer andKramer approach. Here we present an explicit form of the $Sp(4, R)$ generatorsin terms of coset variables and construct a representation of the coset interms of the physical target space coordinates. Complex symmetric $2\times 2$matrix $Z$ (``matrix dilaton --axion'') is introduced for which $U$--dualitytakes the matrix valued $SL(2, R)$ form. In terms of this matrix the theory isfurther presented as a K\"ahler $\sigma$--model. This leads to a more concise$2\times 2$ formulation which opens new ways to construct exact classicalsolutions. New solution (corresponding to constant ${\rm Im} Z$ ) is obtainedwhich describes the system of point massless magnetic monopoles endowed withaxion charges equal to minus monopole charges. In such a system mutual magneticrepulsion is exactly balanced by axion attraction so that the resulting spacetime is locally flat but possesses multiple Taub--NUT singularities.
