We study type IIA string theory compactified on Calabi-Yau fourfolds andheterotic string theory compactified on Calabi-Yau threefolds times atwo-torus. We derive the resulting effective theories which have two space-timedimensions and preserve four supercharges. The duality between such vacua isestablished at the level of the effective theory. For type IIA vacua withnon-trivial Ramond-Ramond background fluxes a superpotential is generated. Weshow that for a specific choice of background fluxes and a fourfold which hasthe structure of a threefold fibred over a sphere the superpotential coincideswith the superpotential recently proposed by Taylor and Vafa incompactifications of type IIB string theory on a threefold.
