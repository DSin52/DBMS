It is well known through a recent work of Bernard, Gaudin, Haldane andPasquier (BGHP) that the usual spin Calogero-Sutherland (CS) model, containingparticles with $M$ internal degrees of freedom, respects the $Y(gl_M)$ Yangiansymmetry. By following and suitably modifying the approach of BGHP, in thisarticle we construct a novel class of spin CS models which exhibitmulti-parameter deformed or `nonstandard' variants of $Y(gl_M)$ Yangiansymmetry. An interesting feature of such CS Hamiltonians is that they containmany-body spin dependent interactions, which can be calculated directly fromthe associated rational solutions of Yang-Baxter equation. Moreover, these spindependent interactions often lead to `anyon like' representations ofpermutation algebra on the combined internal space of all particles. We alsofind out the general forms of conserved quantities as well as Lax pairs for theabove mentioned class of spin CS models, and describe the method ofconstructing their exact wave functions.
