Title: Light-Front Quantization and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking

Comments: 5 pages, Tex. Published in the Proceedings of the WORKSHOP ON HADRON

PHYSICS, HADRONS94, Gramado, RS, Brasil, World Scientific, Singapore, 1994.Shortened form of SLAC-HEP-PPF-9222, April 1992The spontaneous symmetry breaking (and Higgs) mechanism in the theoryquantized on the light-front ({\it l.f.}), in the {\it discretizedformulation}, is discussed. The infinite volume limit is taken to obtain the{\it continuum version}. The hamiltonian formulation is shown to contain a newingredient in the form of nonlocal {\it constraint eqs.} which lead to a {\itnonlocal l.f. Hamiltonian}. The description of the broken symmetry here has thesame physical content as in the conventional formulation though arrived atthrough a different mechanism.
