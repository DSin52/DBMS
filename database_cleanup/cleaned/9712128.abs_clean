The kinetic action of the N=2 Yang-Mills vector multiplet can be written inprojective N=2 superspace using projective multiplets. It is possible toperform a simple N=2 gauge fixing, which translated to N=1 component languagemakes the kinetic terms of gauge potentials invertible. After coupling theYang-Mills multiplet to unconstrained sources it is very simple to integrateout the gauge fixed vector multiplet from the path integral of the free theoryand obtain the N=2 propagator. Its reduction to N=1 components agrees with thepropagators of the gauge fixed N=1 component superfields. The coupling ofYang-Mills multiplets and hypermultiplets in N=2 projective superspace allowsus to define Feynman rules in N=2 superspace for these two fields.
