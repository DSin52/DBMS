A space consisting of two rapidly moving cosmic strings has recently beenconstructed by Gott that contains closed timelike curves. The global structureof this space is analysed and is found that, away from the strings, the spaceis identical to a generalised Misner space. The vacuum expectation value of theenergy momentum tensor for a conformally coupled scalar field is calculated onthis generalised Misner space. It is found to diverge very weakly on theChronology horizon, but more strongly on the polarised hypersurfaces. Thedivergence on the polarised hypersurfaces is strong enough that when the propergeodesic interval around any polarised hypersurface is of order the Plancklength squared, the perturbation to the metric caused by the backreaction willbe of order one. Thus we expect the structure of the space will be radicallyaltered by the backreaction before quantum gravitational effects becomeimportant. This suggests that Hawking's `Chronology Protection Conjecture'holds for spaces with non-compactly generated Chronology horizon.
