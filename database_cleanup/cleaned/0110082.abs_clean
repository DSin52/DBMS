In this paper we present the effects produced by the temperature in therenormalized vacuum expectation value of the zero-zero component of theenergy-momentum tensor associated with massless left-handed spinor field in thepointlike global monopole spacetime. In order to develop this calculation wehad to obtain the Euclidean thermal Green function in this background. Becausethe expression obtained for the thermal energy density cannot be expressed in aclosed form, its explicit dependence on the temperature is not completelyevident. So, in order to obtain concrete information about its thermalbehavior, we develop a numerical analysis of our result in the high-temperaturelimit for specific values of the parameter $\alpha$ which codify the presenceof the monopole.
