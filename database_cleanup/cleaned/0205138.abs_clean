We present a class of orthogonal membrane configurations which preserve 1/4of the full type IIA supersymmetry. These membrane configurations carryadditional F-string charges. We further analyze the D1-D3 configuration afterapplying T- duality along the world volume directions of the above orthogonalmembranes.
