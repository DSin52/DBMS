A simple model is introduced in which the cosmological constant isinterpreted as a true Casimir effect on a scalar field filling the universe(e.g. $\mathbf{R} \times \mathbf{T}^p\times \mathbf{T}^q$, $\mathbf{R} \times\mathbf{T}^p\times \mathbf{S}^q, ...$). The effect is driven by compactifyingboundary conditions imposed on some of the coordinates, associated both withlarge and small scales. The very small -but non zero- value of the cosmologicalconstant obtained from recent astrophysical observations can be perfectlymatched with the results coming from the model, by playing just with thenumbers of -actually compactified- ordinary and tiny dimensions, and being thecompactification radius (for the last) in the range $(1-10^3) l_{Pl}$, where$l_{Pl}$ is the Planck length. This corresponds to solving, in a way, what hasbeen termed by Weinberg the {\it new} cosmological constant problem. Moreover,a marginally closed universe is favored by the model, again in coincidence withindependent analysis of the observational results.
