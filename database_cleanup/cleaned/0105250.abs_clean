We construct supergravity solutions dual to the twisted field theoriesarising when M-theory membranes wrap holomorphic curves in Calabi-Yau n-folds.The solutions are constructed in an Abelian truncation of maximal D=4 gaugedsupergravity and then uplifted to D=11. For four-folds and five-folds we findnew smooth AdS/CFT examples and for all cases we analyse the nature of thesingularities that arise. Our results provide an interpretation of certaincharged topological AdS black holes. We also present the generalisedcalibration two-forms for the solutions.
