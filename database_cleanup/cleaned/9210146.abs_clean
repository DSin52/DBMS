section expandedWe demonstrate the relation of the infrared anomaly of conformal field theorywith entropy considerations of finite temperature thermodynamics for the3-state Potts chain. We compute the free energy and compute the low temperaturespecific heat for both the ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic spin chains,and find the central charges for both.
