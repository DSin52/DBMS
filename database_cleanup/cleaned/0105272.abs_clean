We investigate classical bosonic open-string field theory from theperspective of the Wilson renormalization group of world-sheet theory. Themicroscopic action is identified with Witten's covariant cubic action and theshort-distance cut-off scale is introduced by length of open-string strip whichappears in the Schwinger representation of open-string propagator. {\itClassical open-string field theory} in the title means open-string field theorygoverned by a classical part of the low energy action. It is obtained byintegrating out suitable tree interactions of open-strings and is ofnon-polynomial type. We study this theory by using the BV formalism. It turnsout to be deeply related with deformation theory of $A_{\infty}$-algebra. Weintroduce renormalization group equation of this theory and discuss it fromseveral aspects. It is also discussed that this theory is interpreted as aboundary open-string field theory. Closed-string BRST charge and boundarystates of closed-string field theory in the presence of open-string field playimportant roles.
