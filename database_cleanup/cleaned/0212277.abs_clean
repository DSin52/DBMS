Using the eternal BTZ black hole as a concrete example, we show how spacelikesingularities and horizons can be described in terms of AdS/CFT amplitudes. Ourapproach is based on analytically continuing amplitudes defined in Euclideansignature. This procedure yields finite Lorentzian amplitudes. The naivedivergences associated with the Milne type singularity of BTZ are regulated byan $i\epsilon$ prescription inherent in the analytic continuation and acancellation between future and past singularities.The boundary description corresponds to a tensor product of two CFTs in anentangled state, as in previous work. We give two bulk descriptionscorresponding to two different analytic continuations. In the first, onlyregions outside the horizon appear explicitly, and so amplitudes are manifestlyfinite. In the second, regions behind the horizon and on both sides of thesingularity appear, thus yielding finite amplitudes for virtual particlespropagating through the black hole singularity. This equivalence betweendescriptions only outside and both inside and outside the horizon isreminiscent of the ideas of black hole complementarity.
