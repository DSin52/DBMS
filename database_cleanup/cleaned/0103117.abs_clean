We study orbifold group actions on locally defined fields upon M-theorybranes in a three-form C-fields background. We derive some constraints from theconsistency of the orbifold group actions. We show the possibility of theexistence of M-theory discrete torsion for the fields on the worldvolume anddiscuss its features.
