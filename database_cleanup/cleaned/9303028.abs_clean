The heat coefficients related to the Laplace-Beltrami operator defined on thehyperbolic compact manifold $H^3/\Ga$ are evaluated in the case in which thediscrete group $\Ga$ contains elliptic and hyperbolic elements. It is shownthat while hyperbolic elements give only exponentially vanishing corrections tothe trace of the heat kernel, elliptic elements modify all coefficients of theasymptotic expansion, but the Weyl term, which remains unchanged. Some physicalconsequences are briefly discussed in the examples.
