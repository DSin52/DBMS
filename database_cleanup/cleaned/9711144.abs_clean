Imposing initial conditions to nonequilibrium systems at some time t_0 leads,in renormalized quantum field theory, to the appearance of singularities in thevariable t-t_0 in relevant physical quantities, such as energy density andpressure. The origin of these `initial singularities' can be traced back to thechoice of initial state. We construct here, by a Bogoliubov transformation,initial states such that these singularities are eliminated. While theconstruction is not unique it can be considered a minimal way of taking intoaccount the nonequilibrium evolution of the system prior to t_0.
