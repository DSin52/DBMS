Using a Hamiltonian approach, we construct the classical and quantum theoryof open WZW strings on a strip. (These are the strings which end on WZWbranes.) The development involves non-abelian generalized Dirichlet images inan essential way. At the classical level, we find a new non-commutativegeometry in which the equal-time coordinate brackets are non-zero at theworld-sheet boundary, and the result is an intrinsically non-abelian effectwhich vanishes in the abelian limit. Using the classical theory as a guide tothe quantum theory, we also find the operator algebra and the analogue of theKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations for the the conformal field theory of open WZWstrings.
