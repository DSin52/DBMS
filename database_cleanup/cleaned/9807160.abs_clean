A non-linear integral equation (NLIE) governing the finite size effects ofexcited states of even topological charge in the sine-Gordon (sG) / massiveThirring (mTh) field theory, deducible from a light-cone lattice formulation ofthe model, has been known for some time. In this letter we conjecture anextension of this NLIE to states with odd topological charge, thus completingthe spectrum of the theory. The scaling functions obtained as solutions to ourconjectured NLIE are compared successfully with Truncated Conformal Space dataand the construction is shown to be compatible with all other facts known aboutthe local Hilbert spaces of sG and mTh models. With the present results we haveachieved a full control over the finite size behaviour of energy levels ofsG/mTh theory.
