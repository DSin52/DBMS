By employing D6-branes intersecting at angles in $D = 4$ type I strings, weconstruct the first examples of three generation string GUT models (PS-Aclass), that contain at low energy exactly the standard model spectrum with noextra matter and/or extra gauge group factors. They are based on the group$SU(4)_C \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$. The models are non-supersymmetric,even though SUSY is unbroken in the bulk. Baryon number is gauged and itsanomalies are cancelled through a generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism. We alsodiscuss models (PS-B class) which at low energy have the standard modelaugmented by an anomaly free U(1) symmetry and show that multibrane wrappingscorrespond to a trivial redefinition of the surviving global U(1) at lowenergies. There are no colour triplet couplings to mediate proton decay andproton is stable. The models are compatible with a low string scale of energyless that 650 GeV and are directly testable at present or future acceleratorsas they predict the existence of light left handed weak fermion doublets atenergies between 90 and 246 GeV. The neutrinos get a mass through anunconventional see-saw mechanism. The mass relation $m_e = m_d$ at the GUTscale is recovered. Imposing supersymmetry at particular intersectionsgenerates non-zero Majorana masses for right handed neutrinos as well providingthe necessary singlets needed to break the surviving anomaly free U(1), thussuggesting a gauge symmetry breaking method that can be applied in generalleft-right symmetric models.
