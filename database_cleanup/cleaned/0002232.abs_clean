Multicomplex numbers of order n have an associated trigonometry (multisinefunctions with (n-1) parameters) leading to a natural extension of thesine-Gordon model. The parameters are constrained from the requirement of localcurrent conservation. In two dimensions for n < 6 known integrable models(deformed Toda and non-linear sigma, pure affine Toda...) with dualcounterparts are obtained in this way from the multicomplex space MC itself andfrom the natural embedding $\MC_n \subset \MMC_m, n < m$. For $ n \ge 6$ ageneric constraint on the space of parametersis obtained from currentconservation at first order in the interaction Lagragien.
