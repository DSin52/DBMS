Using a Dirac-matrix substitution rule, applied to the electric charge, theanomalous magnetic moments of fermions are incorporated in local form in thetwo-body relativistic wave equations of constraint theory. The structure of theresulting potential is entirely determined, up to magnetic type form factors,from that of the initial potential descibing the mutual interaction in theabsence of anomalous magnetic moments. The wave equations are reduced to asingle eigenvalue equation in the sectors of pseudoscalar and scalar states($j=0$). The requirement of a smooth introduction of the anomalous magneticmoments imposes restrictions on the behavior of the form factors near theorigin, in $x$-space. The nonrelativistic limit of the eigenvalue equation isalso studied.
