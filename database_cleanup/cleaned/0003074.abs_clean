We consider a modification of gravity at large distances in a Brane Universewhich was discussed recently. In these models the modification of gravity atlarge distances is ultimately connected to existence of negative tensionbrane(s) and exponentially small tunneling factor. We discuss a general modelwhich interpolates between Bi-gravity model and GRS model. We also discuss thepossible mechanism of stabilization for negative tension branes in AdSbackground. Finally we show that extra degrees of freedom of massive gravitonsdo not lead to disastrous contradiction with General Relativity if thestabilization condition $\int dy \sqrt{-G^{(5)}} (T^\mu_\mu-2T^5_5)=0$ isimplemented.
