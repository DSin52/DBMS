Authors: Antonio S. de Castro

Journal-ref: J.Phys. A35 (2002) 6203-6204

This comment directs attention to some fails of the Alhaidari approach tosolve relativistic problems. It is shown that his gauge considerations are wayoff the mark and that the class of exactly solvable relativistic problems isnot so enlarged as Alhaidari thinks it is.
