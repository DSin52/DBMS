Since the background fields of the string low energy action are supposed tobe the long range manifestation of a condensate of strings, the addition ofworld sheet actions to the low energy effective action needs some stringtheoretic explanation. In this paper we suggest that this may be understood, asbeing due to string loop effects. We first present arguments using an equationdue to Tseytlin and then more rigorously in the particular case of type IIBtheory by invoking the Fischler-Susskind effect. The argument provides furtherjustification for ${\rm SL}(2,Z)$ duality between D-strings andF(fundamental)-strings. In an appendix we comment on recent attempts to relatethe type IIA membrane to the 11-dimensional membrane.
