We develop a perturbation theory of four-dimensional topological 2-formgravity without cosmological constant.A 2-form and an $SU(2)$ connection 1-form are used as fundamental variablesinstead of metric.There is no quantum correction from two-loop and higher orders in covariantgauge, in Landau gauge and in background covariant gauge.We improve naive dimensional regularization and calculate an exact quantumcorrection at one-loop order.We observe that the renormalizability depends on gauge choice in topological2-form gravity.It is unrenormalizable in the covariant gauge and in the background covariantgauge.On the other hand in the Landau gauge, we obtain finite but $SU(2)$non-covariant quantum corrections.There may exist anomaly for the $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry.(Talk given by A.
