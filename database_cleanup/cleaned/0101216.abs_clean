A review of the relationships between matrix models and noncommutative gaugetheory is presented. A lattice version of noncommutative Yang-Mills theory isconstructed and used to examine some generic properties of noncommutativequantum field theory, such as UV/IR mixing and the appearence ofgauge-invariant open Wilson line operators. Morita equivalence in this class ofmodels is derived and used to establish the generic relation betweennoncommutative gauge theory and twisted reduced models. Finite dimensionalrepresentations of the quotient conditions for toroidal compactification ofmatrix models are thereby exhibited. The coupling of noncommutative gaugefields to fundamental matter fields is considered and a large mass expansion isused to study properties of gauge-invariant observables. Morita equivalencewith fundamental matter is also presented and used to prove the equivalencebetween the planar loop renormalizations in commutative and noncommutativequantum chromodynamics.
