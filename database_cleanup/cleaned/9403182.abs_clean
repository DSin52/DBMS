A Poisson--Hopf algebra of smooth functions on the (1+1) Cayley--Kleingroups is constructed by using a classical $r$--matrix which is invariantunder contraction. The quantization of this algebra for the Euclidean,Galilei and Poincar\'e cases is developed, and their duals are alsocomputed. Contractions on these quantum groups are studied.
