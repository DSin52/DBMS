Certain aspects of three dimensional asymptotically de Sitter spaces arestudied, with emphasis on the mapping between gravity observables and therepresentation of the conformal symmetry of the boundary. In particular, weshow that non-real conformal weights for the boundary theory correspond tospace-times that have non-zero angular momentum. Some miscellaneous results onthe role of the holonomies and isometry groups are also presented.
