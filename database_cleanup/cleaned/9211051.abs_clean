Title: Physical States in the $W_3$ String

Authors: C.N. Pope

Comments: 14 pages

We present a review of some of the recent developments in the study of the$W_3$ string. One of the interesting features of the theory is that thephysical spectrum includes states with non-standard ghost structure, such asexcitations of the ghost fields, both for discrete-momentum andcontinuous-momentum states.
