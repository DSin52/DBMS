Title: A Look at the Discretized Superstring Using Random Matrices

Comments: 12 pages, latex file, no figures. Based on a talk given at the II

International Colloquium in Modern Quantum Field Theory at Bombay, India,January 5-11, 1994, to appear in the ProceedingsBeginning with a review of the arguments leading to the so-called c=1 barrierin the continuum formulation of noncritical string theory, the pathology isthen exhibited in a discretized version of the theory, formulated throughdynamical triangulation of two dimensional random surfaces. The effect ofembedding the string in a superspace with fermionic coordinates is next studiedin some detail. Using techniques borrowed from the theory of random matrices,indirect arguments are presented to establish that such an embedding maystabilize the two dimensional world sheet against degeneration into a branchedpolymer-like structure, thereby leading to a well-defined continuum stringtheory in a spacetime of dimension larger than 2.
