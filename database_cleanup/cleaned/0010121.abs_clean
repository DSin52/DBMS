We consider (n + m + 1) dimensional bulk spacetime, containing flat (n + m -1) dimensional parallel branes, with topology R^{n - 1} \times T^m. We assumethat the graviton and an m-form field are the only bulk fields and that them-form field has non vanishing components along the T^m directions only. Wethen find that the m-form field, with suitable bulk and brane potentials, canstabilise the radion modulus at the required value with no fine tuning. We findself tuning solutions also.
