The finite-volume spectrum of an integrable massive perturbation of arational conformal field theory interpolates between massive multi-particlestates in infinite volume (IR limit) and conformal states, which are approachedat zero volume (UV limit). Each state is labeled in the IR by a set of `BetheAnsatz quantum numbers', while in the UV limit it is characterized primarily bythe conformal dimensions of the conformal field creating it. We presentexplicit conjectures for the UV conformal dimensions corresponding to any IRstate in the $\phi_{1,3}$-perturbed minimal models $M(2,5)$ and $M(3,5)$. Theconjectures, which are based on a combinatorial interpretation of theRogers-Ramanujan-Schur identities, are consistent with numerical resultsobtained previously for low-lying energy levels.
