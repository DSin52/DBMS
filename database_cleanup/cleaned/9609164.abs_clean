figure, uses sprocl.styWe review the application of the critical point large N_f self-consistencymethod to QCD. In particular we derive the O(1/N_f) d-dimensional criticalexponents whose epsilon-expansion determines the perturbative coefficients inMSbar of the field dimensions, beta-function and various twist-2 operatorswhich occur in the operator product expansion of deep inelastic scattering.
