Title: Anomaly Cancellations and String Symmetries in the Effective Field

TheoryComments: 10 pages, LaTeX

This contribution briefly describes some developments of the use of stringsymmetries and anomaly cancellation mechanisms to include string loopcorrections in the construction of the low-energy effective supergravity ofsuperstrings.
