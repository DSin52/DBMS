We present a geometric formulation of super $p$--brane theories in which theWess--Zumino term is $(p+1)$--th order in the supersymmetric currents, andhence is manifestly supersymmetric. The currents are constructed using asupergroup manifold corresponding to a generalization of a superalgebra whichwe found sometime ago. Our results generalize Siegel's analogous reformulationof the Green--Schwarz superstring. The new superalgebras we construct underlythe free differential superalgebras introduced by de Azc\'arraga and Townsend afew years ago.
