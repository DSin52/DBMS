We find an infinite number of conserved currents and charges in thesemiclassical limit $\lambda \to \infty$ of string theory in AdS$_5 \times S^5$and remark on their relevance to conserved charges in the dual gauge theory. Weestablish a general procedure of exploring the semiclassical limit by viewingthe classical motion as collective motion in the relevant part of theconfiguration space. We illustrate the procedure for semiclassical expansionaround solutions of string theory on AdS$_5 \times (S^5/Z_M)$.
