Degenerations of Lie algebras of meromorphic vector fields on elliptic curves(i.e. complex tori) which are holomorphic outside a certain set of points(markings) are studied. By an algebraic geometric degeneration process certainsubalgebras of Lie algebras of meromorphic vector fields on P^1 the Riemannsphere are obtained. In case of some natural choices of the markings thesesubalgebras are explicitly determined. It is shown that the number of markings30F30, 81T40
