Closed forms are derived for the effective actions for free, massive spinlessfields in anti-de Sitter spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions. The results havesimple expressions in terms of elementary functions (for odd dimensions) ormultiple Gamma functions (for even dimensions). We use these to argue againstthe quantum validity of a recently-proposed duality relating such theories withdiffering masses and cosmological constants.
