The methods of conformal field theory are used to obtain the series of exactsolutions of the fundamental equations of the theory of turbulence. The basicconjecture, proved to be self-consistent ,is the conformal invariance of theinertial range. The resulting physical picture is different from the standardone , since the enstrophy transfer is catalyzed by the large scale motions. Thetheory gives some unambiguous predictions for the correlations in the inertialrange.
