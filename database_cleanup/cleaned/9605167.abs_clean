We introduce and investigate numerically a minimal class of dynamicaltriangulations of two-dimensional gravity on the sphere in which only verticesof order five, six or seven are permitted. We show firstly that thisrestriction of the local coordination number, or equivalently intrinsic scalarcurvature, leaves intact the fractal structure characteristic of genericdynamically triangulated random surfaces. Furthermore the Ising model coupledto minimal two-dimensional gravity still possesses a continuous phasetransition. The critical exponents of this transition correspond to the usualKPZ exponents associated with coupling a central charge c=1/2 model totwo-dimensional gravity.
