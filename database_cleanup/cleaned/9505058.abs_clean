We consider the theory of four-fermion interactions with N-component fermionsin de Sitter space. It is found that the effective potential for a compositeoperator in the theory is calculable in the leading order of the 1/N expansion.The resulting effective potential is analyzed by varying both the four-fermioncoupling constant and the curvature of the space-time. The critical curvatureat which the dynamically generated fermion mass disappears is found to existand is calculated analytically. The dynamical fermion mass is expressed as afunction of the space-time curvature.
