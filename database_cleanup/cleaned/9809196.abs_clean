Authors: A.Marshakov, A.Mironov

Comments: LaTeX, 20 pages (small changes in section 5)

We briefly review the Whitham hierarchies and their applications tointegrable systems of the Seiberg-Witten type. The simplest example of the N=2supersymmetric SU(2) pure gauge theory is considered in detail and thecorresponding Whitham solutions are found explicitely.
