The importance and usefulness of renormalization are emphasized innonrelativistic quantum mechanics. The momentum space treatment of bothtwo-body bound state and scattering problems involving some potentials singularat the origin exhibits ultraviolet divergence. The use of renormalizationtechniques in these problems leads to finite converged results for both theexact and perturbative solutions. The renormalization procedure is carried outfor the quantum two-body problem in different partial waves for a minimalpotential possessing only the threshold behavior and no form factors. Therenormalized perturbative and exact solutions for this problem are found to beconsistent with each other. The useful role of the renormalization groupequations for this problem is also pointed out.
