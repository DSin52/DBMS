We consider conditions under which a universe contracting towards a bigcrunch can make a transition to an expanding big bang universe. A promisingexample is 11-dimensional M-theory in which the eleventh dimension collapses,bounces, and re-expands. At the bounce, the model can reduce to a weaklycoupled heterotic string theory and, we conjecture, it may be possible tofollow the transition from contraction to expansion. The possibility opens thedoor to new classes of cosmological models. For example, we discuss how itsuggests a major simplification and modification of the recently proposedekpyrotic scenario.
