We investigate the Penrose limit of various brane solutions includingDp-branes, NS5-branes, fundamental strings, (p,q) fivebranes and (p,q) strings.We obtain special null geodesics with the fixed radial coordinate (criticalradius), along which the Penrose limit gives string theories with constantmass. We also study string theories with time-dependent mass, which arise fromthe Penrose limit of the brane backgrounds. We examine equations of motion ofthe strings in the asymptotic flat region and around the critical radius. Inparticular, for (p,q) fivebranes, we find that the string equations of motionin the directions with the B field are explicitly solved by the spheroidal wavefunctions.
