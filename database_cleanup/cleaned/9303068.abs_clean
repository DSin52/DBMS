A general technique is outlined for investigating supersymmetry properties ofa charged spin-$\half$ quantum particle in time-varying electromagnetic fields.The case of a time-varying uniform magnetic induction is examined and shown toprovide a physical realization of a supersymmetric quantum-mechanical system.Group-theoretic methods are used to factorize the relevant Schr\"odingerequations and obtain eigensolutions. The supercoherent states for this systemare constructed.
