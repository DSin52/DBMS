Naked singularities appear naturally in dynamically evolving solutions ofEinstein equations involving gravitational collapse of radiation, dust andperfect fluids, provided the rate of accretion is less than a critical value.We propose that the gamma-ray bursters (GRBs) are examples of these nakedsingularity solutions. For illustration, we show that according to solutionsinvolving spherically symmetric collapse of pure radiation field, the energy$E_\gamma$ and the observed duration $\Delta t_o$ of a GRB should satisfy,$\frac{E_\gamma}{\Delta t_o} \leq 4.5 \times 10^{58} \ f_\gamma $ ergsec$^{-1}$, $f_\gamma$ being the fraction ($10^{-2}$ to $10^{-3}$) of energyreleased as gamma rays. All the presently observed GRBs satisfy this condition;those satisfying the condition close to equality must necessarily be ofcosmological origin with the red-shift factor $z$ not exceeding $\sim 2-10$depending on exact observed flux.
