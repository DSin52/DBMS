Strongly self-dual Yang-Mills fields in even dimensional spaces arecharacterised by a set of constraints on the eigenvalues of the Yang-Millsfields $F_{\mu \nu}$. We derive a topological bound on ${\bf R}^8$, $\int_{M} (F,F )^2 \geq k \int_{M} p_1^2$ where $p_1$ is the first Pontrjagin class of theSO(n) Yang-Mills bundle and $k$ is a constant. Strongly self-dual Yang-Millsfields realise the lower bound.
