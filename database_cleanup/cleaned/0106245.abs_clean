We consider ``cosmologically symmetric'' (i.e. solutions with homogeneity andisotropy along three spatial dimensions) five-dimensional spacetimes with ascalar field and a three-brane representing our universe. We write Einstein'sequations in a conformal gauge, using light-cone coordinates. We obtainthe logarithm of the (bulk) scale factor; b. assuming separable solutions. Wethen discuss the cosmology in the brane nduced by these solutions.
