The dual superconductor picture of the QCD vacuum is thought to describevarious aspects of the strong interaction including confinement. Ordinarysuperconductivity is described by the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equation. In thepresent work we show that it is possible to arrive at a GL-like equation frompure SU(2) gauge theory. This is accomplished by using Abelian projection tosplit the SU(2) gauge fields into an Abelian subgroup and its coset. The twogauge field components of the coset part act as the effective, complex, scalarfield of the GL equation. The Abelian part of the SU(2) gauge field is thenanalogous to the electromagnetic potential in the GL equation. An importantaspect of the dual superconducting model is for the GL Lagrangian to have aspontaneous symmetry breaking potential, and the existence of Nielsen-Olesenflux tube solutions. Both of these require a tachyonic mass for the effectivescalar field. Such a tachyonic mass term is obtained from the condensation ofghost fields.
