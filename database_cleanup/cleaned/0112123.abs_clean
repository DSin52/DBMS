We argue that a spontaneous breakdown of local Weyl invariance offers amechanism in which gravitational interactions contribute to the generation ofparticle masses and their electric charge. The theory is formulated in terms ofa spacetime geometry whose natural connection has both dynamic torsion andnon-metricity. Its structure illuminates the role of dynamic scales used todetermine measurable aspects of particle interactions and it predicts anadditional neutral vector boson with electroweak properties.
