Here we address the problem of bosonizing massive fermions without makingexpansions in the fermion masses in both massive $QED_2$ and $QED_3$ with $ N $fermion flavors including also a Thirring coupling. We start from two pointcorrelators involving the U(1) fermionic current and the gauge field.From the tensor structure of those correlators we prove that the U(1) currentmust be identically conserved (topological) in the corresponding bosonizedtheory both in D=2 and D=3 dimensions. We find an effective bosonic actionwhich reproduces those two point correlators and from such action we obtain amap for the Lagrangian density $\bar{\psi}^{r} (i \partial / - m){\psi}^{r}$ interms of the corresponding bosonic field in both dimensions. This map isnonlocal but it is independent of the eletromagnetic and Thirring couplings, atleast in the quadratic approximation for the fermionic determinant.
