Title: Integrable flows in c=1 string theory

Authors: Ivan K. Kostov

Comments: sect.1 extended and typos corrected

In these notes we review the method to construct integrable deformations ofthe compactified c=1 bosonic string theory by primary fields (momentum orwinding modes), developed recently in collaboration with S. Alexandrov and V.Kazakov. The method is based on the formulation of the string theory as amatrix model. The flows generated by either momentum or winding modes (but notboth) are integrable and satisfy the Toda lattice hierarchy.
