Using the U(4) formalism developed ten years ago, the worldsheet action forthe superstring in Ramond-Ramond plane wave backgrounds is expressed in amanifestly N=(2,2) superconformally invariant manner. This simplifies theconstruction of consistent Ramond-Ramond plane wave backgrounds and eliminatesthe problems associated with light-cone interaction point operators.
