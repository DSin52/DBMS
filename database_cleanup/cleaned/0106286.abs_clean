We work on the relation between the local thermodynamic instability and thedynamical instability of large black holes in four-dimensional anti-de Sitterspace proposed by Gubser and Mitra. We find that all perturbations suppressingthe metric fluctuations at linear order become dynamically unstable when blackholes lose the local thermodynamic stability. We discuss how dynamicalinstabilities can be explained by the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
