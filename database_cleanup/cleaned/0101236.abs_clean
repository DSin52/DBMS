It is shown that a double compactified D=11 supermembrane with non trivialwrapping may be formulated as a symplectic non-commutative gauge theory on theworld volume. The symplectic non commutative structure is intrinsicallyobtained from the symplectic 2-form on the world volume defined by the minimalconfiguration of its hamiltonian. The gauge transformations on the symplecticfibration are generated by the area preserving diffeomorphisms on the worldvolume. Geometrically, this gauge theory corresponds to a symplectic fibrationover a compact Riemman surface with a symplectic connection.
