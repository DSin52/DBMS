Authors: J. Alfaro, H.A. Morales-T\'ecotl, M. Reyes and L.F. Urrutia

Comments: latex, 17 pages, 2 figures

We provide a method and the results for the calculation of the holonomy of aYang-Mills connection in an arbitrary triangular path, in an expansion(developed here to fifth order) in powers of the corresponding segments. Theresults might have applications in generalizing to Yang-Mills fields previouscalculations of the corrections to particle dynamics induced by loop quantumgravity, as well as in the field of random lattices.
