the proceedings of the TMR Conference on Quantum Aspects of Gauge Theories,Supersymmetry and Unification, Paris, 1-7 September 1999We review some aspects of the AdS supergravity description of RG flows. Thecase of a flow to an IR CFT can be rigorously studied within the framework ofsupergravity. Here we discuss various central charges of the conformal theory(included the usually neglected ones) and we compare them with QFTexpectations. The case of flows to non-conformal theories is more problematicin that one usually encounters a naked singularity. We mainly focus on the flowto an IR N=1 super Yang-Mills theory. We discuss the properties of the solutionand we briefly comment on the fate of the singularity. We also compare thesupergravity results with the expectations of an N=1 SYM at strong coupling.
