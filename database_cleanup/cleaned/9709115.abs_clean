The Polyakov loop variable serves as an order parameter to characterize theconfined and deconfined phases of Yang-Mills theory. By integrating out thevector fields in the SU(2) Yang-Mills partition function in one-loopapproximation, an effective action is obtained for the Polyakov loop to secondorder in a derivative expansion. The resulting effective potential for thePolyakov loop is capable of describing a second-order deconfinement transitionas a function of temperature.
