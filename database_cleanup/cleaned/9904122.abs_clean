In this paper we consider IIA and IIB matrix string theories which aredefined by two-dimensional and three-dimensional super Yang-Mills theory withthe maximal supersymmetry, respectively. We exactly compute the partitionfunction of both of the theories by mapping to a cohomological field theory.Our result for the IIA matrix string theory coincides with the result obtainedin the infra-red limit by Kostov and Vanhove, and thus gives a proof of theexact quasi classics conjectured by them. Further, our result for the IIBmatrix string theory coincides with the exact result of IKKT model by Moore,Nekrasov and Shatashvili. It may be an evidence of the equivalence between thetwo distinct IIB matrix models arising from different roots.
