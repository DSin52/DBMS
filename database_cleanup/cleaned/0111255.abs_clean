We propose a general framework for studying quantum field theory on theanti-de-Sitter space-time, based on the assumption of positivity of thespectrum of the possible energy operators. In this framework we show that then-point functions are analytic in suitable domains of the complex AdS manifold,that it is possible to Wick rotate to the Euclidean manifold and come back, andthat it is meaningful to restrict AdS quantum fields to Poincare' branes. Wegive also a complete characterization of two-point functions which are thesimplest example of our theory. Finally we prove the existence of the AdS-Unruheffect for uniformly accelerated observers on trajectories crossing theboundary of AdS at infinity, while that effect does not exist for all the otheruniformly accelerated trajectories.
