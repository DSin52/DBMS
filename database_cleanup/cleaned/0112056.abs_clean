In a recent paper (hep-th/0111091), the near-extremal thermodynamics of a4-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom black hole had been considered. In the currentletter, we extend this prior treatment to the more general case of aspherically symmetric, charged black hole of arbitrary dimensionality. Aftersummarizing the earlier work, we demonstrate a duality that exists between thenear-extremal sector of spherically symmetric black holes and Jackiw-Teitelboimtheory. On the basis of this correspondence, we argue that back-reactioneffects prohibit any of these ``RN-like'' black holes from reaching extremalityand, moreover, from coming arbitrarily close to an extremal state.
