We study the interactions of the discrete states with nonzero ghost number in$c=1$ two-dimensional ($2D$) quantum gravity. By using the vertex operatorrepresentations, it is shown that their interactions are given by the structureconstants of the group of the area preserving diffeomorphism similar to thoseof vanishing ghost number. The effective action for these states is also workedout. The result suggests the whole system has a BRST-like symmetry.
