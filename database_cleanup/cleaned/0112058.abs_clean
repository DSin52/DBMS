We study the addition of an irrelevant operator to the N=4 supersymmetriclarge n SU(n) gauge theory, in the presence of finite temperature, T. In thesupergravity dual, the effect of the operator is known to correspond to adeformation of the AdS_5 x S^5 ``throat'' which restores the asymptotic tendimensional Minkowski region of spacetime, completing the full D3-branesolution. The system at non-zero T is interesting, since at the extremes ofsome of the geometrical parameters the geometry interpolates between a sevendimensional spherical Minkowskian Schwarzschild black hole (times R^3) and afive dimensional flat AdS Schwarzschild black hole (times S^5). We observe thatwhen the coupling of the operator reaches a critical value, the deconfinedphase, which is represented by the geometry with horizon, disappears for alltemperatures, returning the system to a confined phase which is represented bythe thermalised extremal geometry.
