The classical orbits of a test string in the transverse space of a singularheterotic fivebrane source are classified. The orbits are found to be eithercircular or open, but not conic because the inverse square law is not satisfiedat long range. This result differs from predictions of General Relativity. Theconserved total angular momentum contains an intrinsic component from thefivebrane source, analogous to the electron-monopole case.
