Power-counting arguments based on extended superfields have been used toargue that two-dimensional supersymmetric sigma models with (4,0) supersymmetryare finite. This result is confirmed up to three loop order in pertubationtheory by an explicit calculation using (1,0) superfields. In particular, it isshown that the finite counterterms which must be introduced into the theory inorder to maintain (4,0) supersymmetry are precisely the terms that are requiredto establish ultra-violet finiteness.
