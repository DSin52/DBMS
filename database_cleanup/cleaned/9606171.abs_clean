We present the theory, the experimental evidence, and fundamental physicalconsequences concerning the existence of families of undistorted progressivewaves (UPWs) of arbitrary speeds $0\leq v < \infty$, which are solutions of thehomogeneous wave equation, Maxwell equations, and Dirac and Weyl equations.
