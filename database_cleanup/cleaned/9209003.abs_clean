We present field theoretical descriptions of massless (2+1) dimensionalnonrelativistic fermions in an external magnetic field, in terms of a fermionicand bosonic second quantized language. An infinite dimensional algebra,$W_{\infty}$, appears as the algebra of unitary transformations which preservethe lowest Landau level condition and the particle number. In the dropletapproximation it reduces to the algebra of area-preserving diffeomorphisms,which is responsible for the existence of a universal chiral boson Lagrangianindependent of the electrostatic potential. We argue that the bosonic dropletapproximation is the strong magnetic field limit of the fermionic theory. Therelation to the $c=1$ string model is discussed.
