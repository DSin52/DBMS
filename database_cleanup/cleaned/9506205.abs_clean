We examine 4-dimensional string backgrounds compactified over a two torus.There exist two alternative effective Lagrangians containing each two$SL(2)/U(1)$ sigma-models. Two of these sigma-models are the complex and theK\"ahler structures on the torus. The effective Lagrangians are invariant undertwo different $O(2,2)$ groups and by the successive applications of thesegroups the affine $\widehat{O}(2,2)$ Kac-Moody is emerged. The latter has alsoa non-zero central term which generates constant Weyl rescalings of the reduced2-dimensional background. In addition, there exists a number of discretesymmetries relating the field content of the reduced effective Lagrangians.
