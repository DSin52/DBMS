Title: Asymptotic symmetries of AdS2 Branes

Authors: C. Bachas (Ecole Normale, Paris)

Comments: 11 pages, Latex file. Minor changes and some extra references

I analyze the asymptotic symmetries of a theory of gravity in a backgroundconsisting of two patches of ${\rm AdS}_3$ spacetime glued together along an${\rm AdS}_2$ brane. These are generated by a single Virasoro algebra, asexpected from the conjectured dual description in terms of a scale-invariantinterface separating two conformal field theories.
