The present paper studies a completely integrable conformally invariant modelin 1+1 dimensions that corresponds to string propagation on the two-dimensionalblack hole background (semi-ininite cigar). Besides the two space-time stringfields there is a third (internal) field with a very specific Liouville-typeinteraction leading to the complete integrability. This system is known asnon-abelian Toda theory. I give the general explicit classical solution. Itrealizes a rather involved transformation expressing the interacting stringfields in terms of (three) functions $\varphi_j(u)$ and $\bar\varphi_j(v)$ ofone light-cone variable only. The latter are shown to lead to standard harmonicoscillator (free field) Poisson brackets thus paving the way towardsquantization. There are three left-moving and three right-moving conservedquantities. The right (left)-moving conserved quantities form a new closednon-linear, non-local Poisson bracket algebra. This algebra is a Virasoroalgebra extended by two conformal dimension-two primaries.
