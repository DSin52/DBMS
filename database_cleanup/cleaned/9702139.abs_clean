I present the ``Chern--Simons'' formulation of generalized 2d dilatongravity, summarize its Hamiltonian quantization (reduced phase space and Diracquantization) and briefly discuss the statistical mechanical entropy of 2dblack holes. Focus is put on the close relation to finite dimensional pointparticle systems.
