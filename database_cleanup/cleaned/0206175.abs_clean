The supersymmetric $(AdS_3\times S^3)/Z_N$ orbifold constructed by theauthors in hep-th/0106171 is shown to describe AdS fragmentation, wherefivebranes are emerging from the F1-NS5 background. The twisted sector moduliof the orbifold are the collective coordinates of groups of $n_5/N$ fivebranes.We discuss the relation between the descriptions of this background as aperturbative string orbifold and as a BPS state in the dual spacetime CFT.Finally, we attempt to apply the lessons learned to the description of BTZblack holes as $AdS_3$ orbifolds and to related big crunch/big bangcosmological scenarios.
