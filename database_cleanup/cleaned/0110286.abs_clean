We propose an alternative inflationary universe scenario in the context ofRandall-Sundrum braneworld cosmology. In this new scenario the existence ofextra-dimension(s) plays an essential role. First, the brane universe isinitially in the inflationary phase driven by the effective cosmologicalconstant induced by small mismatch between the vacuum energy in the5-dimensional bulk and the brane tension. This mismatch arises since the bulkis initially in a false vacuum. Then, the false vacuum decay occurs, nucleatinga true vacuum bubble with negative energy inside the bulk. The nucleated bubbleexpands in the bulk and consequently hits the brane, bringing a hot big-bangbrane universe of the Randall-Sundrum type. Here, the termination of theinflationary phase is due to the change of the bulk vacuum energy. The bubblekinetic energy heats up the universe. As a simple realization, we propose amodel, in which we assume an interaction between the brane and the bubble. Wederive the constraints on the model parameters taking into account thethe bubble from colliding with the brane, sufficiently high reheatingtemperature for the standard nucleosynthesis to work, and the recovery ofNewton's law up to 1mm. We find that a fine tuning is needed in order tosatisfy the first and the second requirements simultaneously, although, theother constraints are satisfied in a wide range of the model parameters.
