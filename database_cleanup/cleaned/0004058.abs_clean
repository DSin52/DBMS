We formulate a topological theory in six dimensions with gauge group SO(3,3)which reduces to gravity on a four dimensional defect if suitable boundaryconditions are chosen. In such a framework we implement the reflectionautomorphism of SO(3,3) as a $\Z2$ symmetry which forbids the appearance of agravitational cosmological constant. Some temptative speculations are presentedalso for the possible inclusion of the matter contribution at a full quantumlevel.
