Title: Algebra of potentials of the volume-preserving vector fields

Authors: R.L. Mkrtchyan

Comments: 7 pages

The algebra of volume-preserving vector fields is considered. The potentialsfor that fields are introduced, and induced algebra of potentials isconsidered. It is shown, that this algebra fails to satisfy the Jacobyidentity. Analogy with hamiltonian mechanics is developed, as well as 3-cocycleinterpretation of corresponding expressions.
