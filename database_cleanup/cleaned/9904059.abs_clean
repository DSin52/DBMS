Characters and linear combinations of characters that admit a fermionic sumrepresentation as well as a factorized form are considered for some minimalVirasoro models. As a consequence, various Rogers-Ramanujan type identities areobtained. Dilogarithm identities producing corresponding effective centralcharges and secondary effective central charges are derived. Several ways ofconstructing more general fermionic representations are discussed.
