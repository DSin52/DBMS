Title: Q-Boson Representation of the Quantum Matrix Algebra $M_q(3)$

Authors: Vahid Karimipour

Comments: pages 18 ,report # 93-009

{Although q-oscillators have been used extensively for realization of quantumuniversal enveloping algebras,such realization do not exist for quantum matrixalgebras ( deformation of the algebra of functions on the group ). In thispaper we first construct an infinite dimensional representation of the quantummatrix algebra $ M_q ( 3 ) $(the coordinate ring of $ GL_q (3)) $ and then usethis representation to realize $ GL_q ( 3 ) $ by q-bosons.}
