With the aim of clarifying the eleven dimensional content of Matrix theory,we examine the dependence of a theory in the infinite momentum frame (IMF) onthe (purely spatial) longitudinal compactification radius R. It is shown thatin a point particle theory the generic scattering amplitude becomes independentof R in the IMF. Processes with zero longitudinal momentum transfer are foundto be exceptional. The same question is addressed in a theory with extendedobjects. A one-loop type II string amplitude is shown to be R-independent inthe IMF, and to coincide with that of the uncompactified theory. No exceptionalprocesses exist in this case. The possible implications of these results forM-theory are discussed. In particular, if amplitudes in M-theory areindependent of R in the IMF, Matrix theory can be rightfully expected (in the N
