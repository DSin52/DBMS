The space-time disclination is studied by making use of the decompositiontheory of gauge potential in terms of antisymmetric tensor field and$\phi$-mapping method. It is shown that the self-dual and anti-self-dual partsof the curvature compose the space-time disclinations which are classified interms of topological invariants--winding number. The projection of space-timedisclination density along an antisymmetric tensor field is quantizedtopologically and characterized by Brouwer degree and Hopf index.
