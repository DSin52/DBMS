elucidates our claimOne discusses here the connection between \sigma-model gauge anomalies andthe existence of a connection with torsion that does not flatten the Riccitensor of the target manifold, by considering a number of non-symmetric cosetspaces. The influence of an eventual anisotropy on a certain direction of thetarget manifold is also contemplated.
