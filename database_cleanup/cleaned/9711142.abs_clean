We reconsider the Abelian pure Chern-Simons theory in three dimensions byusing our improved Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin Hamiltonian formalism. As a result,we show several novel features, including the connection of the Dirac brackets.In particular, through the path integral quantization, we obtain the desirednew type of the Wess-Zumino action.
