We construct light-cone gauge superstring field theory in a pp-wavebackground with Ramond-Ramond flux. The leading term in the interactionHamiltonian is determined up to an overall function of $p^+$ by requiringclosure of the pp-wave superalgebra. The bosonic and fermionic Neumann matricesfor this cubic vertex are derived, as is the interaction point operator. Wecomment on the development of a $1/\mu p^+$ expansion for these results.
