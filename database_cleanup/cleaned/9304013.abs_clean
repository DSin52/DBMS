It is shown that gauged nonlinear sigma models can be always deformed byterms proportional to the field strength of the gauge fields (nonminimalgauging). These deformations can be interpreted as perturbations, by marginaloperators, of conformal coset models. When applied to theSL(2,R)*SU(2)/[U(1)*U(1)] WZWN model, a large class of four-dimensional curvedspacetime backgrounds are obtained. In particular, a naked singularity may format a time when the volume of the universe is different from zero.
