Title: Magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking and the Pauli problem

Comments: 7 pages, Tex; to appear in the Proceedings of the Conference on

Quantum Aspects of Beam Physics, held at Monterey, California in January 1998The non-perturbative Schwinger-Dyson equation is used to show that chiralsymmetry is dynamically broken in QED at weak gauge couplings when an externaluniform magnetic field is present. A complete analysis of this phenomenon mayshed light on the Pauli problem, namely, why $\alpha$ = 1/137.
