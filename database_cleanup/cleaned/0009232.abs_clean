The only calculations performed beyond one-loop level in the light-cone gaugemake use of the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt (ML) prescription in order to circumventthe notorious gauge dependent poles. Recently we have shown that in the contextof negative dimensional integration method (NDIM) such prescription can bealtogether abandoned, at least in one-loop order calculations. We extend ourapproach, now studying two-loop integrals pertaining to two-point functions.While previous works on the subject present only divergent parts for theintegrals, we show that our prescriptionless method gives the same results forthem, besides finite parts for arbitrary exponents of propagators.
