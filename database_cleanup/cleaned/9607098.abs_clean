the 2nd International Sakharov Conference on Physics, Moscow, May 20-24,1996, to be published in the ProceedingsWe propose a method of constructing a gauge invariant canonical formulationfor non-gauge classical theory which depends on a set of parameters.Requirement of closure for algebra of operators generating quantum gaugetransformations leads to restrictions on parameters of the theory. Thisapproach is then applied to bosonic string theory coupled to massive backgroundfields. It is shown that within the proposed canonical formulation the correctlinear equations of motion for background fields arise.
