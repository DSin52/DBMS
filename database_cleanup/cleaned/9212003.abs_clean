It is shown that the BRST charge $Q$ for any gauge model with a Lie algebrasymmetry may be decomposed as $$Q=\del+\del^{\dag}, \del^2=\del^{\dag 2}=0,[\del, \del^{\dag}]_+=0$$ provided dynamical Lagrange multipliers are used butwithout introducing other matter variables in $\del$ than the gauge generatorsin $Q$. Furthermore, $\del$ is shown to have the form $\del=c^{\dag a}\phi_a$(or $\phi'_ac^{\dag a}$) where $c^a$ are anticommuting expressions in theghosts and Lagrange multipliers, and where the non-hermitian operators $\phi_a$satisfy the same Lie algebra as the original gauge generators. By means of abigrading the BRST condition reduces to $\del|ph\hb=\del^{\dag}|ph\hb=0$ whichis naturally solved by $c^a|ph\hb=\phi_a|ph\hb=0$ (or $c^{\daga}|ph\hb={\phi'_a}^{\dag}|ph\hb=0$). The general solutions are shown to have avery simple form.
