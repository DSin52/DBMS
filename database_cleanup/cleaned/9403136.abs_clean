The elliptic-matrix quantum Olshanetsky-Perelomov problem is introduced forarbitrary root systems by means of an elliptic generalization of the Dunkloperators. Its equivalence with the double affine generalization of theKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation (in the induced representations) isestablished.
