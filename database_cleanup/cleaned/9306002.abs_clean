We study integrals of motion and factorizable S-matrices in two-dimensionalintegrable field theory with boundary. We propose the ``boundarycross-unitarity equation'' which is the boundary analog of the cross-symmetrycondition of the ``bulk'' S-matrix. We derive the boundary S-matrices for theIsing field theory with boundary magnetic field and for the boundarysine-Gordon model.
