We show that ${\rm Tr}(-1)^F F e^{-\beta H}$ is an index for $N$=2supersymmetric theories in two dimensions, in the sense that it is independentof almost all deformations of the theory. This index is related to the geometryof the vacua (Berry's curvature) and satisfies an exact differential equationas a function of $\beta$. For integrable theories we can also compute the indexthermodynamically, using the exact $S$-matrix. The equivalence of these tworesults implies a highly non-trivial equivalence of a set of coupled integralequations with these differential equations, among them Painleve III and theaffine Toda equations.
