We discuss the similarities between BPS monopoles and Skyrmions, and point toan underlying connection in terms of rational maps between Riemann spheres.This involves the introduction of a new ansatz for Skyrme fields. We use thisto construct good approximations to several known Skyrmions, including all theminimal energy configurations up to baryon number nine, and some new solutionssuch as a baryon number seventeen Skyrme field with the truncated icosahedronstructure of a buckyball.The new approach is also used to understand the low-lying vibrational modesof Skyrmions, which are required for quantization. Along the way we discover aninteresting Morse function on the space of rational maps which may be of use inunderstanding the Sen forms on the monopole moduli spaces.
