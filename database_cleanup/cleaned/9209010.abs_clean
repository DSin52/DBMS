We study the discrete state structure of $\hat c=1$ superconformal mattercoupled to 2-D supergravity. Factorization properties of scattering amplitudesare used to identify these states and to construct the corresponding vertexoperators. For both Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sectors these states are shown tobe organized inSU(2) multiplets. The algebra generated by the discrete states is computed inthe limit of null cosmological constant.
