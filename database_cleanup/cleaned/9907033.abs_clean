Title: On Alternate Derivation of Type IIB Matrix Model

Comments: 6 pages, LaTex 2e

Starting with Green-Schwarz superstring action, we construct a type IIBmatrix model. We fix the local $\kappa$ symmetry in the Killing spinor gaugeand then perform the world-sheet duality transformation. A matrix modelobtained from this gauge-fixed action is shown to be equivalent to the type IIBmatrix model constructed by Ishibashi et al. Our construction does not make useof an analytic continuation of spinor variable. Moreover, it seems that ourconstruction is applicable to that of more general type IIB matrix models in acurved background such as $AdS_5 \times S^5$.
