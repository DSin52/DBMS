A Siegel-type chiral p-form action is proposed in D=2(p+1) spacetimedimensions. The approach we adopt is to realize the symmetric second-rankLagrange-multiplier field, introduced in Siegel's action, in terms of anormalized multiplication of two (q+1)-form fields with q indices of each fieldcontracted in the even p case, or of two pairs of (q+1)-form fields with qindices of each pair of fields contracted in the odd p case, where the(q+1)-form fields are of external derivatives of one auxiliary q-form field forthe former, or a pair of auxiliary q-form fields for the latter. Using thisaction, it is straightforward to deduce the recently constructed PST action forq equal to zero. It is found that the Siegel-type chiral p-form action with afixed p (even or odd) is doubly self-dual in D=2(p+1) spacetime dimensions whenthe auxiliary field(s) is/are also chosen to be of p-form. This result includesPST's as a special case where only the chiral 0-form action is doubly self-dualin D=2 dimensions.
