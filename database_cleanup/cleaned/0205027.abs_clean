Title: Black holes at accelerators

Authors: Steven B. Giddings

Comments: 13 pages. Contribution to the proceedings of Stephen Hawking's 60th

This is my contribution to the proceedings of Stephen Hawking's 60th birthdaycelebration. If the ideas of TeV scale gravity are correct, then black holesshould be produced at accelerators that probe the TeV scale, and their decaysshould evidence one of Stephen's greatest discoveries, the phenomenon of blackhole radiance.
