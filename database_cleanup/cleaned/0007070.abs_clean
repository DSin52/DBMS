We calculate the NS-R fermionic zero-norm states of type II string spectrum.The massless and some possible massive zero-norm states are identified to beresponsible for the space-time supersymmetry. The existence of other fermionicmassive zero-norm states with higher spinor-tensor indices correspond to newenlarged boson-fermion symmetries of the theory at high energy. We also discussthe R-R charges and R-R zero-norm states and justify that perturbative stringdoes not carry the massless R-R charges. However, the existence of some massiveR-R zero-norm states make us speculate that string may carry some massive R-Rcharges.
