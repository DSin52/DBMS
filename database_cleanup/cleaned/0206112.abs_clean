Title: Assisted Contraction

Comments: 13 pages, 3 figures, revised version, conclusions unchanged

We consider the dynamics of a contracting universe ruled by two minimallycoupled scalar fields with general exponential potentials. This model describesstring-inspired scenarios in the Einstein frame. Both background andperturbations can be solved analytically in this model. Curvature perturbationsare generated with a scale invariant spectrum only for a dust-like collapse, ashappens for a single field model with an exponential potential. We find theconditions for which a scale invariant spectrum for isocurvature perturbationis generated.
