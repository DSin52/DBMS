We develop the derivative expansion of the one-loop ${\cal N}=4$ SYMeffective action depending both on ${\cal N}=2$ vector multiplet and onhypermultiplet background fields. We get a new derivation of the complete${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric low-energy effective action obtained inhep-th/0111062 and find subleading corrections to it. A problem of ${\cal N}=4$supersymmetry of the results is discussed. Using the formalism of ${\cal N}=2$harmonic superspace and exploring on-shell hidden ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry of${\cal N}=4$ SYM theory we construct the appropriate hypermultiplet-dependingcontributions. The hidden ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry requirements allow to geta leading, in hypermultiplet derivatives, part of the correct ${\cal N}=4$supersymmetric functional containing $F^{8}$ among the component fields.
