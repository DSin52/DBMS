We determine the structure of the partition algebra $P_n(Q)$ (a generalizedTemperley-Lieb algebra) for specific values of $Q \in \C$, focusing on thequotient which gives rise to the partition function of $n$ site $Q$-state Pottsmodels (in the continuous $Q$ formulation) in arbitrarily high latticedimensions (the mean field case). The algebra is non-semi-simple iff $Q$ is anon-negative integer less than $n$. We determine the dimension of the keyirreducible representation in every specialization.
