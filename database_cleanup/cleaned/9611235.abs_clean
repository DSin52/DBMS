Comments: 17 pages, LaTeX

Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories are considered in 1+1 dimensions.Firstly physical mass spectra of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in 1+1dimensions are evaluated in the light-cone gauge with a compact spatialdimension. The supercharges are constructed in order to provide a manifestlysupersymmetric infrared regularization for the discretized light-cone approach.By exactly diagonalizing the supercharge matrix between up to several hundredcolor singlet bound states, we find a rapidly increasing density of states asmass increases. Interpreting this limiting density of states as thestringbehavior, we obtain the Hagedron temperature $\beta_H=0.676 \sqrt{\pi\over g^2 N}$. Secondly we have examined the vacuum structure of supersymmetricYang-Mills theories in 1+1 dimensions. SUSY allows only periodic boundaryconditions for both fermions and bosons. By using the Born-Oppenheimerapproximation for the weak coupling limit, we find that the vacuum energyvanishes, and hence the SUSY is unbroken. Other boundary conditions are alsostudied. The first part is based on a work in collaboration with Y. Matsumuraand T. Sakai. The second part is based on a work in collaboration with H. Odaand T. Sakai.
