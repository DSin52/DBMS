We study the correspondence between the moduli space of vacua ofthree-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills (Maxwell) Chern-Simons theories andbrane configurations with (p,q)5-brane. For Coulomb branches, the number of themassless adjoint scalar fields in various supersymmetric theories exactlycoincides with the number of the freely moving directions of D3-branesstretched between two 5-branes. When we include a matter superfield into thesupersymmetric Chern-Simons theory two distinct symmetric and asymmetric phaseappear. The symmetric phase is peculiar to this Chern-Simons Higgs system. Wefind the corresponding brane configuration for these phases. We also identifythe stringy counterpart of the topological vortex state in the asymmetricphase.
