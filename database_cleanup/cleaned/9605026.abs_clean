The Laplace operator acting on antisymmetric tensor fields in a$D$--dimensional Euclidean ball is studied. Gauge-invariant local boundaryconditions (absolute and relative ones, in the language of Gilkey) areconsidered. The eigenfuctions of the operator are found explicitly for allvalues of $D$. Using in a row a number of basic techniques, as Mellintransforms, deformation and shifting of the complex integration contour, andpole compensation, the zeta function of the operator is obtained. From itsexpression, in particular, $\zeta (0)$ and $\zeta'(0)$ are evaluated exactly. Atable is given in the paper for $D=3, 4, ...,8$. The functional determinantsand Casimir energies are obtained for $D=3, 4, ...,6$.
