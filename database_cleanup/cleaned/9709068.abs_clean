We study the crossing symmetry of the conformal blocks of the conformal fieldtheory based on the affine Lie superalgebra osp(1|2). Within the framework of afree field realization of the osp(1|2) current algebra, the fusion and braidingmatrices of the model are determined. These results are related in a simple wayto those corresponding to the su(2) algebra by means of a suitableidentification of parameters. In order to obtain the link invariantscorresponding to the osp(1|2) conformal field theory, we analyze thecorresponding topological Chern-Simons theory. In a first approach we quantizethe Chern-Simons theory on the torus and, as a result, we get the action of theWilson line operators on the supercharacters of the affine osp(1|2). From thisresult we get a simple expression relating the osp(1|2) polynomials for torusknots and links to those corresponding to the su(2) algebra. Further, thisrelation is verified for arbitrary knots and links by quantizing theChern-Simons theory on the punctured two-sphere.
