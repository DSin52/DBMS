In this thesis we will discuss various aspects of noncommutative geometry andcompactified Little-String theories. First we will give an introduction to theuse of noncommutative geometry in string theory. Thereafter we will present aproof of the connection between D-brane dynamics and noncommutative geometry.Then we will explain the concept of instantons in noncommutative gaugetheories. The last chapters shift the focus to Little-String- and$(2,0)$-theories. We study compactifications of these theories on tori withtwists. First we study the case of two coinciding branes in detail. Afterwardswe study the case of an arbitrary number of coinciding branes. The main resulthere is that the moduli spaces of vacua for the twisted compactifications areequal to moduli spaces of instantons on a noncommutative torus. A special caseof this is that a large class of gauge theories with $\SUSY{2}$ supersymmetryin D=4 or $\SUSY{4}$ in D=3 has moduli spaces which are moduli spaces ofinstantons on noncommutative tori.
