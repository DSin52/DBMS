We show that the $c=1$ bosonic string theory at finite temperature has twomatrix-model realizations related by a kind of duality transformation. Thefirst realization is the standard one given by the compactified matrix quantummechanics in the inverted oscillator potential. The second realization, whichwe derive here, is given by the normal matrix model. Both matrix models exhibitthe Toda integrable structure and are associated with two dual cycles (acompact and a non-compact one) of a complex curve with the topology of a spherewith two punctures. The equivalence of the two matrix models holds for anarbitrary tachyon perturbation and in all orders in the string couplingconstant.
