We exhibit a tachyonic mode in a linearized analysis of perturbations oflarge anti-de Sitter Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in four dimensions. In thelarge black hole limit, and up to a 0.7% discrepancy which is probablyround-off error in the numerical analysis, the tachyon appears precisely whenthe black hole becomes thermodynamically unstable.
