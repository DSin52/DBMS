In this paper the three-dimensional vertex model is given, which is theduality of the three-dimensional Baxter-Bazhanov (BB) model. The braid groupcorresponding to Frenkel-Moore equation is constructed and the transformations$R, I$ are found. These maps act on the group and denote the rotations of thebraids through the angles $\pi$ about some special axes. The weight function ofanother three-dimensional vertex model related the 3D lattice integrable modelproposed by Boos, Mangazeev, Sergeev and Stroganov is presented also, which canbe interpreted as the deformation of the vertex model corresponding to the BBmodel.
