Comments: 10 pages, Latex. Talk given at the workshop on low dimensional field

theory, Telluride, COJournal-ref: Int.J.Mod.Phys. A12 (1997) 1173-1182

We review work done in collaboration with C.B. Thorn on Super-Galileiinvariant field theory and its application to the reformulation of superstringtheory in terms of constituent superstring-bits.
