In the framework of Dirac quantization, the SU(2) Skyrmion is canonicallyquantized to yield the modified predictions of the static properties ofbaryons. We show that the energy spectrum of this Skyrmion obtained by theDirac method with the suggestion of generalized momenta is consistent with theresult of the Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin formalism.
