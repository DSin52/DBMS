The F-theory vacuum constructed from an elliptic Calabi-Yau threefold withsection yields an effective six-dimensional theory. The Lie algebra of thegauge sector of this theory and its representation on the space of masslesshypermultiplets are shown to be determined by the intersection theory of thehomology of the Calabi-Yau threefold. (Similar statements hold for M-theory andthe type IIA string compactified on the threefold, where there is also adependence on the expectation values of the Ramond-Ramond fields.) We describegeneral rules for computing the hypermultiplet spectrum of any F-theory vacuum,including vacua with non-simply-laced gauge groups. The case of monodromyacting on a curve of A_even singularities is shown to be particularlyinteresting and leads to some unexpected rules for how 2-branes are allowed towrap certain 2-cycles. We also review the peculiar numerical predictions forthe geometry of elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds with section which arise fromanomaly cancellation in six dimensions.
