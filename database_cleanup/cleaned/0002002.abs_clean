The counting of long strings in ADS3, in the context of Type IIB stringtheory on $ADS_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$, is used to exhibit the action of theduality group $O(5,5;Z)$, and in particular its Weyl Subgroup $S_5 \bowtieZ_2$, in the non-perturbative phenomena associated with continuous spectra ofstates in these backgrounds. The counting functions are related to states inFock spaces. The symmetry groups also appear in the structure ofcompactifications of instanton moduli spaces on $T^4$.
