by M.B. Green and M. Gutperle are added. The complete calculation of theWitten index for SU(N) matrix theory follows from combination of the resultsof our paper with the results of M.B. Green and M. Gutperle and the resultsobtained by G. Moore, N. Nekrasov, and S. ShatashviliJournal-ref: JHEP 9810 (1998) 018

We compute the leading contribution to the effective Hamiltonian of SU(N)matrix theory in the limit of large separation. We work with a gauge fixedHamiltonian and use generalized Born-Oppenheimer approximation, extending therecent work of Halpern and Schwartz for SU(2). The answer turns out to be afree Hamiltonian for the coordinates along the flat directions of thepotential. Applications to finding ground state candidates and calculation ofthe correction (surface) term to Witten index are discussed.
