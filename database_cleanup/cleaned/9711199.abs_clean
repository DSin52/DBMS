In this paper the complete geometrical setting of (lowest order) abelianT-duality is explored with the help of some new geometrical tools (the reducedformalism). In particular, all invariant polynomials (the integrands of thecharacteristic classes) can be explicitly computed for the dual model in termsof quantities pertaining to the original one and with the help of the canonicalconnection whose intrinsic characterization is given. Using our formalism thephysically, and T-duality invariant, relevant result that top forms are zerowhen there is an isometry without fixed points is easily proved.
