A quantum-field theoretical interpretation is given to the holographic RGequation by relating it to a field-theoretical local RG equation whichdetermines how Weyl invariance is broken in a quantized field theory. Usingthis approach we determine the relation between the holographic C theorem andthe C theorem in two-dimensional quantum field theory which relies on theZamolodchikov metric. Similarly we discuss how in four dimensions theholographic C function is related to a conjectured field-theoretical Cfunction. The scheme dependence of the holographic RG due to the possiblepresence of finite local counterterms is discussed in detail, as well as itsimplications for the holographic C function. We also discuss issues special tothe situation when mass deformations are present. Furthermore we suggest thatthe holographic RG equation may also be obtained from a bulk diffeomorphismwhich reduces to a Weyl transformation on the boundary.
