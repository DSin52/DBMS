Two issues regarding chiral $p$-forms are addressed. First, we investigatethe topological conditions on spacetime under which the action for a non-chiral$p$-form can be split as the sum of the actions for two chiral $p$-forms, oneof each chirality. When these conditions are not met, we exhibit explicitly theextra topological degrees of freedom and their couplings to the chiral modes.Second, we study the problem of constructing Lorentz-invariant self-couplingsof a chiral $p$-form in the light of the Dirac-Schwinger condition on theenergy-momentum tensor commutation relations. We show how the Perry-Schwarzcondition follows from the Dirac-Schwinger criterion and point out thatconsistency of the gravitational coupling is automatic.
