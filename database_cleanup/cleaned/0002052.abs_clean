We use the AdS/SYM correspondence to study the relevant effects ofcompactified dimensions on the D-brane dynamics. We present a detailed pictureof the T-duality transition between branes in type IIA and type IIBsupergravity. An analysis of the renormalization scheme coming from theexpectation values of background fields and the role of Wilson lines in it isgiven. We finally explore finite size effects and T-duality maps on thedescription of Wilson loops by supergravity.
