The simple algebras of a dressed operator, which is composed of a dressingand a residual operators, are averaged following a proper statistics of thedressing one. In the Bose-Einstein statistics, a (fermionic) Calogero-Vasilievoscillator, $q$-boson (fermion), and (fermionic) $su_q(1,1)$ are obtained foreach bosonic (fermionic) residual operator. In the Fermi-Dirac statistics, newsimilar algebras are derived for each residual operator. Constructions of dual$q$-algebras, such as a dual Calogero-Vasiliev oscillator, a dual $q$-boson anda $su_q(2)$, and prospects are discussed.
