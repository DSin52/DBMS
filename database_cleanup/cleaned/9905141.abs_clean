Whenever the N=(2,2) supersymmetry algebra of non-linear sigma-models in twodimensions does not close off-shell, a holomorphic two-form can be defined. Theonly known superfields providing candidate auxiliary fields to achieve anoff-shell formulation are semi-chiral fields. Such a semi-chiral description isonly possible when the two-form is constant. Using an explicit example,hyper-Kahler manifolds, we show that this is not always the case. Finally, wegive a concrete construction of semi-chiral potentials for a class ofhyper-Kahler manifolds using the duality exchanging a pair consisting of achiral and a twisted-chiral superfield for one semi-chiral multiplet.
