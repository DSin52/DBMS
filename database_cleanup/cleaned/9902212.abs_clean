Title: Is the Standard Model Renormalizable?

Authors: Hung Cheng and S.P. Li

Comments: 19 pages, LATEX

In this paper, we study the renormalizability of the Standard Model in theLandau gauge. On the basis of the Ward-Takahashi identities, we derive exactexpressions for the physical masses of the W and Z as well as the renormalizedcoupling constants in the theory. We show that it is impossible to make allthese renormalized quantities finite. Thus the quantum theory of the StandardModel with the divergent amplitudes obeying the Ward-Takahashi identities isnot renormalizable.
