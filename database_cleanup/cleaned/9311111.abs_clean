We find a quantum group structure in two-dimensional motions of anonrelativistic electron in a uniform magnetic field and in a periodicpotential. The representation basis of the quantum algebra is composed ofwavefunctions of the system. The quantum group symmetry commutes with theHamiltonian and is relevant to the Landau level degeneracy. The deformationparameter $q$ of the quantum algebra turns out to be given by the fractionalfilling factor $\nu=1/m$ ($m$ odd integer).
