The equations of motion of the super five-brane in D=11 dimensions arederived using the formalism of superembeddings. The equations describe highlynonlinear self-interactions of a tensor multiplet in the six dimensionalworlsurface, and they have manifest worldsurface local supersymmetry. Thegeometry of the target space corresponds to D=11 supergravity.
