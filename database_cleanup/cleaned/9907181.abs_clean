We show that, in the framework of covariant Hamiltonian field theory, adegenerate almost regular quadratic Lagrangian $L$ admits a complete set ofnon-degenerate Hamiltonian forms such that solutions of the correspondingHamilton equations, which live in the Lagrangian constraint space, exhaustsolutions of the Euler--Lagrange equations for $L$. We obtain thecharacteristic splittings of the configuration and momentum phase bundles. Dueto the corresponding projection operators, the Koszul-Tate resolution of theLagrangian constraints for a generic almost regular quadratic Lagrangian isconstructed in an explicit form.
