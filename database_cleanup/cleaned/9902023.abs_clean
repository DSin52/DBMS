We show that certain excitations of the F-string/D3-brane system can be shownto obey Neumann boundary conditions by considering Born-Infeld dynamics of theF-string (viewed as a 3-brane cylindrically wrapped on an $S_2$). Excitationswhich are coming down the string with a polarization along a direction parallelto the brane are almost completely reflected just as in the case of all-normalexcitations, but the end of the string moves freely on the 3-brane, thusrealizing Polchinski's open string Neumann boundary condition dynamically. Inthe low energy limit w -> 0, i.e. for wavelengths much larger than the stringscale only a small fraction ~w^4 of the energy escapes in the form of dipoleradiation. The physical interpretation is that a string attached to the 3-branemanifests itself as an electric charge, and waves on the string cause the endpoint of the string to freely oscillate and therefore produce electromagneticdipole radiation in the asymptotic outer region.
