Models of closed superstrings in certain curved NS-NS magnetic fluxbackgrounds are exactly solvable in terms of free fields. They interpolatebetween free superstring theories with periodic and antiperiodic boundaryconditions for fermions around some compact direction, and, in particular,between type 0 and type II string theories. Using ``9-11 flip'', thisinterpolation can be extended to M-theory and provides an interesting settingfor a study of tachyon problem in closed string theory. Starting with a general2-parameter family of such Melvin-type models, we present several new magneticflux backgrounds in 10-d string theory and 11-d M-theory and discuss theirtachyonic instabilities. In particular, we suggest a description of type 0Btheory in terms of M-theory in curved magnetic flux background, which supportsits conjectured SL(2,Z) symmetry, and in which the type 0 tachyon appears tocorrespond to a state in 11-d supergravity multiplet. In another ``T-dual''description, the tachyon is related to a winding membrane state.
