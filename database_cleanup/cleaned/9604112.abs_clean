We consider the methods by which higher-level and non-simply laced gaugesymmetries can be realized in free-field heterotic string theory. We show thatall such realizations have a common underlying feature, namely a dimensionaltruncation of the charge lattice, and we identify such dimensional truncationswith certain irregular embeddings of higher-level and non-simply laced gaugegroups within level-one simply-laced gauge groups. This identification allowsus to formulate a direct mapping between a given subgroup embedding, and thesorts of GSO constraints that are necessary in order to realize the embeddingin string theory. This also allows us to determine a number of usefulconstraints that generally affect string GUT model-building. For example, moststring GUT realizations of higher-level gauge symmetries G_k employ theso-called diagonal embeddings G_k\subset G\times G \times...\times G. We findthat there exist interesting alternative embeddings by which such groups can berealized at higher levels, and we derive a complete list of all possibilitiesfor the GUT groups SU(5), SU(6), SO(10), and E_6 at levels k=2,3,4 (and in somecases up to k=7). We find that these new embeddings are always more efficientand require less central charge than the diagonal embeddings which havetraditionally been employed. As a byproduct, we also prove that it isimpossible to realize SO(10) at levels k>4. This implies, in particular, thatfree-field heterotic string models can never give a massless 126 representationof SO(10).
