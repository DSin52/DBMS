In this paper we explicitly show the equivalence between the non-AbelianBorn-Infeld action, which was proposed by Tseytlin as an effective action onseveral D-branes, and its noncommutative counterpart for slowly varying fields.This confirms the equivalence between the two descriptions of the D-branesusing an ordinary gauge theory with a constant B field background and anoncommutative gauge theory, claimed by Seiberg and Witten. We also constructthe general forms of the 2 n-derivative terms for non-Abelian gauge fieldswhich are consistent with the equivalence in the approximation of neglecting (2n+2)-derivative terms.
