A higher dimensional analogue of the dispersionless KP hierarchy isintroduced. In addition to the two-dimensional ``phase space'' variables$(k,x)$ of the dispersionless KP hierarchy, this hierarchy has extra spatialdimensions compactified to a two (or any even) dimensional torus. Integrabilityof this hierarchy and the existence of an infinite dimensional of ``additionalsymmetries'' are ensured by an underlying twistor theoretical structure (or anonlinear Riemann-Hilbert problem). An analogue of the tau function, whoselogarithm gives the $F$ function (``free energy'' or ``prepotential'' in thecontest of matrix models and topological conformal field theories), isconstructed. The infinite dimensional symmetries can be extended to this tau(or $F$) function. The extended symmetries, just like those of thedispersionless KP hierarchy, obey an anomalous commutation relations.
