In this work we compute the spectra, waveforms and total scalar energyradiated during the radial infall of a small test particle coupled to a scalarfield into a $d$-dimensional Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter black hole. We focuson $d=4, 5$ and 7, extending the analysis we have done for $d=3$. For smallblack holes, the spectra peaks strongly at a frequency $\omega \sim d-1$, whichis the lowest pure anti-de Sitter (AdS) mode. The waveform vanishesexponentially as $t \to \infty$, and this exponential decay is governedentirely by the lowest quasinormal frequency. This collision process isinteresting from the point of view of the dynamics itself in relation to thepossibility of manufacturing black holes at LHC within the brane worldscenario, and from the point of view of the AdS/CFT conjecture, since thescalar field can represent the string theory dilaton, and 4, 5, 7 aredimensions of interest for the AdS/CFT correspondence.
