467-478We review the coset construction of conformal field theories; the emphasis ison the construction of the Hilbert spaces for these models, especially if fixedpoints occur. This is applied to the $N=2$ superconformal cosets constructed byKazama and Suzuki. To calculate heterotic string spectra we reformulate theGepner con- struction in terms of simple currents and introduce the so-calledextended Poincar\'e polynomial. We finally comment on the various equivalencesarising between models of this class, which can be expressed as level rankdualities. (Invited talk given at the III.
