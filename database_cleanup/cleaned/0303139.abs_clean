Title: Closed strings from decaying D-branes

Comments: harvmac, 30 pages, 2 figures. v2

We compute the emission of closed string radiation from homogeneous rollingtachyons. For an unstable decaying D$p$-brane the radiated energy is infiniteto leading order for $p\leq 2$ and finite for $p>2$. The closed string stateproduced by a decaying brane is closely related to the state produced byD-instantons at a critical Euclidean distance from $t=0$. In the case of a D0brane one can cutoff this divergence so that we get a finite energy final statewhich would be the state that the brane decays into.
