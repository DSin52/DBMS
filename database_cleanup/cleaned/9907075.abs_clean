We construct marginal operators of the orbifold SCFT corresponding to alltwenty near-horizon moduli in supergravity, including operators involving twistfields which correspond to the blowing up modes. We identify the operators withthe supergravity moduli in a 1-1 fashion by inventing a global SO(4) algebra inthe SCFT. We analyze the gauge dynamics of the D1/D5 system relevant to thesplitting $(Q_1,Q_5)\to (Q'_1,Q'_5)+ (Q''_1,Q''_5)$ with the help of a linearsigma model. We show in supergravity as well as in SCFT that the absorptioncross-section for minimal scalars is the same all over the near-horizon modulispace.
