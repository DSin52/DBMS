It is well-known that the standard no-ghost theorem is valid as long as thebackground has the light-cone directions. We prove the no-ghost theorem for theNSR string when only the timelike direction is flat. This is done by the BRSTquantization, using the technique of Frenkel, Garland and Zuckerman and ourprevious results for the bosonic string. The theorem actually applies as longas the timelike direction is written as a u(1) SCFT.
