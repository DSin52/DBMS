An investigation of the center symmetric phase of SU(2) QCD is presented. Therole of the center-symmetry, the dynamics of Polyakov loops and the structureof Abelian monopoles are studied within the axial gauge representation of QCD.Realization of the center symmetry is shown to result from non-perturbativegauge fixing and concomitant confinement like properties emerging even at theperturbative level are displayed. In an analysis of the Polyakov loop dynamics,non-perturbative gauge fixing is also shown to inevitably lead to singulargauge field configurations whose dynamics are briefly discussed.
