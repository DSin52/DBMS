The dynamics of n slowly moving fundamental monopoles in the SU(n+1) BPSYang-Mills-Higgs theory can be approximated by geodesic motion on the4n-dimensional hyperkahler Lee-Weinberg-Yi manifold. In this paper we apply avariational method to construct some scaling geodesics on this manifold. Thesegeodesics describe the scattering of n monopoles which lie on the vertices of abouncing polyhedron; the polyhedron contracts from infinity to a point,representing the spherically symmetric n-monopole, and then expands back out toinfinity. For different monopole masses the solutions generalize to formbouncing nested polyhedra. The relevance of these results to the dynamics ofwell separated SU(2) monopoles is also discussed.
