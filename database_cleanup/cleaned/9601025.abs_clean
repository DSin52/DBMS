It is demonstrated that quasi-exactly solvable models of quantum mechanicsadmit an interesting duality transformation which changes the form of theirpotentials and inverts the sign of all the exactly calculable energy levels.This transformation helps one to reveal some new features of quasi-exactlysolvable models and associated orthogonal polynomials.
