Title: Chern-Simons theory on an arbitrary manifold via surgery

Comments: 8 pages

A general formula for physical observables in Chern-Simons theory with anarbitrary compact Lie group $G$, on an arbitrary closed orientedthree-dimensional manifold $\cM$ is derived in terms of vacuum expectationvalues of Wilson loops in ${\cal S}^3$. Surgery presentation of $\cM$ and theKirby moves are implemented as the main ingredients of the approach. The caseof $G={\rm SU}(n)$ is explicitly calculated.
