We study $N=1$ supersymmetric $SO(10)$ gauge theory with a field in thespinorial representaition and $N_f$ ($\leq8$) fields in the definingrepresentation. It is shown that this theory for $N_f=7,8$ has a dualdescription, which is $N=1$ supersymmetric $SU(N_f-5)$ gauge theory. Its mattercontent for $N_f=7$ is different {}from the one for $N_f=8$; for $N_f=7$, itcontains $8$ fields in the anti-fundamental representation. For $N_f=8$, arank-$2$ symmetric tensor and one field in the fundamental representationappears in addition to them. This duality connects along the flat direction tothe duality between chiral and vector gauge theory found by Pouliot.
