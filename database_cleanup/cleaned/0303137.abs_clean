Title: Symmetries within domain walls

Authors: Tanmay Vachaspati

Comments: 5 pages. Added references

The comparison of symmetries in the interior and the exterior of a domainwall is relevant when discussing the correspondence between domain walls andbranes, and also when studying the interaction of walls and magnetic monopoles.I discuss the symmetries in the context of an SU(N) times Z_2 model (for odd N)with a single adjoint scalar field. Situations in which the wall interior hasless symmetry than the vacuum are easy to construct while the reverse situationrequires significant engineering of the scalar potential.
