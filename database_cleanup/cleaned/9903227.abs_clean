We describe a scheme for constructing the holographic dual of the fullD3-brane geometry with charge $K$ by embedding it into a large anti-de Sitterspace of size $N$. Such a geometry is realized in a multi-center anti-de Sittergeometry which admits a simple field theory interpretation as $SU(N+K)$ gaugetheory broken to $SU(N) \times SU(K)$. We find that the characteristic size ofthe D3-brane geometry is of order $(K/N)^{1/4} U^0$ where $U^0$ is the scale ofthe Higgs. By choosing $N$ to be much larger than $K$, the scale of theD3-brane metric can be well separated from the Higgs scale in the radialcoordinate. We generalize the holographic energy-distance relation and estimatethe characteristic energy scale associated with these radial scales, and findthat the $E/U$ relation becomes effectively $U$ independent in the range$(K/N)^{1/2} U^0 < U < U^0$. This implies that all detailed structure of theD3-brane geometry is encoded in the fine structure of the boundary gauge theoryat around the Higgs scale.
