Integrable SystemsWe consider the quantum nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in one space and onetime dimension. We are interested in the non-free-fermionic case. We considerstatic temperature-dependent correlation functions. The determinantrepresentation for correlation functions simplifies in the small mass limit ofthe Bose particle. In this limit we describe the correlation functions by thevacuum expectation value of a boson-valued solution for Maxwell-Blochdifferential equation. We evaluate long-distance asymptotics of correlationfunctions in the small mass limit.
