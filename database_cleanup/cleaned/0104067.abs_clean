We investigate brane physics in a universe with an extra dimensional globalmonopole and negative bulk cosmological constant. The graviton zero mode isnaturally divergent; we thus invoke a physical cut-off to induce fourdimensional gravity on a brane at the monopole core. Independently, the massiveKaluza-Klein modes have naturally compactified extra dimensions, inducing adiscrete spectrum. This spectrum remains consistent with four dimensionalgravity on the brane, even for small mass gap. Extra dimensional matter fieldsalso induce four dimensional matter fields on the brane, with the sameKaluza-Klein spectrum of excited states. We choose parameters to solve thehierarchy problem; that is, to induce the observed hierarchy between particleand Planck scales in the effective four dimensional universe.
