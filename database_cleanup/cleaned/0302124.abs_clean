paper (including all PS fonts) atWe present a method for evaluating divergent Borel-nonsummable series by ananalytic continuation of variational perturbation theory. We demonstrate itsvalidity by an application to the exactly known partition function of theanharmonic oscillator in zero spacetime dimensions, and derive the fullimaginary part of the ground state energy of the anharmonic oscillator for allnegative values of the coupling constant $g$. As a highlight of the theory weretrieve from the divergent perturbation expansion the instanton action and thecontribution of the higher loop fluctuations around the instanton in the pathintegral.
