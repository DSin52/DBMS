We construct solutions of type IIB supergravity with non-trivialRamond-Ramond 5-form in ten dimensions by replacing the transverse flat spaceof pp-wave backgrounds with exact $N=(4,4)$ $c=4$ superconformal field theoryblocks. These solutions, which also include a dilaton and (in some cases) ananti-symmetric tensor field, lead to integrable models on the world-sheet inthe light-cone gauge of string theory. In one instance we demonstrateexplicitly the emergence of the complex sine-Gordon model, which coincides withintegrable perturbations of the corresponding superconformal building blocks inthe transverse space. In other cases we arrive at the supersymmetric Liouvilletheory or at the complex sine-Liouville model. For axionic instantons in thetransverse space, as for the (semi)-wormhole geometry, we obtain an entireclass of supersymmetric pp-wave backgrounds by solving the Killing spinorequations as in flat space, supplemented by the appropriate chiral projections;as such, they generalize the usual Neveu-Schwarz five-brane solution of typeIIB supergravity in the presence of a Ramond-Ramond 5-form. We also presentsome further examples of interacting light-cone models and we briefly discussthe role of dualities in the resulting string theory backgrounds.
