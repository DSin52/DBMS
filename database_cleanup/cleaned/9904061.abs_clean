We calculate in dimensions $D=2+\epsilon$ and in light-cone gauge (LCG) theperturbative ${\cal O}(g^4)$ contribution to a rectangular Wilson loop in the(t,x)-plane coming from diagrams with a self-energy correction in the vectorpropagator. In the limit $\epsilon \to 0$ the result is finite, in spite of thevanishing of the triple vector vertex in LCG, and provides the expectedagreement with the analogous calculation in Feynman gauge.
