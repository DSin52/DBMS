We show that the moduli space of all Calabi-Yau manifolds that can berealized as hypersurfaces described by a transverse polynomial in a fourdimensional weighted projective space, is connected. This is achieved byexploiting techniques of toric geometry and the construction of Batyrev thatrelate Calabi-Yau manifolds to reflexive polyhedra. Taken together with thepreviously known fact that the moduli space of all CICY's is connected, and ismoreover connected to the moduli space of the present class of Calabi-Yaumanifolds (since the quintic threefold P_4[5] is both CICY and a hypersurfacein a weighted P_4, this strongly suggests that the moduli space of all simplyconnected Calabi-Yau manifolds is connected. It is of interest that singularCalabi-Yau manifolds corresponding to the points in which the moduli spacesmeet are often, for the present class, more singular than the conifolds thatconnect the moduli spaces of CICY's.
