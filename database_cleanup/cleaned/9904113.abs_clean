We find, from the toric description of the moduli space of D3-branes onnon-compact six-dimensional singularities $\C^3/\Z_3$ and $\C^3/\Z_5$ in theblown-down limit, the four-dimensional bases on which these singular spaces arecomplex cones, and prove the existence of K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on thesefour-dimensional bases. This shows, in particular, that one can use thehorizons obtained from these base spaces by a U(1)-foliation as compact partsof the target space for Type-IIB string theory with $\ads{5}$ in the context ofthe AdS-CFT correspondence.
