In this paper the stabilization of 2D quantum Gravity by branchinginteractions is considered. The perturbative expansion and the firstnonperturbative term of the stabilized model are the same than the unboundedmatrix model which define pure Gravity, but it has new nonperturbative effectsthat survives in the continuum limit.
