Title: Elliptic Calogero-Moser system from two dimensional current algebra

Authors: Alexander Gorsky and Nikita Nekrasov

Comments: 8 pages, Tex

We show that elliptic Calogero-Moser system and its Lax operator found byKrichever can be obtained by Hamiltonian reduction from the integrableHamiltonian system on the cotangent bundle to the central extension of thealgebra of SL(N,C) currents.Elliptic deformation of Yang-Mills theory ispresented.
