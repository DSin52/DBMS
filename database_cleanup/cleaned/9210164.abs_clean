We consider a string theory with two types of strings with geometricinteraction. We show that the theory contains strings with constant Dirichletboundary condition and those strings are glued together by 2-d topologicalgravity with macroscopic boundaries. A light-cone string field theory is givenand the theory has interactions to all orders.
