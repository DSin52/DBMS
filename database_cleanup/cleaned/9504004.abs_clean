We analyze multi-instanton sector in two dimensional U(N) Yang-Mills theoryon a sphere. We obtain a contour intregrals representation of themulti-instanton amplitude and find ``neutral'' configurations of the evennumber instantons are dominant in the large N limit. Using this representation,we calculate 1,2,3,4 bodies interactions and the free energies for $N =3,4,5$numerically and find that in fact the multi-instanton interaction effectessentially contribute to the large N phase transition discovered by Douglasand Kazakov.
