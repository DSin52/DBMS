We solve for the spectrum and eigenfunctions of Dirac operator on the sphere.The eigenvalues are nonzero whole numbers. The eigenfunctions are two-componentspinors which may be classified by representations of the SU(2) group withhalf-integer angular momenta. They are not the conventional spherical spinorsbut special linear combinations of those.
