Coherent states on the quantum group $SU_q(2)$ are defined by using harmonicanalysis and representation theory of the algebra of functions on the quantumgroup. Semiclassical limit $q\rightarrow 1$ is discussed and the crucial roleof special states on the quantum algebra in an investigation of thesemiclassical limit is emphasized. An approach to $q$-deformation as a $q$-Weylquantization and a relavence of contact geometry in this context is pointedout. Dynamics on the quantum group parametrized by a real time variable andcorresponding to classical rotations is considered.
