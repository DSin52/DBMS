We discuss the bosonized Schwinger model in light-cone quantization, usingdiscretization as an infrared regulator. We consider both the light-coneCoulomb gauge, in which all gauge freedom can be removed and a physical Hilbertspace employed, and the light-cone Weyl (temporal) gauge, in which the Hilbertspace is unphysical and a Gauss law operator is used to select a physicalsubspace. We describe the different ways in which the theta vacuum ismanifested depending on this choice of gauge, and compute the theta-dependenceof the chiral condensate in each case.
