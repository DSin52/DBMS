Title: Weak decay of swirling protons and other processes

Authors: George E. A. Matsas and Daniel A. T. Vanzella

Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures

We investigate the weak-interaction emission of spin-1/2 fermions fromdecaying (and non-decaying) particles endowed with uniform circular motion. Thedecay of swirling protons and the neutrino- antineutrino emission fromcircularly moving electrons are analyzed in some detail. The relevance of ourresults to astrophysics is commented.
