We construct several quantum coset W-algebras, e.g. sl(2,R)/U(1) andsl(2,R)+sl(2,R) / sl(2,R), and argue that they are finitely nonfreelygenerated. Furthermore, we discuss in detail their role as unifying W-algebrasof Casimir W-algebras. We show that it is possible to give coset realizationsof various types of unifying W-algebras, e.g. the diagonal cosets based on thesymplectic Lie algebras sp(2n) realize the unifying W-algebras which havepreviously been introduced as `WD_{-n}'. In addition, minimal models of WD_{-n}are studied. The coset realizations provide a generalization oflevel-rank-duality of dual coset pairs. As further examples of finitelynonfreely generated quantum W-algebras we discuss orbifolding of W-algebraswhich on the quantum level has different properties than in the classical case.We demonstrate in some examples that the classical limit according to Bowcockand Watts of these nonfreely finitely generated quantum W-algebras probablyyields infinitely nonfreely generated classical W-algebras.
