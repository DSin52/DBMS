We derive the period structure of several one-modulus Calabi-Yau manifolds.With this knowledge we then obtain the generators of the duality group and themirror map that defines the physical variable $t$ representing the radius ofcompactification. We also describe the fundamental region of $t$ and discussits relation with automorphic functions. As a byproduct of our analysis wecompute the non-perturbative corrections of Yukawa couplings.
