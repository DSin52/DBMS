Title: Relic gravitons from non-singular string cosmologies

Authors: Cyril Cartier

Comments: Contribution to CAPP2000, Verbier (Switzerland),July 2000. To appear

in the Proceedings (American Institute of Physics publication)In the context of the pre-Big Bang scenario of string cosmology, we propose amodified equation for the evolution of the tensor perturbations, which includesthe full contribution of possible higher-order curvature and couplingcorrections required to regularise the background evolution. We then discussthe high-frequency branch of the spectrum of primordial gravitons.
