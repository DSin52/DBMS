Title: On Path Integration on Noncommutative Geometries

Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX

We discuss a recent approach to quantum field theoretical path integration onnoncommutative geometries which imply UV/IR regularising finite minimaluncertainties in positions and/or momenta. One class of such noncommutativegeometries arise as `momentum spaces' over curved spaces, for which we can nowgive the full set of commutation relations in coordinate free form, based onthe Synge world function.
