We investigate the $q$-deformation of the BRST algebra, the algebra of theghost, matter and gauge fields on one spacetime point using the result of thebicovariant differential calculus. There are two nilpotent operations in thealgebra, the BRST transformation $\brs$ and the derivative $d$. We show thatone can define the covariant commutation relations among the fields and theirderivatives consistently with these two operation as well as the $*$-operation,the antimultiplicative inner involution.
