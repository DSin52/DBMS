cross-referencingWe investigate the quantum volume of D-branes wrapped around cycles ofvarious dimension in Calabi-Yau fourfolds and fivefolds. Examining the cases ofthe sextic and heptic hypersurface Calabi-Yau varieties, as well as one examplein weighted projective space, we find expressions for periods which vanish atthe singular point analogous to the conifold point. As in the knownthree-dimensional cases, it is the top dimensional cycle which attains zeroquantum volume, even though lower dimensional cycles remain non-degenerate,indicating this phenomena to be a general feature of quantum geometry.
