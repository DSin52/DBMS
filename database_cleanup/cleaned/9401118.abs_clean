We consider integrable open--boundary conditions for the supersymmetric t--Jmodel commuting with the number operator $n$ and $S^{z}$. Four families, eachone depending on two arbitrary parameters, are found. We find the relationbetween Sklyanin's method of constructing open boundary conditions and the onefor the quantum group invariant case based on Markov traces. The eigenvalueproblem is solved for the new cases by generalizing the Nested Algebraic Betheansatz of the quantum group invariant case (which is obtained as a speciallimit). For the quantum group invariant case the Bethe ansatz states are shownto be highest weights of $spl_{q}(2,1)$.
