Title: Alternative Formulation of The Quantum Electroweak Theory

Authors: Jun-Chen Su

Comments: 17 pages,3 figures

The quantization of the electroweak theory is performed starting from theLagrangian given in the so-called unitary gauge in which the unphysicalGoldstone fields disappear. In such a Lagrangian, the unphysical longitudinalcomponents of the gauge fields are naturally eliminated by introducing theLorentz gauge condition. In this way, the quautum theory given in $\alpha$-gauge is perfectly established in the Lagangian formalism by theFaddeev-Popov approach and/or the Lagrange multiplier method in the frameworkof SU(2)$\times $U(1) gauge symmetry. The theory established is not onlysimpler than the ordinary R$_\alpha -$gauge theory, but also explicitlyrenormalizable. The unitarity of the theory is ensured by the limitingprocedure of letting the gauge parameter $\alpha $ appearing in the massivevector boson propagators tend to infinity in the final step of calculations.The formulations of the theory with and without involving the Higgs boson arediscussed separately.
