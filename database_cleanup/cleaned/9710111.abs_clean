Title: Quasi exactly solvable matrix models in sl(n)

Authors: Yves Brihaye, Piotr Kosinski

We reconsider the quasi exactly solvable matrix models constructed recentlyby R. Zhdanov. The 2$\times$2 matrix operators representing the algebra sl(2)are generalized to matrices of arbitrary dimension and a similar constructionis achieved for the algebra sl(n).
