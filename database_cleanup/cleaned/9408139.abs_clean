In this letter we show that the restricted star-triangle relation introducedby Bazhanov and Baxter can be obtained either from the star-triangle relationof chiral Potts model or from the star-square relation which is proposed byKashaev $et ~al$ and give a response of the guess which is suggested byBazhanov and Baxter in Ref. \cite{b2}.
