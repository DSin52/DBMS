Systematic use of the infinite-dimensional spin representation simplifies andrigorizes several questions in Quantum Field Theory. This representationpermutes ``Gaussian'' elements in the fermion Fock space, and is necessarilyterms and anomalies from infinitesimal versions of this cocycle. Quantization,in this framework, depends on the choice of the ``right'' complex structure onthe space of solutions of the Dirac equation. We show how the spinrepresentation allows one to compute exactly the S-matrix for fermions in anexternal field; the cocycle yields a causality condition needed to determinethe phase.
