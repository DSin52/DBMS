Hamiltonian lattice gauge models based on the assignment of the Heisenbergdouble of a Lie group to each link of the lattice are constructed in arbitraryspace-time dimensions. It is shown that the corresponding generalization of thegauge-invariant Wilson line observables requires to attach to each vertex ofthe line a vertex operator which goes to the unity in the continuum limit.
