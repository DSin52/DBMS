We study the renormalizable abelian vector-field models in the presence ofthe Wess-Zumino interaction with the pseudoscalar matter. The renormalizabilityis achieved by supplementing the standard kinetic term of vector fields withhigher derivatives. The appearance of fourth power of momentum in thevector-field propagator leads to the super-renormalizable theory in which thebeta-function, the vector-field renormalization constant and the anomalous massdimension are calculated exactly. It is shown that this model has the infraredstable fixed point and its low-energy limit is non-trivial. The modifiedeffective potential for the pseudoscalar matter leads to the occurrence of thequantum dynamical breaking of Lorentz symmetry.
