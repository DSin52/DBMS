We show that the entanglement between inner and outer particles, with respectto the event horizon, is the microscopic origin of the black hole entropy. Dueto the non-unitarity of the mapping between the vacua in the flat and thecurved frames, this entanglement is very robust. The holographic nature of theentropy is recovered in a quantum field theoretical setting, and it is shownthat, at microscopic level, the responsible for the dimensional reduction ofthe degrees of freedom is the Hawking effect.
