We investigate the evolution of small perturbations around black strings andbranes which are low energy solutions of string theory. For simplicity we focusattention on the zero charge case and show that there are unstable modes for arange of time frequency and wavelength in the extra $10-D$ dimensions. Theseperturbations can be stabililized if the extra dimensions are compactified to ascale smaller than the minimum wavelength for which instability occurs and thuswill not affect large astrophysical black holes in four dimensions. We commenton the implications of this result for the Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis.
