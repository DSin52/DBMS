Gravitation, Tokyo, Japan, 9-12, January, 2002It is important to reveal the brane-bulk correspondence for understanding thebrane world cosmology. When gravitational waves exist in the bulk, however, itis difficult to make the analysis of the interrelationship between the braneand the bulk. Hence, the minimal model which allows gravitational waves in thebulk would be useful. As for such models, we adopt the Bianchi typemidi-superspace models. In particular, the effects of gravitational waves inthe bulk on the brane cosmology is examined using the midi-superspace approach.
