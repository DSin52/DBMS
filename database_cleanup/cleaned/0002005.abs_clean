Title: Multifractality of time and space, covariant derivatives and gauge

invarianceAuthors: L.Ya.Kobelev

A possibility to represent the standard model of fundamental particlescovariant derivatives by means of approximate generalized fractionalRiemann-Liouville derivatives of multifractal time and space model is shown.
