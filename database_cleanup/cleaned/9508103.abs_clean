We describe a finite analogue of the Poisson algebra of Wilson loops inYang-Mills theory. It is shown that this algebra arises in an apparentlycompletely different context; as a Lie algebra of vector fields on anon-commutative space. This suggests that non-commutative geometry plays afundamental role in the manifestly gauge invariant formulation of Yang-Millstheory. We also construct the deformation of the loop algebra induced byquantization, in the large N_c limit.
