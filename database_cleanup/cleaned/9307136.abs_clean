Using the hamiltonian formalism, we investigate the smooth bosonizationmethod in which bosonization and fermionization are carried out through aspecific gauge-fixing of an enlarged gauge invariant theory. The generator ofthe local gauge symmetry, which cannot be derived from the lagrangian of theenlarged theory, is obtained by making a canonical transformation. We also showthat the massless Thirring model possesses a similar local gauge symmetry for aspeific value of the coupling constant.
