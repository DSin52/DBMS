Title: Near-Horizon Supergravity Superspace

Comments: 6 pages, contribution to the proceedings of the "mid-term TMR meeting

on Quantum Aspects Theories, Supersymmetry and Unification", Corfu, September20-26, 1998We present a construction of the superspace of maximally supersymmetricadS_{p+2} x S^{d-p-2} near-horizon geometry based entirely on the supergravityconstraints of which the bosonic space is a solution. Besides the geometricsuperfields, i.e. the vielbeine and the spinconnection, we also derive theisometries of the superspace together with the compensating tangent spacetransformations to all orders in anticommuting superspace coordinates.
