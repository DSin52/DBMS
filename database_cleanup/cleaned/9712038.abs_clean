A derivative expansion of the Wegner-Houghton equation is derived for ascalar theory. The corresponding full non-perturbative renormalization groupequations for the potential and the wave-function renormalization function arepresented. We also show that the two loop perturbative anomalous dimension forthe O(N) theory can be obtained by means of a polynomial truncation in thefield dependence in our equations.
