In this paper we consider heterotic compactifications on K3 x T2 as well astype II compactifications on K3-fibred Calabi-Yau spaces with certain fluxesfor the gauge and RR field strengths F and H turned on. By providing anidentification of corresponding fluxes we show that the well-known N=2heterotic/type II string-string duality still holds for a subset of allpossible fluxes, namely those which arise from six-dimensional gauge fieldswith internal magnetic flux on the common two-sphere P1, which is the basespace of the type II K3-fibration. On the other hand, F- and H-fluxes withoutP1-support, such as heterotic F-fluxes on the torus T2 or type II H-fluxes oncycles of the K3-fibre cannot be matched in any simple way, which is achallenge for heterotic/type II string-string duality. Our analysis is based onthe comparison of terms in the effective low-energy heterotic and type IIactions which are induced by the fluxes, such as the Green-Schwarz couplingsrelated to flux-induced U(1) anomalies, the effective superpotential and theFayet-Iliopoulos scalar potential.
