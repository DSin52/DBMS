Title: Seventy Relatives of the Monster Module

Comments: 18 pages

Recent work on the classification of conformal field theories with oneprimary field (the identity operator) is reviewed. The classification of suchtheories is an essential step in the program of classification of all rationalconformal field theories, but appears impossible in general. The last managablecase, central charge 24, is considered here. We found a total of 71 suchtheories (which have not all been constructed yet) including the monstermodule. The complete list of modular invariant partition functions has alreadyappeared elsewhere \SchM. This paper contains an easily readable account of themethod, as well as a few examples and some comments. (This is a compilation ofcontributions to workshops in Goteborg, Kiev, Corfu and Erice).
