be updated from time to timeAn assessment is offered of the progress that the major approaches to quantumgravity have made towards the goal of constructing a complete and satisfactorytheory. The emphasis is on loop quantum gravity and string theory, althoughother approaches are discussed, including dynamical triangulation models(euclidean and lorentzian) regge calculus models, causal sets, twistor theory,non-commutative geometry and models based on analogies to condensed mattersystems. We proceed by listing the questions the theories are expected to beso far achieved in each theory, while the second lists conjectures which remainopen. By comparing them we can evaluate how far each theory has progressed, andwhat must still be done before each theory can be considered a satisfactoryquantum theory of gravity. We find there has been impressive recent progress onseveral fronts. At the same time, important issues about loop quantum gravityare so far unresolved, as are key conjectures of string theory. However, thereis a reasonable expectation that experimental tests of lorentz invariance atPlanck scales may in the near future make it possible to rule out one or morecandidate quantum theories of gravity.
