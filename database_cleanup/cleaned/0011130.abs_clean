We consider topology-changing transitions between 7-manifolds of holonomy G_2constructed as a quotient of CY x S^1 by an antiholomorphic involution. Weclassify involutions for Complete Intersection CY threefolds, focussingprimarily on cases without fixed points. The ordinary conifold transitionbetween CY threefolds descends to a transition between G_2 manifolds,corresponding in the N=1 effective theory incorporating the light black holestates either to a change of branch in the scalar potential or to a Higgsmechanism. A simple example of conifold transition with a fixed nodal point isalso discussed. As a spin-off, we obtain examples of G_2 manifolds with thesame value for the sum of Betti numbers b_2+b_3, and hence potential candidatesfor mirror manifolds.
