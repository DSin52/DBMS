Bianchi-type string cosmology involves generalizations of the FRW backgroundswith three transitive spacelike Killing symmetries, but without any a prioriassumption of isotropy in the 3D sections of homogeneity. With emphasis onthose cases with diagonal metrics and vanishing cosmological constant whichwhich have not been previously examined in the literature, the present findingsallow an overview and the classification of all Bianchi-type backgrounds. Thesestring solutions (at least to lowest order in alpha prime) offer prototypes forthe study of spatial anisotropy and its impact on the dynamics of the earlyuniverse.
