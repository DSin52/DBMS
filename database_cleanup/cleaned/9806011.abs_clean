The string theory description of BPS states in D-brane world-volume fieldtheories may undergo transitions from open strings to string webs, as well asbetween different string webs, as one moves in the field theory moduli space.These transitions are driven by the string creation phenomenon. We demonstratesuch transitions in the D3-brane realization of N=2 SU(2) Super-Yang-Millstheory.
