In this paper the evolution of a quantum system drived by a non-HermitianHamiltonian depending on slowly-changing parameters is studied by building anuniversal high-order adiabatic approximation(HOAA) method with Berry's phase,which is valid for either the Hermitian or the non-Hermitian cases. Thismethod can be regarded as a non-trivial generalization of the HOAA method forclosed quantum system presented by this author before. In a general situation,the probabilities of adiabatic decay and non-adiabatic transitions areexplicitly obtained for the evolution of the non-Hermitian quantum system. Itis also shown that the non-Hermitian analog of the Berry's phase factor for thenon-Hermitian case just enjoys the holonomy structure of the dual linear bundleover the parameter manifold. The non-Hermitian evolution of the generalizedforced harmonic oscillator is discussed as an illustrative examples.
