Starting from the known representation of the partition function of the 2-and 3-D Ising models as an integral over Grassmann variables, we perform ahopping expansion of the corresponding Pfaffian. We show that this expansion isan exact, algebraic representation of the loop- and surface expansions (withintrinsic geometry) of the 2- and 3-D Ising models. Such an algebraic calculusis much simpler to deal with than working with the geometrical objects. For the2-D case we show that the algebra of hopping generators allows a simplealgebraic treatment of the geometry factors and counting problems, and as aresult we obtain the corrected loop expansion of the free energy. We computethe radius of convergence of this expansion and show that it is determined bythe critical temperature. In 3-D the hopping expansion leads to the surfacerepresentation of the Ising model in terms of surfaces with intrinsic geometry.Based on a representation of the 3-D model as a product of 2-D models coupledto an auxiliary field, we give a simple derivation of the geometry factor whichprevents overcounting of surfaces and provide a classification of possible setsof surfaces to be summed over. For 2- and 3-D we derive a compact formula for2n-point functions in loop (surface) representation.
