515-539We study the general form of the *-commutator treated as a deformation of thePoisson bracket on the Grassman algebra. We show that, up to a similaritytransformation, there are other deformations of the Poisson bracket in additionto the Moyal commutator (one at even and one at odd n, n is the number of thegenerators of the Grassman algebra) which are not reduced to the Moyalcommutator by a similarity transformation.
