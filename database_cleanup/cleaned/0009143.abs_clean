Authors: Kei-Ichi Kondo (Chiba Univ., Japan)

Comments: 9 pages, Invited talk given at International Symposium on Quantum

Chromodynamics (QCD) and Color Confinement (Confinement 2000), Osaka, Japan,7-10 Mar 2000, and at 30th International Conference on High-Energy Physics(ICHEP 2000), Osaka, Japan, 27 Jul - 2 Aug 2000 (ICHEP2000) (to be publishedin the Proceedings (World Scientific, Singapore))To understand the Abelian dominance and magnetic monopole dominance inlow-energy QCD, we rewrite the non-Abelian Wilson loop into the form which iswritten in terms of its Abelian components or the 't Hooft-Polyakov tensordescribing the magnetic monopole. This is peformed by making use of a versionof non-Abelian Stokes theorem. We propose a modified version of the maximalAbelian (MA) gauge. By adopting the modified MA gauge in QCD, we show that theoff-diagonal gluons and Faddeev-Popov ghosts acquire their masses through theghost--anti-ghost condensation due to four ghost interaction coming from thegauge-fixing term of the modified MA gauge. The asymptotic freedom of theoriginal non-Abelian gauge theory is preserved in this derivation.
