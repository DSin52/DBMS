Title: U(N) Matrix Difference Equations and a Nested Bethe Ansatz

Authors: H. Babujian, M. Karowski and A. Zapletal

Comments: 17 pages, LaTeX

A system of U(N)-matrix difference equations is solved by means of a nestedversion of a generalized Bethe Ansatz. The highest weight property of thesolutions is proved and some examples of solutions are calculated explicitly.(Part II of a series of articles on the generalized nested Bethe Ansatz anddifference equations.)
