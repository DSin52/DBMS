We show that the physical degrees of freedom of the critical open string withN=2 superconformal symmetry on the worldsheet are described by a self-dualYang-Mills field on a hyperspace parametrised by the coordinates of the targetspace R^{2,2} together with a commuting chiral spinor. A prepotential for theself-dual connection in the hyperspace generates the infinite tower of physicalfields corresponding to the inequivalent pictures or spinor ghost vacua of thisstring. An action is presented for this tower, which describes consistentinteractions amongst fields of arbitrarily high spin. An interesting truncationto a theory of five fields is seen to have no graphs of two or more loops.
