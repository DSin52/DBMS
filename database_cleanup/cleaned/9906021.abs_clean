We study the behaviour of Wilson and 't Hooft loop operators for the 2+1 dim.Abelian-Higgs model with Chern-Simons term. The phase of topological symmetrybreaking where the vortex field condenses, found by Samuel for the model in theabsence of the Chern-Simons term, persists in its presence. In this phase, thetopological linking of instantons, which are configurations of closed vortexloops, with the Wilson loop on one hand and with the 't Hooft loop on the otherhand gives rise to a long-range, logarithmic, confining potential betweenelectric charges and magnetic flux tubes. This is surprising since the gaugefield is short range due to the Chern-Simons term. Gauss' law forces theconcomitance of charge and magnetic flux, hence the confinement is actually ofanyons.
