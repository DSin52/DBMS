Superfield equations of motion for D=10 type IIB Dirichlet super-9-brane areobtained from the generalized action principle. The geometric equationscontaining fermionic superembedding equations and constraints on thegeneralized field strength of Abelian gauge field are separated from the properdynamical equations and are found to contain these dynamical equations amongtheir consequences. The set of superfield equations thus obtained involves aSpin(1,9) group valued superfield $h_\a^{~\b}$ whose leading component appearsin the recently obtained simplified expression for the kappa-symmetryprojector of the D9-brane. The Cayley image of this superfield coincides (onthe mass shell) with the field strength tensor of the world volume gauge fieldcharacteristic for the Dirichlet brane. The superfield description of thesuper-9-brane obtained in this manner is known to be, on the one hand, thenonlinear (Born-Infeld) generalization of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theoryand, on the other hand, the theory of partial spontaneous breaking of D=10,N=IIB supersymmetry down to D=10, N=1.
