Using a contour integral representation we analyze the multi-instanton sectorin two dimensional $U(N)$ Yang-Mills theory on a sphere and argue the role ofmulti-instanton in the large $N$ phase transition. In the strong couplingregion at the large $N$ , we encounter ``singular saddle point''. Because ofthis situation, ``neutral'' configurations of the multi-instanton are dominantin this region. Based on the ``neutral'' multi-instanton approximation wenumerically calculate the multi-instanton amplitude , the free energies and theWilson loops for finite $N$ . We also compare our results with the large $N$exact solution of the free energy and the Wilson loop and argue some problems.We find the ``neutral'' multi-instanton contribution bridges the gap betweenweak and strong coupling phase.
