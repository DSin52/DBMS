A new two-step renormalization procedure is proposed. In the first step, theeffects of high-energy states are considered in the conventional (Feynman)perturbation theory. In the second step, the coupling to many-body states iseliminated by a similarity transformation. The resultant effective Hamiltoniancontains only interactions which do not change particle number. It is subjectto numerical diagonalization. We apply the general procedure to a simpleexample for the purpose of illustration.
