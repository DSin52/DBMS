We compute the CP-odd part of the finite temperature effective action formassive Dirac fermions in the presence of a Dirac monopole. We confirm that theinduced charge is temperature dependent, and in the effective action we find aninfinite series of CP-violating terms that generalize the familiar zerotemperature $F\tilde{F}$ term. These results are analogous to recent resultsconcerning finite temperature induced Chern-Simons terms.
