By defining a regular gauge which is conformal-like and providesinstantaneous field propagation, we investigate classical solutions of(2+1)-Gravity coupled to arbitrarily moving point-like particles. We show howto separate field equations from self-consistent motion and we provide asolution for the metric and the motion in the two-body case with arbitraryspeed, up to second order in the mass parameters.
