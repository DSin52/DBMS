We consider the supergravity dual descriptions of non-conformal superYang-Mills theories realized on the world-volume of Dp-branes. We use the dualdescription to compute stress-energy tensor and current correlators. We applythe results to the study of dilatonic brane-worlds described by non-conformalfield theories coupled to gravity. We find that brane-worlds based on D4 and D5branes exhibit a localization of gauge and gravitational fields. We calculatethe corrections to the Newton and Coulomb laws in these theories.
