We consider the critical alternating quantum spin chain with ${q_{+}\over2}$, ${q_{-} \over2}$ spins. Using the Bethe ansatz technique we find explicitexpressions for the $S$-matrix of the model. We show that in the limit that$q_{\pm} \rightarrow \infty$ our results coincide with the ones obtained forthe principal chiral model level one, for the LL (RR) LR scattering. We alsostudy the scattering of the bound states of the model and we recover theresults of the XXZ (sine -Gordon) model.
