We investigate Yang-Mills theory on a spatial torus at finite temperature inthe presence of discrete electric and magnetic fluxes using the AdS/CFTcorrespondence. We calculate the leading dependence of the partition functionon the fluxes using the dual supergravity theory and comment upon theinterpretation of these fluxes as discrete quantum hair for black holes in AdSspacetime.
