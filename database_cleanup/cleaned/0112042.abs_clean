An on-shell model for the supersymmetric index counting multiplicities of BPSstates of the M5-brane theory is reviewed. In particular we explicitly studythe tensionless Little String states appearing at intersections in a boundstate of $N$ 5-branes wrapped on a six-manifold with product topology$M_4\times T^2$.
