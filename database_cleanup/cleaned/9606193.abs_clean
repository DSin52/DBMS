We find the general charged rotating black hole solutions of the maximalsupergravities in dimensions $4\le D\le 9$ arising from toroidally compactifiedType II string or M-theories. In each dimension, these are obtained by actingon a generating solution with classical duality symmetries. In D=4, D=5 and$6\le D \le 9$ the generating solution is specified by the ADM mass,$[{D-1}/2]$-angular momentum components and five, three and two charges,respectively. We discuss the BPS-saturated (static) black holes and derive theU-duality invariant form of the area of the horizon. We also comment on theU-duality invariant form of the BPS mass formulae.
