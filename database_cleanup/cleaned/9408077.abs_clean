In the framework of the classical field theory a mapping betweenantisymmetric tensor matter fields and Weinberg's $2(2j+1)$ component"bispinor" fields is considered. It is shown that such a mapping exists andequations which describe the $j=1$ antisymmetric tensor field coincide with theHammer-Tucker equations completely and with the Weinberg ones within asubsidiary condition, the Klein-Gordon equation. A new Lagrangian for theWeinberg theory is proposed. It is scalar, Hermitian and contains only thefirst-order time derivatives of the fields. The remarkable feature of thisLagrangian is the presence of dual field functions, considered as parts of aparity doublet. I study then origins of appearance of the dual solutions in theWeinberg equations on the basis of spinorial analysis and point out the topicswhich have to be explained in the framework of a secondary quantization scheme.
