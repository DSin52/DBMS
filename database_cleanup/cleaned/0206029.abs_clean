We consider M-theory on AdS_4 x V_{5,2} where V_{5,2}= SO(5)/SO(3) is aStiefel manifold. We construct a Penrose limit of AdS_4 x V_{5,2} that providesthe pp-wave geometry. There exists a subsector of three dimensional N=2 dualgauge theory, by taking both the conformal dimension and R charge large withthe finiteness of their difference, which has enhanced N=8 maximalsupersymmetry. We identify operators in the N=2 gauge theory with supergravityKK excitations in the pp-wave geometry and describe how the gauge theoryoperators made out of chiral field of conformal dimension 1/3 fall into N=8supermultiplets.
