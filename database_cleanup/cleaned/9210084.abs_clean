By considering the fermionic realization of $G/H$ coset models, we show thatthe partition function for the $U(1)/U(1)$ model defines a Topological QuantumField Theory and coincides with that for a 2-dimensional Abelian BF system. Inthe non-Abelian case, we prove the topological character of $G/G$ coset modelsby explicit computation, also finding a natural extension of 2-dimensional BFsystems with non-Abelian symmetry.
