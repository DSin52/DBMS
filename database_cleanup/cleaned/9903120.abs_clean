We study the proposed duality between the 5-dimensionalsupergravity/superstring on $AdS_3\times S^2$ and the 2-dimensional N=(0,4)SCFT defined on the boundary of AdS-space. We construct explicitly the N=(0,4)SCFT by imposing the `quiver projection' developed by Douglas-Moore on theN=(4,4) SCFT of symmetric orbifold, which is proposed to be the dual of the6-dimensional supergravity/superstring on $AdS_3\times S^3$.We explore in detail the spectrum of chiral primaries in this `quiver$SCFT_2$'. We compare it with the Kaluza-Klein spectrum on $AdS_3\times S^2$and check the consistency between them. We further emphasize that orbifoldingof bulk theory should {\em not} correspond to orbifolding of the boundary CFTin the usual sense of two dimensional CFT, rather corresponds to the quiverprojection. We observe that these are not actually equivalent with each otherwhen we focus on the multi-particle states.
