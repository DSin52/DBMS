We argue that the random-matrix like energy spectra found in pseudointegrablebilliards with pointlike scatterers are related to the quantum violation ofscale invariance of classical analogue system. It is shown that the behavior ofthe running coupling constant explains the key characteristics of the levelstatistics of pseudointegrable billiards.
