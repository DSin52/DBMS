Title: On the algebraic structures connected with the linear Poisson brackets

of hydrodynamics typeThe generalized form of the Kac formula for Verma modulesassociated with linear brackets of hydrodynamics type is proposed.Second cohomology groups of the generalized Virasoro algebras arecalculated. Connection of the central extensions with the problem ofquntization of hydrodynamics brackets is demonstrated.
