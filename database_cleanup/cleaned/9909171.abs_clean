We consider the elastic scattering of two open strings living on two D-branesseparated by a distance $r$. We compute the high-energy behavior of theamplitude, to leading order in string coupling, as a function of the scatteringangle $\phi$ and of the dimensionless parameter $v=r/(\pi\alpha^\prime\sqrt{s})$ with $\sqrt{s}$ the center-of-mass energy. Theresult exhibits an interesting phase diagram in the $(v,\phi)$ plane, with atransition at the production threshold for stretched strings at $v=1$. We alsodiscuss some more general features of the open-string semiclassicalworld-sheets, and use T-duality to give a quantum tunneling interpretation ofthe exponential suppression at high-energy.
