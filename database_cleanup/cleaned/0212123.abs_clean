addedA novel geometrical model of a two-brane has been constructed, which is {\itinherently} noncommutative, without external interactions. We show that thenoncommutative spacetime is to be interpreted as having an {\it internal}angular momentum throughout. Subsequently, the elementary excitations - {\iti.e.} point particles - living on the brane are endowed with a {\it spin}. Thestudy of them reveals in a natural way various signatures of a noncommutativequantum theory, such as dipolar nature of the basic excitations \cite{jab} andmomentum dependent shifts in the interaction point \cite{big}. The observation\cite{sw} that noncommutative and ordinary field theories are alternativedescriptions of the same underlying theory, is corroborated here by showingthat they are gauge equivalent. Also, treating the present model as an explicitexample, we show that, even classically, in the presence of constraints, theequivalence between Nambu-Goto and Polyakov formulations is ! subtle.
