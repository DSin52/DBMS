In this paper we describe the moduli space of kinks in a class of systems oftwo coupled real scalar fields in (1+1) Minkowskian space-time. The mainfeature of the class is the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry of(real) Ginzburg-Landau type that guarantees the existence of kink topologicaldefects.
