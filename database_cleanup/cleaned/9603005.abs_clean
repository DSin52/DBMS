Title: The renormalized $\phi^4_4$-trajectory by perturbation theory in a

running coupling using partial differential equationsComments: 39 pages LaTeX2e, some misprints corrected

We compute the renormalized trajectory of $\phi^4_4$-theory by perturbationtheory in a running coupling. We use an exact infinitesimal renormalizationgroup. The expansion is put into a form which is manifestly independent of thescale parameter.
