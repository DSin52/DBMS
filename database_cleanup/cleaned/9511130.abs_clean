Title: Divergences in formal variational calculus and boundary terms in

Hamiltonian formalismComments: 15 pages, TeX macro included, no figures, talk given at "Symposium on

Differential Geometry and Mathematical Physics", Warsaw, May 1995It is shown how to extend the formal variational calculus in order toincorporate integrals of divergences into it. Such a generalization permits tostudy nontrivial boundary problems in field theory on the base of canonicalformalism.
