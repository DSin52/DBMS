Title: Lectures on D-branes, tachyon condensation, and string field theory

Authors: Washington Taylor (MIT)

Comments: 52 pages, 3 eps figures, Latex; lectures presented at CECS school on

quantum gravity, Valdivia, Chile, January 2002These lectures provide an introduction to the subject of tachyon condensationin the open bosonic string. The problem of tachyon condensation is firstdescribed in the context of the low-energy Yang-Mills description of a systemof multiple D-branes, and then using the language of string field theory. Anintroduction is given to Witten's cubic open bosonic string field theory. TheSen conjectures on tachyon condensation in open bosonic string field theory areintroduced, and evidence confirming these conjectures is reviewed.
