Title: Negative Flows of the KP-Hierarchy

Authors: G. Haak

Comments: 22 pages (LaTeX), Report KITCS94-2-1

We construct a Grassmannian-like formulation for the potential KP-hierarchyincluding additional ``negative'' flows. Our approach will generalize thenotion of a tau-function to include negative flows. We compare the resultinghierarchy with results by Hirota, Satsuma and Bogoyavlenskii.
