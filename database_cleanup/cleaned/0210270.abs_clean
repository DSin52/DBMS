String TheoryAuthors: M. Laidlaw

We use the boundary state formalism for the bosonic string to calculate theemission amplitude for closed string states from particular D-branes. We showthat the amplitudes obtained are exactly the same as those obtained from theworld-sheet sigma model calculation, and that the construction enforces therequirement for integrated vertex operators, even in the off-shell case. Usingthe expressions obtained for the boundary state we propose higher order termsin the string loop expansion for the background considered.
