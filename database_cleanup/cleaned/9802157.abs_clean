In the possible scaling region for lattice chiral fermions advocated inhep-lat/9609037, no hard spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs anddoublers are gauge-invariantly decoupled via mixing with compositethree-fermion-states. However the strong coupling expansion breaks down due tono ``static limit'' for the low-energy limit ($p\sim 0$). We further analyzerelevant Green functions of three-fermion-operators. It is shown that in thelow-energy limit, the propagators of three-fermion-states with the ``wrong''chiralities positively vanish due to the generalized form factors (thewave-function renormalizations) of these composite states vanishing as$O(p^4)$. This strongly implies that three-fermion-states with ``wrong''chirality are ``decoupled'' in this limit.
