We provide a non-renormalization theorem for the coefficients of theconformal anomaly associated with operators with vanishing anomalousdimensions. Such operators include conserved currents and chiral operators insuperconformal field theories. We illustrate the theorem by computing theconformal anomaly of 2-point functions both by a computation in the conformalfield theory and via the adS/CFT correspondence. Our results imply that 2- and3-point functions of chiral primary operators in N=4 SU(N) SYM will notrenormalize provided that a ``generalized Adler-Bardeen theorem'' holds. Wefurther show that recent arguments connecting the non-renormalizability of theabove mentioned correlation functions to a bonus U(1)_Y symmetry are incompletedue to possible U(1)_Y violating contact terms. The tree level contribution tothe contact terms may be set to zero by considering appropriately normalizedoperators. Non-renormalizability of the above mentioned correlation functions,however, will follow only if these contact terms saturate by free fields.
