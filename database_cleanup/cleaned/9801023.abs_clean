The partition function in Matrix theory is constructed by Euclidean pathintegral method. The D0-branes, which move around in the finite region with atypical size of Schwarzschild radius, are chosen as the background. The massand entropy of the system obtained from the partition function contain theparameters of the background. After averaging the mass and entropy over theparameters, we find that they match the properties of 11D Schwarzschild blackholes. The period $\b$ of Euclidean time can be identified with the reciprocalof the boosted Hawking temperature. The entropy $S$ is shown to be proportionalto the number $N$ of Matrix theory partons, which is a consequence of theD0-brane background.
