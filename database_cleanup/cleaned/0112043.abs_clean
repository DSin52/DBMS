Journal-ref: Nucl.Phys.Proc.Suppl. 108 (2002) 99-105

In this lecture I will review some results about the discrete light-conequantization (DLCQ) of strings and some connections of the results with matrixstring theory. I will review arguments which show that, in the path integralrepresentation of the thermal free energy of a string, the compactificationswhich are necessary to obtain discrete light-cone quantization constrains theintegral over all Riemann surfaces of a given genus to the set of those Riemannsurfaces which are branched covers of a particular torus. I then review anexplicit check of this result at genus 1. I discuss the intriguing suggestionthat these branched covers of a torus are related to those which are found in acertain limit of the matrix string model
