Title: Compactifications of the N=2^* flow

Authors: Alex Buchel

Comments: 17 pages

In hep-th/0004063 Pilch and Warner (PW) constructed N=2 supersymmetric RGflow corresponding to the mass deformation of the N=4 SU(N) Yang-Mills theory.In this paper we present exact deformations of PW flow when the gauge theory3-space is compactified on S^3. We consider also the case with the gauge theoryworld-volume being dS_4 instead of R^{3,1}. The solution is constructed infive-dimensional gauged supergravity and is further uplifted to 10d.
