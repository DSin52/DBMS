Title: The Classification of SU(m)_{k} Automorphism Invariants

Authors: Terry Gannon

Comments: 8 pp. (plain tex)

In this paper we find all permutations of the level k weights of the affinealgebra A_r^{(1)} which commute with both its S and T modular matrices. We findthat all of these are simple current automorphisms and their conjugations.Previously, the A_{r,k}^{(1)} automorphism invariants were known only for r=1,2\forall k, and k=1 \forall r. This is a major step toward the fullclassification of all A_{r,k}^{(1)} modular invariants; the simplicity of thisproof strongly suggests that the full classification should be accomplishable.In an appendix we collect some new results concerning the A_{r,k}^{(1)} fusionring.
