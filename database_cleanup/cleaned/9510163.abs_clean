Title: Construction of trigonometric Toda $r$-matrices via Hamiltonian

reduction of the cotangent bundle over loop groupsAuthors: G.E.Arutyunov

Comments: 10 pages, LATEX

By applying the Hamiltonian reduction method to the cotangent bundle overloop groups we recover the well-known classical trigonometric $r$-matrices ofthe periodic Toda lattice.
