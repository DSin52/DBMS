Title: The One Dimensional Matrix Model and String Theory

Authors: Sumit R. Das

Comments: (Based on lectures delivered at the Spring School on Superstrings at

ICTP, Trieste, April, 1992.) 40 pages. Preprint TIFR-TH-92/67We discuss the basic features of the double scaling limit of the onedimensional matrix model and its interpretation as a two dimensional stringtheory. Using the collective field theory formulation of the model we show howthe fluctuations of the collective field can be interpreted as the massless"tachyon" of the two dimensional string in a linear dilaton background. Weoutline the basic physical properties of the theory and discuss the nature ofthe S-matrix. Finally we show that the theory admits of another interpretationin which a certain integral transform of the collective field behaves as themassless "tachyon" in the two dimensional string with a blackhole background.We show that both the classical background and the fluctuations arenon-singular at the black hole singularity.
