We present a perturbative study of Ramond-Ramond backgrounds in the NSRformalism. We show how to perform sigma-model computations and discuss indetail the structure of the BRST charge and picture-changing operators. Contactterms play a vital role in the analysis. We also give evidence for a two loopnon-renormalization theorem for the background beta functions.
