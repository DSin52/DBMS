We show that any generally covariant coupling of matter fields to gravitygives rise to a conserved, on-shell symmetric energy-momentum tensor equivalentto the canonical energy-momentum tensor of the flat-space theory. For matterfields minimally coupled to gravity our algorithm gives the conventionalBelinfante tensor. We establish that different matter-gravity couplings givemetric energy-momentum tensors differing by identically conserved tensors. Weprove that the metric energy-momentum tensor obtained from an arbitrary gravitytheory is on-shell equivalent to the canonical energy-momentum tensor of theflat-space theory.
