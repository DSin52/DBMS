It is shown that the non-relativistic `Dirac' equation of L\'evy-Leblond, weused recently to describe a spin $1/2$ field interacting non-relativisticallywith a Chern-Simons gauge field, can be obtained by lightlike reduction from$3+1$ dimensions. This allows us to prove that the system is Schr\"odingersymmetric. A spinor representation of the Schr\"odinger group is presented.Static, self-dual solutions, describing spinor vortices are given and shown tobe the non-relativistic limits of the fermionic vortices found by Cho et al.The construction is extended to external harmonic and uniform magnetic fields.
