We study geodesically complete, singularity free space-times induced bysupersymmetric planar domain walls interpolating between Minkowski and anti-deSitter ($AdS_4$) vacua. A geodesically complete space-time without closedtime-like curves includes an infinite number of semi-infinite Minkowskispace-times, separated from each other by a region of $AdS_4$ space-time. Thesespace-times are closely related to the extreme Reissner Nordstr\" om (RN) blackhole, exhibiting Cauchy horizons with zero Hawking temperature, but in contrastto the RN black hole there is no entropy. Another geodesically completeextension with closed time-like curves involves space-times connecting a finitenumber of semi-infinite Minkowski space-times.
