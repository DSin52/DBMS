By an extension of the methods used for the reduction of the two body problemin 2+1 dimensional gravity, we show that the two body problem in N=2 ChernSimons supergravity can be reduced exactly to an equivalent on body formalism.We give exact expressions for the invariants of the reduced one body problem.
