Dynamical systems whose symplectic structure degenerates, becomingnoninvertible at some points along the orbits are analyzed. It is shown thatfor systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom, like in classicalmechanics, the degeneracy occurs on domain walls that divide phase space intononoverlapping regions each one describing a nondegenerate system, causallydisconnected from each other. These surfaces are characterized by the sign ofthe Liouville's flux density on them, behaving as sources or sinks of orbits.In this latter case, once the system reaches the domain wall, it acquires a newgauge invariance and one degree of freedom is dynamically frozen, while theremaining degrees of freedom evolve regularly thereafter.
