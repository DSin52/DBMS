We show that introducing a periodic time coordinate in the models ofPenner-Kontsevich type generalizes the corresponding constructions to the caseof the moduli space ${\cal S}_{gn}^k$ of curves $C$ with homology chains$\gamma\in H_1(C,\zet_k)$. We make a minimal extension of the resulting modelsby adding a kinetic term, and we get a new matrix model which realizes a simpledynamics of $\zet_k$-chains on surfaces. This gives a representation of $c=1$matter coupled to two-dimensional quantum gravity with the target space being acircle of finite radius, as studied by Gross and Klebanov.
