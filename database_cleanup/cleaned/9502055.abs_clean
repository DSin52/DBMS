Title: On the number of periodic classical trajectories in a Hamiltonian

dynamical systemComments: Standard Latex - run twice

Periodic classical trajectories are of fundamental importance both in classicaland quantum physics. Here we develop path integral techniques to investigatesuch trajectories in an arbitrary, not necessarily energy conservinghamiltonian system. In particular, we present a simple derivation of a lowerbound for the number of periodic classical trajectories.
