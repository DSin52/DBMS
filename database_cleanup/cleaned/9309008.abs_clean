The $d = 2$ string admits a black hole solution and also a singular solutionwhen tachyon back reaction is included. It is of importance to know if theformer solution can evolve into a later one. An explicit solution describingthis process is difficult to obtain. We present here a scenario in which suchan evolution is very likely to occur. In essence, it takes place when aderivative discontinuity is seeded in the dilaton field by an incident tachyonpulse. An application of this scenario to $1 + 1$ dimensional toy modelssuggests that a black hole can evolve into a massive remnant, strengthening itscandidacy for the end state of a black hole.
