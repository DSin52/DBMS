We find new closed string couplings on Dp-branes for the bosonic string.These couplings are quadratic in derivatives and therefore take the form ofinduced kinetic terms on the brane. For the graviton in particular we find theinduced Einstein-Hilbert term as well as terms quadratic in the secondfundamental tensor. We comment on tachyon dependences of these brane-localizedcouplings.
