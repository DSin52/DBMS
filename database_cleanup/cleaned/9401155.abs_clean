We discuss the canonical quantization of $N=1$ supergravity in the functionalSchrodinger representation. Although the form of the supersymmetry constraintssuggests that there are solutions of definite order $n$ in the fermion fields,we show that there are no such states for any finite $n$. For $n=0$, a simplescaling argument definitively excludes the purely bosonic states discussed byD'Eath. For $n>0$, the argument is based on a mode expansion of the gravitinofield on the quantization 3-surface. It is thus suggested that physical statesin supergravity have infinite Grassmann number. This is confirmed for the freespin-3/2 field, for which we find that states satisfying the gauge constraintscontain an infinite product of fermion mode operators.
