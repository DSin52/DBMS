Title: On the Aharonov-Anandan Experiment

Authors: Carlo Rovelli

Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX, preprint pitt-gr-3-93

An experiment that would measure non--commuting quantum mechanicalobservables without collapsing the wave function has been recently proposed byY Aharonov and J Anandan. These authors argue that this "protected measurement"may give indication on "the reality of the wave function". We argue that,depending of the precise version of the experiment considered, either theauthor's prediction is incorrect and the wave function does collapse, or themeasurement is not a measurement on a quantum system. In either case, theexperiment does not provide a way for measuring non--commuting observableswithout collapse, and it does not bear on the issue of the "reality of the wavefunction".
