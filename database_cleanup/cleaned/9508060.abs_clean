Two dimensional quantum R$^2$-gravity is formulated in the semiclassicalmethod. The thermodynamic properties,such as the equation of state, thetemperature and the entropy, are explained. The topology constraint and thearea constraint are properly taken into account. A total derivative term and aninfrared regularization play important roles. The classical solutions (vacua)of R$^2$-Liouville equation are obtained by making use of the well-knownsolution of the ordinary Liouville equation. The positive and negative constantcurvature solutions are 'dual' each other. Each solution has twobranches($\pm$). We characterize all phases. The topology of a sphere is mainlyconsidered.
