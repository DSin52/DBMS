We consider $N=1$ supersymmetric Toda theories which admit a fermionicuntwisted affine extension, i.e. the systems based on the $A(n,n)$, $D(n+1,n)$and $B(n,n)$ superalgebras. We construct the superspace Miura trasformationswhich allow to determine the W-supercurrents of the conformal theories and wecompute their renormalized expressions. The analysis of the renormalization andconservation of higher-spin currents is then performed for the correspondingsupersymmetric massive theories. We establish the quantum integrability ofthese models and show that although their Lagrangian is not hermitian, themasses of the fundamental particles are real, a property which is maintained byone-loop corrections. The spectrum is actually much richer, since the theoriesadmit solitons. The existence of quantum conserved higher-spin charges impliesthat elastic, factorized S-matrices can be constructed.
