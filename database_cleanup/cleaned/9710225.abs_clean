In Causal Perturbation Theory the process of renormalization is preciselyequivalent to the extension of time ordered distributions to coincident points.This is achieved by a modified Taylor subtraction on the corresponding testfunctions. I show that the pullback of this operation to the distributionsyields expressions known from Differential Renormalization. The subtraction isequivalent to BPHZ subtraction in momentum space. Some examples from Euclideanscalar field theory in flat and curved spacetime will be presented.
