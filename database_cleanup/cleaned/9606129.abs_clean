Proceedings of the QCD 96 workshop (March, Minnesota)Two-dimensional QED with $N$ flavor fermions is solved at zero and finitetemperature with arbitrary fermion masses to explore QCD physics such as chiralcondensate and string tension. The problem is reduced to solving aSchr\"odinger equation for $N$ degrees of freedom with a specific potentialdetermined by the ground state of the Schr\"odinger problem itself.
