By quantizing the generalized Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction scheme for arbitrary$sl_2$ embeddings we show that a large set $\cal W$ of quantum W algebras canbe viewed as (BRST) cohomologies of affine Lie algebras. The set $\cal W$contains many known $W$ algebras such as $W_N$ and $W_3^{(2)}$. Our formalismyields a completely algorithmic method for calculating the W algebra generatorsand their operator product expansions, replacing the cumbersome construction ofW algebras as commutants of screening operators. By generalizing and quantizingthe Miura transformation we show that any $W$ algebra in $\cal W$ can beembedded into the universal enveloping algebra of a semisimple affine Liealgebra which is, up to shifts in level, isomorphic to a subalgebra of theoriginal affine algebra. Therefore {\em any} realization of this semisimpleaffine Lie algebra leads to a realization of the $W$ algebra. In particular,one obtains in this way a general and explicit method for constructing the freefield realizations and Fock resolutions for all algebras in $\cal W$. Someexamples are explicitly worked out.
