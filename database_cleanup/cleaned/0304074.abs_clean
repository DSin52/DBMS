In conventional gauge theory, a charged point particle is described by arepresentation of the gauge group. If we propagate the particle along somepath, the parallel transport of the gauge connection acts on thisrepresentation. The Lagrangian density of the gauge field depends on thecurvature of the connection which can be calculated from the holonomy around(infinitesimal) loops. For Abelian symmetry groups, say G=U(1), there exists ageneralization, known as p-form electrodynamics, in which (p-1)-dimensionalcharged objects can be propagated along p-surfaces and in which the Lagrangiandepends on a generalized curvature associated with (infinitesimal) closedp-surfaces. In this article, we use Lie 2-groups and ideas from higher categorytheory in order to formulate a discrete gauge theory which generalizes thesemodels at the level p=2 to possibly non-Abelian symmetry groups. An importantfeature of our model is that it involves both parallel transports along pathsand generalized transports along surfaces with a non-trivial interplay of thesetwo types of variables. Our main result is the geometric picture, namely theassignment of non-Abelian quantities to geometrical objects in a coordinatefree way. We construct the precise assignment of variables to the curves andsurfaces, the generalized local symmetries and gauge invariant actions and weclarify which structures can be non-Abelian and which others are alwaysAbelian. A discrete version of connections on non-Abelian gerbes is a specialcase of our construction. Even though the motivation sketched so far suggestsapplications mainly in string theory, the model presented here is also relatedto spin foam models of quantum gravity and may in addition provide some insightinto the role of centre monopoles and vortices in lattice QCD.
