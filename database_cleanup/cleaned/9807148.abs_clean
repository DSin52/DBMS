The wave function of the universe is usually taken to be a functional of thethree-metric on a spacelike section, Sigma, which is measured. It is sometimesbetter, however, to work in the conjugate representation, where the wavefunction depends on a quantity related to the second fundamental form of Sigma.This makes it possible to ensure that Sigma is part of a Lorentzian universe byrequiring that the argument of the wave function be purely imaginary. Wedemonstrate the advantages of this formalism first in the well-known examplesof the nucleation of a de Sitter or a Nariai universe. We then use it tocalculate the pair creation rate for sub-maximal black holes in de Sitterspace, which had been thought to vanish semi-classically.
