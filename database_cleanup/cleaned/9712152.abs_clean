Ahrenshoop Symposium on the Theory of Elementary Particles, 2-6 September1997, in Buckow, Germany, and the String Workshop, 14-15 November 1997, inWittenberg, Germany)Some exact solutions to the hypermultiplet low-energy effective action in N=2supersymmetric four-dimensional gauge field theories with massive `quark'hypermultiplets are discussed. The need for a spontaneous N=2 supersymmetrybreaking is emphasized, because of its possible relevance in the search for anultimate theoretical solution to the confinement problem.
