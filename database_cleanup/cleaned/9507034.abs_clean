We develop the concept of trajectories in anyon spectra, i.e., the continuousdependence of energy levels on the kinetic angular momentum. It provides a moreeconomical and unified description, since each trajectory contains an infinitenumber of points corresponding to the same statistics. For a system ofnon-interacting anyons in a harmonic potential, each trajectory consists of twoinfinite straight line segments, in general connected by a nonlinear piece. Wegive the systematics of the three-anyon trajectories. The trajectories ingeneral cross each other at the bosonic/fermionic points. We use the(semi-empirical) rule that all such crossings are true crossings, i.e.\ theorder of the trajectories with respect to energy is opposite to the left and tothe right of a crossing.
