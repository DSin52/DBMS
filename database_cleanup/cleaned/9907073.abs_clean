A field theoretical framework for the recently proposed photon condensationeffect in a nonlinear Fabry-Perot cavity is discussed. The dynamics of thephoton gas turns out to be described by an effective 2D Hamiltonian of acomplex massive scalar field. Finite size effects are shown to be relevant forthe existence of the photon condensate.
