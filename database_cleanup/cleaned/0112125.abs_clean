in Nonlinear Mathematical Physics'' (9-15 July, 2001, Kyiv), Editors A. G.Nikitin, V. M. Boyko and R. O. Popovych, Kyiv, Inst. of Mathematics, 2002,V.43, Part 2, pp. 508--519After a short discussion of the intimate relation between the generalizedstatistics and supersymmetry, we review the recent results on the nonlinearsupersymmetry obtained in the context of the quantum anomaly problem and of theuniversal algebraic construction associated with the holomorphic nonlinearsupersymmetry.
