This work describes the formulation of the manifestly ghost-free (spacetime)light-cone gauge for bosonic string theory with non-trivial spacetime metric,antisymmetric tensor, dilaton and tachyon fields. The action is a generaltwo-dimensional sigma model, corresponding to a closed string theory with asecond order action in the Polyakov picture. The spacetime fields must have asymmetry generated by a null, covariantly constant spacetime vector in orderfor the light-cone gauge to be accessible. Also, the theory must be Weylinvariant. The conditions for Weyl invariance are computed within thelight-cone gauge, reproducing the usual beta functions. The calculation of thedilaton beta function and the critical dimension is somewhat novel in thisghost-free theory. Some exactly solvable light-cone theories are discussed.
