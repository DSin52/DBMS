A generalization of the pseudoclassical action of a spinning particle in thepresence of an anomalous magnetic moment is given. The leading considerations,to write the action, are gotten from the path integral representation for thecausal Green's function of the generalized (by Pauli) Dirac equation for theparticle with anomalous magnetic momentum in an external electromagnetic field.The action can be written in reparametrization and supergauge invariant form.Both operator (Dirac) and path-integral (BFV) quantization are discussed. Thefirst one leads to the Dirac-Pauli equation, whereas the second one gives thecorresponding propagator. One of the nontrivial points in this case is thatboth quantizations schemes demand for consistency to take into account anoperators ordering problem.
