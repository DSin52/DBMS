In recent work Kachru, Kumar and Silverstein introduced a special class ofnon-supersymmetric type II string theories in which the cosmological constantvanishes at the first two orders of perturbation theory. Heuristic argumentssuggest the cosmological constant may vanish in these theories to all orders inperturbation theory leading to a flat potential for the dilaton. A slightvariant of their model can be described in terms of a dual heterotic theory.The dual theory has a non-zero cosmological constant which is non-perturbativein the coupling of the original type II theory. The dual theory also predicts amismatch between Bose and Fermi degrees of freedom in the non-perturbativeD-brane spectrum of the type II theory.
