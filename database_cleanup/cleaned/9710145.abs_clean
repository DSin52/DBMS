The Wilsonian exact renormalization group gives a natural framework in whichultraviolet and infrared divergences can be treated separately. In massless QEDwe introduce, as the only mass parameter, a renormalization scale $\L_R > 0$.We prove, using the flow equation technique, that infrared convergence is anecessary consequence of any zero-momentum renormalization condition at $\L_R$compatible with the effective Ward identities and axial symmetry. The sameformalism is applied to renormalize gauge-invariant composite operators and toprove their infrared finiteness; in particular we consider the case of theaxial current operator and its anomaly.
