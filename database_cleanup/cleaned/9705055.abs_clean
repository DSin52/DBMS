We consider compactifications of the matrix model of M-theory on$S^1/Z_2\times T^d$ for $d>0$, and interpret them as orbifolds of thesupersymmetric U(N) Yang-Mills theory on $R\times T^{d+1}$. The orbifoldgroup acts both on the gauge group and on the $T^{d+1}$, reduces the gaugegroup to O(N) over 1+1 dimensional fixed-point submanifolds, and breakshalf of the supersymmetry. We clarify some puzzling aspects of the gaugeanomaly cancellation in the presence of space-time Wilson lines; in general,the Yang-Mills theory requires certain Chern-Simons couplings to supergravitybackground fields. We discuss the possibility that D8-branes are present ascertain matrix configurations in the Yang-Mills theory, and the fundamentalfermions emerge as zero modes. Finally, we point out that the correspondencebetween matrix theory and string theory suggests the existence of a multitudeof non-trivial RG fixed points and dualities in orbifold Yang-Mills theorieswith eight supercharges in various dimensions.
