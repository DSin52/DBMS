The Liouville action for two--dimensional quantum gravity coupled tointeracting matter contains terms that have not been considered previously.They are crucial for understanding the renormalization group flow and can beobserved in recent matrix model results for the phase diagram of theSine--Gordon model coupled to gravity. These terms insure, order by order inthe coupling constant, that the dressed interaction is exactly marginal. Theyare discussed up to second order.
