In this paper we lay the foundations of causal quantum gravity (CQG), i.e. ofa quantum theory of self-interacting symmetric massless rank-2 tensor gaugefields, the gravitons, on flat space-time, in the framework of causalperturbation theory. The causal inductive construction of the S-matrix forquantum gravity leads to a very satisfactory treatment of the ultravioletproblem. Here we concentrate on some main fundamental issues that concern thegraviton field, the role of the fermionic ghost vector fields in preservingperturbative gauge invariance, the construction of the Fock space for thegraviton and the consequent characterization of the subspace for the physicalgraviton states. This last point is necessary, together with perturbative gaugeinvariance, in order to prove unitary of the S-matrix restricted to thephysical subspace.
