We study the holographic dual of asymmetrically warped space-times, which areasymptotically AdS. The self-tuning of the cosmological constant isreinterpreted as a cancellation of the visible sector stress-energy tensor bythe contribution of a hidden CFT, charged under a spontaneously broken globalsymmetry. The apparent violation of 4D causality due to bulk geodesics isjustified by considering that the CFT feels the background metric as smearedout over a length of the order of the AdS radius.
