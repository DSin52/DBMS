fluid states in the matrix modelsAuthors: Yi-Xin Chen

We investigate the condensate mechanism of the low-lying excitations in thematrix models of 4-dimensional quantum Hall fluids recently proposed by us. Itis shown that there exist some hierarchies of 4-dimensional quantum Hall fluidstates in the matrix models, and they are similar to the Haldane's hierarchy inthe 2-dimensional quantum Hall fluids. However, these hierarchical fluid statesappear consistently in our matrix models without any requirement ofmodifications of the matrix models.
