We study the generalization of noncommutative gauge theories to the case oforthogonal and symplectic groups. We find out that this is possible, since weare allowed to define orthogonal and symplectic subgroups of noncommutativeunitary gauge transformations even though the gauge potentials and gaugetransformations are not valued in the orthogonal and symplectic subalgebras ofthe Lie algebra of antihermitean matrices. Our construction relies on anantiautomorphism of the basic noncommutative algebra of functions whichgeneralizes the charge conjugation operator of ordinary field theory. We showthat the corresponding noncommutative picture from low energy string theory isobtained via orientifold projection in the presence of a non-trivial NSNSB-field.
