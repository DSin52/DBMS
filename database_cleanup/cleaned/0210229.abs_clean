We study the spectrum of solvable string models on plane waves descendingfrom non-conformal Dp-brane geometries. We mainly focus on S-dual F1/D1-wavesin type IIB and type I/heterotic 10D superstrings. We derive the Kaluza-Kleinspectrum of N=1,2 10D supergravities on D1/F1-waves. We compute helicitysupertraces counting multiplicities and R-charges of string excitations in theplane wave geometry. The results are compared against the expectations comingfrom gauge/supergravity descriptions. In the type I case, the Klein, Annulusand Moebius one-loop amplitudes are computed for ten-dimensional D1-waves. Wetest the consistency of the open string descendant by showing that aftermodular transformations to the closed string channel, the three amplitudescombine themselves to reconstruct a complete square (|B>+|C>)^2. Tadpoleconditions are also discussed.
