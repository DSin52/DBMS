This paper explores a recent idea of Nambu to generate hierarchies amongYukawa couplings in the context of effective supergravity and superstringsmodels. The Yukawa couplings are homogeneous functions of the moduli and ageometrical constraint between them with a crucial role in the Nambu mechanismis found in a class of models of no-scale type. The Yukawas are dynamicalvariables at low energy to be determined by a minimization process. (Based onthe talk given at ICHEP94, Glasgow, july 1994)
