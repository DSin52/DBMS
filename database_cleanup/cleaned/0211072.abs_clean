We treat general relativity as an effective field theory, obtaining the fullnonanalytic component of the scattering matrix potential to one-loop order. Thelowest order vertex rules for the resulting effective field theory arepresented and the one-loop diagrams which yield the leading nonrelativisticpost-Newtonian and quantum corrections to the gravitational scatteringamplitude to second order in G are calculated in detail. The Fouriertransformed amplitudes yield a nonrelativistic potential and our result isdiscussed in relation to previous calculations. The definition of a potentialis discussed as well and we show how the ambiguity of the potential undercoordinate changes is resolved.
