The chiral symmetry breaking in the 4-dimensional QED with the chirallyinvariant four-fermion interaction is discussed by using a novel path integralexpression in terms of the field-strength tensor. In the local potentialapproximation, we find that the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken for anynonzero gauge and four-fermion couplings on the tree level of an auxiliaryfield $\sigma$. The present approach allows us to easily include higher ordersof the gauge coupling so that the effective potential up to the sixth order isobtained.
