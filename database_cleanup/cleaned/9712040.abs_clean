In this paper we obtain both the vector and scalar equations of motion of anM-fivebrane in the presence of threebrane solitons. The resulting equations ofmotion are precisely those obtained from the Seiberg-Witten low energyeffective action for N=2 Yang-Mills, including all quantum corrections. Thisanalysis extends the work of a previous paper which derived the scalarequations of motion but not in detail the vector equations. We also discusssome features of an infinite number of higher derivative terms predicted by Mtheory.
