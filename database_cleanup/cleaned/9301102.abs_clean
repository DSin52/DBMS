We study four dimensional systems of global, axionic and local strings. Byusing the path integral formalism, we derive the dual formulation of thesesystems, where Goldstone bosons, axions and missive vector bosons are describedby antisymmetric tensor fields, and strings appear as a source for these tensorfields. We show also how magnetic monopoles attached to local strings aredescribed in the dual formulation. We conclude with some remarks.
