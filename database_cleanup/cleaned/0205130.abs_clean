Title: Renormalization in quantum Brans-Dicke gravity

Authors: Z. Haba (University of Wroclaw)

Comments: Latex, 9 pages

In the Brans-Dicke model we treat the scalar field exactly and expand thegravitational field in a power series. A comparison with 2D sigma models and\phi^{4} perturbation theory in four dimensions suggests that the perturbationseries in 4D Brans-Dicke model is renormalizable.
