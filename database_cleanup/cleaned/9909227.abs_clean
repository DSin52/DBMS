Comments: 115 pages, PhD-thesis defended at the University of Amsterdam,

september 1999. Hardcopies available via the authorThis PhD-thesis reviews matrix string theory and recent developments therein.Emphasis is put on symmetries, interactions and scattering processes in thematrix model. We start with an introduction to matrix string theory and areview of the orbifold model that flows out of matrix string theory in thestrong YM coupling limit. Then we turn our attention to the appearance ofU-duality symmetry in gauge models, after a (very) short summary of stringduality, D-branes and M-theory. The last chapter reviews matrix stringinteractions and scattering processes in the high energy limit. Also, pairproduction of D-particles is studied in detail. D-pair production is expectedto give important corrections to high energy scattering processes in stringtheory.
