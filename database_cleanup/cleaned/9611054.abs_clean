NATO ASI B349, ed A.-C. Davis, R. Brandenberger, pp 303-348(Plenum, New York, 1995)The supporting worldsheet of a string, membrane, or other higher dimensionalbrane, is analysed in terms of its first, second, and third fundamentaltensors, and its inner and outer curvature tensors. The dynamical equationsgoverning the models appropriate for phenomena such as (superconducting) cosmicstrings and cosmic domain walls are developed in a general framework (allowingfor both electromagnetic and Kalb Ramond background coupling). It is shown howthe surface stress momentum energy density tensor determines the propagationcharacteristics of small ``wiggle" perturbations of the worldsheet. Attentionis then focussed on special features of strings (using the transonic model withtension T inversely proportional to the energy density U as a particularlyimportant example). A quadratic Hamilton-Jacobi formulation is shown to governequilibium states and other conservative string configurations sharing asymmetry of the (gravitational, electromagnetic, and Kalb-Ramond) background,including stable ring states that may be cosmologically important.
