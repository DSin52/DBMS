This is a short nontechnical note summarizing the motivation and results ofmy recent work on D-brane categories. I also give a brief outline of how thisframework can be applied to study the dynamics of topological D-branes and whythis has a bearing on the homological mirror symmetry conjecture. This note canbe read without any knowledge of category theory.
