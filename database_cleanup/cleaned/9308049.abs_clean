We discuss quantum deformation of the affine transformation group and its Liealgebra. It is shown that the quantum algebra has a non-cocommutative Hopfalgebra structure, simple realizations and quantum tensor operators. Thedeformation of the group is achieved by using the adjoint representation. Theelements of quantum matrix form a Hopf algebra. Furthermore, we construct adifferential calculus which is covariant with respect to the action of thequantum matrix.
