We investigate hidden symmetries of P,T-invariant system of topologicallymassive U(1) gauge fields. For this purpose, we propose a pseudoclassical modelgiving rise to this field system at the quantum level. The model contains aparameter, which displays a quantization property at the classical and thequantum levels and demonstrates a nontrivial relationship between continuousand discrete symmetries. Analyzing the integrals of motion of thepseudoclassical model, we identify U(1,1) symmetry and S(2,1) supersymmetry ashidden symmetries of the corresponding quantum system. Representing the hiddensymmetries in a covariant form, we show that one-particle states realize anirreducible representation of a non-standard super-extension of the(2+1)-dimensional Poincare group labelled by the zero eigenvalue of thesuperspin.
