We study the confining phase structure on {\cal N}=1 supersymmetric SO(12)gauge theory with N_f \le 7 vectors and one spinor. The explicit form of lowenergy superpotentials for N_f \le 7 are derived after gauge invariantoperators relevant in the effective theory are identified via gauge symmetrybreaking pattern. The resulting confining phase structure is analogous to N_f\le N_c+1 SUSY QCD. Finally, we conclude with some comments on the search forduals to N_f \ge 8 SO(12) theory.
