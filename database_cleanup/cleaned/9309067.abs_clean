The loop representation of quantum gravity has many formal resemblances to abackground-free string theory. In fact, its origins lie in attempts to treatthe string theory of hadrons as an approximation to QCD, in which the stringsrepresent flux tubes of the gauge field. A heuristic path-integral approachindicates a duality between background-free string theories and generallycovariant gauge theories, with the loop transform relating the two. We reviewtheory (which, while not generally covariant, has symmetry under allarea-preserving transformations), 3d quantum gravity, and 4d quantum gravity.$SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory in 2 dimensions has been given a string-theoreticinterpretation in the large-$N$ limit by Gross, Taylor, Minahan andPolychronakos, but here we provide an exact string-theoretic interpretation ofthe theory on $\R\times S^1$ for finite $N$. The string-theoreticinterpretation of quantum gravity in 3 dimensions gives rise to conjecturesabout integrals on the moduli space of flat connections, while in 4 dimensionsthere may be connections to the theory of 2-tangles.
