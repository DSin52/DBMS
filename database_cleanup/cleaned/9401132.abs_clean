A consistent procedure of canonical quantization of pseudoclassical model forspin one relativistic particle is considered. Two approaches to treat thequantization for the massless case are discussed, the limit of the massive caseand independent quantization of a modified action. Quantum mechanicsconstructed for the massive case proves to be equivalent to the Proca theoryand for massless case to the Maxwell theory. Results obtained are compared withones for the case of spinning (spin one half) particle.
