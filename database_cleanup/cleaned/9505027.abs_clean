In this paper we discuss topological BF theories in 3 and 4 dimensions.Observables are associated to ordinary knots and links (in 3 dimensions) and to2-knots (in 4 dimensions). The vacuum expectation values of such observablesgive a wide range of invariants. Here we consider mainly the 3-dimensionalcase, where these invariants include Alexander polynomials, HOMFLY polynomialsand Kontsevich integrals.
