Title: A Two Fluid Description of the Quantum Hall Soliton

Authors: Ben Freivogel, Leonard Susskind and Nicolaos Toumbas

Comments: 28 pages, 2 figures

We show that the Quantum Hall Soliton constructed in \cite{giantbob} isstable under small perturbations. We find that creating quasiparticles actuallylowers the energy of the system, and discuss whether this indicates aninstability on the time scales relevant to the problem.
