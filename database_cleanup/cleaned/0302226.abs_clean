We analyse the moduli spaces of superconformal field theories (SCFTs). ForN=2 we find an enhanced moduli space which in geometrical terms corresponds totori with two independent complex structures. To explain the precise relationwith the moduli space of SCFTs on K3 surfaces as described by Aspinwall andMorrison, we discuss some subtleties with the precise interpretation of the N=2and N=4 moduli spaces. We also explain why in some cases the SYZ-description ofmirror symmetry as fibrewise T-duality seems to break down.Using gluing matrices we give an algebraic description of D-branes andconstruct the corresponding boundary states. We study how isomorphisms of theSCFTs act on D-branes. Finally we give a geometrical interpretation of ouralgebraic constructions and make contact with the geometrical D-branecategories and Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry conjecture.
