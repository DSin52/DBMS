We consider evolution equations of the Lotka-Volterra type, and elucidateespecially their formulation as canonical Hamiltonian systems. The generalconditions under which these equations admit several conserved quantities(multi-Hamiltonians) are analysed. A special case, which is related to theLiouville model on a lattice, is considered in detail, both as aclassical andas aquantal system
