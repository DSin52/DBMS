Title: Codimension two lump solutions in string field theory and tachyonic

theoriesAuthors: Nicolas Moeller

Comments: 10 pages, 6 figures

We present some solutions for lumps in two dimensions in level-expandedstring field theory and pure $\phi^3$ theory. Much easier to handle, thesetheories might be used to help understanding solitonic features of string fieldtheory. We compare lump solutions between these theories and we discuss someconvergence issues.
