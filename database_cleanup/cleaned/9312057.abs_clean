Title: Difference equations with elliptic coefficients and quantum affine

algebrasComments: 27 pages, no figures

The purpose of this paper is to introduce and study a q-analogue of theholonomic system of differential equations associated to the Belavin'sclassical r-matrix (elliptic r-matrix equations), or, equivalently, to definean elliptic deformation of the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equationsof Frenkel and Reshetikhin. In hep-th 9303018, it was shown that solutions ofthe elliptic r-matrix equations admit a representation as traces of productsof intertwining operators between certain modules over affine sl(N). In thispaper, this construction is generalized to quantum affine sl(N).The main object of study in the paper is a family of meromorphic matrixfunctions of n complex variables z_1,...,z_n and three additional parametersp,q,s -- (modified) traces of products of intertwiners between modules overquantum affine sl(N). They are a new class of transcendental functions whichcan be degenerated into many interesting special functions -- hypergeometricand q-hypergeometric functions, elliptic and modular functions,transcendental functions of an elliptic curve, vector-valued modularforms, solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations etc.The main result of the paper states that these functions satisfy twoholonomic systems of difference equations -- the first one has shiftparameter p and elliptic modulus s, and the second one has shift parameters and elliptic modulus p.The paper also contains a short proof of the quantum KZ equations.
