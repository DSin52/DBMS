The moduli space of vacua for the confining phase of N=1 $SO(N_c)$supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions is analyzed by studying the Mtheory fivebrane. The type IIA brane configuration consists of a single NS5brane, multiple copies of NS'5 branes, D4 branes between them, and D6 branesintersecting D4 branes. We construct M theory fivebrane configurationcorresponding to the superpotential perturbation where the power of adjointfield is connected to the number of NS'5 branes. At a singular point in themoduli space where mutually local dyons become massless, the quadraticdegeneracy of the N=2 $SO(N_c)$ hyperelliptic curve determines whether thissingular point gives a N=1 vacua or not. The comparison of the meson vevs in Mtheory fivebrane configuration with field theory results turns out that theeffective superpotential by the integrating in method with enhanced gauge groupSU(2) is exact.
