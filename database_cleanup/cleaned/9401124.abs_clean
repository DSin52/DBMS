The topological sigma model with the semi-infinite cigar-like target space(black hole geometry) is considered. The model is shown to possess unsuppressedinstantons. The noncompactness of the moduli space of these instantons isresponsible for an unusual physics. There is a stable vacuum state in which thevacuum energy is zero, correlation functions are numbers thus the model is inthe topological phase. However, there are other vacuum states in whichcorrelation functions show the coordinate dependence. The estimation of thevacuum energy indicates that it is nonzero. These states are interpreted as theones with broken BRST-symmetry.
