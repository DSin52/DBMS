We find the discrete states of the c=1 string in the light-cone gauge ofPolyakov. When the state space of the gravitational sector of the theory istaken to be the irreducible representations of the SL(2,R) current algebra, thecohomology of the theory is NOT the same as that in the conformal gauge. Inparticular, states with ghost numbers up to 4 appear. However, after taking thespace of the theory to be the Fock space of the Wakimoto free-fieldrepresentation of the SL(2,R), the light-cone and conformal gauges areequivalent. This supports the contention that the discrete states of the theoryare physical. We point out that the natural states in the theory do not satisfythe KPZ constraints.
