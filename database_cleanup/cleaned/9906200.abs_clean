We study D-branes on the quintic CY by combining results from severalgeometry and mirror symmetry, and the boundary states in Gepner models recentlyconstructed by Recknagel and Schomerus, to begin sketching a picture ofD-branes in the stringy regime. We also make first steps towards computingsuperpotentials on the D-brane world-volumes.
