We investigate some properties of a recent supergravity solution of Pilch andWarner, which is dual to the N=4 gauge theory softly broken to N=2. We verifythat a D3-brane probe has the expected moduli space and its effective actioncan be brought to N=2 form. The kinetic term for the probe vanishes on anenhancon locus, as in earlier work on large-n N=2 theories, though for thePilch-Warner solution this locus is a line rather than a ring. On the gaugetheory side we find that the probe metric can be obtained from a perturbativeone-loop calculation; this principle may be useful in obtaining thesupergravity dual at more general points in the N=2 gauge theory moduli space.We then turn on a B-field, following earlier work on the N=4 theory, to obtainthe supergravity dual to the noncommutative N=2 theory.
