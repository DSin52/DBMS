The thermodynamic potential of ideal gases described by the simplestnon-abelian statistics is investigated. I show that the potential is the linearfunction of the element of the abelian-part statistics matrix. Thus, thefactorizable property in the Haldane (abelian) fractional exclusion shown bythe author [W. H. Huang, Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 2392 (1998)] is now extended tothe non-abelian case. The complete expansion of the thermodynamic potential isalso given.
