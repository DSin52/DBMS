We develop a new approach for bosonization based on the direct comparison ofcurrent correlation functions and apply it to the case of the Massive ThirringModel in three dimensions in the weak coupling regime, but with an arbitrarymass. Explicit bosonized forms for the lagrangian and the current are obtainedin terms of a vector gauge field. Exact results for the correspondingexpressions are also obtained in the case of a free massive fermion. Finally, acomment on the derivation of the current algebra directly from the bosonizedexpressions is included.
