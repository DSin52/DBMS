We show that the BV (Batalin Vilkovisky) action, formulated with an extendedBRST symmetry (including the shift symmetry), is also invariant under anextended anti-BRST transformation (where the antifields are the parameters ofthe transformation), when the gauge fixing Lagrangian is both BRST andanti-BRST invariant. We show that for a general gauge fixing Lagrangian, the BVaction can be written in a manifestly extended BRST invariant manner in asuperspace with one Grassmann coordinate whereas it can be expressed in amanifestly extended BRST and anti-BRST invariant manner in a superspace withtwo Grassmann coordinates when the gauge fixing Lagrangian is invariant underboth BRST and anti-BRST transformations.
