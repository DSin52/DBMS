We define multi-colour generalizations of braid-monoid algebras and presentexplicit matrix representations which are related to two-dimensional exactlysolvable lattice models of statistical mechanics. In particular, we show thatthe two-colour braid-monoid algebra describes the Yang-Baxter algebra of thecritical dilute A-D-E models which were recently introduced by Warnaar,Nienhuis, and Seaton as well as by Roche. These and other solvable modelsrelated to dense and dilute loop models are discussed in detail and it is shownthat the solvability is a direct consequence of the algebraic structure. It isconjectured that the Yang-Baxterization of general multi-colour braid-monoidalgebras will lead to the construction of further solvable lattice models.
