We study some aspects of Maldacena's large $N$ correspondence between N=4superconformal gauge theory on D3-brane and maximal supergravity on AdS_5xS_5by introducing macroscopic strings as heavy (anti)-quark probes. Themacroscopic strings are semi-infinite Type IIB strings ending on D3-braneworld-volume. We first study deformation and fluctuation of D3-brane when amacroscopic BPS string is attached. We find that both dynamics and boundaryconditions agree with those for macroscopic string in anti-de Sittersupergravity. As by-product we clarify how Polchinski's Dirichlet / Neumannopen string boundary conditions arise dynamically. We then study non-BPSmacroscopic string anti-string pair configuration as physical realization ofheavy quark Wilson loop. We obtain quark-antiquark static potential from thesupergravity side and find that the potential exhibits nonanalyticity ofsquare-root branch cut in `t Hooft coupling parameter. We put forward thenonanalyticity as prediction for large-N gauge theory at strong `t Hooftcoupling limit. By turning on Ramond-Ramond zero-form potential, we also studytheta-vacuum angle dependence of the static potential. We finally discusspossible dynamical realization of heavy N-prong string junction and of large-Nloop equation via local electric field and string recoil thereof. Throughoutcomparisons of the AdS-CFT correspondence, we find crucial role played by`geometric duality' between UV and IR scales on directions perpendicular toD3-brane and parallel ones, explaining how AdS5 spacetime geometry emerges outof four-dimensional gauge theory at strong coupling.
