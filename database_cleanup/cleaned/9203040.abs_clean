Solutions to both the diffeomorphism and the hamiltonian constraint ofquantum gravity have been found in the loop representation, which is based onAshtekar's new variables. While the diffeomorphism constraint is easily solvedby considering loop functionals which are knot invariants, there remains thepuzzle why several of the known knot invariants are also solutions to thehamiltonian constraint. We show how the Jones polynomial gives rise to aninfinite set of solutions to all the constraints of quantum gravity therebyilluminating the structure of the space of solutions and suggesting theexistance of a deep connection between quantum gravity and knot theory at adynamical level.
