We present an improved effective action for the D-brane-anti-D-brane systemobtained from boundary superstring field theory. Although the action lookshighly non-trivial, it has simple explicit multi-vortex (i.e. codimension-2multi-BPS D-brane) multi-anti-vortex solutions. The solutions have a curiousdegeneracy corresponding to different ``magnetic'' fluxes at the core of eachvortex. We also generalize the brane anti-brane effective action that issuitable for the study of the inflationary scenario and the production ofdefects in the early universe. We show that when a brane and anti-brane aredistantly separated, although the system is classically stable it can decay viaquantum tunneling through the barrier.
