The statics and dynamics of a surface separating two phases of a relativisticquantum field theory at or near the critical temperature typically make use ofa free energy as a functional of an order parameter. This free energyfunctional also affords an economical description of states away fromequilibrium. The similarities and differences between using a scalar field asthe order parameter versus the energy density are examined, and a peculiarityis noted. We also point out several conceptual errors in the literature dealingwith the dynamical prefactor in the nucleation rate.
