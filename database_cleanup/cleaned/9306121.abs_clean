We consider one dimensional lattice gauge theories constructed by the minimalcoupling prescription. It is shown that these theories are exactly solvable inthe thermodynamic limit. After considering the most general case, we discusssome special cases on finite lattices, and also work out some examples. Thereis no phase transition in these minimally coupled theories.
