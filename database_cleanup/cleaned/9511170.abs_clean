We consider slow motion of a pointlike topological defect (vortex) in thenonlinear Schrodinger equation minimally coupled to Chern-Simons gauge fieldand subject to external uniform magnetic field. It turns out that a formalexpansion of fields in powers of defect velocity yields only the trivial staticsolution. To obtain a nontrivial solution one has to treat velocities andaccelerations as being of the same order. We assume that acceleration is alinear form of velocity. The field equations linearized in velocity uniquelydetermine the linear relation. It turns out that the only nontrivial solutionis the cyclotron motion of the vortex together with the whole condensate. Thissolution is a perturbative approximation to the center of mass motion knownfrom the theory of magnetic translations.
