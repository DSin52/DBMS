Behavior of the Euclidean path integral at large orders of the perturbationseries is studied. When the model allows tunneling, the path-integralfunctional in the zero instanton sector is known to be dominated by bounce-likeconfigurations at large order of the perturbative series, which causesnon-convergence of the series. We find that in addition to this bounce theperturbative functional has a subleading peak at the instanton andanti-instanton pair, and its sum reproduces the non-perturbative valley.
