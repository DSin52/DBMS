In this letter we study (2+1)-dimensional QED. The first part contains thecomputation of the flavor symmetry-breaking condensate and its relation to thetrace of the energy-momentum tensor, while the second part is concerned withthe computation of the effective action allowing for non-constant staticexternal magnetic fields. We do not find that space derivatives in the magneticfield lower the energy of the ground state as compared to a constant fieldconfiguration.
