The canonical structure of classical non-linear sigma models on Riemanniansymmetric spaces, which constitute the most general class of classicalnon-linear sigma models known to be integrable, is shown to be governed by afundamental Poisson bracket relation that fits into the $r$-$s$-matrixformalism for non-ultralocal integrable models first discussed by Maillet. Thematrices $r$ and $s$ are computed explicitly and, being field dependent,satisfy fundamental Poisson bracket relations of their own, which can beexpressed in terms of a new numerical matrix~$c$. It is proposed that all thesePoisson brackets taken together are representation conditions for a new kind ofalgebra which, for this class of models, replaces the classical Yang-Baxteralgebra governing the canonical structure of ultralocal models. The Poissonbrackets for the transition matrices are also computed, and the notoriousregularization problem associated with the definition of the Poisson bracketsfor the monodromy matrices is discussed.
