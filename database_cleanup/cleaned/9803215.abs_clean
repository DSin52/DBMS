Repulsive singularities (repulsons) in extended supergravity theories areinvestigated. These repulsive singularities are related to attractivesingularities (black holes) in moduli space of extended supergravity vacua. Inorder to study these repulsive singularities a scalar test-particle in thebackground of a repulson is investigated. It is shown, using a partial waveexpansion, that the wave function of the scalar particle vanishes at thecurvature singularity at the origin. In addition the connection to higherdimensional p-brane solutions including anti-branes is discussed.
