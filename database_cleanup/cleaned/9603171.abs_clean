The reduction from N=1, D=10 to N=4, D=4 supergravity with the Yang-Millsmatter is considered. For this purpose a set of constraints is imposed in orderto exclude six additional abelian matter multiplets and conserve thesupersymmetry. We consider both the cases of usual and dual N=1, D=10supergravity using the superspace approach. Also the effective potential of thederiving theory is written.
