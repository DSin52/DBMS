A study of the thermodynamics in IIA Matrix String Theory is presented. Thefree string limit is calculated and seen to exactly reproduce the usual result.When energies are enough to excite non-perturbative objects like D-particlesand specially membranes, the situation changes because they add a large numberof degrees of freedom that do not appear at low energies. There seems to be anegative specific heat (even in the Microcanonical Ensemble) that moves theasymptotic temperature to zero. Besides, the mechanism of interaction andattachment of open strings to D-particles and D-membranes is analyzed.
