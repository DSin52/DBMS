Title: Cross Product Quantisation, Nonabelian Cohomology And Twisting Of Hopf

AlgebrasComments: 26 pages

This is an introduction to work on the generalisation to quantum groups ofMackey's approach to quantisation on homogeneous spaces. We recall thebicrossproduct models of the author, which generalise the quantum double. Wedescribe the general extension theory of Hopf algebras and the nonAbeliancohomology spaces $\CH^2(H,A)$ which classify them. They form a new kind oftopological quantum number in physics which is visible only in the quantumworld. These same cross product quantisations can also be viewed as trivialquantum principal bundles in quantum group gauge theory. We also relate thisnonAbelian cohomology $\CH^2(H,\C )$ to Drinfeld's theory of twisting.
