In previous articles it was demonstrated that the total cross section of thescattering of two light particles (zero modes of the Kaluza-Klein tower) in thesix-dimensional $\lambda \phi^{4}$ model differs significantly from the crosssection of the same process in the conventional $\lambda \phi^{4}$ theory infour space-time dimensions even for the energies below the threshold of thefirst heavy particle. Here the analytical structure of the cross section in thesame model with torus compactification for arbitrary radii of thetwo-dimensional torus is studied. Further amplification of the total crosssection due to interaction of the scalar field with constant background Abeliangauge potential in the space of extra dimensions is shown.
