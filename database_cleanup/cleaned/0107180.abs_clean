Two dimensional Non-Commutative Open String (NCOS) theory, well-definedperturbatively, may also be studied at strong coupling and for large D-stringcharge by making use of the Holographic duality. We analyze the zero modedynamics of a closed string in the appropriate background geometry and map theresults onto a sector of strongly coupled NCOS dynamics. We find an elaborateclassical picture that shares qualitative similarities with the SL(2,R) WZWmodel. In the quantum problem, we compute propagators and part of the energyspectrum of the theory; the latter involves interesting variations in thedensity of states as a function of the level number, and energies scalinginversely with the coupling. Finally, the geometry exhibits a near horizonthroat, associated with NCOS dynamics, yet it is found that the whole space isavailable for Holography. This provides a setting to extend the Maldacenaduality beyond the near horizon limit.
