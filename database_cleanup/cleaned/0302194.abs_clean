Title: Chiral Ring Of Sp(N) And SO(N) Supersymmetric Gauge Theory In Four

DimensionsAuthors: Edward Witten

Comments: 14 pages

The chiral ring of classical supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gaugegroup $Sp(N)$ or SO(N) is computed, extending previous work (of Cachazo,Douglas, Seiberg, and the author) for SU(N). The result is that, as has beenconjectured, the ring is generated by the usual glueball superfield $S\sim \TrW_\alpha W^\alpha$, with the relation $S^h=0$, $h$ being the dual Coxeternumber. Though this proposition has important implications for the behavior ofthe quantum theory, the statement and (for the most part) the proofs amount toassertions about Lie groups with no direct reference to gauge theory.
