We construct SUGRA solutions of brane configurations of intersecting Dp andNS branes. These solutions are semi-localized in the sense that one of theintersecting branes is smeared along the world volume of the other, while thesecond is localized. We examine the gauge theory that lives on the localizedbrane, and the various descriptions possible via T and S dualities, andM-theory.
