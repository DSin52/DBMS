In the paper ``Density perturbations in the ekpyrotic scenario'', it isargued that the expected spectrum of primordial perturbations should be scaleinvariant in this scenario. Here we show that, contrary to what is claimed inthat paper, the expected spectrum depends on an arbitrary choice of matchingvariable. As no underlying (microphysical) principle exists at the present timethat could lift the arbitrariness, we conclude that the ekpyrotic scenario isnot yet a predictive model.
