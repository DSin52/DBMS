We study BPS monopoles in 4 dimensional N=4 SO(N) and $Sp(N)$ superYang-Mills theories realized as the low energy effective theory of $N$(physical and its mirror) parallel D3 branes and an {\it Orientifold 3 plane}with D1 branes stretched between them in type IIB string theory. Monopoles onD3 branes give the natural understanding by embedding in SU(N) through theconstraints on both the asymptotic Higgs field (corresponding to the horizontalpositions of D3 branes) and the magnetic charges (corresponding to the numberof D1 branes) imposed by the O3 plane. The compatibility conditions of Nahmdata for monopoles for these groups can be interpreted very naturally throughthe D1 branes in the presence of O3 plane.
