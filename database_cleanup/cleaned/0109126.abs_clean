We examine domain wall solutions of N=1, D=4 supergravity which preserve halfof the supersymmetry and arise from Euclidean M2-brane instantons on M5-braneswrapping associative 3-cycles of G_2 holonomy manifolds. We also investigatecomposite solutions which break an additional half of the supersymmetry.
