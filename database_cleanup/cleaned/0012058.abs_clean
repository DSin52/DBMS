We construct and study a class of N particle supersymmetric Hamiltonians withnearest and next-nearest neighbor inverse-square interaction in one dimension.We show that inhomogeneous XY models in an external non-uniform magnetic fieldcan be obtained from these super-Hamiltonians in a particular limit decouplingthe fermionic degrees of freedom from the kinematic ones. We further consider asuitable deformation of these super-models such that inhomogeneous XXZHamiltonians in an external non-uniform magnetic field are obtained in the samelimit. We show that this deformed Hamiltonian with rational potential is, (i)mapped to a set of free super-oscillators through a similarity transformationand (ii) supersymmetric in terms of a new, non-standard realization of thesupercharge. We construct many exact eigenstates of this Hamiltonian anddiscuss about the applicability of this technique to other models.
