The strong structural similarity between the deformed conifold of Candelasand de la Ossa (a noncompact Calabi-Yau manifold) and the moduli space of unitcharge CP^1 lumps equipped with its L^2 metric is pointed out. This allows oneto reinterpret certain recent results on D3 branes in terms of lump dynamics,and to deduce certain curvature properties of the deformed conifold.
