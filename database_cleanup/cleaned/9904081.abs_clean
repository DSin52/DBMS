Title: Light-cone Hamiltonian flow for positronium. The numerical solutions

Authors: Elena Gubankova and Gabor Papp

Comments: 28 pages, LaTeX2e, 2 Figures

The effective Hamiltonian, as obtained from applying the Hamiltonian flowequations to front form QED, are solved numerically for positronium. Both theexchange and the annihilation channels are included. The impact of differentsimilarity functions is explicitly studied. Perfect numerical agreement withother methods is found.
