In the AdS/CFT correspondence motion in the radial direction of the AdS spaceis identified with renormalization group flow in the field theory. For the N=4Yang-Mills theory this motion is trivial. More interesting examples ofrenormalization group flow occur when the N=4 theory is deformed. Aspects ofthe flows are discussed for the N=4 theory on its moduli space, and deformed toN=2 in the infra-red within the context of 5d SUGRA. 10d lifts and braneprobing are crucial tools for linking the spacetime backgrounds to the dualfield theory.
