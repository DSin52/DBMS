Title: Hamilton's Formalism for Systems with Constraints

Authors: Andreas W. Wipf

Comments: 52 pages, revised LATEX version, ETH-TH/93-48, Lectures given at the

Seminar "The Canonical Formalism in Classical and Quantum GeneralRelativity", Bad Honnef, September 93The main goal of these lectures is to introduce and review the Hamiltonianformalism for classical constrained systems and in particular gauge theories.Emphasis is put on the relation between local symmetries and constraints and onthe relation between Lagrangean and Hamiltonian symmetries.
