The effective action for Q.E.D in external magnetic field is constructedusing the method of inhomogeneity expansion. We first treat thenon-relativistic case where a Chern-Simons like term is generated. We thenconsider the full relativistic theory and derive the effective action for the$A_{\mu}$ fields.In the non-relativistic case we also add a 4-fermi type interaction and showthat under certain circumstances, it corresponds to a Zeeman type term in theeffective action.
