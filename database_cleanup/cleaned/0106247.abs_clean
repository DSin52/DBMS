We discuss several aspects of the proposed correspondence between quantumgravity on de Sitter spaces and Euclidean conformal field theories. The centralcharge appearing in the asymptotic symmetry algebra of three-dimensional deSitter space is derived both from the conformal anomaly and the transformationlaw of the CFT stress tensor when going from dS_3 in planar coordinates to dS_3with cosmological horizon. The two-point correlator for CFT operators couplingto bulk scalars is obtained in static coordinates, corresponding to a CFT on acylinder. Correlation functions are also computed for CFTs on two-dimensionalhyperbolic space. We furthermore determine the energy momentum tensor and theCasimir energy of the conformal field theory dual to the Schwarzschild-deSitter solution in five dimensions. Requiring the pressure to be positiveyields an upper bound for the black hole mass, given by the mass of the Nariaisolution. Beyond that bound, which is similar to the one found by Stromingerrequiring the conformal weights of CFT operators to be real, one encountersnaked singularities.
