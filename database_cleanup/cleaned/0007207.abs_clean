We study backreaction effects in two-dimensional dilaton gravity. Thebackreaction comes from an $R^2$ term which is a part of the one-loop effectiveaction arising from massive scalar field quantization in a certainapproximation. The peculiarity of this term is that it does not contribute tothe Hawking radiation of the classical black hole solution of the fieldequations. In the static case we examine the horizon and the physicalsingularity of the new black hole solutions. Studying the possibility of timedependence we see the generation of a new singularity. The particular solutionfound still has the structure of a black hole, indicating that non-thermaleffects cannot lead, at least in this approximation, to black hole evaporation.
