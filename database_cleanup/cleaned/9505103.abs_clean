Title: WZW model based on the extended de Sitter group

Comments: 16 pages

We study the WZW model based on the centrally extended 2D de Sitter algebra.We obtain the spacetime metric and its explicitly conformally flat expression.The symmetries of the spacetime are found by identifying the Killing vectorswith the group generators. The energy-momentum tensor obtained from theaffine-Sugawara construction agrees with that from the more conventionalapproach. The exact center charge agrees to one-loop order with the one-loopbeta function equations. We have also studied the representations of thecorresponding enveloping Virasoro algebra.
