We study noncommutative open string (NCOS) theories realized in string theorywith time-dependent backgrounds. Starting from a noncommutative Yang-Millstheory (NCYM) with a constant space-space noncommutativity but in atime-dependent background and making an S-dual transformation, we show that theresulting theory is an NCOS also in a time-dependent background but now with atime-dependent time-space noncommutativity and a time-dependent string scale.The corresponding dual gravity description is also given. A general SL(2,Z)transformation on the NCYM results in an NCOS with a time-dependent time-spacenoncommutativity and a constant space-space noncommutativity, and also in atime-dependent background.
