orthographical correctionThe response of vacuum to the presence of external conditions is the subjectof this work. We consider a generalization of the Casimir effect in thepresence of curved boundaries on which a sharp potential is concentrated. Theprofile of the potential is a delta function, which has some features in commonwith a hard boundary and some with a smooth background field. The boundariesmagnetic flux tube. The vacuum energy is calculated by means of the Jostfunction of the scattering problem related to the field equation. The energy isthen renormalized by means of a zeta functional approach adopting theheat-kernel expansion. The heat kernel coefficients are calculated and adiscussion of the UV-divergences of the model is presented. The renormalizedvacuum energy $E^{ren}$ is then numerically studied and plotted. The sign of$E^{ren}$ is found to be always negative in the case of the cylindrical shell,while in the case of the spherical shell and of the magnetic flux tube the signdepends on the value of the radius.
