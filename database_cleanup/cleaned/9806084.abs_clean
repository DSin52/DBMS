We first consider nonlinear Grassmann sigma models in any dimension and nextconstruct their submodels. For these models we construct an infinite number ofnontrivial conserved currents. Our result is independent of time-spacedimensions and, therfore, is a full generalization of that of authors (Alvarez,Ferreira and Guillen). Our result also suggests that our method may be appliedto other nonlinear sigma models such as chiral models, $G/H$ sigma models inany dimension.
