We introduce a notion of Q-algebra that can be considered as a generalizationof the notion of Q-manifold (a supermanifold equipped with an odd vector fieldobeying {Q,Q} =0). We develop the theory of connections on modules overQ-algebras and prove a general duality theorem for gauge theories on suchmodules. This theorem contains as a simplest case SO(d,d,{\bf Z})-duality ofgauge theories on noncommutative tori.
