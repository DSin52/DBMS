The "body fixed frame" with respect to local gauge transformations isintroduced. Rigid gauge "rotations" in QCD and their \Sch equation are studiedfor static and dynamic quarks. Possible choices of the rigid gauge fieldconfiguration corresponding to a nonvanishing static colormagnetic field in the"body fixed" frame are discussed. A gauge invariant variational equation isderived in this frame. For large number N of colors the rigid gauge fieldconfiguration is regarded as random with maximally random probabilitydistribution under constraints on macroscopic--like quantities. For the uniformmagnetic field the joint probability distribution of the field components isdetermined by maximizing the appropriate entropy under the area law constraintfor the Wilson loop. In the quark sector the gauge invariance requires therigid gauge field configuration to appear not only as a background but also asinducing an instantaneous quark-quark interaction. Both are random in the largeN limit.
