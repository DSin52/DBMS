A new local world volume supersymmetric Lagrangian for the bosonic membraneis presented. The starting Lagrangian is the one constructed by Dolan andTchrakian with vanishing cosmological constant, with quadratic and quarticderivative terms. Our Lagrangian differs from the one constructed by Lindstromand Rocek in the fact that it is polynomial in the fields facilitating thequantization process. It is argued, rigorously, that if one wishes to constructpolynomial actions without a curvature scalar term and, where supersymmetry islinearly realized in the space of physical fields, after the elimination ofauxiliary fields, one must relinquish $S$ supersymmetry, altogether, andconcentrate solely on the $Q$ supersymmetry associated with the superconformalalgebra in three dimensions. A full $''Q+S''$ supersymmetry cannot beimplemented in a linearly realized way satisfying all of the above-mentionedrequirements, unless a non-polynomial action is chosen.
