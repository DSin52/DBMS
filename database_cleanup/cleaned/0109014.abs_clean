Using functional derivatives with respect to free propagators andinteractions we derive a closed set of Schwinger-Dyson equations in quantumelectrodynamics. Its conversion to graphical recursion relations allows us tosystematically generate all connected and one-particle irreducible Feynmandiagrams for the $n$-point functions and the vacuum energy together with theircorrect weights.
