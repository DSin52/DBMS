Title: Black hole entropy in string-generated gravity models

Authors: Ishwaree P. Neupane

Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, Physical Review D (Rapid Communication) version

The Euclidean action and entropy are computed in string-generated gravitymodels with quadratic curvatures, and used to argue that a negative massextremal metric is the background for hyperbolic (k=-1) black hole spacetimes,k being the curvature constant of the event horizon. The entropy associatedwith a black hole is always positive for k=(0,1) family. The positivity ofenergy condition also ensures that the k=-1 (extremal) entropy is non-negative.
