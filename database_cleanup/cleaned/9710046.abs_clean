We review various aspects of classical solutions in string theories. Emphasisis placed on their supersymmetry properties, their special roles in stringdualities and microscopic interpretations. Topics include black hole solutionsin string theories on tori and N=2 supergravity theories; p-branes; microscopicinterpretation of black hole entropy. We also review aspects of dualities andBPS states.
