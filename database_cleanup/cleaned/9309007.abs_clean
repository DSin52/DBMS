SystemsThe study of the integrability properties of the N=2 Landau- Ginzburg modelsleads naturally to a graph generalization of the Yang-Baxter equation whichsynthetizes the well known vertex and RSOS Yang-Baxter equations. A non trivialsolution of this equation is found for the $t_2$ perturbation of the A-models,which turns out to be intimately related to the Boltzmann weights of a Chiral-Potts model.
