Title: Discrete Torsion

Authors: Eric R. Sharpe

Comments: 45 pages, LaTeX, 4 figures

In this article we explain discrete torsion. Put simply, discrete torsion isthe choice of orbifold group action on the B field. We derive theclassification H^2(G, U(1)), we derive the twisted sector phases appearing instring loop partition functions, we derive M. Douglas's description of discretetorsion for D-branes in terms of a projective representation of the orbifoldgroup, and we outline how the results of Vafa-Witten fit into this framework.In addition, we discover some new degrees of freedom that appear in describingorbifold group actions on B fields, in addition to those classified by H^2(G,U(1)), and explain how these new degrees of freedom appear in terms of twistedsector contributions to partition functions and in terms of orbifold groupactions on D-brane worldvolumes. This paper represents a technically simplifiedversion of prior papers by the author on discrete torsion. We repeat heretechnically simplified versions of results from those papers, and have includedsome new material.
