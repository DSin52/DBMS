We study a canonical quantization of the Wess--Zumino--Witten (WZW) modelwhich depends on two integer parameters rather than one. The usual theory canbe obtained as a contraction, in which our two parameters go to infinitykeeping the difference fixed. The quantum theory is equivalent to a generalizedThirring model, with left and right handed fermions transforming underdifferent representations of the symmetry group. We also point out that theclassical WZW model with a compact target space has a canonical formalism inwhich the current algebra is an affine Lie algebra of non--compact type.Also, there are some non--unitary quantizations of the WZW model in whichthere is invariance only under half the conformal algebra (one copy of theVirasoro algebra).
