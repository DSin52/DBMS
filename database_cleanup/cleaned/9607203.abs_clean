The presence of Killing-Yano tensors implies the existence of non-standardsupersymmetries in point particle theories on curved backgrounds. In a stringtheoretical context these are symmetries of the modes describing theparticle-like behavior of the string. In the presence of isometries we showthat, in addition to these, one can also define a new type of non-standardsupersymmetry among a mixture of particle and winding modes. The interplay withT-duality is also examined and illustrated by explicit examples.
