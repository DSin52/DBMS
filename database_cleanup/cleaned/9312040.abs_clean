The present paper describes the $W$--geometry of the Abelian finitenon-periodic (conformal) Toda systems associated with the $B,C$ and $D$ seriesof the simple Lie algebras endowed with the canonical gradation. The principaltool here is a generalization of the classical Pl\"ucker embedding of the$A$-case to the flag manifolds associated with the fundamental representationsof $B_n$, $C_n$ and $D_n$, and a direct proof that the corresponding K\"ahlerpotentials satisfy the system of two--dimensional finite non-periodic(conformal) Toda equations. It is shown that the $W$--geometry of the typementioned above coincide with the differential geometry of special holomorphic(W) surfaces in target spaces which are submanifolds (quadrics) of $CP^N$ withappropriate choices of $N$. In addition, these W-surfaces are defined tosatisfy quadratic holomorphic differential conditions that ensure consistencyof the generalized Pl\"ucker embedding. These conditions are automaticallyfulfiled when Toda equations hold.
