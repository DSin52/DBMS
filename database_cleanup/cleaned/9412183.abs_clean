Title: Gap Equations of O(N) Non-linear Sigma Model in Three Dimensions

Comments: 10pages,Latex

We study the $O(N)$ non-linear $\sigma$ model on three-dimensional manifoldsof constant curvature by means of the large $N$ expansion at the criticalpoint. We examine saddle point equations imposing anti-periodic boundarycondition in time direction. In the case $S^1 \times S^2$ we find that asolution is inevitably unstable. We briefly refer to the case $S^1 \times S^1\times S^1$.
