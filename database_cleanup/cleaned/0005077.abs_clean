The zero momentum sectors in effective theories of three dimensional QCDcoupled to pseudoreal (two colors) and real (adjoint) quarks in a classicallyparity-invariant manner have alternative descriptions in terms of orthogonaland symplectic ensembles of random matrices. Using this correspondence, wecompute finite-volume QCD partition functions and correlation functions ofDirac operator eigenvalues in a presence of finite quark masses of the order ofthe smallest Dirac eigenvalue. These novel correlation functions, expressed interms of quaternion determinants, are reduced to conventional results for theGaussian ensembles in the quenched limit.
