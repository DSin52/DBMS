FTUV/93-13In the analytic-Bargmann representation associated with the harmonicoscillator and spin coherent states, the wavefunction as entire complexfunctions can be factorized in terms of their zeros in a unique way. TheSchr\"odinger equation of motion for the wavefunction is turned to a system ofequations for its zeros. The motion of these zeros as a non-linear flow ofpoints is studied and interpreted for linear and non-linear bosonic and spinHamiltonians. Attention is given to the study of the zeros of theJaynes-Cummings model and to its finite analoque. Numerical solutions arederived and discussed.
