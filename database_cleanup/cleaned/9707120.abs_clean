We discuss supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with the multiple scales in thebrane language. The issue concerns N=2 SUSY gauge theories with massivefundamental matter including the UV finite case of $n_{f}=2n_c$, theoriesinvolving products of SU(n) gauge groups with bifundamental matter, and thesystems with several parameters similar to $\Lambda_{QCD}$. We argue that theproper integrable systems are, accordingly, twisted XXX SL(2) spin chain,$SL(p)$ magnets and degenerations of the spin Calogero system. The issue ofsymmetries underlying integrable systems is addressed. Relations with themonopole systems are specially discussed. Brane pictures behind all theseintegrable structures in the IIB and M theory are suggested. We argue thatdegrees of freedom in integrable systems are related to KK excitations in Mtheory or D-particles in the IIA string theory, which substitute the infinitenumber of instantons in the field theory. This implies the presence of more BPSstates in the low-energy sector.
