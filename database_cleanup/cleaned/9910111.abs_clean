Six dimensional supergravities on $ADS_3 \times S^3$ present interest due tothe role they play in the $AdS/CFT$ correspondence. The correspondence in thiscase states the equivalence between supergravity on the given background and astill unknown conformal field theory. The conformal field theory in question isexpected to appear by deforming of the free conformal field theory on$S^N(T^4)$ in a way which preserves the superconformal symmetry. The purpose ofthis paper is to compute the first nontrivial corrections to the equations ofmotion for the chiral primary fields coming from supergravity. Using themethods already developed which involve nontrivial redefinitions of fields, wecompute three-point correlation functions for scalar chiral primaries andnotice similarities between their expressions and those obtained in theorbifold conformal field theory.
