We show that flavor 't Hooft anomalies automatically vanish in noncommutativefield theories which are obtained from string theory in the decoupling limit.We claim that this is because the flavor symmetries are secretly local, becauseof coupling to closed string bulk modes. An example is the SU(4) R-symmetry ofN=4 D=4 NCSYM. The gauge fields, along with all closed string bulk modes, arenot on-shell external states but do appear as off-shell intermediate states innon-planar processes; these closed string modes are thereby holographicallyencoded in the NCFT.
