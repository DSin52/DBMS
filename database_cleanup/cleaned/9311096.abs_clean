Title: Quantization of the external algebra on a Poisson-Lie group

Comments: 19 pages. The proof of eq.(3.16) and LaTeX errors are corrected

We show that the external algebra $\cal M$ on $GL(N)$ can be equipped withthe graded Poisson brackets compatible with the group action. We prove thatthere are only two graded Poisson-Lie structures (brackets) on $\cal M$ and weobtain their explicit description. We realize that just these two structuresappear as the quasiclassical limit of the bicovariant differential calculi onthe quantum linear group $GL_q (N)$.
