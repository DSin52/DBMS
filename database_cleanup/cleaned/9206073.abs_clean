We write a Ginzburg-Landau Hamiltonian for a charged order parameterinteracting with a background electromagnetic field in 2+1 dimensions. Usingthe method of Lund we derive a collective coordinate action for vortex defectsin the order parameter and demonstrate that the vortices are charged. Weexamine the classical dynamics of the vortices and then quantize their motion,demonstrating that their peculiar classical motion is a result of the fact thatthe quantum motion takes place in the lowest Landau level. The classical andquantum motion in two dimensional regions with boundaries is also investigated.The quantum theory is not invariant under magnetic translations. Magnetictranslations add total time derivative terms to the collective action, but noextra constants of the motion result.
