The spontaneous generation of uniform magnetic condensate in $QED_3$ givesrise to ferromagnetic domain walls at the electroweak phase transition. Theseferromagnetic domain walls are caracterized by vanishing effective surfaceenergy density avoiding, thus, the domain wall problem. Moreover we find thatthe domain walls generate a magnetic field $B \simeq 10^{24} Gauss$ at theelectroweak scale which account for the seed field in the so called dynamomechanism for the cosmological primordial magnetic field. We find that theannihilation processes of walls with size $R \simeq 10^5 Km$ could release anenergy of order $10^{52} erg$ indicating the invisible ferromagnetic walls aspossible compact sources of Gamma Ray Bursts.
