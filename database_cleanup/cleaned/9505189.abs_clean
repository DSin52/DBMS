Title: Unique Closed-Form Quantization Via Generalized Path Integrals or by

Natural Extension of the Standard Canonical RecipeComments: 6 pages, LaTeX, Revised to refer to the earlier Kerner-Sutcliffe

Hamiltonian quantization formula and to the Born-Jordan operator orderingrule. Also now gives the generalizations to multiple degrees of freedom andcontinuum fieldsThe Feynman-Garrod path integral representation for time evolution isextended to arbitrary one-parameter continuous canonical transformations. Onethereupon obtains a generalized Kerner-Sutcliffe formula for the unique quantumrepresentation of the transformation generator, which can be an arbitraryclassical dynamical variable. This closed-form quantization procedure is shownto be equivalent to a natural extension of the standard canonical quantizationrecipe -- an extension that resolves the operator-ordering ambiguity in favorof the Born-Jordan rule.
