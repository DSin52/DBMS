Title: Extended Structures in Topological Quantum Field Theory

Comments: 11 pages + 2 figures

In this note, based on a conference talk, we show how a 3 dimensionaltopological field theory leads to an algebraic gadget roughly equivalent to aquantum group. This is an expository version of some material in hep-th/9212115(where we also carry out computations for a specific finite example). We alsoexplain how to incorporate the central extensions usually explained via``framings'', and we show how to recover invariants of framed tangles. Thispaper is written using AMSTeX 2.1, which can be obtained via ftp from theAmerican Mathematical Society (instructions included). 2 encapsulatedpostscript files were submitted separately in uuencoded tar-compressed format.
