We show that a geometrical notion of entropy, definable in flat space,governs the first quantum correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking black holeentropy. We describe two methods for calculating this entropy -- astraightforward Hamiltonian approach, and a less direct but more powerfulEuclidean (heat kernel) method. The entropy diverges in quantum field theory inthe absence of an ultraviolet cutoff. Various related finite quantities can beextracted with further work. We briefly discuss the corresponding question instring theory.
