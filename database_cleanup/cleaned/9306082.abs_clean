We study the mass-charge relation for the semiclassical extremal black holeof the $S$-wave sector Einstein-Maxwell theory coupled to $N$ conformalscalars. The classical ratio $M/{|Q|}=1$ is shown to be modified to $M/{|Q|}\simeq 1-k/6$ for small $ k \equiv N\hbar/(12\pi Q^{2})$. Furthermore,numerical study for $k<2$ shows that $M/|Q|$ is a monotonically decreasingfunction of $k$. We speculate on the consequence of such a modification in the4-dimensional context.
