We propose examples, which involve orbifolds by elements of the U-dualitygroup, with M-theory moduli fixed at the eleven-dimensional Planck scale. Webegin by reviewing asymmetric orbifold constructions in perturbative stringtheory, which fix radial moduli at the string scale. Then we considernon-perturbative aspects of those backgrounds (brane probes and the orbifoldaction from the eleven-dimensional point of view). This leads us to considermutually non-perturbative group actions. Using a combination of dualities,matrix theory, and ideas for the generalization of the perturbative orbifoldprescription, we present evidence that the examples we construct are consistentM-theory backgrounds. In particular we argue that there should be consistentnon-supersymmetric compactifications of M-theory.
