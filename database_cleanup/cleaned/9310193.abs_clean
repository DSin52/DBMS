We investigate $O(N)$-symmetric vector field theories in the double scalinglimit. Our model describes branched polymeric systems in $D$ dimensions, whosemulticritical series interpolates between the Cayley tree and the ordinaryrandom walk. We give explicit forms of residual divergences in the free energy,analogous to those observed in the strings in one dimension.
