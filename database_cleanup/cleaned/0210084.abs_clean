Title: String in noncommutative background

We propose a model action in 1+1 flat space-time (compact in spatialdimension) embedded in D flat space-time with a non dynamical space-timedependent two vector. For the above constrained system Dirac brackets ofsuitably defined co-ordinates turn out to be non zero and under specific choiceof the two vector the model action reduces to a general action of open stringin a noncommutative background where we find the natural embedding of the openstring action of in presence of magnetic field on D-brane.
