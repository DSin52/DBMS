The vector and tensor fluctuations of vortices localizing gravity in thecontext of the six-dimensional Abelian Higgs model are studied. Thesestring-like solutions break spontaneously six-dimensional Poincar\'e invarianceleading to a finite four-dimensional Planck mass and to a regular geometry bothin the bulk and on the core of the vortex. While the tensor modes of the metricare decoupled and exhibit a normalizable zero mode, the vector fluctuations,present in the gauge sector of the theory, are naturally coupled to thegraviphoton fields associated with the vector perturbations of the warpedgeometry. Using the invariance under infinitesimal diffeomorphisms, it is foundthat the zero modes of the graviphoton fields are never localized. On thecontrary,the fluctuations of the Abelian gauge field itself admit anormalizable zero mode.
