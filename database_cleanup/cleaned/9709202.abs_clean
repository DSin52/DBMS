Killing spinors of space-time BPS configurations play an important role inquantization of theories with the fermionic worldvolume local symmetry. We showhere how it works for the GS superstring, BST supermembrane and M-5-brane. Weshow that the non-linear generalization of the (2,0) d=6 tensor supermultipletaction is the M-5-brane action in a Killing gauge. For D-p-branes the novelfeature of quantization is that they can be quantized Lorentz covariantly, inparticular, for D-0-brane a gauge exists where the action is covariant andfree. We present a general condition on possible choice of gauges for thekappa-symmetric branes.
