We consider self-avoiding Nambu-Goto open strings on a random surface. Wehave shown that the partition function of such a string theory can becalculated exactly. The string susceptibility for the disk is evaluated to be$-\frac{1}{2}$. We also consider modifications of the Nambu-Goto action whichare exactly soluble on a random surface.
