Title: A possible description of the quantum numbers in a hadronic string model

Authors: V.A. Kudryavtsev and G.Weidl

Comments: 14 pages, LaTeX

We consider a critical composite superconformal string model to desribehadronic interactions. We present a new approach of introducing hadronicquantum numbers in the scattering amplitudes. The physical states carry thequantum numbers and form a common system of eigenfunctions of the operators inthis string model. We give explicit constructions of the quantum numberoperators.
