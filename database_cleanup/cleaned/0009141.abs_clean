We show that a four-parameter class of 3+1 dimensional NCOS theories can beobtained by dimensional reduction on a general 2-torus from OM theory.Compactifying two spatial directions of NCOS theory on a 2-torus, we study thetransformation properties under the $SO(2,2;Z)$ T-duality group. We thendiscuss non-perturbative configurations of non-commutative super Yang-Millstheory. In particular, we calculate the tension for magnetic monopoles and(p,q) dyons and exhibit their six-dimensional origin, and construct asupergravity solution representing an instanton in the gauge theory. We alsocompute the potential for a monopole-antimonopole in the supergravityapproximation.
