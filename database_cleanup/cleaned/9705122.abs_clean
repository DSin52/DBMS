This is the written version of a series of lectures reviewing the basics ofduality as applied to p-forms and sigma-models. The ideas are introduced by wayof worked examples, often quite detailed. Our approach is very pedestrian andthe presentation is aimed at non-specialists, such as e.g. graduate students.
