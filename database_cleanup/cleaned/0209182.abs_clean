EffectWe propose two non-abelian Chern-Simons matrix models as the effectivedescriptions of 4-dimensional quantum Hall fluids. One of them describes a newtype of 4-dimensional quantum Hall fluid on the space of quaternions, the otherprovides the description of non-commutative field theory for Zhang and Hu's4-dimensional quantum Hall fluid of $S^4$. The complete sets of physicalquantum states of these matrix models are determined, and the properties ofquantum Hall fluids related with them are discussed.
