We study the cosmological meaning of duality symmetry by considering a twodimensional model of string cosmology. We find that as seen by an internalobserver in this universe, the scale factor rebounds at the self-dual length.This rebound is a consequence of the adiabatic expansion. Furthermore, in thissituation there are four mathematically different scenarios which describephysically equivalent universes which are in fact indistinguishable. We alsostress that $R$-duality suffices to prove that all possible evolutions presenta maximum temperature.
