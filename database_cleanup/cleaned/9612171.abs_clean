Title: Self-duality and F theory

Authors: Sergei V. Ketov (ITP, University of Hannover)

Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX; Talk given at the 4th Nordic Meeting `Supersymmetric

Field and String Theories', (G"oteborg, Sweden, 9--11 September 1996), and atthe `mitteldeutsche' Workshop (Lutherstadt Wittenberg, Germany, 29--30November 1996)The (2,2) world-sheet supersymmetric string theory is discussed from theviewpoint of string/membrane unification. The effective field theory in theclosed string target space is known to be the 2+2 dimensional (integrable)theory of self-dual gravity (SDG). A world-volume supersymmetrization of thePleba'nski action for SDG naturally implies the maximal N=8 world-volumesupersymmetry, while the maximal supersymmetrization of the dual covariantK"ahler-Lorentz-Chern-Simons action for SDG implies gauging a self-dual part ofthe super-Lorentz symmetry in 2+10 dimensions. The proposed OSp(32|1)supersymmetric action for the M-brane may be useful for a fundamentalformulation of uncompactified F theory, with the self-duality being playing thecentral role both in the world-volume and in the target space of the M-brane.
