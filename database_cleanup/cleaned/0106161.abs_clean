We study the positive energy unitary representations of 2N extendedsuperconformal algebras OSp(8*|2N) in six dimensions. These representations canbe formulated in a particle basis or a supercoherent state basis, which arelabeled by the superspace coordinates in d=6. We show that the supercoherentstates that form the bases of positive energy representations of OSp(8*|2N) canbe identified with conformal superfields in six dimensions. The masslessconformal superfields correspond precisely to the ultra short doubletonsupermultiplets of OSp(8*|2N). The other positive energy unitaryrepresentations correspond to massive conformal superfields in six dimensionsand they can be obtained by tensoring an arbitrary number of doubletonsupermultiplets with each other. The supermultiplets obtained by tensoring twocopies of the doubletons correspond to massless anti-de Sitter supermultipletsin d = 7.
