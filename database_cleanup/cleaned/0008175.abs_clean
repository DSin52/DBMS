Boris Ioffe, edited by M. ShifmanIn certain 1+1 dimensional field theoretic toy models, one can go all the wayfrom microscopic quarks via the hadron spectrum to the properties of hot anddense baryonic matter in an essentially analytic way. This "miracle" isillustrated through case studies of two popular large N models, the Gross-Neveuand the 't Hooft model - caricatures of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model and realQCD, respectively. The main emphasis will be on aspects related to spontaneoussymmetry breaking (discrete or continuous chiral symmetry, translationalinvariance) and confinement.
