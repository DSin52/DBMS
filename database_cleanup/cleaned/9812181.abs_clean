Title: The Operator Manifold Formalism. I

Comments: LaTex, 30 pages

The suggested operator manifold formalism enables to develop an approach tothe unification of the geometry and the field theory. We also elaborate theformalism of operator multimanifold yielding the multiworld geometry involvingthe spacetime continuum and internal worlds, where the subquarks are definedimplying the Confinement and Gauge principles. This formalism in Part II(hep-th/9812182) is used to develop further the microscopic approach to somekey problems of particle physics.
