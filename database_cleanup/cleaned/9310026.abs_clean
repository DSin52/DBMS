the conclusions altered. The analysis only applies in a straightforward wayto $N$-particle scattering for $N\leq 26$.)The bracket operation on mutually local BRST classes may be combined withLorentz invariance and analyticity to write an infinite set of finitedifference relations on string scattering amplitudes. When combined with somesimple physical criteria these relations uniquely determine the genus zerostring $S$-matrix for $N\leq 26$-particle scattering in $\IR^{25,1}$ in termsof a single parameter, $\kappa$, the string coupling. We propose that thehigh-energy limit of the relations are the Ward identities for the high-energysymmetries of string theory.
