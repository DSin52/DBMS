TechniquesWe perform consistently the Gupta-Bleuler quantization combined with Diracprocedure for a chiral boson with the parameter ($\alpha$) on the circle, theboundary of the circular droplet. For $\alpha =1$, we obtain the holomorphicconstraints. Using the representation of Bargmann-Fock space and theSchr\"odinger equation, we construct the holomorphic wave functions. In orderto interpret these functions, we introduce the $W_\infty$-coherent state toaccount for the infinite-dimensional translation symmetry for the Fourier(edge) modes. The $\alpha=1$ wave functions explain the neutral edge states for$\nu =1$ quantum Hall fluid very well. In the case of $\alpha = -1$,we obtain the new wave functions which may describe the higher modes (radialexcitations) of edge states. Finally, the charged edge states are described bythe $|\alpha| \not=1$ wave functions.
