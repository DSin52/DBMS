Using a coherent state representation we derive many-body probabilitydistributions and wavefunctions for the Chern-Simons matrix model proposed byPolychronakos and compare them to the Laughlin ones. We analyze two differentcoherent state representations, corresponding to different choices for electroncoordinate bases. In both cases we find that the resulting probabilitydistributions do not quite agree with the Laughlin ones. There is agreement onthe long distance behavior, but the short distance behavior is different.
