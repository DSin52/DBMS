A generalized approach of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is developed toanalytically deal with the influence exercised by the spatial motion of atom'smass-center on a two-level atom in an optical ring cavity with a quantizedsingle-mode electromagnetic field. The explicit expressions of tunneling rateare obtained for various cases, such as that with initial coherent state andthermal equilibrium state at finite temperature. Therefore, the studies forDoppler and recoil effects of the spatial motion on the scheme controllingatomic tunneling should be reconsidered in terms of the initial momentum ofatom's mass center.
