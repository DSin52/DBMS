Integrable SystemsWe consider irreducible cyclic representations of the algebra of monodromymatrices corresponding to the R-matrix of the six-vertex model. In roots ofunity the Baxter Q-operator can be represented as a trace of a tensor productof L-operators corresponding to one of these cyclic representations andsatisfies the TQ-equation. We find a new algebraic structure generated by theseL-operators and, as a consequence, by the Q-operators.
