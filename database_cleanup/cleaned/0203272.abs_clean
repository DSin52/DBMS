We investigate strings at singularities of G_2-holonomy manifolds which arisein Z_2 orbifolds of Calabi-Yau spaces times a circle. The singularities locallylook like R^4/Z_2 fibered over a SLAG, and can globally be embedded in CICYs inweighted projective spaces. The local model depends on the choice of a discretetorsion in the fibration, and the global model on an anti-holomorphicinvolution of the Calabi-Yau hypersurface. We determine how these choices arerelated to each other by computing a Wilson surface detecting discrete torsion.We then follow the same orbifolds to the non-geometric Landau-Ginzburg regionof moduli space. We argue that the symmetry-breaking twisted sectors areeffectively captured by real Landau-Ginzburg potentials. In particular, we findagreement in the low-energy spectra of strings computed from geometry andGepner-model CFT. Along the way, we construct the full modular data oforbifolds of N=2 minimal models by the mirror automorphism, and give a real-LGinterpretation of their modular invariants. Some of the models provide examplesof the mirror-symmetry phenomenon for G_2 holonomy.
