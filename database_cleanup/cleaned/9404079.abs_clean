We describe a new geometrical solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in twodimensional quantum gravity. The solution is the amplitude of a surface whoseboundary consists of two tangent loops. We further discuss a new method forestimating singular geometries amplitudes, which uses explicit recursivecounting of discrete surfaces.
