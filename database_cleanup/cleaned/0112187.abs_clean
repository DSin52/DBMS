We discuss fractional D3-branes on the orbifold C^3/Z_2*Z_2. We study theopen and the closed string spectrum on this orbifold. The corresponding N=1theory on the brane has, generically, a U(N_1)*U(N_2)*U(N_3)*U(N_4) gauge groupwith matter in the bifundamental. In particular, when only one type of brane ispresent, one obtains pure N=1 Yang-Mills. We study the coupling of the branesto the bulk fields and present the corresponding supergravity solution, validat large distances. By using a probe analysis, we are able to obtain theWilsonian beta-function for those gauge theories that possess some chiralmultiplet. Although, due to the lack of moduli, the probe technique is notdirectly applicable to the case of pure N=1 Yang-Mills, we point out that thesame formula gives the correct result also for this case.
