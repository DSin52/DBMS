Pseudo conformal field theories are theories with the same fusion rules, butwith different modular matrix as some conventional field theory. One of theauthors defined these and conjectured that, for bosonic systems, they can allbe realized by some actual RCFT, which is of free bosons. We complete the proofhere by treating the non diagonal automorphism case. It is shown that forcharacteristics $p\neq2$ they are all equivalent to a diagonal case, fullyclassified in our previous publication. For $p=2^n$ we realize the non diagonalcase, establishing this theorem.
