Superstrings have been postulated based on parafermionic partition functionswhich permit spacetime supersymmetry by generalized Jacobi identities. Acomprehensive search finds new such identities. Quadrilateral anomalycancellation gives constraints on allowed chiral fermions. Bosonic left-moversand $Z_4$ parafermionic right-movers combine in a new heterotic superstring,more constrained than the old one, yet equally applicable to physics.
