One can reconstruct the given group $G$ from its representations tovector spaces as the full group of monoidal automorphisms of the underlyingfunctor. This is a special example of Tannaka-Krein theory. This theory wasused in recent years to reconstruct quantum groups (quasitriangular Hopfalgebras) in the study of algebraic quantum field theory and otherapplications.We show that a similar study of representations in spaces with additionalstructure (super vector spaces, graded vector spaces, comodules, braidedmonoidal categories) produces additional symmetries, called ``hiddensymmetries''. More generally, reconstructed quantum groups tend to decomposeinto a smash product of the given quantum group and a quantum group of``hidden'' symmetries of the base category.
