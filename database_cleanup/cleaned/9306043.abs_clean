I consider the Hermitean two-matrix model with a logarithmic potential whichis associated in the one-matrix case with the Penner model. Using loopequations I find an explicit solution of the model at large N (or in thespherical approximation) and demonstrate that it solves the correspondingRiemann-Hilbert problem. I construct the potential of the Kazakov-Migdal modelon a D-dimensional lattice, which turns out to be a sum of two logarithms aswell, whose large-N solution is given by the same formulas. In the "naive"continuum limit this potential recovers in D<4 dimensions the standard scalartheory with quartic self-interaction. I exploit the solution to calculateexplicitly the pair correlator of gauge fields in the Kazakov-Migdal model withthe logarithmic potential.
