We investigate the possibility of Lorentz and CPT violations in the photonsector, of the Chern-Simons form, be induced by radiative corrections arisingfrom the Lorentz and CPT non-invariant fermionic sector of an extended versionof QED. By analyzing the modified vacuum polarization tensor, threeamplitudes; the (identical) QED vacuum polarization tensor and the (closelyrelated) $AVV$ triangular amplitude. These amplitudes are evaluated in theirmost general form (to include in our discussion automatically the question ofambiguities) on the point of view of a strategy to manipulate and calculatedivergent amplitudes that can avoid the explicit calculation of divergentintegrals. Rather than this only general properties are used in intermediarysteps. With this treatment, the results obtained by others authors can beeasily recovered and we show that, if we choose to impose U(1) gauge invariancemaintenance in the pure QED calculated amplitudes, to be consistent with therenormalizability, the induced Chern-Simons term assumes a nonvanishingambiguities free value. However if, in addition, we choose to get an answerconsistent with renormalizability by anomaly cancellation of the Standard Modela vanishing value can be obtained, in accordance with what was previouslyconjectured by other authors.
