In this talk we review the harmonic space formulation of the twistortransform for the supersymmetric self-dual Yang-Mills equations. The recentlyestablished harmonic-twistor correspondence for the N-extended supersymmetricgauge theories is described. It affords an explicit construction of solutionsto these equations which displays a remarkable matreoshka-like structuredetermined by the N=0 core.
