Inspired by our previous finding that supersymmetric Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons(SYM-CS) theory dimensionally reduced to 1+1 dimensions possesses approximateBogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) states, we study the analogous phenomenonin the three-dimensional theory. Approximate BPS states in two dimensions havemasses which are nearly independent of the Yang-Mills coupling and proportionalto their average number of partons. These states are a reflection of theexactly massless BPS states of the underlying pure SYM theory. In threedimensions we find that this mechanism leads to anomalously light bound states.While the mass scale is still proportional to the average number of partonstimes the square of the CS coupling, the average number of partons in thesebound states changes with the Yang-Mills coupling. Therefore, the masses ofthese states are not independent of the coupling. Our numerical calculationsare done using supersymmetric discrete light-cone quantization (SDLCQ).
