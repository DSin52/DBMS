This paper discusses multi-skyrmions on the 3-sphere with variable radius Lusing the rational map ansatz. For baryon number B = 3,...,9 this ansatzproduces the lowest energy solutions known so far. By considering the geometryof the model we find an approximate analytic formula for the shape function.This provides an insight why skyrmions have a shell-like structure.
