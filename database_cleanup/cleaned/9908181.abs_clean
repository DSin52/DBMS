We study spin one particles interacting through a Chern-Simons field. In theBorn approximation, we calculate the two body scattering amplitude consideringminimally coupled to a Chern-Simons field, (b) the model obtained from (a) byreplacing the Proca's mass by a Chern-Simons term and (c) a complexMaxwell-Chern-Simons model minimally coupled to a Chern-Simons field. In thelow energy regime the results show similarities with the Aharonov-Bohmscattering for spin 1/2 particles. We discuss the one loop renormalizationprogram for the Proca's model. In spite of the bad ultraviolet behavior of thematter field propagator, we show that, up to one loop the model is powercounting renormalizable thanks to the Ward identities satisfied by theinteraction vertices.
