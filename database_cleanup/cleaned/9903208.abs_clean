A recently proposed model of confining strings has a non-local world-sheetaction induced by a space-time Kalb-Ramond tensor field. Here we show that, inthe large-D approximation, an infinite set of ghost- and tachyon-freetruncations of the derivative expansion of this action all lead to c=1 models.Their infrared limit describes smooth strings with world-sheets of Hausdorffdimension D_H=2 and long-range orientational order, as expected for QCDstrings.
