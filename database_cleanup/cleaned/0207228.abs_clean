We consider the construction of nonsingular Pre-Big-Bang and Ekpyrotic typecosmological models realized by the addition to the action of specifichigher-order terms stemming from quantum corrections. We study models involvinggeneral relativity coupled to a single scalar field with a potential motivatedby the Ekpyrotic scenario. We find that the inclusion of the string loop andquantum correction terms in the string frame makes it possible to obtainsolutions of the variational equations which are nonsingular and bouncing inthe Einstein frame, even when a negative exponential potential is present, asis the case in the Ekpyrotic scenario. We analyze the spectra of perturbationsproduced during the bouncing phase and find that the spectrum of curvaturefluctuations in the model proposed originally to implement the Ekpyroticscenario has a large blue tilt ($n_R= 3$). Except for instabilities introducedon small scales, the result agrees with what is obtained by imposing continuityof the induced metric and of the extrinsic curvature across a constant scalarfield (up to $k^2$ corrections equal to the constant energy density) matchingsurface between the contracting and the expanding Einstein Universes. We alsodiscuss nonsingular cosmological solutions obtained when a Gauss-Bonnet termwith a coefficient suitably dependent on the scalar matter field is added tothe action in the Einstein frame with a potential for the scalar field present.
