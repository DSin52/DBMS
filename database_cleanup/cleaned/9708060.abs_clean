In a wide class of supersymmetric theories degenerate families of theBPS-saturated domain walls exist. The internal structure of these walls cancontinuously vary, without changing the wall tension. This is described byhidden parameters (collective coordinates). Differentiating with respect to thecollective coordinates one gets a set of the bosonic zero modes localized onthe wall. Neither of them is related to the spontaneous breaking of anysymmetry. Through the residual 1/2 of supersymmetry each bosonic zero modegenerates a fermionic partner.
