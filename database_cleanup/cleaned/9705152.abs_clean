We present a lattice formulation which gives super Yang-Mills theories in anydimensions with simple supersymmetry as well as extended supersymmetry in thecontinuum limit without fine-tuning. We first formulate super Yang-Millstheories with simple supersymmetry in 3,4,6,10 dimensions, incorporating thegluino on the lattice using the overlap formalism. In 4D, exact chiral symmetryforbids gluino mass, which ensures that the continuum limit is supersymmetricwithout fine-tuning. In 3D, exact parity invariance plays the same role. 6D and10D thories being anomalous, we formulate them as anomalous chiral gaugetheories as they are. Dimensional reduction within lattice formulation is thenapplied to the theories in 3,4,6 and 10D to obtain super Yang-Mills theories inarbitrary dimensions with either simple or extended supersymmetry.
