An irreducible Hamiltonian BRST approach to topologically coupled p- and(p+1)-forms is developed. The irreducible setting is enforced by means ofconstructing an irreducible Hamiltonian first-class model that is equivalentfrom the BRST point of view to the original redundant theory. The irreduciblepath integral can be brought to a manifestly Lorentz covariant form.
