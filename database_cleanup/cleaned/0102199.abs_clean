In this report we introduce the basic techniques (of the Closed Time Path -Coarse Grained Effective Action CTP-CGEA) and ideas (scaling, coarse-grainingand backreaction) behind the treatment of quantum processes in dynamicalbackground spacetimes and fields. We show how they are useful for theconstruction of renormalization group (RG) theories for studying thesenonequilibrium processes and discuss the underlying issues. Examples are drawnfrom quantum field processes in an inflationary universe, semiclassicalcosmology and stochastic gravity. In Part I we show how eternal inflation canbe treated as static critical phenomena, while a `slow-roll' or power-lawinflation can be treated as dynamical critical phenomena. In Part II weintroduce the key concepts in open systems and discuss the relation ofcoarse-graining and backreaction. In Part III we present the CTP - CGEA. Weperform perturbative and nonperturbative evaluations, and show how to derive RGequations. In Part IV, we use the RG equations to derive the Einstein-Langevinequation in stochastic semiclassical gravity. We end with a discussion on why astochastic component of RG equations is expected for nonequilibrium processes
