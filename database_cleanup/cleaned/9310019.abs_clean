We consider N=2 and N=4 supersymmetric gauge theories in two-dimensions,coupled to matter multiplets. In analogy with the N=2 case also in the N=4 caseone can introduce Fayet-Iliopoulos terms.The associated three-parameters havethe meaning of momentum-map levels in a HyperK\"ahler quotient construction.Differently from the N=2 case, however, the N=4 has a single phasecorresponding to an effective $\sigma$-model. There is no Landau-Ginzburgphase. The main possible application of our N=4 model is to an effectiveLagrangian construction of a $\sigma$-model on ALE-manifolds. We discuss the Aand B topological twists of these models clarifying some issues not yetdiscussed in the literature, in particular the identification of thetopological systems emerging from the twist. Applying our results to the caseof ALE-manifolds we indicate how one can use the topologically twisted theoriesto study the K\"ahler class and complex structure deformations of thesegravitational instantons.
