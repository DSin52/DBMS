We propose a classification of critical behaviours of branched polymers forarbitrary topology. We show that in an appropriately defined double scalinglimit the singular part of the partition function is universal. We calculatethis partition function exactly in the generic case and perturbativelyotherwise. In the discussion section we comment on the relation betweenbranched polymer theory and Euclidean quantum gravity.
