Certain classes of chiral four-dimensional gauge theories may be obtained asthe worldvolume theories of D5-branes suspended between networks of NS5-branes,the so-called brane box models. In this paper, we derive the stringyconsistency conditions placed on these models, and show that they areequivalent to anomaly cancellation of the gauge theories. We derive theseconditions in the orbifold theories which are T-dual to the elliptic brane boxmodels. Specifically, we show that the expression for tadpoles for unphysicaltwisted Ramond-Ramond 4-form fields in the orbifold theory are proportional tothe gauge anomalies of the brane box theory. Thus string consistency isequivalent to worldvolume gauge anomaly cancellation. Furthermore, we findadditional cylinder amplitudes which give the $\beta$-functions of the gaugetheory. We show how these correspond to bending of the NS-branes in the branebox theory.
