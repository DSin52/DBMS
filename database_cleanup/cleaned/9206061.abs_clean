We present a concise method to construct a BRST invariant action for thetopological quantum field theories in the Batalin-Vilkovisky antifieldformalism. The BV action that is a solution for the master equation is directlyobtained by means of the extended forms that involve all the required ghostsand antifields. The BV actions for the non-abelian $BF$ theories (in 4 andhigher dimensions) and the Chern-Simons theory are constructed by means of theextended form method. An extension of the $BF$ theory in 4-dimensions toinclude a ``cosmological term'' is also examined and the close connection withthe topological Yang-Mills theory is indicated.
