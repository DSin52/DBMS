The duality properties of perturbative string characters associated with thetransverse space-time rotations are studied. T duality is achieved by suitablyintegrating over the total momentum, contrary to earlier discussions. The O(8)triality properties of the characters for critical superstrings, are derived.This shows the existence of a third formulation (unnoticed so far to ourknowledge) equivalent to, but different from the ones of Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond,and Green-Schwarz. Projectors in the NS and R sectors are defined in the GSformalism. The consequences of supersymmetry are neatly derived at once for allmassive states by factorising the character of the long SUSY multiplet.
