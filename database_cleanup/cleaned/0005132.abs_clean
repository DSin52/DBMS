We consider an action for a closed, bosonic, p-brane, where the brane tensionis not an assigned parameter but rather it is induced by a maximal rank gaugep-form. This model is classically equivalent to the Nambu--Goto/Howe-Tuckermodel. We investigate how this classical equivalence can be implemented in thepath integral framework. For this purpose we adopt a ``first order''integration procedure over gauge p-forms and a ``shortened'' Fadeev-Popovprocedure.
