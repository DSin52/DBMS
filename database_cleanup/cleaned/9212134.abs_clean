Inspired by the formulation of the Batalin-Vilkovisky method of quantizationin terms of ``odd time'', we show that for a class of gauge theories which arefirst order in the derivatives, the kinetic term is bilinear in the fields, andthe interaction part satisfies some properties, it is possible to give thesolution of the master equation in a very simple way. To clarify the generalprocedure we discuss its application to Yang-Mills theory, massive (abelian)theory in the Stueckelberg formalism, relativistic particle and to theself-interacting antisymmetric tensor field.
