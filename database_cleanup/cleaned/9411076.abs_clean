Title: Singularities in Graviton-Dilaton System

Parameters and the Cosmological ConstantComments: 23 pages. Latex File, process twice. Revised version

discussion on naked singularities is added in section 3; a note and some newreferences addedTCD-9-94; October 1994Alternatives to Einstein's theory of general relativity can be distinguishedby measuring the parametrised post Newtonian parameters. Two such parameters$\beta$ and $\gamma$, equal to one in Einstein theory, can be obtained fromstatic spherically symmetric solutions. For the graviton-dilaton system, as inBrans-Dicke or low energy string theory, we find that if $\gamma \ne 1$ for acharge neutral point star, then there exist naked singularities. Thus, if$\gamma$ is measured to be different from one, then it cannot be explained bythese theories, without implying naked singularities. We also couple acosmological constant $\Lambda$ to the graviton-dilaton system, a la stringtheory. We find that static spherically symmetric solutions in low energystring theory, which describe the gravitational field of a point star in thereal universe atleast upto a distance $r_* \simeq {\cal O} ({\rm pc})$, alwayslead to curvature singularities. These singularities are stable and much worsethan the naked ones. Requiring their absence upto a distance $r_*$ implies abound $| \Lambda | < 10^{- 102} (\frac{r_*}{{\rm pc}})^{- 2}$ in natural units.If $r_* \simeq 1 {\rm Mpc}$ then $| \Lambda | < 10^{- 114}$, and if $r_*$extends all the way upto the edge of the universe ($10^{28} {\rm cm}$) then $|\Lambda | < 10^{- 122}$ in natural units.
