We present the extension of the Lagrangian loop gauge invariantrepresentation in such a way to include matter fields. The partition functionof lattice compact U(1)-Higgs model is expressed as a sum over closed as muchas open surfaces. We have simulated numerically the loop action equivalent tothe Villain form of the action and mapped out the beta-gamma phase diagram ofthis model.
