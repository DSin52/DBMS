The gauge symmetry inherent in the concept of manifold has been discussed.Within the scope of this symmetry the linear connection or displacement fieldcan be considered as a natural gauge field on the manifold. The gauge invariantequations for the displacement field have been derived. It has been shown thatthe energy-momentum tensor of this field conserves and hence the displacementfield can be treated as one that transports energy and gravitates. To show theexistence of the solutions of the field equations we have derived the generalform of the displacement field in Minkowski space-time which is invariant underrotation and space and time inversion. With this anzats we foundspherically-symmetric solutions of the equations in question.
