This paper is an extended version of our previous short letter \cite{ZG2} andis attempted to give a detailed account for the results presented in thatpaper. Let $U_q({\cal G}^{(1)})$ be the quantized nontwisted affine Lie algebraand $U_q({\cal G})$ be the corresponding quantum simple Lie algebra. Using theprevious obtained universal $R$-matrix for $U_q(A_1^{(1)})$ and$U_q(A_2^{(1)})$, we determine the explicitly spectral-dependent universal$R$-matrix for $U_q(A_1)$ and $U_q(A_2)$. We apply these spectral-dependentuniversal $R$-matrix to some concrete representations. We then reproduce thewell-known results for the fundamental representations and we are also able toderive for the first time the extreamly explicit and compact formula of thespectral-dependent $R$-matrix for the adjoint representation of $U_q(A_2)$, thesimplest nontrival case when the tensor product of the representations is {\emnot} multiplicity-free.
