By considering constraints on the dimensions of the Lie algebra correspondingto the weight one states of Z_2 and Z_3 orbifold models arising from imposingthe appropriate modular properties on the graded characters of theautomorphisms on the underlying conformal field theory, we propose a set ofconstructions of all but one of the 71 self-dual meromorphic bosonic conformalfield theories at central charge 24. In the Z_2 case, this leads to anextension of the neighborhood graph of the even self-dual lattices in 24dimensions to conformal field theories, and we demonstrate that the graphbecomes disconnected.
