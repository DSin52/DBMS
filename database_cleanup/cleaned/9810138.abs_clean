We put forward the following, physically motivated premise for constructing aEuler-Lagrange equations of such a theory formally resemble some equations ofmotion underlying fluid-dynamics equations in the kinetic theory of gases.Following this premise, we point out Lorentz-invariant Lagrangians whoseEuler-Lagrange equations contain a subsystem equivalent to the Euler-Lagrangeequations of the standard model with covariantly regularized propagators.
