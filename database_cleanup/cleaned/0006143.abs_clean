Title: Global calculus in BRST cohomology

Authors: G.Giachetta, L.Mangiarotti and G.Sardanashvily

Comments: 15 pages

The iterated BRST cohomology is studied by computing cohomology of thevariational complex on the infinite order jet space of a smooth fibre bundle.This computation also provides a solution of the global inverse problem of thecalculus of variations in Lagrangian field theory.
