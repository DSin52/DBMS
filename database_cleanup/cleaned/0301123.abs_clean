presentationA holographic interpretation for some specific Ricci flat string backgroundsof the form $A_6\times C_4$ is proposed. The conjecture is that there is aFour-dimensional Euclidean Conformal Field Theory (ECFT) defined on acodimension two {\em submanifold} of the manifold $A_6$ (where one of the tworemaining {\em holographic} coordinates of $A_6$ is timelike, and the other onespacelike), with central charge proportional to the radius of curvature of thesix-dimensional manifold, $c\sim l^4$.
