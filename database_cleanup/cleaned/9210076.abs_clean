We study the problem of string propagation in a general instanton backgroundfor the case of the complete heterotic superstring. We define the concept ofgeneralized HyperK\" ahler manifolds and we relate it to (4,4) superconformaltheories. We propose a generalized h-map construction that predicts a universalSU(6) symmetry for the modes of the string excitations moving in an instantonbackground. We also discuss the role of abstract $N$=4 moduli and, applying itto the particular limit case of the solvable SU(2) X R instanton found byCallan et al. we show that it admits deformations and corresponds to a point ina 16-dimensional moduli space. The geometrical characterization of the otherspaces in the same moduli-space remains an outstanding problem.
