The quantum evolution equations for the field expectation value areanalytically solved to cubic order in the field amplitude and to one-loop levelin the lambda phi-fourth model. We adapt and use the renormalization group (RG)method for such non-linear and non-local equations. The time dependence of thefield expectation value is explicitly derived integrating the RG equations. Itis shown that the field amplitude for late times approaches a finite limit asthe time to the power -3/2. This limiting value is expressed as a function ofthe initial field amplitude.
