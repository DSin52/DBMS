The use of the mass term as a gauge fixing term has been studied byZwanziger, Parrinello and Jona-Lasinio, which is related to the non-lineargauge $A_{\mu}^{2}=\lambda$ of Dirac and Nambu in the large mass limit. We haverecently shown that this modified quantization scheme is in fact identical tothe conventional {\em local} Faddeev-Popov formula {\em without} taking thelarge mass limit, if one takes into account the variation of the gauge fieldalong the entire gauge orbit and if the Gribov complications can be ignored.This suggests that the classical massive vector theory, for example, isinterpreted in a more flexible manner either as a gauge invariant theory with agauge fixing term added, or as a conventional massive non-gauge theory. As formassive gauge particles, the Higgs mechanics, where the mass term is gaugeinvariant, has a more intrinsic meaning.It is suggested to extend the notion of quantum gauge symmetry (BRST symmetry)not only to classical gauge theory but also to a wider class of theories whosegauge symmetry is broken by some extra terms in the classical action. Wecomment on the implications of this extended notion of quantum gauge symmetry.
