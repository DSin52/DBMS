We propose a generalization of the stochastic gauge fixing procedure for thestochastic quantization of gauge theories where not only the drift term of thestochastic process is changed but also the Wiener process itself. All gaugeinvariant expectation values remain unchanged. As an explicit example we studythe case of an abelian gauge field coupled with three bosonic matter fields in0+1 dimensions. We nonperturbatively prove quivalence with the path integralformalism.
