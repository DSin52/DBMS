We pursue the study of the type IIB matrix model as a constructive definitionof superstring. In this paper, we justify the interpretation of space-time asdistribution of eigenvalues of the matrices by showing that some low energyexcitations indeed propagate in it. In particular, we show that if thedistribution consists of small clusters of size $n$, low energy theory acquireslocal SU(n) gauge symmetry and a plaquette action for the associated gaugeboson is induced, in addition to a gauge invariant kinetic term for a masslessfermion in the adjoint representation of the SU(n). We finally argue a possibleidentification of the diffeomorphism symmetry with permutation group acting onthe set of eigenvalues, and show that the general covariance is realized in thelow energy effective theory even though we do not have a manifest generalcovariance in the IIB matrix model action.
