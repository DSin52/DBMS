Title: Integrable Many-Body Systems of Calogero-Moser-Sutherland Type in High

DimensionComments: amstex, no figures

A new series of integrable cases of the many-body problem in many-dimensionalspaces is found. That series appears as a part of the larger series ofintegrable problems, which are in 1-1 correspondence with Krichever-Novikovalgebras of affine type (that is with pairs each one consisting of some finiteroot system and some Riemann surface of finite genus with two marked points).
