We investigate the quantum theory of 1+1 dimensional dilaton gravity, whichis an interesting toy model of the black hole dynamics. The functional measuresof gravity part are explicitly evaluated and derive the Wheeler-DeWitt likeequations as physical state conditions. In ADM formalism the measures are veryambiguous, but in our formalism they are explicitly defined. Then the newfeatures which are not seen in ADM formalism come out. A singularity appears at$\df^2 =\kappa (>0) $, where $\kappa =(N-51/2)/12 $ and $ N$ is the number ofmatter fields. At the final stage of the black hole evaporation, the Liouvilleterm becomes important, which just comes from the measures of the fields.Behind the singularity the quantum mechanical region $\kappa > \df^2 >0 $extends, where the sign of the kinetic term in the Wheeler-DeWitt like equationchanges. If $\kappa <0 $, the singularity disappears. We briefly discuss thepossibility of gravitational tunneling and the issue of the information loss.(Talk given at "YITP Workshop on Theories of Quantum Fields -BeyondPerturbation-", Kyoto, Japan, 14-17 July 1992.Some misleading arguments in the preprint UT-Komaba 92-7 entitled "QuamtumTheory of Dilaton Gravity in 1+1 Dimensions" are corrected. The several remarkson the quantization are included. The difference from the other quantum theoryis clarified.
