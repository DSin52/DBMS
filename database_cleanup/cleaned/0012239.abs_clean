A V-duality conjecture for noncommutative open string theories (NCOS) thatresult from decoupling D-branes in Lorentz-boost related backgrounds was putforward recently in hep-th/0006013. The aim of this paper is to test theGalilean nature of this conjecture in the gravity dual setup. We start with an(F, D3) bound state Lorentz-boosted along one D3-brane direction perpendicularto the F-string, and show that insisting a decoupled NCOS allows onlyinfinitesimal Lorentz boosts. In this way, it is shown that the V-dualityrelates a family of NCOS by Galileo boosts. Starting with a Lorentz-boosted(D1,D3) bound state, we show that a similar V-duality works for noncommutativeYang-Mills (NCYM) theories as well. In addition, we deduce by a holographyargument that the running string tension, as a function of the energy scale,for NCOS (or NCYM) remains unchanged under V-duality.
