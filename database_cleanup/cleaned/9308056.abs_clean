The recently obtained results in \cite{ZG2} are used to compute theexplicitly spectral-dependent $R$-matrix (or the intertwiners) on$V_{(6)}(x)\otimes V_{(6)}(y)$ and $V_{(3)}(x)\otimes V_{(6)}(y)$, where$V_{(6)}$ and $V_{(3)}$ are the 6-dimensional and fundamental representationsof $U_q(A_2)$, respectively. It appears that the $R$-matrix on$V_{(3)}(x)\otimes V_{(6)}(y)$ depends on $q$ in the different way from whatseems to be the first example in literatures of $R$-matrix with the newfeature.
