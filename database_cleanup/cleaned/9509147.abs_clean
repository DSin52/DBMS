A discussion of an extended class of higher-derivative classical theories ofgravity is presented. A procedure is given for exhibiting the new propagatingdegrees of freedom, at the full non-linear level, by transforming thehigher-derivative action to a canonical second-order form. For generalfourth-order theories, described by actions which are general functions of thescalar curvature, the Ricci tensor and the full Riemann tensor, it is shownthat the higher-derivative theories may have multiple stable vacua. The vacuaare shown to be, in general, non-trivial, corresponding to deSitter oranti-deSitter solutions of the original theory. It is also shown that aroundany vacuum the elementary excitations remain the massless graviton, a massivescalar field and a massive ghost-like spin-two field. The analysis is extendedto actions which are arbitrary functions of terms of the form $\nabla^{2k}R$,and it is shown that such theories also have a non-trivial vacuum structure.
