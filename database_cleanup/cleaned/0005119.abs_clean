We study the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen string in N=2 supersymmetric QED withN=2-preserving superpotential, in which case the Abrikosov string is found tobe 1/2-BPS saturated. Adding a quadratic small perturbation in thesuperpotential breaks N=2 supersymmetry to N=1 supersymmetry. Then theAbrikosov string is no longer BPS saturated. The difference between the stringtensions for the non-BPS and BPS saturated situation is found to be negative tothe first order of the perturbation parameter.
