The behaviour of solitons in integrable theories is strongly constrained bythe integrability of the theory; i.e. by the existence of an infinite number ofconserved quantities which these theories are known to possess. One usuallyexpects the scattering of solitons in such theories to be rather simple, i.e.trivial. By contrast, in this paper we generate new soliton solutions for theplanar integrable chiral model whose scattering properties are highlynontrivial; more precisely, in head-on collisions of $N$ indistinguishablesolitons the scattering angle (of the emerging structures relative to theincoming ones) is $\pi/N$. We also generate soliton-antisoliton solutions withelastic scattering; in particular, a head-on collision of a soliton and anantisoliton resulting in $90^0$ scattering.
