(Proposition 1.3, Remarks 2.1 and 1.2 etc.)The zero modes of the chiral SU(n) WZNW model give rise to an intertwiningquantum matrix algebra A generated by an n x n matrix a=(a^i_\alpha) (withnoncommuting entries) and by rational functions of n commuting elementsq^{p_i}. We study a generalization of the Fock space (F) representation of Afor generic q (q not a root of unity) and demonstrate that it gives rise to amodel of the quantum universal enveloping algebra U_q(sl_n), each irreduciblerepresentation entering F with multiplicity 1. For an integer level k thecomplex parameter q is an even root of unity, q^h=-1 (h=k+n) and the algebra Ahas an ideal I_h such that the factor algebra A_h = A/I_h is finitedimensional.
