The universal field equations introduced by the author and his collaborators,which admit infinitely many inequivalent Lagrangian formulations are shown toarise as consistency conditions for the existence of non-trivial solutions tothe quasi-linear equations, called equations of hydrodynamic type by Novikov ,Dubrovin and others. The solutions in closed form are only implicit. A methoddue to Stokes, which is in essence just Fourier Analysis is resurrected forapplication to those equations. With the benefit of algebraic computationfacilities, this method, allows the general structure of power series solutionsto be conjectured.
