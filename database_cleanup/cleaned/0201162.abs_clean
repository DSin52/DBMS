We present a complete relativistic analysis for the scalar radiation emittedby a particle in circular orbit around a Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter blackhole. If the black hole is large, then the radiation is concentrated in narrowangles- high multipolar distribution- i.e., the radiation is synchrotronic.black hole regime, the radiation is concentrated in low multipoles. There is atransition mass at $M=0.427 R$, where $R$ is the AdS radius. This behavior isnew, it is not present in asymptotically flat spacetimes.
