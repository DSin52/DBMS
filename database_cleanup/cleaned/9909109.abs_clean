We study a ${{\IZ}}_2$ orbifold of Type 0B string theory by reflection of sixof the coordinates (this theory may also be thought of as a ${{\IZ}}_4$orbifold of Type IIB string theory by a rotation by $\pi$ in three independentplanes). We show that the only massless mode localized on the fixed fourplane$\IR^{3,1}$ is a U(1) gauge field. After introducing D3-branes parallel to thefixed fourplane we find non-supersymmetric non-abelian gauge theories on theirworldvolume. One of our results is that the theory on equal numbers of electricand magnetic D3-branes placed at the fourplane is the ${{\IZ}}_4$ orbifold of${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory by the center of its R-symmetrygroup.
