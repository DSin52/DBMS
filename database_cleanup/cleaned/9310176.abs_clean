Commuting ObservablesAuthors: Lev Vaidman

Comments: 12 pages, for Proceedings of SFMP, Cologne 1993#

The concept of ``elements of reality" is analyzed within the framework ofquantum theory. It is shown that elements of reality fail to fulfill theproduct rule. This is the core of recent proofs of the impossibility of aLorentz-invariant interpretation of quantum mechanics. A generalization andextension of the concept of elements of reality is presented.Lorentz-invariance is restored by giving up the product rule. The consequencesof giving up the ``and" rule, which must be abandoned together with the productrule, are discussed.
