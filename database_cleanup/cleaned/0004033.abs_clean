The idea of ``soft'' confinement when the lifetime of hadron with respect toquark-gluon channel of decay is greater or at least of the order of somecharacteristic time for our Universe is considered. Within the framework of amodel of three nonlinearly interacting fields the explicit form of an effectivepotential is found. It provides the confinement of a massive particle withinthe limited region of space by means of constant component of the potentialwhich arises as a result of reorganization of vacuum of one of the scalarfields. It is shown that the lifetime of hadron being equal to the age of theUniverse leads to the Higgs boson with the mass m > 63.7 GeV and realisticself-constant.
