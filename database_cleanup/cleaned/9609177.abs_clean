Unitary irreducible representation of the group SO(1,2) is obtained in themixed basis, i.e. between the compact and noncompact basis and the new additiontheorems are derived which are required in path integral applications involvingthe positively signed potential. The Green function for the potential barrier$V=cosh^{-2}\omega x$ is evaluated from the path integration over the cosetspace SO(1,2)/K where K is the compact subgroup. The transition and thereflection coefficients are given. Results for the moving barrier$V=\cosh^{-2}\omega (x-g_0t)$ are also presented.
