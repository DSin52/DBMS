We introduce a basis for a bi-dimensional finite matrix calculus and abi-dimensional finite matrix action principle. As an application, we analyzescalar and spinorial fields in $D=4n+2$ in this approach. We verify that toestablish a bi-dimensional matrix action principle we have to define aDirac-algebra-modified Lebniz rule. From the bi-dimensional equations ofmotion, we obtain a matrix holomorphic feature for massless matrix scalar andspinorial fields.
