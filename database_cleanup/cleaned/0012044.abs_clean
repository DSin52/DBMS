In brane-world cosmologies of Randall-Sundrum type, we show that evolution oflarge-scale curvature perturbations may be determined on the brane, withoutsolving the bulk perturbation equations. The influence of the bulkgravitational field on the brane is felt through a projected Weyl tensor whichbehaves effectively like an imperfect radiation fluid with anisotropic stress.We define curvature perturbations on uniform density surfaces for both thematter and Weyl fluids, and show that their evolution on large scales followsdirectly from the energy conservation equations for each fluid. The totalcurvature perturbation is not necessarily constant for adiabatic matterperturbations, but can change due to the Weyl entropy perturbation. To relatethis curvature perturbation to the longitudinal gauge metric potentialsrequires knowledge of the Weyl anisotropic stress which is not determined bythe equations on the brane. We discuss the implications for large-angleanisotropies on the cosmic microwave background sky.
