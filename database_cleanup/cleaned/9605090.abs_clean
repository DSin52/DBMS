We find the nonperturbative relation between $\langle {\rm tr} \phi^2\rangle$, $\langle {\rm tr} \phi^3\rangle$ the prepotential ${\cal F}$ andthe vevs $\langle \phi_i\rangle$ in $N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theorieswith gauge group $SU(3)$. Nonlinear differential equations for ${\cal F}$including the Witten -- Dijkgraaf -- Verlinde -- Verlinde equation areobtained. This indicates that $N=2$ SYM theories are essentially topologicalfield theories and that should be seen as low-energy limit of sometopological string theory. Furthermore, we construct relevant modularinvariant quantities, derive canonical relations between the periods andinvestigate the structure of the beta function by giving its explicit form inthe moduli coordinates. In doing this we discuss the uniformization problemfor the quantum moduli space.  The method we propose can be generalized to$N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with higher rank gauge groups.
