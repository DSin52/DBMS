Canonical quantization of abelian BF-type topological field theory coupled toextended sources on generic d-dimensional manifolds and with curved linebundles is studied. Sheaf cohomology is used to construct the appropriatetopological extension of the action and the topological flux quantizationconditions, in terms of the Cech cohomology of the underlying spatial manifold,as required for topological invariance of the quantum field theory. Thewavefunctions are found in the Hamiltonian formalism and are shown to carrymulti-dimensional representations of various topological groups of the space.Expressions for generalized linking numbers in any dimension are therebyderived. In particular, new global aspects of motion group presentations areobtained in any dimension. Applications to quantum exchange statistics ofobjects in various dimensionalities are also discussed.
