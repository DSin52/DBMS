Title: On group averaging for non-compact groups

Authors: Andres Gomberoff

Comments: 5 pages, for the proceedings of the 9th Marcel Grossmann Conference,

Rome 2000We review some aspects of the use of a technique known as group averaging,which provides a tool for the study of constrained systems. We focus ourattention on the case where the gauge group is non-compact, and a`renormalized' group averaging method must be introduced. We discuss theconnection between superselection sectors and the rate of divergence of thegroup averaging integral.
