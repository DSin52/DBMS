132-147We represent Feigin's construction [22] of lattice W algebras and give some$g=sl(2)$ we introduce whole $U_q(sl(2))$ quantum group on this lattice. Wefind simplest two-dimensional module as well as exchange relations and definelattice Virasoro algebra as algebra of invariants of $U_q(sl(2))$. Anothergeneralization is connected with lattice integrals of motion as the invariantsof quantum affine group $U_q(\hat{n}_{+})$. We show that Volkov's scheme leadsto the system of difference equations for the function from non-commutativevariables.
