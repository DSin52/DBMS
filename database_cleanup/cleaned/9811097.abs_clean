By solving the equations of motion of massive $p$-form potential inAnti-de-Sitter space and using the $AdS/CFT$ correspondence of Maldacena, thegenerating functional of two-point correlation functions of the currents isobtained. When the mass parameter vanishes the result agrees with the knownmassless case.
