We analyze the Poisson structure of the time-dependent mean-field equationsfor bosons and construct the Lie-Poisson bracket associated to these equations.The latter follow from the time-dependent variational principle of Balian andVeneroni when a gaussian Ansatz is chosen for the density operator. We performa stability analysis of both the full and the linearized equations. We alsosearch for the canonically conjugate variables. In certain cases, the evolutionequations can indeed be cast in a Hamiltonian form.
