We review and extend the computation of scattering amplitudes of tachyons inthe $c=1$ matrix model using a manifestly finite prescription for thecollective field hamiltonian. We give further arguments for the exactness ofthe cubic hamiltonian by demonstrating the equality of the loop corrections inthe collective field theory with those calculated in the fermionic picture.
