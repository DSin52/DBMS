Title: Quantum Effect of Auxiliary Fields to the Gap Equation in the

Nambu-Jona-Lasinio ModelAuthors: Taro Kashiwa, Tomohiko Sakaguchi

Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures

Quantum effect of auxiliary fields is considered for the gap equation of theNambu-Jona-Lasinio model with N-component fermions in 3 as well as 4dimensions. N is not assumed so large but regarded as a loop-expansionparameter. The one-loop, O(1/N), contribution of auxiliary fields enhances thechiral symmetry breaking in both cases except the massless region where loopintegrals are infrared divergent. Dependence on momentum shift, necessarilyarising in loop graphs under cutoff theories, is also studied but difference isnot significant.
