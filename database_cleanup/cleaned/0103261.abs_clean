A regularized model of the double compactified D=11 supermembrane withnontrivial winding in terms of SU(N) valued maps is obtained. The condition ofnontrivial winding is described in terms of a nontrivial line bundle introducedin the formulation of the compactified supermembrane. The multivaluedgeometrical objects of the model related to the nontrivial wrapping aredescribed in terms of a SU(N) geometrical object which in the $ N\to \infty$limit, converges to the symplectic connection related to the area preservingdiffeomorphisms of the recently obtained non-commutative description of thecompactified D=11 supermembrane.(I. Martin, J.Ovalle, A. Restuccia. 2000,2001)The SU(N) regularized canonical lagrangian is explicitly obtained. In the $N\to \infty$ limit it converges to the lagrangian in (I.Martin, J.Ovalle,A.Restuccia. 2000,2001) subject to the nontrivial winding condition. Thespectrum of the hamiltonian of the double compactified D=11 supermembrane isdiscussed.Generically, it contains local string like spikes with zero energy.However the sector of the theory corresponding to a principle bundlecharacterized by the winding number $n \neq 0$, described by the SU(N) model wepropose, is shown to have no local string-like spikes and hence the spectrum ofthis sector should be discrete.
