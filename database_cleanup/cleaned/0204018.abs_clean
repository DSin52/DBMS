Comments: 17 pages, LATEX 2e. Invited talk given at the International Symposium

"30 Years of Supersymmetry" (Theoretical Physics Institute, University ofMinnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA, 13-27 October, 2000) due to the supportkindly offered by the Organizing Committee of this meeting and, especially,by Keith Olive and Mikhail ShifmanJournal-ref: Nucl.Phys.Proc.Suppl. 101 (2001) 26-42

Some applications of the odd Poisson bracket developed by Kharkov's theoristsare represented, including the reformulation of classical Hamiltonian dynamics,the description of hydrodynamics as a Hamilton system by means of the oddbracket and the dynamics formulation with the Grassmann-odd Lagrangian. Quantumrepresentations of the odd bracket are also constructed and applied for thequantization of classical systems based on the odd bracket and for therealization of the idea of a composite spinor structure of space-time. At last,the linear odd bracket, corresponding to a semi-simple Lie group, is introducedon the Grassmann algebra.
