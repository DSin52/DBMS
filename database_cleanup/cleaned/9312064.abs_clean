The field theory quantized on the {\it light-front} is compared with theconventional equal-time quantized theory. The arguments based on the {\itmicrocausality} principle imply that the light-front field theory may becomenonlocal with respect to the longitudinal coordinate even though thecorresponding equal-time formulation is local. This is found to be the case forthe scalar theory which is quantized by following the Dirac procedure. In spiteof the different mechanisms of the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the twoforms of dynamics they result in the same physical content. The phasetransition in {$(\phi^{4})_{2}$} theory is also discussed. The symmetric vacuumstate for vanishingly small couplings is found to turn into an unstablesymmetric one when the coupling is increased and may result in a phasetransition of the {\it second order} in contrast to the first order transitionconcluded from the usual variational methods.
