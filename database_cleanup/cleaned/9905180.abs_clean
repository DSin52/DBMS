The embedding of a Taub-NUT space in the directions transverse to the worldvolume of branes describes branes at (spherical) orbifold singularities.Similarly, the embedding of a pp-wave in the brane world volume yields an AdSorbifold. In case of the D1-D5--brane system, the AdS3 orbifolds yields a BTZblack hole; as we will show, the same holds for D3-branes corresponding toAdS5. In addition we will show that the AdS orbifolds and the sphericalorbifolds are U-dual to each other. However in contrast to spherical orbifoldsthe AdS orbifolds lead to a running coupling, which is in the IR inverse to thecoupling of the spherical orbifold. A discussion of the general pp-wavesolution in AdS space is added.
