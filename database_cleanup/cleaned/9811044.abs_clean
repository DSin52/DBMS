We use the graded eigenvalue method, a variant of the supersymmetrytechnique, to compute the universal spectral correlations of the QCD Diracoperator in the presence of massive dynamical quarks. The calculation is donefor the chiral Gaussian unitary ensemble of random matrix theory with anarbitrary Hermitian matrix added to the Dirac matrix. This case is of interestfor schematic models of QCD at finite temperature.
