There are two methods to study families of conformal theories in the operatorformalism. In the first method we begin with a theory and a family of deformedtheories is defined in the state space of the original theory. In the otherthere is a distinct state space for each theory in the family, with thecollection of spaces forming a vector bundle. This paper establishes theequivalence of a deformed theory with that in a nearby state space in thebundle via a connection that defines maps between nearby state spaces. We findthat an appropriate connection for establishing equivalence is one that arosein a recent paper by Kugo and Zwiebach. We discuss the affine geometry inducedon the space of backgrounds by this connection. This geometry is the same asthe one obtained from the Zamolodchikov metric.
