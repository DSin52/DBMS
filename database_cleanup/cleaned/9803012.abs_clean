The classical linearised gravitational self interaction of a Goto-Nambustring is examined in four spacetime dimensions. Using a conveniently gaugeindependent tensorial treatment, the divergent part of the self-force is shownto be exactly zero. This is due to cancelation by a contribution that wasneglected in the previous treatments. This result has implications for manyapplications.
