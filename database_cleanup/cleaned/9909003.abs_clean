Title: A Note on non-supersymmetric open-string orbifolds with a quantised B_ab

Comments: 4 pages, Latex + cargese.cls. To appear in the Proceedings of the

Cargese 99 School on "Progress in String Theory and M-Theory"In this short note we review the main features of open-string orbifolds witha quantised flux for the NS-NS antisymmetric tensor in the context of the opendescendants of non-supersymmetric asymmetric orbifolds with a vanishingcosmological constant.
