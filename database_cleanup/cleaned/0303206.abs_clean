A set of brackets for classical dissipative systems, subject to externalrandom forces, are derived. The method is inspired to the old procedure foundby Peierls, for deriving the canonical brackets of conservative systems,starting from an action principle. It is found that an adaptation of Peierls'method is applicable also to dissipative systems, when the friction term can bedescribed by a linear functional of the coordinates, as is the case in theclassical Langevin equation, with an arbitrary memory function. The generalexpression for the brackets satisfied by the coordinates, as well as by theexternal random forces, at different times, is determined, and it turns outthat they all satisfy the Jacobi identity. Upon quantization, these classicalbrackets are found to coincide with the commutation rules for the quantumLangevin equation, that have been obtained in the past, by appealing tomicroscopic conservative quantum models for the friction mechanism.
