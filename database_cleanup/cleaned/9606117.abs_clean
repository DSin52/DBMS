The non-Abelian analog of the classical Coulomb gas is discussed. Thestatistical mechanics of arrays of classical particles which transform undervarious representations of a non-Abelian gauge group and which interact throughnon-Abelian electric fields are considered. The problem is formulated on thelattice and, for the case of adjoint charges, it is solved in the large Nlimit. The explicit solution exhibits a first order confinement-de-confinementphase transition with computable properties. In one dimension, the solution hasa continuum limit which describes 1+1-dimensional quantum chromodynamics (QCD)with heavy adjoint matter.
