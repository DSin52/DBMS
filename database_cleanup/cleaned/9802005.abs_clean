We study membrane scattering in a curved space with non-zero M-momentump_{11} transfer. In the low-energy short-distance region, the membrane dynamicsis described by a three-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory. We studyan n-instanton process of the gauge theory, corresponding to the exchange of nunits of p_{11}, and compare the result with the scattering amplitude computedin the low-energy long-distance region using supergravity. We find that theybehave differently. We show that this result is not in contradiction with thelarge-N Matrix Theory conjecture, by pointing out that cutoff scales of thesupergravity and the gauge theory are complementary to each other.
