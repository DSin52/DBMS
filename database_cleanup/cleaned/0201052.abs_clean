Title: Clifford statistics and the temperature limit in the theory of

fractional quantum Hall effectAuthors: Andrei A. Galiautdinov (School of Physics, Georgia Institute of

Technology)Comments: 7 pages, no figures (title changed + numerous revisions)

Using the recently discovered Clifford statistics we propose a simple modelfor the grand canonical ensemble of the carriers in the theory of fractionalquantum Hall effect. The model leads to a temperature limit associated with thepermutational degrees of freedom of such an ensemble.We also relate Schur's theory of projective representations of the permutationgroups to physics, and remark on possible extensions of the second quantizationprocedure.
