In this note we prove the complete stability of the classical fluctuationmodes of the rotating ellipsoidal membrane. The analysis is carried out in thefull SU(N) setting, with the conclusion that the fluctuation matrix has onlypositive eigenvalues. This proves that the solution will remain close to theoriginal one for all time, under arbitrary infinitesimal perturbations of thegauge fields.
