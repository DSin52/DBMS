Born-Infeld theory admits finite energy point particle solutions with$\delta$-function sources, BIons. I discuss their role in the theory ofDirichlet $p$-branes as the ends of strings intersecting the brane when theeffects of gravity are ignored. There are also topologically non-trivialelectrically neutral catenoidal solutions looking like two $p$-branes joined bya throat. The general solution is a non-singular deformation of the catenoid ifthe charge is not too large and a singular deformation of the BIon solution forcharges above that limit. The intermediate solution is BPS and Coulomb-like.Performing a duality rotation we obtain monopole solutions, the BPS limit beinga solution of the abelian Bogolmol'nyi equations. The situation closelyresembles that of sub and super extreme black-brane solutions of thesupergravity theories. I also show that certain special Lagrangian submanifoldsof ${\Bbb C}^p$, $p=3,4,5$, may be regarded as supersymmetric configurationsconsisting of $p$-branes at angles joined by throats which are the sources ofglobal monopoles. Vortex solutions are also exhibited.
