The standard Klein bottle coefficient in the construction of open descendantsis shown to equal the Frobenius-Schur indicator of a conformal field theory.Other consistent Klein bottle projections are shown to correspond to simplecurrents. These observations enable us to generalize the standard open stringconstruction from C-diagonal parent theories to include non-standard Kleinbottles. Using (generalizations of) the Frobenius-Schur indicator we provepositivity and integrality of the resulting open and closed string statemultiplicities for standard as well as non-standard Klein bottles.
