We construct the Euclidean on-shell action for the five-dimensionalnon-extremal black hole with multiple electric charges. We show that thisthermal action agrees with one half of the entropy. This agreement is argued tobe related to the generalized Smarr formula of the five-dimensional black holemass. Through the calculation of the specific heat far off extremality weobserve that a phase transition occurs.
