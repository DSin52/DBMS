We consider the properties of massive one particle states on a translationcovariant Haag-Kastler net in Minkowski space. In two dimensional theories,these states can be interpreted as soliton states and we are interested in theexistence of antisolitons. It is shown that for each soliton state there arethree different possibilities for the construction of an antisoliton sectorwhich are equivalent if the (statistical) dimension of the correspondingsoliton sector is finite.
