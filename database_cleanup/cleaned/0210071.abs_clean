Title: The correlation functions of the D_6 conformal model

Authors: S.Balaska (Univ. Oran) and K. Demmouche (Univ. Oran)

Comments: 16 pages, 2 tables. Some errors of calculus are corrected. More

details are givenIn this work, we exploit the operator content of the D$_{6}$ conformalalgebra. By constructing a $Z_{2}$-invariants fusion rules of a chosensubalgebra and by resolving the bootstrap equations consistent with theserules, we determine the structure constants of the subalgebra.
