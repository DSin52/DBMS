We identify the states in string theory which are responsible for the entropyof near-extremal rotating four-dimensional black holes in $N=8$ supergravity.For black holes far from extremality (with no rotation), the Bekenstein-Hawkingentropy is exactly matched by a mysterious duality invariant extension of theformulas derived for near-extremal black holes states.
