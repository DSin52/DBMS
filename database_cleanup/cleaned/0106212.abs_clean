We consider properties of a covariant worldvolume action for a system of Ncoincident Dp-branes in D=(p+2) dimensional space-time (so called codimensionone branes). In the case of N coincident D0-branes in D=2 we then find ageneralization of this action to a model which includes fermionic degrees offreedom and is invariant under target-space supersymmetry and worldlinekappa-symmetry. We find that the type IIA D=2 superalgebra generating thesupersymmetry transformations of the ND0-brane system acquires a non-trivial"central extension" due to a nonlinear contribution of U(N) adjoint scalarfields. Peculiarities of space-time symmetries of coincident Dp-branes arediscussed.
