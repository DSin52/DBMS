We investigate the perturbative and non-perturbative correspondence of aclass of four dimensional dual string constructions with N=4 and N=2supersymmetry, obtained as Z_2 or Z_2 x Z_2 orbifolds of the type II, heteroticand type I string. In particular, we discuss the heterotic and type I dual ofall the symmetric Z_2 x Z_2 orbifolds of the type II string, classified inhep-th/9901123. .
