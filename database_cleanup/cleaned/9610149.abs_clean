Title: Theta-Vacua in the Light-Front Quantized Schwinger Model

Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil)Comments: 20 pages, Tex, to be published in "Proceedings First US-Brasil

Workshop on Topology, Geometry, and Physics, UNICAMP, BrasilThe light-front (LF) quantization of the bosonized Schwinger model isdiscussed in the "continuum formulation". The proposal, successfully usedearlier for describing the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) on the LF, ofseparating first the scalar field into the dynamical condensate and thefluctuation fields before employing the "standard" Dirac method works here aswell. The condensate variable, however, is now shown to be a q-number operatorin contrast to the case of SSB where it was shown to be a c-number or abackground field. The "condensate or Theta-vacua" emerge straightforwardlytogether with their continuum normalization which avoids the violation of thecluster decomposition property in the theory. Some topics on the "front form"theory are summarized in the Appendices and attention is drawn to the fact that"the theory quantized, say, at equal $x^{+}$ seems already to carry informationon equal $x^{-}$ commutators as well".
