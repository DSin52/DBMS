According to one of Maldacena's dualities, type IIB string theory on AdS_3 XS^3 X K3 is equivalent to a certain N=(4,4) superconformal field theory. Inthis note we compute the elliptic genus of the boundary theory in thesupergravity approximation. A finite quantity is obtained once we introduce aparticular exclusion principle. In the regime where the supergravityapproximation is reliable, we find exact agreement with the elliptic genus of asigma model with target space K3^N/S_N.
