The linear particle-antiparticle conjugation $\ty C$ and position spacereflection $\ty P$ as well as the antilinear time reflection $\ty T$ are shownto be inducable by the selfduality of representations for the operation groups$\SU(2)$, $\SL(\C^2)$ and $\R$ for spin, Lorentz transformations and timetranslations resp. The definition of a colour compatible linear$\ty{CP}$-reflection for quarks as selfduality induced is impossible sincetriplet and antitriplet $\SU(3)$-representations are not linearly equivalent.
