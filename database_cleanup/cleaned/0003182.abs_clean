Title: Superextension n=(2,2) of the complex Liouville equation and its

solutionComments: 11 pages, LaTeX, talk given at the XIV-th Max Born Symposium,

Karpacz, Poland, September 21-25, 1999It is shown that the method of the nonlinear realization of localsupersymmetry previously developed in framework of supergravity being appliedto the n=(2,2) superconformal symmetry allows one to get the new form of theexactly solvable n=(2,2) super-Liouville equation. The general advantage ofthis version as compared with the conventional one is that its bosonic partincludes the complex Liouville equation. We obtain the suitable supercovariantconstraints imposed on the corresponding superfields which provide the set ofthe resulting system of component equations be the same as that in model ofN=2, D=4 Green-Schwarz superstring. The general solution of this system isderived from the corresponding solution of the bosonic string equation.
