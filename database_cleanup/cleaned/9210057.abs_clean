Title: Peculiarity of String Theory on Orbifolds in the Presence of an

Antisymmetric Background FieldAuthors: Makoto Sakamoto

Comments: 14 pages, plain TEX

We study string theory on orbifolds in the presence of an antisymmetricconstant background field and discuss some of new aspects of the theory. It isshown that the term with the antisymmetric field has a topological nature likea Chern-Simons term or a Wess-Zumino term. Due to this property, the theoryquantization conditions. Coordinate transformations which define orbifolds aremodified at the quantum level. Wavefunctions of twisted strings acquire phasefactors when they move around non-contractible loops on orbifolds. Zero modeeigenvalues are shifted from naively expected values, in favor of modularinvariance.
