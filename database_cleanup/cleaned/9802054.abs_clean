1643-1649A singular configuration of an external static vector field in the form of amagnetic string polarizes the vacuum of a second-quantized theory on the planeorthogonal to the string axis. The most general boundary conditions at thepunctured singular point that are compatible with the self-adjointness oftwo-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian are considered. The dependences of theinduced vacuum quantum numbers on the parameter of the self-adjoint extension,on the string flux, and on the choice of irreducible representation of thematrices in (2+1)-dimensional spacetime are disscussed.
