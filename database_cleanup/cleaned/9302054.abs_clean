Title: Path Integral Solution of a Class of Explicitly Time-Dependent

PotentialsAuthors: Christian Grosche

Comments: 13 pages, amstex, SISSA/2/93/FM (In the revised version some

improvements and corrections have been made.)A specific class of explicitly time-dependent potentials is studied by meansof path integrals. For this purpose a general formalism to treat explicitlytime-dependent space-time transformations in path integrals is sketched. Anexplicit time-dependent model under consideration is of the form$V(q,t)=V[q/\zeta(t)]/\zeta^2(t)$, where $V$ is a usual potential, and$\zeta(t)=(at^2+2bt+c)^{1/2}$. A recent result of Dodonov et al.\ forcalculating corresponding propagators is incorporated into the path integralformalism by performing a space-time transformation. Some examples illustratethe formalism.
