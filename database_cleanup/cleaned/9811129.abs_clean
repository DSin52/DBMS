We consider four dimensional heterotic compactifications on smooth ellipticCalabi-Yau threefolds. Using spectral cover techniques, we study bundlecohomology groups corresponding to charged matter multiplets. The analysisshows that in generic situations, the resulting charged matter spectrum isstable under deformations of the vector bundle.
