We consider a version of generalised $q$-oscillators and some of theirapplications. The generalisation includes also "quons" of infinite statisticsand deformed oscillators of parastatistics. The statistical distributions fordifferent $q$-oscillators are derived for their corresponding Fock spacerepresentations. The deformed Virasoro algebra and SU(2) algebra are alsotreated.
