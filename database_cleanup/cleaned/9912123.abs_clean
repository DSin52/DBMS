We find further evidence for the conjecture relating large N Chern-Simonstheory on S^3 with topological string on the resolved conifold geometry byshowing that the Wilson loop observable of a simple knot on S^3 (for anyrepresentation) agrees to all orders in N with the corresponding quantity onthe topological string side. For a general knot, we find a reformulation of theknot invariant in terms of new integral invariants, which capture the spectrum(and spin) of M2 branes ending on M5 branes embedded in the resolved conifoldgeometry. We also find an intriguing link between knot invariants andsuperpotential terms generated by worldsheet instantons in N=1 supersymmetrictheories in 4 dimensions.
