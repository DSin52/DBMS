We examine the possibility that the strong CP problem is solved bystring-theoretic axions in strong-coupling limit of the E_8 x E_8 heteroticstring theory (M-theory). We first discuss some generic features of gaugekinetic functions in compactified M-theory, and examine in detail the axionpotential induced by the explicit breakings other than the QCD anomaly of thenon-linear U(1)_{PQ} symmetries of string-theoretic axions. It is argued basedon supersymmetry and discrete gauge symmetries that if the compactificationradius is large enough, there can be a U(1)_{PQ}-symmetry whose breaking otherthan the QCD anomaly, whatever its microscopic origin is, is suppressed enoughfor the axion mechanism to work. Phenomenological viability of such a largeradius crucially depends upon the quantized coefficients in gauge kineticfunctions. We note that the large radius required for the axion mechanism isviable only in a limited class of models. For instance, for compactificationson a smooth Calabi-Yau manifold with a vanishing second E_8 field strength, itis viable only when the quantized flux of the antisymmetric tensor field inM-theory has a minimal nonzero value. It is also stressed that this largecompactification radius allows the QCD axion in M-theory to be cosmologicallyviable in the presence of a late time entropy production.
