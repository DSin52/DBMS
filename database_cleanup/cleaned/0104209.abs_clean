We describe the coupled system of supergravity and a superbrane source by thesum of the group manifold action for D--dimensional supergravity and the actionfor a super--$p$--brane. We derive the generalized Einstein equation with thesource and discuss the local fermionic symmetries of the coupled action. Ourscheme could be especially relevant in $D=11, 10$, in which the superfieldactions for supergravity are not known.
