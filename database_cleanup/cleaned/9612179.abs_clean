This contribution reviews recent progress in constructing affine Lie algebrasat arbitrary level in terms of vertex operators. The string model describes acompletely compactified subcritical chiral bosonic string whose momentumlattice is taken to be the (Lorentzian) affine weight lattice. The main featureof the new realization is the replacement of the ordinary string oscillators byphysical DDF operators, whereas the unphysical position operators aresubstituted by certain linear combinations of the Lorentz generators. As a sideresult we obtain simple expressions for the affine Weyl translations as Lorentzboosts. Various applications of the construction are discussed.
