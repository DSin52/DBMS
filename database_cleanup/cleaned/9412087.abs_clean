The multi-Regge effective action is derived directly from the linearizedgravity action. After excluding the redundant field components we separate thefields into momentum modes and integrate over modes which correspond neither tothe kinematics of scattering nor to the one of exchanged particles. Theeffective vertices of scattering and of particle production are obtained assums of the contributions from the triple and quartic interaction terms and thefields in the effective action are defined in terms of the two physicalcomponents of the metric fluctuation.
