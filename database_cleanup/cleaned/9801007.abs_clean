Title: Recent Developments in Dynamical Supersymmetry Breaking

Comments: 14 pages, Latex, to appear in the proceedings of the International

Workshop on Perspectives of Strong Coupling Gauge TheoriesSome formal aspects of supersymmetry breaking are reviewed. The classic"requirements" for supersymmetry breaking include chiral matter, a dynamicalsuperpotential, and a classical superpotential which completely lifts themoduli space. These "requirements" may be evaded in theories with large matterrepresentations. The mechanisms of supersymmetry breaking by confinement andquantum deformation of the moduli space are explained, with emphasis on theimportance of identifying the relevant degrees of freedom in the ground state.Supersymmetry breaking and the behavior of the Witten index in non-chiraltheories are discussed. The quantum removal of directions which are classicallyunlifted is also illustrated. Examples of product gauge group theories thatadmit dual descriptions of the non-supersymmetric ground state are alsopresented.
