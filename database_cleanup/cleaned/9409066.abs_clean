We introduce a parametrization of the coupling constant space of thegeneralized Kontsevich models in terms of a set of moments equivalent to thoseintroduced recently in the context of topological gravity. For the simplestgeneralization of the Kontsevich model we express the moments as elementaryfunctions of the susceptibilities and the eigenvalues of the external field. Wefurthermore use the moment technique to derive a closed expression for thegenus zero multi-loop correlators for $(3,3m-1)$ and $(3,3m-2)$ rational matterfields coupled to gravity. We comment on the relation between the two-matrixmodel and the generalized Kontsevich models
