The introduction and quantization of a center-of-mass coordinate isdemonstrated for the one-soliton sector of nonlinear field theories in (1+1)dimensions. The present approach strongly emphazises the gauge andBRST-symmetry aspects of collective coordinate quantization. A gauge ispresented which is independent of any approximation scheme and which allows tointerpret the new degree of freedom as the {\em quantized} center of masscoordinate of a soliton. Lorentz invariance is used from the beginning tointroduce fluctuations of the collective coordinate in the {\em rest frame} ofthe {\em moving} soliton. It turns out that due to the extended nature of thesoliton retardation effects lead to differences in the quantum mechanics of thesoliton as compared to a point-like particle. Finally, the results of thesemiclassical expansion are used to analyse effective soliton-meson verticesand the coupling to an external source. Such a coupling in general causesacceleration as well as internal excitation of the soliton.
