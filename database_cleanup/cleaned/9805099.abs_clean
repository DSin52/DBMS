Title: Heterotic String Theory on Anti-de-Sitter Spaces

Comments: 6 pages, latex

We suggest that compactifications on Anti-de-Sitter (AdS) spaces of type IIA,IIB, heterotic strings and eleven dimensional vacuua of M-theory are related bya combination of $T$ and strong/weak dualities. Maldacena conjecture relatesthen all these vacuua to a conformal theory on the boundaries. Furthermoreacting with discrete groups on part of the internal spaces of these theorieswill lead to further dual theories with less or no supersymmetry.
