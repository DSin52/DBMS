We discuss the connection between Matrix string theory and the DLCQ of stringtheory. Using this connection we describe the sense in which perturbativestring amplitudes are reproduced in the Matrix string theory. Using recentrealization of the connection between SYM and Supergravity, we suggest how todescribe Matrix theory with non-flat backgrounds.
