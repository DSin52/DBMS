The scalar potentials of the non-semi-simple CSO(p,8-p)(p=7,6,5) gaugings ofN=8 supergravity are studied for critical points. The CSO(7,1) gauging has noG_2-invariant critical points, the CSO(6,2) gauging has three newSU(3)-invariant AdS critical points and the CSO(5,3) gauging has noSO(5)-invariant critical points. The scalar potential of CSO(6,2) gauging infour dimensions we discovered provides the SU(3) invariant scalar potential offive dimensional SO(6) gauged supergravity. The nontrivial effective scalarpotential can be written in terms of the superpotential which can be read offfrom A_1 tensor of the theory. We discuss first-order domain wall solutions byanalyzing the supergravity scalar-gravity action and using some algebraicrelations in a complex eigenvalue of A_1 tensor. We examine domain wallsolutions of G_2 sectors of noncompact SO(7,1) and CSO(7,1) gaugings and SU(3)sectors of SO(6,2) and CSO(6,2) gaugings. They share common features with eachsector of compact SO(8) gauged N=8 supergravity in four dimensions. We analyzethe scalar potentials of the CSO(p,q,8-p-q) gauged supergravity we have foundbefore. The CSO(p,6-p,2) gauge theory in four dimensions can be reduced fromthe SO(p,6-p) gauge theory in five dimensions. Moreover, the SO(p,5-p) gaugetheory in seven dimensions reduces to CSO(p,5-p,3) gauge theory in fourdimensions. Similarly, CSO(p,q-p,8-q) gauge theories in four dimensions arerelated to SO(p,q-p)(q=2,3,4,7) gauge theories in other dimensions.
