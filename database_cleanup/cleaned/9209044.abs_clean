We study general relativity in the framework of non-commutative differentialgeometry. In particular, we introduce a gravity action for a space-time whichis the product of a four dimensional manifold by a two-point space. In thesimplest situation, where the Riemannian metric is taken to be the same on thetwo copies of the manifold, one obtains a model of a scalar field coupled toEinstein gravity. This field is geometrically interpreted as describing thedistance between the two points in the internal space.
