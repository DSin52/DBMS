We discuss time-dependent perturbations (induced by matter fields) of ablack-hole background in tree-level two-dimensional string theory. We analysethe linearized case and show the possibility of having black-hole solutionswith time-dependent horizons. The latter exist only in the presence oftime-dependent `tachyon' matter fields, which constitute the only propagatingdegrees of freedom in two-dimensional string theory. For real tachyon fieldconfigurations it is not possible to obtain solutions with horizons shrinkingto a point. On the other hand, such a possibility seems to be realized in thecase of string black-hole models formulated on higher world-sheet genera. Weconnect this latter result with black hole evaporation/decay at a quantumlevel.}
