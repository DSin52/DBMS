A class of two-dimensional topological conformal field theories (TCFTs) isstudied within the framework of gauged WZW models in order to gain someinsights on the global geometrical nature of TCFTs. The BRST quantizations oftopological G/H gauged WZW models (the twisted versions of SUSY gauged WZWmodels) are given under fixed back-ground gauge fields. The BRST-cohomology ofthe system is investigated and the correlation functions among these physicalobservables are considered under the instanton back-grounds. As a consequence,two-dimensional BF gauge theoretical aspects of TCFTs are revealed. Especiallyit is shown that two correlation functions under the different instantonback-grounds can change to each other. This process of transmutation isdescribed by the spectral flow. The flow is formulated as a "singular" gaugetransformation which creates an appropriate back-ground charge on the physicalvacuum of the system. The field identification problem of the system is alsodiscussed from the above point of view.
