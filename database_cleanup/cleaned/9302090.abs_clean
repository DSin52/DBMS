The algebraic formulation of the quantum group gauge models in the frameworkof the $R$-matrix approach to the theory of quantum groups is given. Weconsider gauge groups taking values in the quantum groups and noncommutativegauge fields transformed as comodules under the coaction of the gauge quantumgroup $ G_{q}$. Using this approach we construct the quantum deformations ofthe topological Chern-Simons models, non-abelian gauge theories and theEinstein gravity. The noncommutative fields in these models generate $G_{q}$-covariant quantum algebras.
