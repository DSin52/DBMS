A new heterotic N=2 string with manifest target space supersymmetry isconstructed by combining a conventional N=2 string in the right-moving sectorand a Green-Schwarz-Berkovits type string in the left-moving sector. Thecorresponding sigma model is then obtained by turning on background fields forthe massless excitations. We compute the beta functions and we partially checkthe OPE's of the superconformal algebra perturbatively in $\alpha'$, all insuperspace. The resulting field equations describe N=1 self-dual supergravity.
