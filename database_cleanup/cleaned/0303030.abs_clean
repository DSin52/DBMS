The spontaneous symmetry breaking in noncommutative $\lambda\Phi^4$ theoryhas been analyzed by using the formalism of the effective action for compositeoperators in the Hartree-Fock approximation. It turns out that there is nophase transition to a constant vacuum expectation of the field and the brokenphase corresponds to a nonuniform background. By considering$<\phi(x)>=A \cos(\vec Q \cdot \vec x)$ the generated mass gap depends on theangles among the momenta $\vec k$ and $\vec Q$ and the noncommutativityparameter $\vec\theta$. The order of the transition is not easily determinablein our approximation.
