We consider black holes in anti-de Sitter space AdS_{p+2} (p = 2,3,5), whichhave hyperbolic, flat or spherical event horizons. The $O(\alpha'^3)$corrections (or the leading corrections in powers of the eleven-dimensionalPlanck length) to the black hole metrics are computed for the varioustopologies and dimensions. We investigate the consequences of the stringy orM-theory corrections for the black hole thermodynamics. In particular, we showthe emergence of a stable branch of small spherical black holes. We obtain thecorrected Hawking-Page transition temperature for black holes with sphericalhorizons, and show that for p=3 this phase transition disappears at a value of$\alpha'$ considerably smaller than that estimated previously by Gao and Li.Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we determine the $S^1 x S^3$ N=4 SYM phasediagram for sufficiently large `t Hooft coupling, and show that the criticalpoint at which the Hawking-Page transition disappears (the correspondence pointof Horowitz-Polchinski), occurs at $g_{YM}^2N \approx 20.5$. The d=4 and d=7black hole phase diagrams are also determined, and connection is made with thecorresponding boundary CFTs. Finally, for flat and hyperbolic horizons, we showthat the leading stringy or M-theory corrections do not give rise to any phasetransition. For horizons compactified to a torus $T^p$ or to a quotient ofhyperbolic space, $H^p/\Gamma$, we comment on the effects of light windingmodes.
