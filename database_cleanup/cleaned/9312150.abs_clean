The most general homogeneous monodromy conditions in $N{=}2$ string theoryare classified in terms of the conjugacy classes of the global symmetry group$U(1,1)\otimes{\bf Z}_2$. For classes which generate a discrete subgroup $\G$,the corresponding target space backgrounds ${\bf C}^{1,1}/\G$ include halfspaces, complex orbifolds and tori. We propose a generalization of theintercept formula to matrix-valued twists, but find massless physical statesonly for $\Gamma{=}{\bf 1}$ (untwisted) and $\Gamma{=}{\bf Z}_2$ (\`a la Mathurand Mukhi), as well as for $\Gamma$ being a parabolic element of $U(1,1)$. Inparticular, the sixteen ${\bf Z}_2$-twisted sectors of the $N{=}2$ string areinvestigated, and the corresponding ground states are identified viabosonization and BRST cohomology. We find enough room for an extended multipletof `spacetime' supersymmetry, with the number of supersymmetries beingdependent on global `spacetime' topology. However, world-sheet locality for thechiral vertex operators does not permit interactions among all massless`spacetime' fermions.
