The model of the bosonic string with the noncommutative world-sheet geometryis proposed in the framework of Fedosov's deformation quantization. There-interpretation of the model in terms of bosonic string coupled to infinitemultiplet of background fields is given and the link to the W-symmetry isdiscussed. For the case of d=4 Euclidean target space, the stringy counterpartsof the Yang-Mills instantons are constructed in both commutative andnoncommutative regimes.
