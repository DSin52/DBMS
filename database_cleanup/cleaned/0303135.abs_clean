Title: Orientifolds and Mirror Symmetry

We study parity symmetries and crosscap states in classes of N=2supersymmetric quantum field theories in 1+1 dimensions, including non-linearsigma models, gauged WZW models, Landau-Ginzburg models, and linear sigmamodels. The parity anomaly and its cancellation play important roles in many ofthem. The case of the N=2 minimal model are studied in complete detail, fromall three realizations -- gauged WZW model, abstract RCFT, and LG models. Wealso identify mirror pairs of orientifolds, extending the correspondencebetween symplectic geometry and algebraic geometry by including unorientableworldsheets. Through the analysis in various models and comparison in theoverlapping regimes, we obtain a global picture of orientifolds and D-branes.
