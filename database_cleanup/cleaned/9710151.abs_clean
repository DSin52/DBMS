Certain one-loop processes in eleven-dimensional supergravity compactified onT**2 determine exact, non-perturbative, terms in the effective action of typeII string theories compactified on a circle. One example is the modularinvariant U(1)-violating interaction of sixteen complex spin-1/2 fermions often-dimensional type IIB theory. This term, together with the (curvature)**4term, and many other terms of the same dimension are all explicitly related bysupersymmetry.
