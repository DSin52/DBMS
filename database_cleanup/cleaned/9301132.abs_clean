In this work we extend Onofri and Perelomov's coherent states methods to therecently introduced $OSp(1/2)$ coherent states. These latter are shown to beparametrized by points of a supersymplectic supermanifold, namely thehomogeneous superspace $OSp(1/2)/U(1)$, which is clearly identified with asupercoadjoint orbit of $OSp(1/2)$ by exhibiting the corresponding equivariantsupermoment map. Moreover, this supermanifold is shown to be a nontrivialexample of Rothstein's supersymplectic supermanifolds. More precisely, we showthat its supersymplectic structure is completely determined in terms of$SU(1,1)$-invariant (but unrelated) K\"ahler $2$-form and K\"ahler metric onthe unit disc. This result allows us to define the notions of a superK\"ahlersupermanifold and a superK\"ahler superpotential, the geometric structure ofthe former being encoded into the latter.
