We study phase structure of the moduli space of a D0-brane on the orbifoldC^3/Z_2 \times Z_2 based on stability of quiver representations. It is knownfrom an analysis using toric geometry that this model has multiple phasesconnected by flop transitions. By comparing the results of the two methods, weobtain a correspondence between quiver representations and geometry of toricresolutions of the orbifold. It is shown that a redundancy of coordinatesarising in the toric description of the D-brane moduli space, which is a keyingredient of disappearance of non-geometric phases, is understood from themonodromy around the orbifold point. We also discuss why only geometric phasesappear from the viewpoint of stability of D0-branes.
