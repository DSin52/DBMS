An AdS_2 black hole spacetime is an AdS_2 spacetime together with a preferredchoice of time. The Boulware, Hartle-Hawking and SL(2,R) invariant vacua areconstructed, together with their Green functions and stress tensors, for bothmassive and massless scalars in an AdS_2 black hole. The classicalBekenstein-Hawking entropy is found to be independent of the temperature, butat one loop a non-zero entanglement entropy arises. This represents alogarithmic violation of finite-temperature decoupling for AdS_2 black holeswhich arise in the near-horizon limit of an asymptotically flat black hole.Correlation functions of the SL(2,R) invariant boundary quantum mechanics arecomputed as functions of the choice of AdS_2 vacuum.
