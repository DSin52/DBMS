Title: Anti-Grand Unification and the Phase Transitions at the Planck Scale in

Gauge TheoriesAuthors: L. Laperashvili (ITEP, Moscow, Russia)

Comments: 16 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, Invited talk on the International

Symposium "Frontiers of Fundamental Physics", December 09-13, 2000,Hyderabad, IndiaThis review is devoted to Anti-Grand Unification and to the Multiple PointModel solution of problems of the unification of gauge interactions. Accordingto this model, near the Planck scale there exists a Multiple Critical Point(MCP), where vacua of all fields existing in nature are degenerate. The MCPrules over the evolution of all inverse finestructure constants in the Standardmodel and beyond it.
