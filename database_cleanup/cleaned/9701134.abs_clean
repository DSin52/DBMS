Renormalization group methods are used to determine the evolution of the lowenergy Wilson effective action for supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models infour dimensions. For the case of supersymmetric $CP^{(N-1)}$ models, theK\"ahler potential is determined exactly and is shown to exhibit a nontrivialultraviolet fixed point in addition to a trivial infrared fixed point. Thestrong coupling behavior of the theory suggests the possible existence ofadditional relevant operators or nonperturbative degrees of freedom.
