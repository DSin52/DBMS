Title: On Unitary Evolution of a Massless Scalar Field In A Schwarzschild

Authors: Kirill Melnikov and Marvin Weinstein

Comments: 45 pages, revtex

We develop a Hamiltonian formalism which can be used to discuss the physicsof a massless scalar field in a gravitational background of a Schwarzschildblack hole. Using this formalism we show that the time evolution of the systemis unitary and yet all known results such as the existence of Hawking radiationcan be readily understood. We then point out that the Hamiltonian formalismleads to interesting observations about black hole entropy and the informationparadox.
