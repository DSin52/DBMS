In a tachyon effective field theory of a non-BPS brane, we construct aclassical solution representing a parallel brane-antibrane. The solution ismade of a kink and an antikink placed at antipodal points of S^1. Estimation ofthe brane energy suggests an excitation of a string connecting the two branes,even though the theory is Abelian. We performed fluctuation analysis around theobtained solution, and find the structure of the supersymmetry breaking by theco-existence of the brane and the antibrane. We discuss possible processes ofthe pair-annihilation of the brane defect.
