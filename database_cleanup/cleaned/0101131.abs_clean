We discuss radiative corrections to the Casimir effect from an effectivefield theory point of view. It is an improvement and more complete version of aprevious discussion by Kong and Ravndal. By writing down the most generaleffective Lagrangian respecting the symmetries and the boundary conditions, weare able to reproduce earlier results of Bordag, Robaschik and Wieczorekcalculated in full QED. They obtained the correction E_0^(1) =\pi^2\alpha/2560mL^4 to the Casimir energy. We find that this leadingcorrection is due to surface terms in the effective theory, which we attributeto having dominant fluctuations localized on the plates.
