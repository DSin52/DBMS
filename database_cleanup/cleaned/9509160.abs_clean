We report on the formulation of $N=2$ $D=4$ supergravity coupled to $n_V$abelian vector multiplets in presence of electric and magnetic charges. Generalformulae for the (moduli dependent) electric and magnetic charges for the$n_V+1$ gauge fields are given which reflect the symplectic structure of theunderlying special geometry. The specification to Type IIB strings compactifiedon Calabi-Yau manifolds, with gauge group $U(1)^{h_{21}+1}$ is given.
