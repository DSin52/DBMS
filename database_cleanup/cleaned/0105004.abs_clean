Commutation Relations, edited by R.C. Hilborn and G.M. Tino, (AmericanInstitute of Physics, NY, 2000) p. 169Orthofermi statistics is characterized by an exclusion principle which iscontain more than one particle, no matter what the spin direction is. Thewavefunction is antisymmetric in spatial indices alone with arbitrary symmetrywavefunction is symmetric in spatial indices, with arbitrary symmetry in spinindices. We construct the quantum field theory of particles obeying these newkinds of quantum statistics. Non-relativistic as well as relativistic quantumfield theories with interactions are considered.
