We consider the two complex dimensional moduli space of supersymmetric vacuafor low energy effective N=2 SYM with gauge group SU(3). We describe, at thetopological level, a consistent model of how the relevant curves of marginalstability (CMS) intertwine with the branch cuts to partition the moduli spaceinto pieces carrying different BPS spectra. At strong coupling we findconnected cores which carry a smaller BPS spectrum than that at weak coupling.At the strongest coupling we find double cores which carry a finite BPSspectrum. These include not only states one can deduce from the monodromygroup, but three states, bounded away from weak coupling, each of which weinterpret as a bound state of two BPS gauge bosons. We find new BPS states atweak coupling corresponding to a excitations of a state with magnetic charge asimple co-root, with respect to the other simple root direction.
