Q-ball configuration that represents oscillating or spinning closed membraneis constructed via M(atrix) theory. Upon gravitational collapse Q-balls areexpected to form Schwarzschild black holes. For quasi-static sphericalmembrane, we probe spacetime geometry induced by monopole moment via D0-partonscattering off the Q-ball. We find a complete agreement with long distancepotential calculated using eleven-dimensional supergravity. Generalizing toheterotic M(atrix) theory, we also construct Q-ball configurations of realprojective and disk membranes. The latter Q-ball configuration arises astwisted sector of heterotic M(atrix) theory, hence, are expected to form acharged black hole after gravitational collapse.
