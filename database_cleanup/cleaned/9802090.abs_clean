The construction of $SL(2,Z)$ invariant amplitudes that generalizetheVirasoro amplitude is investigated in detail. We describe a number ofmathematical properties that characterize the simplest example, and presentpieces of evidence that it represents the tree-level four-graviton scatteringamplitude in membrane theory on ${\bf R}^9\times T^2$ in the limit that thetorus area goes to zero. In particular, we show that the poles of the $S$-dualamplitude are in precise correspondence with the states of membrane theory thatsurvive in the type IIB limit. These are shown to be the states that span theCartan subspaces of area preserving diffeomorphisms of the 2-torus; all otherstates become infinitely massive, and membrane world-volume theory acquires thestructure of a free theory.
