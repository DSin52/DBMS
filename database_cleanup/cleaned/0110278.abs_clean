A Green's function approach is presented for the D-dimensional inverse squarepotential in quantum mechanics. This approach is implemented by theintroduction of hyperspherical coordinates and the use of a real-spaceregulator in the regularized version of the model. The application ofSturm-Liouville theory yields a closed expression for the radial energy Green'sfunction. Finally, the equivalence with a recent path-integral treatment of thesame problem is explicitly shown.
