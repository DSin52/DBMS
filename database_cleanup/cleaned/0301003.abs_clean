Title: Strings in the Quantized pp-wave Backgrounds from Membrane

Comments: 15 pages, Latex, no figure

In this paper we study strings with quantized masses in the pp-wavebackgrounds. We obtain these strings from the membrane theory. For achieving tothis, one of the membrane and one of the spacetime directions will beidentified and wrapped. From the action of strings in the quantized pp-wavebackgrounds, we obtain its mass dual action. Some properties of the closed andopen strings in these backgrounds will be studied.
