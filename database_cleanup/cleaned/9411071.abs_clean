32-42To every partition $n=n_1+n_2+\cdots+n_s$ one can associate a vertex operatorrealization of the Lie algebras $a_{\infty}$ and $\hat{gl}_n$. Using thisconstruction we obtain reductions of the $s$--component KP hierarchy,reductions which are related to these partitions. In this way we obtain matrixKdV type equations. We show that the following two constraints on a KP$\tau$--function are equivalent (1) $\tau$ is a $\tau$--function of the$[n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_s]$--th reduced KP hierarchy which satisfies stringequation, $L_{-1}\tau=0$, (2) $\tau$ satisfies the vacuum constraints of the$W_{1+\infty}$ algebra.
