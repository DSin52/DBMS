Title: Classical spin contribution to the Tunnel Effect

Spain)Comments: 25 pages, 6 Figures, RevTeX

Since the spin of real particles is of order of $\hbar$, it is difficult todistinguish in a quantum mechanical experiment involving spinning particleswhat part of the outcome is related to the spin contribution and what part is apure quantum mechanical effect. We analyze in detail a classical model of anonrelativistic spinning particle under the action of a potential barrier andcompute numerically the crossing for different potentials. In this way it isshown that because of the spin structure there is a nonvanishing contributionto crossing for energies above a certain minimum value, even below the top ofthe potential barrier. Results are compared with the quantum tunnel effect.
