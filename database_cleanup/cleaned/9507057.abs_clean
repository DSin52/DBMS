It is shown that graphs that generalize the ADE Dynkin diagrams and haveappeared in various contexts of two-dimensional field theory may be regarded ina natural way as encoding the geometry of a root system. After recalling whatare the conditions satisfied by these graphs, we define a bilinear form on aroot system in terms of the adjacency matrices of these graphs and undertakethe study of the group generated by the reflections in the hyperplanesorthogonal to these roots. Some ``non integrally laced " graphs are shown to beassociated with subgroups of these reflection groups. The empirical relevanceof these graphs in the classification of conformal field theories or in theconstruction of integrable lattice models is recalled, and the connections withrecent developments in the context of ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric theories andtopological field theories are discussed.
