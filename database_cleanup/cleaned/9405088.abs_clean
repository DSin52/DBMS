It is shown how the BRST quantization can be applied to a gauge invariantsector of theories with anomalously broken symmetries. This result is used toshow that shifting the anomalies to a classically trivial sector of fields(Wess-Zumino mechanism) makes it possible to quantize the physical sector usinga standard BRST procedure, as for a non anomalous theory. The trivial sectorplays the role of a topological sector if the system is quantized withoutshifting the anomalies.
