We derive the singularity conditions of the N=1 generalized (general yukawacouplings and quark masses) form of hyperelliptic curves of SU(N_c) with N_fflavors. The results reproduce the known form of N=2 curves when the yukawacouplings and the quark masses reduce to those of N=2. We obtained these curvesby determining the dependence of the unbroken SU(2) gaugino condensation on thecouplings in the moduli source terms which break N=2 SQCD to N=1 SU(N_c) gaugetheory with the quarks and the adjoint matter, \Phi. The degenerate componentof the diagonalized classical vacuum expectation value of \Phi is shown to beexplicitly written in terms of these couplings, which enables us to determinethe form of the gaugino condensation.
