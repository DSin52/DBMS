The minimal bosonization of supersymmetry in terms of one bosonic degree offreedom is considered. A nontrivial relationship of the construction to theWitten supersymmetric quantum mechanics is illustrated with the help of thesimplest $N=2$ SUSY system realized on the basis of the ordinary (undeformed)bosonic oscillator. It is shown that the generalization of such a constructionto the case of Vasiliev deformed bosonic oscillator gives a supersymmetricextension of the 2-body Calogero model in the phase of exact or spontaneouslybroken $N=2$ SUSY. The construction admits an extension to the case of theOSp(2$\vert$2) supersymmetry, and, as a consequence, $osp(2\vert 2)$superalgebra is revealed as a dynamical symmetry algebra for the bosonizedsupersymmetric Calogero model. Realizing the Klein operator as a parityoperator, we construct the bosonized Witten supersymmetric quantum mechanics.Here the general case of the corresponding bosonized $N=2$ SUSY is given by anodd function being a superpotential.
