{}From the one-loop effective potential for a gas of non-relativistic bosonsin two spatial dimensions interacting via a delta-function potential atzero-temperature and finite chemical potential, the anomaly of theenergy-momentum tensor follows directly. It is also similarly derived when thebosons have an additional Chern-Simons interaction. In the special case ofanyons, the scale anomaly vanishes to one-loop order in the effective potentialand also to second order in the statistical angle.
