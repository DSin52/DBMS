Space-time N=2 and N=4 superconformal algebras can be built using world-sheetfree fields or, equivalently, free field representations of osp(1|2) andsl(2|1), respectively. A prescription for the calculation of space-timecorrelators is given. As applications we compute one and two-point correlationfunctions of Virasoro (superVirasoro) generators. We also present a possiblescenario for taking into account of NS fivebranes in the framework of ourconstruction for description of superstring on AdS_3. It is nothing but asimplified version of Green's ``world-sheets for world-sheets''.
