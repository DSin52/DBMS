We consider a conformal unified theory as the basis of conformal-invariantcosmological model where the permanent rigid state of the universe iscompatible with the primordial element abundance and supernova data. We showthat the cosmological creation of vector Z and W bosons, in this case, issufficient to explain the CMB temperature (2.7 K). The primordial bosonsviolate the baryon number in the standard model as a result of anomalousnonconservation of left-handed currents and a nonzero squeezed vacuumexpectation value of the topological Chern-Simons functional.
