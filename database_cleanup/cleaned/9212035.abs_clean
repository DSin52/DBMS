We present simple, analytic solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equation, whichdescribe an arbitrary number of charged black holes in a spacetime withpositive cosmological constant $\Lambda$. In the limit $\Lambda=0$, thesesolutions reduce to the well known Majumdar-Papapetrou (MP) solutions. Like theMP solutions, each black hole in a $\Lambda >0$ solution has charge $Q$ equalto its mass $M$, up to a possible overall sign. Unlike the $\Lambda = 0$ limit,however, solutions with $\Lambda >0$ are highly dynamical. The black holes movewith respect to one another, following natural trajectories in the backgrounddeSitter spacetime. Black holes moving apart eventually go out of causalcontact. Black holes on approaching trajectories ultimately merge. To ourknowledge, these solutions give the first analytic description of coalescingblack holes. Likewise, the thermodynamics of the $\Lambda >0$ solutions isquite interesting. Taken individually, a $|Q|=M$ black hole is in thermalequilibrium with the background deSitter Hawking radiation. With more than oneblack hole, because the solutions are not static, no global equilibriumtemperature can be defined. In appropriate limits, however, when the blackholes are either close together or far apart, approximate equilibrium statesare established.
