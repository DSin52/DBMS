Title: Energy-momentum tensors in gauge theory

Authors: G.Sardanashvily

Comments: 5 pages, The talk in XXY International Workshop on Fundamental

Problems of High Energy Physics and Field Theory (25-28 June, Protvino,Russia)In field theory on a fibre bundle Y->X, an energy-momentum current isassociated to a lift onto Y of a vector field on X. Such a lift by no means isdifferent energy-momentum currents, (ii) the Noether part of an energy-momentumcurrent can not be taken away, (iii) if a Lagrangian is not gauge-invariant,the energy-momentum fails to be conserved.
