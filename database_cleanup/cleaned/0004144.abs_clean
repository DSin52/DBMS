By carefully analyzing the geodesic motion of a test particle in the bulk ofbrane worlds, we identify an extra force which is recognized in spacetime ofone lower dimensions as a non-gravitational force acting on the particle. Suchextra force acts on the particle in such a way that the conventional particlemechanics in one lower dimensions is violated, thereby hinting at thehigher-dimensional origin of embedded spacetime in the brane world scenario. Weobtain the explicit equations describing the motion of the bulk test particleas observed in one lower dimensions for general gravitating configurations inbrane worlds and identify the extra non-gravitational force acting on theparticle measured in one lower dimensions.
