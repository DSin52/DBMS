The N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory with gauge group SU(2) is considered. Theinstanton field is calculated explicitly using the superfield formalism. Theinstanton-induced effects are encoded in the effective vertex in theLagrangian. This vertex produces the large distance expansion of the low energyeffective Lagrangian in derivatives of fields. The leading term in thisexpansion coincides with the one-instanton-induced term of the Seiberg-Wittenexact solution of the model. All orders of corrections in derivatives of fieldsare also calculated.
