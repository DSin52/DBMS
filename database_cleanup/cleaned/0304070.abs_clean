Title: Evidence that highly non-uniform black strings have a conical waist

Authors: Barak Kol, Toby Wiseman

Comments: 7 pages

Numerical methods have allowed the construction of vacuum non-uniformstrings. For sufficient non-uniformity, the local geometry about the minimalhorizon sphere (the "waist") was conjectured to be a cone metric. We are ableto test this conjecture explicitly giving strong evidence in favour of it. Wealso show how to extend the conjecture to weakly charged strings.
