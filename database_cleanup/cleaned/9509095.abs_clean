A description of dual non-Abelian duality is given, based on the notion ofthe Drinfeld double. The presentation basically follows the original paper\cite{KS2}, written in collaboration with P. \v Severa, but here the emphasisis put on the algebraic rather than the geometric aspect of the constructionand a concrete example of the Borelian double is worked out in detail.
