hep-th/0210051, hence title and abstracts modified, typos correctedThe spacetime dependent lagrangian formalism of references [1-2] is used toobtain is used to obtain a classical solution of Yang-Mills theory. This isthen used to obtain an estimate of the vacuum expectation value of the Higgsfield,{\it viz.} $\phi_{a}=A/e$, where $A$ is a constant and $e$ is theYang-Mills coupling (related to the usual electric charge).The solution canalso accommodate non-commuting coordinates on the boundary of the theory whichmay be used to construct $D$-brane actions. The formalism is also used toobtain the Deser-Gomberoff-Henneaux-Teitelboim results [10] for dyon chargequantisation in abelian $p$-form theories in dimensions $D=2(p+1)$ for both
