In three dimensions, the effective action for the gauge field induced byintegrating out a massless Dirac fermion is known to give either aparity-invariant or a parity-violating result, depending on the regularizationscheme. We construct a lattice formulation of the massless Dirac fermion usingthe overlap formalism. We show that the result is parity invariant in contrastto the formulation using Wilson fermions in the massless limit. Thisfacilitates a non-perturbative study of three-dimensional massless Diracfermions interacting with a gauge field in a parity invariant setting with noneed for fine-tuning.
