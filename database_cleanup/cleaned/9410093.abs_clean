We discuss conserved currents and operator product expansions (OPE's) in thecontext of a $O(N)$ invariant conformal field theory. Using OPE's we findexplicit expressions for the first few terms in suitable short-distance limitsfor various four-point functions involving the fundamental $N$-component scalarfield $\phi^{\alpha}(x)$, $\alpha=1,2,..,N$. We propose an alternativeevaluation of these four-point functions based on graphical expansions.Requiring consistency of the algebraic and graphical treatments of thefour-point functions we obtain the values of the dynamical parameters in eithera free theory of $N$ massless fields or a non-trivial conformally invariant$O(N)$ vector model in $2<d<4$, up to next-to-leading order in a $1/N$expansion. Our approach suggests an interesting duality property of thecritical $O(N)$ invariant theory. Also, solving our consistency relations weobtain the next-to-leading order in $1/N$ correction for $C_{T}$ whichcorresponds to the normalisation of the energy momentum tensor two-pointfunction.
