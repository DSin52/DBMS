Comments: LaTeX, 8 pages; typos corrected, one reference added

We describe the construction of the quantum deformed affine Lie algebrasusing the vertex operators in the free field theory. We prove the Serrerelations for the quantum deformed Borel subalgebras of affine algebras, namelythe case of $ \hat{\it sl}_{2}$ is considered in details. We provide theformulas for generators of affine algebra.
