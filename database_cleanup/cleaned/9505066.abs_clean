In the zero temperature Glauber dynamics of the ferromagnetic Ising or$q$-state Potts model, the size of domains is known to grow like $t^{1/2}$.Recent simulations have shown that the fraction $r(q,t)$ of spins which havenever flipped up to time $t$ decays like a power law $r(q,t) \simt^{-\theta(q)}$ with a non-trivial dependence of the exponent $\theta(q)$ on$q$ and on space dimension. By mapping the problem on an exactly solubleone-species coagulation model ($A+A\rightarrow A$), we obtain the exactexpression of $\theta(q)$ in dimension one.
