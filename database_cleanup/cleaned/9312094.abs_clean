Halpern and Yamron have given a Lorentz, conformal, and Diff S$_2$-invariantworld-sheet action for the generic irrational conformal field theory, but theaction is highly non-linear. In this paper, we introduce auxiliary fields tofind an equivalent linearized form of the action, which shows in a very clearway that the generic affine-Virasoro action is a Diff S$_2$-gauged WZW model.In particular, the auxiliary fields transform under Diff S$_2$ as local Lie $g$$\times$ Lie $g$ connections, so that the linearized affine-Virasoro actionbears an intriguing resemblance to the usual (Lie algebra) gauged WZW model.
