Title: On the renormalization of higher derivative two dimensional gravity.

Authors: I.L. Shapiro (Univ. of Zaragoza, Spain)

Comments: 7 pages, latex, no figures. Replacement. The analysis is essentially

modified as compared with the first version.The fourth derivative models for two dimensional gravity are shown to beequivalent to the special version of the nonlinear sigma models coupled to 2dquantum gravity. The reduction consists in the introduction of the auxiliaryscalar fields and can be performed in an explicit way for both metric andgeneral metric-dilaton cases. In view of this we can evaluate the structure ofpossible counterterms and show that they contains second derivative structuresonly. The calculations in the theory with an auxiliary fields require somespecial procedure to be applied. We perform the explicit calculations in adifferent gauges and explore the features of the auxiliary fields.
