Monopole ``superpartner'' solutions are constructed by acting with finite,broken supersymmetry transformations on a bosonic N=2 BPS monopole. The termsbeyond first order in this construction represent the backreaction of the thefermionic zero-mode state on the other fields. Because of the quantum nature ofthe fermionic zero-modes, the superpartner solution is necessarily operatorvalued. We extract the electric dipole moment operator and show that it isproportional to the fermion zero-mode angular momentum operator with agyroelectric ratio g=2. The magnetic quadrupole operator is shown to vanishidentically on all states. We comment on the usefulness of the monopolesuperpartner solution for a study of the long-range spin dependent dynamics ofBPS monopoles.
