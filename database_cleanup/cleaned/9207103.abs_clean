We argue that the light particles in string theory obey an effective quantummechanics modified by the inclusion of a quantum-gravitational friction term,induced by unavoidable couplings to unobserved massive string states in thespace-time foam. This term is related to the $W$-symmetries that couple lightparticles to massive solitonic string states in black hole backgrounds, and hasa formal similarity to simple models of environmental quantum friction. Itincreases apparent entropy, and may induce the wave functions of macroscopicsystems to collapse.
