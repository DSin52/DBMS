Exact massive S-matrices for two dimensional sigma models on symmetric spacesSU(2N)/Sp(N) and Sp(2P)/Sp(P)*Sp(P) are conjectured. They are checked bycomparison of perturbative and non perturbative TBA calculations of free energyin a strong external field. We find the mass spectrum of the models andcalculate their exact mass gap.
