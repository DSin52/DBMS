We discuss the spectrum of the three dimensional phi^4 theory in the brokensymmetry phase. In this phase the effective potential between the elementaryquanta of the model is attractive and bound states of two or more of them mayexist. We give theoretical and numerical evidence for the existence of thesebound states. Looking in particular at the Ising model realization of the phi^4theory we show, by using duality, that these bound states are in one-to-onecorrespondence with the glueball states of the gauge Ising model. We discusssome interesting consequences of this identification.
