Title: Frustrated SU(4) as the Preonic Precursor of the Standard Model

Comments: 36 pages, plain TEX, no figures

We give a model for composite quarks and leptons based on the semisimplegauge group SU(4), with the preons in the 10 representation; this choice ofgauge gluon and preon multiplets is motivated by the possibility of embeddingthem in an N=6 supergravity multiplet. Hypercolor singlets are forbidden inthe fermionic sector of this theory; we propose that SU(4) symmetryspontaneously breaks to $SU(3) \times U(1)$, with the binding of trialitynonzero preons and gluons into composites, and with the formation of a colorsinglet condensate that breaks the initial $Z_{12}$ vacuum symmetry to $Z_{6}$.The spin 1/2 fermionic composites have the triality structure of a quark leptonfamily, and the initial $Z_{12}$ symmetry implies that there are six masslessfamilies, which mix to give three distinct families, two massless with massivepartners and one with both states massive, at the scale of the condensate. Thespin 1 triality zero composites of the color triplet SU(4) gluons, whencoupled to the condensate and with the color singlet representation of the 10acting as a doorway state, lead to weak interactions of the fermioniccomposites through an exact SU(2) gauge algebra. The initial $Z_{12}$symmetry implies that this SU(2) gauge algebra structure is doubled, which inturn requires that the corresponding independent gauge bosons must couple tochiral components of the composite fermions. Since the U(1) couples to the 10representation as $B-L$, an effective $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \timesU(1)_{B-L}$ electroweak theory arises at the condensate scale, with allcomposites having the correct electric charge structure. A renormalizationgroup analysis shows that the conversion by binding of one 10 of SU(4) to 12triplets of SU(3) can give a very large, calculable hierarchy ratio between
