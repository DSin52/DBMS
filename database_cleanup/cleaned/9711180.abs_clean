The metric-affine gauge theory of gravity provides a broad framework in whichgauge theories of gravity can be formulated. In this article we fitmetric-affine gravity into the covariant BRST--antifield formalism in order toobtain gauge fixed quantum actions. As an example the gauge fixing of a generaltwo-dimensional model of metric-affine gravity is worked out explicitly. Theresult is shown to contain the gauge fixed action of the bosonic string inconformal gauge as a special case.
