We determine all the terms that are gauge-invariant up to a total spacetimederivative ("semi-invariant terms") for gauged non-linear sigma models.Assuming that the isotropy subgroup $H$ of the gauge group is compact orsemi-simple, we show that (non-trivial) such terms exist only in odd dimensionsand are equivalent to the familiar Chern-Simons terms for the subgroup $H$.Various applications are mentioned, including one to the gauging of theWess-Zumino-Witten terms in even spacetime dimensions. Our approach is based onthe analysis of the descent equation associated with semi-invariant terms.
