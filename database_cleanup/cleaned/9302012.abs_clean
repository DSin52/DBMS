Covariant anomalies are studied in terms of the theory of secondarycharacteristic classes of the universal bundle of Yang-Mills theory. A new setof descent equations is derived which contains the covariant current anomalyand the covariant Schwinger term. The counterterms relating consistent andcovariant anomalies are determined. A geometrical realization of theBRS/anti-BRS algebra is presented which is used to understand the relationshipbetween covariant anomalies in different approaches.
