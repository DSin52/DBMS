We review certain emergent notions on the nature of spacetime fromnoncommutative geometry and their radical implications. These ideas ofspacetime are suggested from developments in fuzzy physics, string theory, anddeformation quantisation. The review focuses on the ideas coming from fuzzyphysics. We find models of quantum spacetime like fuzzy $S^4$ on which statescannot be localised, but which fluctuate into other manifolds like $ CP^3$ .New uncertainty principles concerning such lack of localisability on quantumspacetimes are formulated.Such investigations show the possibility offormulating and answering questions like the probabilty of finding a point of aquantum manifold in a state localised on another one. Additional strikingpossibilities indicated by these developments is the (generic) failure of $CPT$theorem and the conventional spin-statistics connection. They even suggest thatPlanck's `` constant '' may not be a constant, but an operator which does notcommute with all observables. All these novel possibilities arise within therules of conventional quantum physics,and with no serious input from gravityphysics.
