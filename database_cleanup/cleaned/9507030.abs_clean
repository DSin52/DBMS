The action with the Grassmann-odd Lagrangian for the supersymmetric classicalWitten mechanics is constructed. It is shown that the exterior differential canbe used for the connection between Grassmann-even and Grassmann-oddformulations of the classical dynamics in the superspace in both Hamilton's andLagrange's approaches.
