We here consider a generalization of the Klein-Gordon scalar wave equationwhich involves a single arbitrary function. The quantization may be viewed asallowing $\hbar$ to be a function of the momentum or wave vector rather than aconstant. The generalized theory is most easily viewed in the wave vector spaceanalog of the Lagrangian. We need no reference to spacetime. In the generalizedtheory the de Broglie relation between wave vector and momentum is generalized,as are the canonical commutation relations and the uncertainty principle. Thegeneralized uncertainty principle obtained is the same as has been derived fromstring theory, or by a general consideration of gravitational effects duringthe quantum measurement process. The propagator of the scalar field is alsogeneralized, and an illustrative example is given in which it factors into theusual propagator times a "propagator form factor."
