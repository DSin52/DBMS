We show that the surface roughness for $c<1$ matter theories coupled to $2D$quantum gravity is described by a self-similar structure of baby universes.There exist baby universes whose neck thickness is of the order of theultraviolet cutoff, the largest of these having a macroscopic area $\sim A^{1\over {1-\gamma}}$, where $A$ is the total area and $\gamma$ the stringsusceptibility exponent.
