Title: Permutation orbifolds and their applications

Authors: P. Bantay

Comments: Invited talk at the Fields Institute workshop "Vertex Operator

Algebras in Mathematics and Physics", Toronto, Canada, 23-27 October 2000The theory of permutation orbifolds is reviewed and applied to the study ofsymmetric product orbifolds and the congruence subgroup problem. The issue ofdiscrete torsion, the combinatorics of symmetric products, the Galois actionand questions related to the classification of RCFTs are also discussed.
