We describe a general way of constructing integrable defect theories asperturbations of conformal field theory by local defect operators. The methodrelies on folding the system onto a boundary field theory of twice the centralcharge. The classification of integrable defect theories obtained in this wayparallels that of integrable bulk theories which are a perturbation of thetensor product of two conformal field theories. These include local defectperturbations of all $c<1$ minimal models, as well as of the coset theoriesbased on SO(2n), obtained in this way. We discuss in detail the former case ofall the Virasoro minimal models. In the Ising case our construction correspondsto having a spin field as a defect operator; in the folded formulation this ismapped onto an orbifolding of the boundary sine-Gordon theory at $\beta^2/8\pi= 1/8$, or a version of the anisotropic Kondo model.
