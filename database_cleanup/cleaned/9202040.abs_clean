We define and compute explicitly the classical limit of the realizations of$W_n$ appearing as hamiltonian structures of generalized KdV hierarchies. Theclassical limit is obtained by taking the commutative limit of the ring ofpseudodifferential operators. These algebras---denoted $w_n$---have free fieldrealizations in which the generators are given by the elementary symmetricpolynomials in the free fields. We compute the algebras explicitly and we showthat they are all reductions of a new algebra $w_{\rm KP}$, which is proposedas the universal classical $W$-algebra for the $w_n$ series. As a deformationof this algebra we also obtain $w_{1+\infty}$, the classical limit of$W_{1+\infty}$.
