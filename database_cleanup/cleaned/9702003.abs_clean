This paper treats some basic points in general relativity and in itsperturbative analysis. Firstly a systematic classification of global SO(n)invariants, which appear in the weak-field expansion of n-dimensionalgravitational theories, is presented. Through the analysis, we explain theinvariants clearly; b) every graph of invariants is specified by a set ofindices; c) a number, called weight, is assigned to each invariant. Itexpresses the symmetry with respect to the suffix-permutation within aninvariant. Interesting relations among the weights of invariants are given.Those relations show the consistency and the completeness of the presentclassification; d) some reduction procedures are introduced in graphs for thepurpose of classifying them. Secondly the above result is applied to the proofof the independence of general invariants with the mass-dimension $M^6$ for thegeneral geometry in a general space dimension. We take a graphicalrepresentation for general invariants too. Finally all relations depending oneach space-dimension are systematically obtained for 2, 4 and 6 dimensions.
