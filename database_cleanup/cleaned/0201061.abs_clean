in Nuclear Physics BThe existence of supersymmetric D0-branes at an arbitrary distance from aflux 5-brane is proven. The physical picture in type IIA is consistent with theKaluza-Klein reduction origin of the flux 5-brane. An analysis of thefluctuations around these vacua is performed and the backreaction of theD0-branes computed. Non-threshold D0-D2 bound states and similar stabilizationmechanisms for D2-branes in such backgrounds are also briefly discussed.
