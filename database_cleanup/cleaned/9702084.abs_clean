We present a relatively simple argument showing that the H-dyon statesrequired by S-duality of the heterotic string on $T^6$ are present providedthat the BPS dyons required by S-duality of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Millstheory are present. We also conjecture and provide evidence that H-dyons atsingularities where the nonperturbative gauge symmetry is completely broken areactually BPS dyons.
