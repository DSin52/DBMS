We propose a new approach for deriving the string field equations from ageneral sigma model on the world sheet. This approach leads to an equationwhich combines some of the attractive features of both the renormalizationgroup method and the covariant beta function treatment of the masslessexcitations. It has the advantage of being covariant under a very general setof both local and non-local transformations in the field space. We apply it tothe tachyon, massless and first massive level, and show that the resultingfield equations reproduce the correct spectrum of a left-right symmetricbosonic string.
