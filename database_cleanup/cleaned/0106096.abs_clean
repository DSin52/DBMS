When eight-dimensional instantons, satisfying F \wedge F = \pm \star_8(F\wedge F), shrink to zero size, we find stringy objects in higher orderten-dimensional Yang-Mills (viewed as a low-energy limit of open stringtheory). The associated F^4 action is a combination of two independent partshaving a single-trace and a double-trace structure. As a result we get aD-string from the single-trace term and a fundamental string from thedouble-trace. The latter has (8,0) supersymmetry on the worldsheet andcouplings to the background gauge fields of a heterotic string. A correlationbetween the conformal factor of the instanton and the tachyon field isconjectured.
