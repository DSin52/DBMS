Title: Some Aspects of Quantum Gravity in the Causal Approach

Authors: Nicola Grillo (Institute for Theoretical Physics, Zurich University)

Comments: 7 pages, latex, no figures

We describe the construction of quantum gravity, i.e. of a theory ofself-interacting massless spin-2 quantum gauge fields, the gravitons, on flatspace-time, in the framework of causal perturbation theory.
