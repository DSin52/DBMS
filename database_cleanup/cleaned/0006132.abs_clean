This article, based on the Klein lecture, contains some new results and newspeculations on various topics. They include discussion of open strings in theAdS space, unusual features of D-branes, conformal gauge theories in higherdimensions. We also comment on the infrared screening of the cosmologicalconstant and on the "brane worlds"
