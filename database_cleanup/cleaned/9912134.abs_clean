The weak-field expansion of the charged fermion propagator under a uniformmagnetic field is studied. Starting from Schwinger's proper-timerepresentation, we express the charged fermion propagator as an infinite seriescorresponding to different Landau levels. This infinite series is thenreorganized according to the powers of the external field strength $B$. Forillustration, we apply this expansion to $\gamma\to \nu\bar{\nu}$ and $\nu\to\nu\gamma$ decays, which involve charged fermions in the internal loop. Theleading and subleading magnetic-field effects to the above processes arecomputed.
