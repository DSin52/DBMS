We present a first-quantized formulation of the quadratic non-commutativefield theory in the background of abelian (gauge) field. Even in this simplecase the Hamiltonian of a propagating particle depends non-trivially on themomentum (since external fields depend on location of the Landau orbit) so thatone can not integrate out momentum to obtain a local theory in the second orderformalism. The cases of scalar and spinning particles are considered. Arepresentation for exact propagators is found and the result is applied todescription of the Schwinger-type processes (pair-production in homogenousexternal field).
