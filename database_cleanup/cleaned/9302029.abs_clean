We formulate the conformal bootstrap approach to four--fermion theory at itsstrong coupling fixed point in dimensions $2<d<4$. We present a solution of thebootstrap equations in the five--vertex approximation. We show that thebootstrap approach gives a particularly simple way to obtain next to leadingorder corrections to critical exponents in the large $N$ expansion and presentthe values of the anomalous dimensions of the fermion field $\psi$ and thecomposite $\bar\psi\psi$ to order $1/N^2$.
