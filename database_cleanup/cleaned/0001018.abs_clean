We study the solution describing a non-extreme dilatonic (p+1)-braneintersecting a D-dimensional extreme dilatonic domain wall, where one of itslongitudinal directions is along the direction transverse to the domain wall,in relation to the Randall-Sundrum type model. The dynamics of the probe(p+1)-brane in such source background reproduces that of the probe p-brane inthe background of the (D-1)-dimensional source p-brane. However, as for a probetest particle, the dynamics in one lower dimensions is reproduced, only whenthe source (p+1)-brane is uncharged.
