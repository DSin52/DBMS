A new N=4 superconformal algebra (SCA) is presented. Its internal affine Liealgebra is based on the seven-dimensional Lie algebra su(2)\oplus g, where gshould be identified with a four-dimensional non-reductive Lie algebra. Thus,it is the first known example of what we choose to call a non-reductive SCA. Itcontains a total of 16 generators and is obtained by a non-trivialIn\"on\"u-Wigner contraction of the well-known large N=4 SCA. The recentlydiscovered asymmetric N=4 SCA is a subalgebra of this new SCA. Finally, thepossible affine extensions of the non-reductive Lie algebra g are classified.The two-form governing the extension appearing in the SCA differs from theordinary Cartan-Killing form.
