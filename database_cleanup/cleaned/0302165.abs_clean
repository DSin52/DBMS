We show how the Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model proposal can be extended todescribe five-dimensional gauge theories compactified on a circle to fourdimensions. This involves solving a certain quantum mechanical matrix model. Wedo this for the lift of the N=1* theory to five dimensions. We show that theresulting expression for the superpotential in the confining vacuum isidentical with the elliptic superpotential approach based on Nekrasov'sfive-dimensional generalization of Seiberg-Witten theory involving therelativistic elliptic Calogero-Moser, or Ruijsenaars-Schneider, integrablesystem.
