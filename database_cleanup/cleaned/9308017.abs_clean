The Chern-Simons membranes and in general the Chern-Simons p-branes moving in$D$-dimensional target space admit an infinite set of secondary constraints.With respect to the Poisson bracket these constraints form a closed algebrawhich contains classical \ $W_{1+\infty }$ \ algebra in $p$-dimensions as asubalgebra. Corresponding gauged theory in the phase-space is constructed in aHamilton gauge as an analog of the ordinary $W$-gravity.
