We consider a soluble model of large $\phi^{4}$-graphs randomly embedded inone compactified dimension; namely the large-order behaviour offinite-temperature perturbation theory for the partition function of theanharmonic oscillator. We solve the model using semi-classical methods anddemonstrate the existence of a critical temperature at which the systemundergoes a second-order phase transition from $D=1$ to $D=0$ behaviour.Non-trivial windings of the closed loops in a graph around the compactifiedtime direction are interpreted as vortices. The critical point has a naturalinterpretation as the temperature at which these vortices condense and disorderthe system. We show that the vortex density increases rapidly in the criticalregion indicating the breakdown of the dilute vortex gas approximation at thispoint. We discuss the relation of this phenomenon to theBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in the $D=1$ matrix model formulatedon a circle.
