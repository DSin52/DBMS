Authors: Georg Junker (Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of

Erlangen-Nurnberg) and John R. Klauder (Departments of Physics andMathematics, University of Florida, Gainesville)Comments: 4 pages, to appear in the proceedings of "Path-Integrals from peV to

TeV, Florence, Italy, 25-29 August 1998Journal-ref: in R. Casalbuoni, R.Giachetti, V.Tognetti, R. Vaia, P.Verrucchi,

Scientific, Singapore, 1999) pp. 213-216The coherent-state path-integral representation for the propagator offermionic systems subjected to first-class constraints is constructed. As inthe bosonic case the importance of path-integral measures for Lagrangemultipliers is emphasized. One example is discussed in some detail.
