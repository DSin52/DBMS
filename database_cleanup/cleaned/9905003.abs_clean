Extended BRST invariance (BRST plus anti-BRST invariances) provides inprinciple a natural way of introducing the complete gauge fixing structureassociated to a gauge field theory in the minimum representation of thealgebra. However, as it happens in topological Yang Mills theory, not all gaugefixings can be obtained from a symmetrical extended BRST algebra, whereantighosts belong to the same representation of the Lorentz group of thecorresponding ghosts. We show here that, at non interacting level, a simplefield redefinition makes it possible to start with an extended BRST algebrawith symmetric ghost antighost spectrum and arrive at the gauge fixing actionof topological Yang Mills theory.
