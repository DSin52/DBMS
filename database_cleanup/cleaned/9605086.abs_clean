Using cumulant expansion for an averaged Wilson loop we derive an action ofthe gluodynamics string in the form of a series in powers of the correlationlength of the vacuum. In the lowest orders it contains the Nambu-Goto term andthe rigidity term with the coupling constants computed from the bilocalcorrelator of gluonic fields. Some higher derivative corrections arecalculated.
