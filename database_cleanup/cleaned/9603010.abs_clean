We show how to compute form factors, matrix elements of local fields, in therestricted sine-Gordon model, at the reflectionless points, by quantizingsolitons. We introduce (quantum) separated variables in which the Hamiltoniansare expressed in terms of (quantum) tau-functions. We explicitly describe thesoliton wave functions, and we explain how the restriction is related to anunusual hermitian structure. We also present a semi-classical analysis whichenlightens the fact that the restricted sine-Gordon model corresponds to ananalytical continuation of the sine-Gordon model, intermediate betweensine-Gordon and KdV.
