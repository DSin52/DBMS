Title: Intermittency in the q-State Potts Model

Authors: Yves Leroyer

Comments: 10 pages (Latex) 3 postcript figures included, Preprint LPTB93_2,

Bordeaux UniversityWe define a block observable for the $q$-state Potts model which exhibits anintermittent behaviour at the critical point. We express the intermittencyindices of the normalised moments in terms of the magnetic critical exponent$\beta /\nu$ of the model. We confirm this relation by a numerical similationof the $q=2$ (Ising) and $q=3$ two-dimensional Potts model.
