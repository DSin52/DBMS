A cosmological model describing the evolution of n Ricci-flat spaces (n>1) inthe presence of 1-component perfect-fluid and minimally coupled scalar field isconsidered. When the pressures in all spaces are proportional to the density,the Einstein and Wheeler-DeWitt equations are integrated for a large variety ofparameters. Classical and quantum wormhole solutions are obtained for negativedensity. Some special classes of solutions, e.g. solutions with spontaneous anddynamical compactification, exponential and power-law inflations, are singledout. For positive density a third quantized cosmological model is consideredand the Planckian spectrum of created universes is obtained.
