After reviewing the $\beta$-function equations for consistent stringbackgrounds in the $\sigma$-model approach, including metric and antisymmetrictensor, dilaton and tachyon potential, we apply this formalism to WZW models.We particularly emphasize the case where the WZW model is perturbed by anintegrable marginal tachyon potential operator leading to the non-abelian Todatheories. Already in the simplest such theory, there is a large non-linear andnon-local chiral algebra that extends the Virasoro algebra. This theory isshown to have two formulations, one being a classical reduction of the other.Only the non-reduced theory is shown to satisfy the $\beta$-function equations.
