Title: On Symmetry Restoration at Finite Temperature (Scalar Case)

Authors: M. Bordag, V. Skalozub

Comments: 25 pages, 11 figures, references added, corrected for some misprints

We investigate the effective potential for a scalar $\Phi^{4}$ theory withspontaneous symmetry breaking at finite temperature. All 'daisy' and 'superdaisy' diagrams are summed up and the properties of the corresponding gapeqation are investigated. It is shown exactly that the phase transition isfirst order.
