Some issues in the loop variable renormalization group approach to gaugeinvariant equations for the free fields of the open string are discussed. Ithad been shown in an earlier paper that this leads to a simple form of thegauge transformation law. We discuss in some detail some of the curiousfeatures encountered there. The theory looks a little like a massless theory inone higher dimension that can be dimensionally reduced to give a massivetheory. We discuss the origin of some constraints that are needed for gaugeinvariance and also for reducing the set of fields to that of standard stringtheory. The mechanism of gauge invariance and the connection with the Virasoroalgebra is a little different from the usual story and is discussed. It is alsoshown that these results can be extended in a straightforward manner to closedstrings.
