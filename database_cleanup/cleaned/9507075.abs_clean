New geometrical features of the Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds are presented, formodels with a typical type of superpotential. We show the one-to-onecorrespondence between some of the $(a,c)$ states with $U(1)$ charges $(-1,1)$and the integral points on the dual polyhedra, which are useful tools for theconstruction of mirror manifolds. Relying on toric geometry, these states areshown to correspond to the $(1,1)$ forms coming from blowing-up processes. Interms of the above identification, it can be checked that the monomial-divisormirror map for Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds, proposed by the author, is equivalentto that mirror map for Calabi-Yau manifolds obtained by the mathematicians.
