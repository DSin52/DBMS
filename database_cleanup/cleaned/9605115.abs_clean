We perform a dimensional reduction of the $U(1)\times SU(2)$ Chern--Simonsbosonization and apply it to the $t-J$ model, relevant for high $T_c$superconductors. This procedure yields a decomposition of the electron fieldinto a product of two ``semionic" fields, i.e. fields obeying abelian braidstatistics with statistics parameter $\theta={1\over 4}$, one carrying thecharge and the other the spin degrees of freedom. A mean field theory is thenshown to reproduce correctly the large distance behaviour of the correlationfunctions of the 1D $t-J$ model at $t>>J$. This result shows that to capturethe essential physical properties of the model one needs a specific ``semionic"form of spin--charge separation.
