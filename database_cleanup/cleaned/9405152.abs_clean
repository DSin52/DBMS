The relativistic distribution for indistinguishable events is considered inthe mass-shell limit $m^2\cong M^2,$ where $M$ is a given intrinsic property ofthe events. The characteristic thermodynamic quantities are calculated andsubject to the zero-mass and the high-temperature limits. The results are shownto be in agreement with the corresponding expressions of an on-mass-shellrelativistic kinetic theory. The Galilean limit $c\rightarrow \infty ,$ whichcoincides in form with the low-temperature limit, is considered. The theory isshown to pass over to a nonrelativistic statistical mechanics ofindistinguishable particles.
