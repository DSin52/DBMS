We consider the quantum sinh-Gordon model in this paper. Using known formulaefor form factors we sum up all their contributions and obtain a closedexpression for a correlation function. This expression is a determinant of anintegral operator. Similar determinant representations were proven to be usefulnot only in the theory of correlation functions, but also in the matrix models.
