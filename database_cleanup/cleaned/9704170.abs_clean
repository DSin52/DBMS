We analyze various brane configurations corresponding to field theories inthree, four and five dimensions. We find brane configurations which correspondto three dimensional N=2 and four dimensional N=1 supersymmetric QCD theorieswith quartic superpotentials, in which what appear to be ``hidden parameters''play an important role. We discuss the construction of five dimensional N=1supersymmetric gauge theories and superconformal fixed points using branes,which leads to new five dimensional N=1 superconformal field theories. The samefive dimensional theories are also used, in a surprising way, to describe newsuperconformal fixed points of three dimensional N=2 supersymmetric theories,which have both ``electric'' and ``magnetic'' Coulomb branches.
