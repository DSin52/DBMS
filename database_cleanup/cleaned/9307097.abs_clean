Title: What are we quantizing in integrable field theory?

Authors: F.A. Smirnov

Comments: 13 pages, AMStex

We continue study of the connection of classical limit of integrableasymptotically free field theory to the finite-gap solutions of classicalintegrable equations. In the limit the momenta of particles turn into themoduli of Riemann surfaces while their isotopic structure is related to theperiod lattices. In this paper we explain that the classical limit of the localoperators can be understood as a measure induced on the phase space byembedding into the projective space of "classical fields".
