We consider aspects of the role of stringy scales and Hagedorn temperaturesin the correspondence between various field theories and AdS-type spaces. Theboundary theory is set on a toroidal world-volume to enable small scales toappear in the supergravity backgrounds also for low field-theory temperatures.We find that thermodynamical considerations tend to favour background manifoldswith no string-size characteristic scales. The gravitational dynamics censorsthe reliable exposure of Hagedorn physics on the supergravity side, and thesystem does not allow the study of the Hagedorn scale by low-temperature fieldtheories. These results are obtained following some heuristic assumptions onthe character of stringy modifications to the gravitational backgrounds. A richphenomenology appears on the supergravity side, with different stringbackgrounds dominating in different regions, which should have field-theoreticconsequences. Six-dimensional world volumes turn out to be borderline casesfrom several points of view. For lower dimensional world-volumes, a fullyholographic behaviour is exhibited to order 1/N^2, and open strings in theirpresence are found to have a thermodynamical Hagedorn behaviour similar to thatof closed strings in flat space.
