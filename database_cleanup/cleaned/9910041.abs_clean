Black hole generalized p-brane solutions for a wide class of intersectionrules are obtained. The solutions are defined on a manifold that contains aproduct of n - 1 Ricci-flat ``internal'' spaces. They are defined up to a setof functions H_s obeying a non-linear differential equations (equivalent toToda-type equations) with certain boundary conditions imposed. A conjecture onpolynomial structure of governing functions H_s for intersections related tosemisimple Lie algebras is suggested. This conjecture is proved for Lieobtained. Two examples of A_2-dyon solutions (e.g. dyon in D = 11 supergravityand Kaluza-Klein dyon) are considered. Post-Newtonian parameters "beta" and"gamma" corresponding to 4-dimensional section of the metric are calculated. Itis shown that "beta" does not depend upon intersections of p-branes. Extremalblack hole configurations are also considered.
