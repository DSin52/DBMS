We consider a spontaneously broken nonabelian topologically massive gaugetheory in a broken phase possessing a residual nonabelian symmetry. Recentlythere has been some question concerning the renormalization of the Chern-Simonscoefficient in such a broken phase. We show that, in this broken vacuum, therenormalized ratio of the Chern-Simons coupling to the gauge coupling isshifted by $1/4\pi$ times an integer, preserving the usual integer quantizationcondition on the bare parameters.
