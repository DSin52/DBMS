In particular, the low energy regime ofSU(2) Yang-Mills is studied in a maximal Abelian gauge. It is shown that undergeneral conditions the effective action derived when integrated using ERGmethods contains the relevant degrees of freedom for confinement. In addition,the physics in the confining regime is dual to that of the broken phase of anAbelian Higgs model.
