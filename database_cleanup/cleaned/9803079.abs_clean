We consider the (2+1)-dimensional massive Thirring model as a gauge theory,with one fermion flavor, in the framework of the causal perturbation theory andaddress the problem of dynamical mass generation for the gauge boson. In thiscontext we get an unambiguous expression for the coefficient of the inducedChern-Simons term.
