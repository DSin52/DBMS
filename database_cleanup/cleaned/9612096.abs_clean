Motivated by twisted N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in 4 dimensions, anatural extension of the monad (ADHM) construction relevant to D-instantons isconsidered. We show that a family of Yang-Mills instantons can be constructedfrom D-instantons. We discuss some possible roles of reciprocity in D-branephysics. We conjecture the existence of universal instantons together with ageneralized Fourier-Nahm transformation as an unifying framework of D-branephysics.
