Generalizing our previous work, we show how $O(d,d)$ transformations can beused to "boost away" in new dimensions the physical singularities that occurgenerically in cosmological and/or black-hole string backgrounds. As anexample, we show how a recent model by Nappi and Witten can be madesingularity-free via $O(3,3)$ boosts involving a fifth dimension.
