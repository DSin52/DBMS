Starting from a Poincar\'e invariant field theory of a real scalar field withinteractions governed by a double-well potential in 2+1 dimensions, the Lorentzrepresentation induced on the collective coordinates describing low-energyexcitations about an effective string background is derived. In thisrepresentation, Lorentz transformations are given in terms of an infiniteseries, in powers of derivatives along the worldsheet. Transformations that acton the direction transverse to the string worldsheet involve a universaldimension $-1$ term. As a consequence, Lorentz invariance holds in this theoryof long effective strings due to cancellations in the action between irrelevantterms and the dimension two term that describes free massless scalar fields intwo dimensions.
