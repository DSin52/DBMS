We discuss the prepotential describing the effective field theory of N=2heterotic superstring models. At the one loop-level the prepotential developslogarithmic singularities due to the appearance of charged massless states atparticular surfaces in the moduli space of vector multiplets. Thesesingularities modify the classical duality symmetry group which now becomes arepresentation of the fundamental group of the moduli space minus the singularsurfaces. For the simplest two-moduli case, this fundamental group turns out tobe a certain braid group and we determine the resulting full dualitytransformations of the prepotential, which are exact in perturbation theory.
