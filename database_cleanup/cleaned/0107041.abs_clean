The problem of the M5 brane anomaly cancellation is addressed. We reformulateFHMM construction making explicit the relation with the M5 brane SUGRAsolution. We suggest another solution to the magnetic coupling equation whichdoesn't need anomalous SO(5) variation of the 3-form potential and coincideswith the SUGRA solution outside smoothed out core of the magnetic source.Chern-Simons term evaluated on this solution generates the same anomaly inflowas achieved by FHMM.
