For $N\!=\!2$ SUSY theories with non-vanishing $\beta$-function andone-dimensional quantum moduli, we study the representation on the specialcoordinates of the group of motions on the quantum moduli defined by$\Gamma_W\!=\!Sl(2;Z)\!/\!\Gamma_M$, with $\Gamma_M$ the quantum monodromygroup. $\Gamma_W$ contains both the global symmetries and the strong-weakcoupling duality. The action of $\Gamma_W$ on the special coordinates is notpart of the symplectic group $Sl(2;Z)$. After coupling to gravity, namely inthe context of non-rigid special geometry, we can define the action of$\Gamma_W$ as part of $Sp(4;Z)$. To do this requires singular gaugetransformations on the "scalar" component of the graviphoton field. In terms ofthese singular gauge transformations the topological obstruction to strong-weakduality can be interpreted as a $\sigma$-model anomaly, indicating the possibledynamical role of the dilaton field in $S$-duality.
