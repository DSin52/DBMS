Title: A Note on the Stability of Quantum Supermembranes

Comments: 4 pages; requires sprocl.sty (World Scientific)

We re-examine the question of the stability of quantum supermembranes. In thepast, the instability of supermembranes was established by using a regulator,i.e. approximating the membrane by SU(N) super Yang-Mills theory and letting $N\rightarrow \infty$. In this paper, we (a) show that the instability persistseven if we directly examine the continuum theory (b) give heuristic argumentsthat even a theory of unstable membranes at the Planck length may still becompatible with experiment (c) resolve a certain puzzling discrepancy betweenearlier works on the stability of supermembranes.
