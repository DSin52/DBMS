Authors: J.Gonzalez and M.A.Martin-Delgado

Comments: 18 pages (uses LaTeX and epsf), 6 figures included (4 in postscript

files encoded through uufiles), PUPT-1367We propose an approach to statistical systems on lattices with sphere-liketopology. Focusing on the Ising model, we consider the thermodynamic limitalong a sequence of lattices which preserve the {\em fixed} large scalegeometry. The hypothesis of scaling appears to hold at criticality, pointing ata sensible definition of the continuum limit of the model in the curved space.
