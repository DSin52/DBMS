For the integrable $N$-particle Calogero-Moser system with elliptic potentialit is shown that the Lax operator found by Krichever possesses a classical$r$-matrix structure. The $r$-matrix is a natural generalisation of the matrixfound recently by Avan and Talon (hep-th/9210128) for the trigonometricpotential. The $r$-matrix depends on the spectral parameter and only half ofthe dynamical variables (particles' coordinates). It satisfies a generalizedYang-Baxter equation involving another dynamical matrix.
