We present here the general solution describing generators of \kdef \poinalgebra as the functions of classical \poin algebra generators as well as theinverse formulae. Further we present analogous relations for the generators ofN=1 D=4 \kdef \poin superalgebra expressed by the classical \poin superalgebragenerators. In such a way we obtain the \kdef \poin (super)algebras with allthe quantum deformation present only in the coalgebra sector. Using theclassical basis of \kdef \poin superalgebra we obtain as a new result the$\k$-deformation of supersymmetric covariant spin square Casimir.
