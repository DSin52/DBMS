We glue together two branched spheres by sewing of two Ramond (dual)two-fermion string vertices and present a rigorous analytic derivation of theclosed expression for the four-fermion string vertex. This method treats alloscillator levels collectively and the obtained answer verifies that the closedform of the four vertex previously argued for on the basis of explicit resultsrestricted to the first two oscillator levels is the correct one.
