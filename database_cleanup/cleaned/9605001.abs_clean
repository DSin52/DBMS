We render a thorough, physicist's account of the formulation of the StandardModel (SM) of particle physics within the framework of noncommutativedifferential geometry (NCG). We work in Minkowski spacetime rather than inEuclidean space. We lay the stress on the physical ideas both underlying andcoming out of the noncommutative derivation of the SM, while we provide thenecessary mathematical tools. Postdiction of most of the main characteristicsof the SM is shown within the NCG framework. This framework, plus standardrenormalization technique at the one-loop level, suggest that the Higgs and topmasses should verify 1.3 m_top \lesssim m_H \lesssim 1.73 m_top.
