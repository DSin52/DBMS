Title: Irrational Conformal Field Theory on the Sphere and the Torus

Comments: LaTex file, 16 pages, Invited talk at the XIth International Congress

of Mathematical Physics, Paris, July 18-23, 1994, One misspelled namecorrectedI review the foundations of irrational conformal field theory (ICFT), whichincludes rational conformal field theory as a small subspace. Highlights of thereview include the Virasoro master equation and the generalizedKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations for the correlators of ICFT on the sphere andthe torus.
