We consider the effective action for strings and describe in detail theevolution of a four dimensional homogeneous isotropic universe with matterincluded. We find that the evolution, which is singular in general, becomessingularity free if during certain Phase of the evolution, when the scalefactor increases and the effective string coupling becomes strong, the universeis dominated by solitonic p-branes, p = 0 and/or - 1, or by `matter' for which$(pressure) \le - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} (density)$. The mechanism in the case ofbranes is reminiscent of the recently discovered field theory mechanism whereheavy states become light and resolve the moduli space singularities.
