Two dimensional charged black hole solution is obtained by implementing an$O(2,2)$ transformation on the three dimensional black string solution. Twodifferent monopole backgrounds in five dimensions are related through an$O(2,2)$ transformation. It has been shown in these examples that theparticular $O(2,2)$ transformation corresponds to duality transformation.
