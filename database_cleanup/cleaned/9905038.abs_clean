Symmetry breaking boundary conditions for WZW theories are discussed. Wederive explicit formulae for the reflection coefficients in the presence ofboundary conditions that preserve only an orbifold subalgebra with respect toan involutive automorphism of the chiral algebra. The characters and modulartransformations of the corresponding orbifold theories are computed. Both innerand outer automorphisms are treated.
