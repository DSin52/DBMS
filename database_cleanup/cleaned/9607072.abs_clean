We study the large N limit of the MATRIX valued Gross-Neveu model in 2<d<4dimensions. The method employed is a combination of the approximate recursionformula of Polyakov and Wilson with the solution to the zero dimensional largeN counting problem of Makeenko and Zarembo. The model is found to have a phasetransition at a finite value for the critical temperature and the criticalexponents are approximated by nu = 1/(2(d-2)) and eta=d-2. We test the validityof the approximation by applying it to the usual vector models where it isfound to yield exact results to leading order in 1/N.
