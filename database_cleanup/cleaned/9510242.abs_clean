We study the $SU(N)$, level $1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model, with affine primaryfields as spinon fields of fundamental representation. By evaluating the actionof the Yangian generators $Q_{0}^{a}, Q_{1}^{a}$ and the Hamiltonian $H_2$ ontwo spinon states we get a new connection between this conformal field theoryand the Calogero-Sutherland model with $SU(N)$ spin. This connection clearlyconfirms the need for the $W_3$ generator in $H_2$ and an additional term inthe $Q^{a}_{1}$. We also evaluate some energy spectra of $H_2$, by acting it onmulti-spinon states.
