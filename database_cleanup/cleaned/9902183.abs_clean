I study the global structure of de Sitter space in the semi-classical andone-loop approximations to quantum gravity. The creation and evaporation ofneutral black holes causes the fragmentation of de Sitter space intodisconnected daughter universes. If the black holes are stabilized by a charge,I find that the decay leads to a necklace of de Sitter universes (`beads')joined by near-extremal black hole throats. For sufficient charge, more andmore beads keep forming on the necklace, so that an unbounded number ofuniverses will be produced. In any case, future infinity will not be connected.This may have implications for a holographic description of quantum gravity inde Sitter space.
