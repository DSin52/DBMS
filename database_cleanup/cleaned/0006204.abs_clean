We describe heterotic string and M-theory realizations of the Randall-Sundrum(RS) scenario with $\cx N=2$ and $\cx N=1$ supersymmetry in the bulk.Supersymmetry can be broken only on the world brane, a scenario that has beenproposed to account for the smallness of the cosmological constant. Aninteresting prediction from string duality is the generation of a warp factorfor conventional type II Calabi--Yau 3-fold compactifications. On the otherhand we argue that an assumption that is needed in the RS explanation of thehierarchy is hard to satisfy in the string theory context.
