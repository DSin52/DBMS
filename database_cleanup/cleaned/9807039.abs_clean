The problem of renormalization of the semiclassical one-loop equations usedin the non-equilibrium field theory is considered. Recently, therenormalizability of such equations has been justified for some special casesof classical field configurations. In this paper the general case of arbitraryspatially inhomogeneous field configuration is investigated. It is shown thatfor certain quantum states the divergences arising in one-loop equations can beeliminated by usual perturbation-theory counterterms.
