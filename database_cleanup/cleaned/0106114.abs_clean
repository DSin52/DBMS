generalization of the IW contractionWe examine a Wess-Zumino term, written in bilinear of superinvariantcurrents, for a superstring in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. The standardInonu-Wigner contraction does not give the correct flat limit but gives zero.This originates from the fact that the fermionic metric of the super-Poincaregroup is degenerate. We propose a generalization of the Inonu-Wignercontraction which reduces the super-AdS group to the "nondegenerate"super-Poincare group, therefore it gives a correct flat limit of thisWess-Zumino term. We also discuss the M-algebra obtained by this generalizedInonu-Wigner contraction from osp(1|32).
