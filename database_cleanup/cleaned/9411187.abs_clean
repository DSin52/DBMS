We construct the general electrically charged, rotating black hole solutionin the heterotic string theory compactified on a six dimensional torus andstudy its classical properties. This black hole is characterized by its mass,angular momentum, and a 28 dimensional electric charge vector. We recover theaxion-dilaton black holes and Kaluza-Klein black holes for special values ofthe charge vector. For a generic black hole of this kind, the 28 dimensionalmagnetic dipole moment vector is not proportional to the electric chargevector, and we need two different gyromagnetic ratios for specifying therelation between these two vectors. We also give an algorithm for constructinga 58 parameter rotating dyonic black hole solution in this theory,characterized by its mass, angular momentum, a 28 dimensional electric chargevector and a 28 dimensional magnetic charge vector. This is the most generalasymptotically flat black hole solution in this theory consistent with theno-hair theorem.
