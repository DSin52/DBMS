We examine some of the implications of implementing the usual boundaryconditions on the closed bosonic string in the hamiltonian framework. Using theKN formalism, it is shown that at the quantum level, the resulting constraintslead to relations among the periods of the basis 1-forms. These are comparedwith those of Riemanns' which arise from a different consideration.
