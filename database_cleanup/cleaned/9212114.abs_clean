We compute the exact spectral density of random matrices in the ground stateof the quantum hamiltonian corresponding to the matrix model whose doublescaling limit describes pure gravity in 2D. We show that the non-perturbativeeffects are very large and in certain cases dominate the semi-classical WKBcontribution studied in the earlier literature. The physical observables inthis model are the loop averages with respect to the spectral density. Wecompute their exact ground-state expectation values and show that they differsignificantly from the values obtained in the WKB approximation. Unlike thealternative regularizations of the nonperturbative 2D quantum gravity, based onanalytic continuation of the Painlev\'e transcendent, our solution shows nopathologies.
