We construct the most general local effective actions for Goldstone bosonfields associated with spontaneous symmetry breakdown from a group $G$ to asubgroup $H$. In a preceding paper, it was shown that any $G$-invariant term inthe action, which results from a non-invariant Lagrangian density, correspondsto a non-trivial generator of the de Rham cohomology classes of $G/H$. Here, wepresent an explicit construction of all the generators of this cohomology forany coset space $G/H$ and compact, connected group $G$. Generators contributingto actions in 4-dimensional space-time arise either as products of generatorsof lower degree such as the Goldstone-Wilczek current, or are of theWess-Zumino-Witten type. The latter arise if and only if $G$ has a non-zero$G$-invariant symmetric $d$-symbol, which vanishes when restricted to thesubgroup $H$, i.e. when $G$ has anomalous representations in which $H$ isembedded in an anomaly free way. Coupling of additional gauge fields leads toactions whose gauge variation coincides with the chiral anomaly, which iscarried here by Goldstone boson fields at tree level. Generators contributingto actions in 3-dimensional space-time arise as Chern-Simons terms evaluated onconnections that are composites of the Goldstone field.
