Title: Clocks, computers, black holes, spacetime foam, and holographic

principleComments: 3 LateX pages (2 columns); to appear in Proceedings of conference

held at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (July 31 - August 4, 2000)What do simple clocks, simple computers, black holes, space-time foam, andholographic principle have in common? I will show that the physics behind themis inter-related, linking together our concepts of information, gravity, andquantum uncertainty. Thus, the physics that sets the limits to computation andclock precision also yields Hawking radiation of black holes and theholographic principle. Moreover, the latter two strongly imply that space-timeundergoes much larger quantum fluctuations than what the folklore suggests ---large enough to be detected with modern gravitational-wave interferometersthrough future refinements.
