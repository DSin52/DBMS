We study M(atrix) theory description of M theory compactified on T5/Z2orbifold. In the large volume limit we show that M theory dynamics is describedby N=8 supersymmetric USp(2N) M(atrix) quantum mechanics. Via zero-brane partonscattering, we show that each orbifold fixed point carries anomalous G-flux$\oint [G/2 \pi]= - 1/2$. To cancel the anomalous G-flux, we introduce twistedsector consisting of sixteen five-branes represented by fundamentalrepresentation hypermultiplets. In the small volume limit we show that M theorydynamics is described by by (5+1)-dimensional (8,0) supersymmetric USp(2N)chiral gauge theory. We point out that both perturbative and global gaugeanomalies are cancelled by the sixteen fundamental representation hyper-multiplets in the twisted sector. We show that M(atrix) theory is capable ofturning on spacetime background with the required sixteen five-branes out ofzero-brane partons as bound-states. We determine six-dimensional spacetimespectrum from the M(atrix) theory for both untwisted and twisted sectors andfind a complete agreement with the spectrum of (2,0) supergravity. We discussM(atrix) theory description of compactification moduli space, symmetry enhance-ment thereof as well as further toroidal compactifications.
