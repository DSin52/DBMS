Authors: R.G. Jafarov (Baku State U.)

Comments: LaTeX, 13 pages

A method of calculation of the scattering amplitude for fermions and scalarbosons with exchanging of a scalar particle in ladder approximation issuggested. The Bethe-Salpeter ladder integral equations system for theimaginary part of the amplitude is costructed and solution in the Reggeasymptotical form is found. The corrections to the amplitude due to the exitfrom mass shell are calculated and the real part of the amplitude is found.
