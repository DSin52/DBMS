We show that Dirichlet p-brane can be expressed as a configuration ofinfinitely many Dirichlet (p-2)-branes in the bosonic string theory. Using thisfact, we interpret the massless fields on the p-brane worldvolume asdeformations of the configuration of the (p-2)-branes. Especially we find thatthe worldvolume gauge field parametrizes part of the group of diffeomorphismson the worldvolume.
