Analyticity of gluon and Faddeev--Popov ghost propagators and their formfactors on the complex momentum-squared plane is exploited to continueanalytically the ultraviolet asymptotic form calculable by perturbation theoryinto the infrared non-perturbative solution. We require the non-perturbativemultiplicative renormalizability to write down the renormalization groupequation. These requirements enable one to settle the value of the exponentcharacterizing the infrared asymptotic solution with power behavior which wasoriginally predicted by Gribov and has recently been found as approximatesolutions of the coupled truncated Schwinger--Dyson equations. For thispurpose, we have obtained all the possible superconvergence relations for thepropagators and form factors in both the generalized Lorentz gauge and themodified Maximal Abelian gauge. We show that the transverse gluon propagatorsare suppressed in the infrared region to be of the massive type irrespective ofthe gauge parameter, in agreement with the recent result of numericalsimulations on a lattice. However, this method alone is not sufficient tospecify some of the ghost propagators which play the crucial role in colorconfinement. Combining the above result with the renormalization group equationagain, we find an infrared enhanced asymptotic solution for the ghostpropagator. The coupled solutions fulfill the color confinement criterion dueto Kugo and Ojima and also Nishijima, at least, in the Lorentz--Landau gauge.We also point out that the solution in compatible with color confinement leadsto the existence of the infrared fixed point in pure Yang--Mills theory withoutdynamical quarks. Finally, the Maximal Abelian gauge is also examined inconnection with quark confinement.
