Title: Duality and Instantons in String Theory

Comments: 66 pages, 4 eps figures, LaTeX. Lectures given at the 1999 ICTP

In these lecture notes duality tests and instanton effects in supersymmetricvacua of string theory are discussed.A broad overview of BPS-saturated terms in the effective actions is firstgiven. Their role in testing the consistency of duality conjectures as well asdiscovering the rules of instanton calculus in string theory is discussed. Theexample of heterotic/type-I duality is treated in detail. Thresholds of F^4 andR^4 terms are used to test the duality as well as to derive rules forcalculated with D1-brane instantons. We further consider the case of R^2couplings in N=4 ground-states. Heterotic/type II duality is invoked to predictthe heterotic NS5-brane instanton corrections to the R^2 threshold. The R^4couplings of type-II string theory with maximal supersymmetry are also analysedand the D-instanton contributions are described Other applications and openproblems are sketched.
