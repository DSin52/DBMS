We reproduce the correspondence between open string states |n> and BMNoperators O_n in N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory using a worldsheet computationwith the relation <B|n>=O_n, where <B| is a boundary state of D3-branes. Weregard the NS ground states and their excitations with respect to a bosonicoscillator as the states |n> and obtain a chiral operator and BMN operators,respectively, in correspondence to them. Because we take the coupling constantto be weak and the background spacetime to be flat Minkowski, not AdS, thestring states |n> are circular waves around the D3-branes, instead of KK modeson S^5. We also discuss the 1/J correction to the correspondence.
