Authors: Vladimir S. Dotsenko, Xuan Son Nguyen, Raoul Santachiara

Comments: 7 pages, 6 figures, Proceedings of the conference "Statistical Field

Theory", Como 2001. To be published in NATO Science Series II, Mathematical,Physics and Chemistry$N$ conformal theory models $WD^{(p)}_{3}$ coupled locally by their energyoperators are analyzed by means of a perturbative renormalization group. Newnon-trivial fixed points are found.
