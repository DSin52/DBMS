The strong coupling limit of a quantum system is in general quitecoupled limit is equivalent to the weakly coupled limit of some other system.In string theory conjectures of this type go back several years, but only inthe past year and a half has it been understood to be a general principleapplying to all string theories. This has improved our understanding of stringdynamics, including quantum gravity, in many new and sometimes surprising ways.I describe these developments and put them in the context of the search for theunified theory of particle physics and gravity.
