We show that rigid supersymmetry theories in four dimensions can be extendedto give supersymmetric trace (or generalized quantum) dynamics theories, inwhich the supersymmetry algebra is represented by the generalized Poissonbracket of trace supercharges, constructed from fields that form a trace classnoncommutative graded operator algebra. In particular, supersymmetry theoriescan be turned into supersymmetric matrix models this way. We demonstrate ourresults by detailed component field calculations for the Wess-Zumino and thesupersymmetric Yang-Mills models (the latter with axial gauge fixing), and thenshow that they are also implied by a simple and general superspace argument.
