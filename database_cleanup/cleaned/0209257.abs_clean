Title: Double Trace Deformations, Infinite Extra Dimensions and Supersymmetry

BreakingAuthors: Micha Berkooz

It was recently shown how to break supersymmetry in certain $AdS_3$ spaces,without destabilizing the background, by using a ``double trace'' deformationwhich localizes on the boundary of space-time. By viewing spatial sections of$AdS_3$ as a compactification space, one can convert this into a SUSY breakingmechanism which exists uniformly throughout a large 3+1 dimensional space-time,without generating any dangerous tadpoles. This is a generalization of a Vissertype infinite extra dimensions compactification. Although the model is notLorentz invariant, the dispersion relation is relativistic at high enoughmomenta, and it can be arranged such that at the same kinematical regime theenergy difference between between former members of a SUSY multiplet is large.
