In the present paper the phase transition in the regularized U(1) gaugetheory is investigated using the dual Abelian Higgs model of scalar monopoles.The corresponding renormalization group improved effective potential, analogousto the Coleman-Weinberg's one, was considered in the two-loop approximation for$\beta$ functions, and the phase transition (critical) dual and non-dualcouplings were calculated in the U(1) gauge theory. It was shown that thecritical value of the renormalized electric fine structure constant$\alpha_{\text{crit}}\approx 0.208$ obtained in this paper coincides with the0.20\pm 0.015$. This result and the behavior of $\alpha$ in the vicinity of thephase transition point were compared with the Multiple Point Model predictionfor the values of $\alpha$ near the Planck scale. Such a comparison is veryencouraging for the Multiple Point Model assuming the existence of the multiplecritical point at the Planck scale.
