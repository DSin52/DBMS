The rules for the free fermionic string model construction are extended toinclude general non-abelian orbifold constructions that go beyond the realfermionic approach. This generalization is also applied to the asymmetricorbifold rules recently introduced. These non-abelian orbifold rules are quiteeasy to use. Examples are given to illustrate their applications.
