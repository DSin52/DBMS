We discuss a generalized form of IIA/IIB supergravity depending on all R-Rpotentials C^(p) (p=0,1,...,9) as the effective field theory of Type IIA/IIBsuperstring theory. For the IIA case we explicitly break this R-R democracy toeither p<=3 or p>=5 which allows us to write a new bulk action that can becoupled to N=1 supersymmetric brane actions.The case of 8-branes is studied in detail using the new bulk & brane action.The supersymmetric negative tension branes without matter excitations can beviewed as orientifolds in the effective action. These D8-branes and O8-planesare fundamental in Type I' string theory. A BPS 8-brane solution is given whichsatisfies the jump conditions on the wall. As an application of our results wederive a quantization of the mass parameter and the cosmological constant instring units.
