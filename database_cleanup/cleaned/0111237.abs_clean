Authors: M. J. Duff

16 March 2001. 38 pages, Latex, 15 color figuresCurrent attempts to find a unified theory that would reconcile Einstein'sGeneral Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, and explain all known physicalphenomena, invoke the Kaluza-Klein idea of extra spacetime dimensions. The bestcandidate is M-theory, which lives in eleven dimensions, the maximum allowed bysupersymmetry of the elementary particles. We give a non-technical account.An Appendix provides an updated version of Edwin A. Abbott's 1884 satire {\itdescribes the adventures of a superstring theorist, A. Square, who inhabits aten-dimensional world and is initially reluctant to accept the existence of aneleventh dimension.
