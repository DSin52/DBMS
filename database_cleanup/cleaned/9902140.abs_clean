We study the geometry of interacting knotted solitons. The interaction islocal and advances either as a three-body or as a four-body process, dependingon the relative orientation and a degeneracy of the solitons involved. Thesplitting and adjoining is governed by a four-point vertex in combination withduality transformations. The total linking number is preserved during theinteraction. It receives contributions both from the twist and the writhe,which are variable. Therefore solitons can twine and coil and links can beformed.
