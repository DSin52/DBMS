Title: A Short Introduction to Bit-String Physics

Comments: LaTex

This paper starts with a personal memoir of how some significant ideas aroseand events took place during the period from 1972, when I first encountered TedBastin, to 1979, when I proposed the foundation of ANPA. I then discuss programuniverse, the fine structure paper and its rejection, the quantitative resultsup to ANPA 17 and take a new look at the handy-dandy formula. Following thishistorical material is a first pass at establishing new foundations forbit-string physics. An abstract model for a laboratory notebook and anhistorical record are developed, culminating in the bit-string representation.I set up a tic-toc laboratory with two synchronized clocks and show how thiscan be used to analyze arbitrary incoming data. This allows me to discuss(briefly) finite and discrete Lorentz transformations, commutation relations,and scattering theory. Earlier work on conservation laws in 3- and 4-events andthe free space Dirac and Maxwell equations is cited. The paper concludes with adiscussion of the quantum gravity problem from our point of view andspeculations about how a bit-string theory of strong, electromagnetic, weak andgravitational unification could take shape.
