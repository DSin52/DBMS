The Chern-Simons theories on a noncommutative plane, which is shown to bedescribing the quantum Hall liquid, is considered. We introduce matter fieldsfundamentally coupled to the noncommutative Chern-Simons field. Exploiting BPSequations for the nonrelativistic Chern-Simons theory, we find the exactsolutions of multi vortices that are closely packed and exponentiallylocalized. We determine the position, the size and the angular momentumexplicitly. We then construct the solutions of two spatially separated vorticesand determine the moduli dependence of the size and the angular momentum. Wealso consider the relativistic Chern-Simons theory and find nontopologicalsolutions whose properties are similar to the nonrelativistic counterpart.However, unlike the nonrelativistic case, there are two branches of solutionsfor a given magnetic field and they cease to exist below certainnoncommutativity scale.
