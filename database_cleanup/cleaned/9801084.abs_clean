We discuss theoretical implications of the large k USp(2k) matrix model inzero dimension. The model appears as the matrix model of type IIB superstringson a large $T^{6}/Z^{2}$ orientifold via the matrix twist operation. In thesmall volume limit, the model behaves four dimensional and its T dual issix-dimensional worldvolume theory of type I superstrings in ten spacetimedimensions. Several theoretical considerations including the analysis on planardiagrams, the commutativity of the projectors with supersymmetries and thecancellation of gauge anomalies are given, providing us with the rationales forthe choice of the Lie algebra and the field content. A few classical solutionsare constructed which correspond to Dirichlet p-branes and some fluctuationsare evaluated. The particular scaling limit with matrix T dualitytransformation is discussed which derives the F theory compactification on anelliptic fibered K3.
