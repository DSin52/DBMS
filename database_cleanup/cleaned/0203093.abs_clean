We show that the string spectrum in the pp-wave limit of AdS_5\times S^5/Z_M(orbifolded pp-wave) is reproduced from the N=2 quiver gauge theory byquantizing the Green-Schwarz string theory on the orbifolded pp-wave in lightcone gauge. We find that the twisted boundary condition on the world-sheet isnaturally interpreted from the viewpoint of the quiver gauge theory. Thecorrection of order g_{YM}^2 to the gauge theory operators agrees with theresult in its dual string theory. We also discuss strings on some otherorbifolded pp-waves.
