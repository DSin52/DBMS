We study some dynamical aspects of gauge theories on noncommutative tori. Weshow that Morita duality, combined with the hypothesis of analyticity as afunction of the noncommutativity parameter Theta, gives information aboutsingular large-N limits of ordinary U(N) gauge theories, where the large-ranklimit is correlated with the shrinking of a two-torus to zero size. We studysome non-perturbative tests of the smoothness hypothesis with respect to Thetain theories with and without supersymmetry. In the supersymmetric case this isdone by adapting Witten's index to the present situation, and in thenonsupersymmetric case by studying the dependence of energy levels on theinstanton angle. We find that regularizations which restore supersymmetry athigh energies seem to preserve Theta-smoothness whereas nonsupersymmetricasymptotically free theories seem to violate it. As a final application we useMorita duality to study a recent proposal of Susskind to use a noncommutativeChern-Simons gauge theory as an effective description of the Fractional HallEffect. In particular we obtain an elegant derivation of Wen's topologicalorder.
