It is shown that all possible N sheeted coverings of the cylinder arecontained in type IIA matrix string theory as non-trivial gauge fieldconfigurations. Using these gauge field configurations as backgrounds the large$N$ limit is shown to lead to the type IIA conformal field theory defined onthe corresponding Riemann surfaces. The sum over string diagrams is identifiedas the sum over non-trivial gauge backgrounds of the SYM theory.
