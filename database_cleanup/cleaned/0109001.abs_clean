Abelian deformations of ordinary algebras of functions are studied. The roleof Harrison cohomology in classifying such deformations is illustrated in thecontext of simple examples chosen for their relevance to physics. It is wellknown that Harrison cohomology is trivial on smooth manifolds and that,consequently, abelian *-products on such manifolds are trivial to first orderin the deformation parameter. The subject is nevertheless interesting; firstbecause varieties with singularities appear in the physical context andsecondly, because deformations that are trivial to first order are not always(indeed not usually) trivial as exact deformations. We investigate cones, toillustrate the situation on algebraic varieties, and we point out that thecoordinate algebra on (anti-) de Sitter space is a nontrivial deformation ofthe coordinate algebra on Minkowski space -- although both spaces are smoothmanifolds.
