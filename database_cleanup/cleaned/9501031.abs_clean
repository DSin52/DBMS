The method of the calculation of the multi-loop superstring amplitudes isproposed. The amplitudes are calculated from the equations that are none otherthan Ward identities. They are derived from the requirement that the discussedamplitudes are independent from a choice of gauge of both the vierbein and thegravitino field. The amplitudes are calculated in the terms of the superfieldsvacuum correlators on the complex (1|1) supermanifolds. The superconformalSchottky groups appropriate for this aim are built for all the spinorstructures. The calculation of the multi- loop boson emission amplitudes in theclosed, oriented Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz superstring theory is discussed indetails. The main problem arises for those spinor structures that correspond tothe Ramond fermion loops. Indeed, in this case the superfield vacuumcorrelators can not be derived by a simple extension of the boson stringresults. The method of the calculation of the above correlators is proposed.The discussed amplitudes due to all the even spinor structures is given in theexplicit form.
