The functional relations of the transfer matrices of fusion hierachies forsix- and eight-vertex models with open boundary conditions have been presentedin this paper. We have shown the su($2$) fusion rule for the models with moregeneral reflection boundary conditions, which are represented by off-diagonalreflection matrices. Also we have discussed some physics properties which aredetermined by the functional relations. Finally the intertwining relationbetween the reflection $K$ matrices for the vertex and SOS models is discussed.
