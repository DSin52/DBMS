The relation between SU(2) Yang-Mills mechanics, originated from the4-dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory under the supposition of spatialhomogeneity of the gauge fields, and the Euler-Calogero-Moser model isdiscussed in the framework of Hamiltonian reduction. Two kinds of reductions ofthe discrete symmetry. In the former case, it is shown that after eliminationof the gauge degrees of freedom from the SU(2) Yang-Mills mechanics theresulting unconstrained system represents the ID_3 Euler-Calogero-Moser modelwith an external fourth-order potential. Whereas in the latter, the IA_6Euler-Calogero-Moser model embedded in an external potential is derived whoseprojection onto the invariant submanifold through the discrete symmetrycoincides again with the SU(2) Yang-Mills mechanics. Based on this connection,the equations of motion of the SU(2) Yang-Mills mechanics in the limit of thezero coupling constant are presented in the Lax form.
