GeometryWe continue the study of a class of geometric transitions proposed byAganagic and Vafa which exhibit open string instanton corrections toChern-Simons theory. In this paper we consider an extremal transition for alocal del Pezzo model which predicts a highly nontrivial relation betweentopological open and closed string amplitudes. We show that the open stringamplitudes can be computed exactly using a combination of enumerativetechniques and Chern-Simons theory proposed by Witten some time ago. Thisyields a striking conjecture relating the topological amplitudes of all genusof the local del Pezzo model to a system of coupled Chern-Simons theories.
