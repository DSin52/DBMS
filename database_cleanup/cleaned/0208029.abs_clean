We study type IIA string theories on the pp-waves with 24 supercharges. Thetype IIA pp-wave backgrounds are derived from the maximally supersymmetricpp-wave solution in eleven dimensions through the toroidal compactification onthe spatial isometry directions. The associated actions of type IIA strings areobtained by using these metrics and other background fields of the type IIAsupergravities on the one hand. On the other hand, we derive these theoriesfrom D=11 supermembrane on the pp-wave via double dimensional reduction for thespatial isometry directions. The resulting actions agree with those of type IIAstrings obtained in the study of the supergravities. Also, the action of thematrix string is written down. Moreover, the quantization of closed and openstrings is discussed. In particular, we study Dp-branes allowed in one of thetype IIA theories.
