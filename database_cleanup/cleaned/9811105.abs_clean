We investigate the issue of electromagnetic duality on the light front. Wework with Zwanziger's theory of electric and magnetic sources which isappropriate for treating duality. When quantized on the light-front in thelight front gauge, this theory yields two independent phase space degrees offreedom, namely the two transverse field components, the right number todescribe the gauge field sector of normal light-front QED and also theappropriate commutator between them. The electromagnetic duality transformationformulated in terms of them is similar in form to the Susskind transformationproposed for the free theory, provided one identifies them as the dynamicalfield components of the photon on the light-front in the presence of magneticsources. The Hamiltonian density written in terms of these components isinvariant under the duality transformation.
