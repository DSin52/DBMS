We discuss the effect of perturbations on the ground rings of $c=1$ stringtheory at the various compactification radii defining the $A_N$ points of themoduli space. We argue that perturbations by plus-type moduli define groundvarieties which are equivalent to the unperturbed ones under redefinitions ofthe coordinates and hence cannot smoothen the singularity. Perturbations by theminus-type moduli, on the other hand, lead to semi-universal deformations ofthe singular varieties that can smoothen the singularity under certainconditions. To first order, the cosmological perturbation by itself can removethe singularity only at the self-dual ($A_1$) point.}
