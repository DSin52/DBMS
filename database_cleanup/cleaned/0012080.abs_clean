We show that a low-energy action for massless fluctuations around a tachyonicsoliton background representing a codimension one D-brane coincides with theDirac-Born-Infeld action. The scalar modes which describe transverseoscillations of the D-brane are translational collective coordinates of thesoliton. The appearance of the DBI action is a universal feature independent ofdetails of a tachyon effective action, provided it has the structure implied bythe open string sigma model partition function.
