We give a prescription for calculating the holographic Weyl anomaly inarbitrary dimension within the framework based on the Hamilton-Jacobi equationproposed by de Boer, Verlinde and Verlinde. A few sample calculations are madeand shown to reproduce the results that are obtained to this time with adifferent method. We further discuss continuum limits, and argue that theholographic renormalization group may describe the renormalized trajectory inthe parameter space. We also clarify the relationship of the present formalismto the analysis carried out by Henningson and Skenderis.
