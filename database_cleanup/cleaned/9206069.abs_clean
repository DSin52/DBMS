Title: Two Dimensional String Theory And Black Holes

Authors: Edward Witten

Comments: 15 pp

This lecture surveys a few loosely related topics, ranging from the scarcityof quantum field theories -- and the role that this has played, and stillplays, in physics -- to paradoxes involving black holes in soluble twodimensional string theory and the question of whether naked singularities mightbe of even greater interest to string theorists than black holes.
