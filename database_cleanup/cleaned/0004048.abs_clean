An algebraic proof of the nonrenormalization theorem for the perturbativebeta function of the coupling constant of N=2 Super Yang-Mills theory isprovided. The proof relies on a fundamental relationship between the N=2Yang-Mills action and the local gauge invariant polynomial Tr phi^2, phi(x)being the scalar field of the N=2 vector gauge multiplet. Thenonrenormalization theorem for the beta function follows from the vanishing ofthe anomalous dimension of Tr phi^2.
