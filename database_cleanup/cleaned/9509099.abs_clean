Title: An action for N=4 supersymmetric self-dual Yang-Mills theory

Journal-ref: Phys.Rev. D53 (1996) 2062-2070

The $N=4$ supersymmetric self-dual Yang-Mills theory in a four- dimensionalspace with signature $(2,2)$ is formulated in harmonic superspace. The on-shellconstraints of the theory are reformulated in the equivalent form of vanishingcurvature conditions for three gauge connections (one harmonic and twospace-time). The constraints are then obtained as variational equations from asuperspace action of the Chern-Simons type. The action is manifestly $SO(2,2)$invariant. It can be viewed as the Lorentz-covariant form of the light-conesuperfield action proposed by Siegel.
