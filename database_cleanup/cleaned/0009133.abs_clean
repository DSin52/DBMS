Field theories with p-form gauge potentials can possess ``hidden'' symmetriesleaving the field strengths invariant on-shell without being gauge symmetrieson-shell. The relevance of such symmetries to supersymmetric models isdiscussed. They provide central charges of supersymmetry algebras, play aparticular role in duality relations, and lead to peculiar interactions. Amultiplet of N=2 supersymmetry in four dimensions with two hidden centralcharges is presented.
