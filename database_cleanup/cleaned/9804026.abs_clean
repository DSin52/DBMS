We study different aspects of the construction of D=4, N=1 type IIBorientifolds based on toroidal Z_N and Z_M x Z_N, D=4 orbifolds. We find thattadpole cancellation conditions are in general more constraining than in sixdimensions and that the standard Gimon-Polchinski orientifold projection leadsto the impossibility of tadpole cancellations in a number of Z_N orientifoldswith even N including Z_4, Z_8, Z_8' and Z_{12}'. We construct D=4, Z_N and Z_Nx Z_M orientifolds with different configurations of 9-branes, 5-branes and7-branes, most of them chiral. Models including the analogue of discretetorsion are constructed and shown to have features previously conjectured onthe basis of F-theory compactified on four-folds. Different properties of theD=4, N=1 models obtained are discussed including their possible heterotic dualsand effective low-energy action. These models have in general more than oneanomalous U(1) and the anomalies are cancelled by a D=4 generalizedGreen-Schwarz mechanism involving dilaton and moduli fields.
