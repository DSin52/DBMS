Title: Construction of Modular Branching Functions from Bethe's Equations in

the 3-State Potts ChainAuthors: Rinat Kedem and Barry M. Mccoy

Comments: 31 pages

We use the single particle excitation energies and the completeness rules ofthe 3-state anti-ferromagnetic Potts chain, which have been obtained fromBethe's equation, to compute the modular invariant partition function. Thisprovides a fermionic construction for the branching functions of the $D_4$representation of $Z_4$ parafermions which complements the previous bosonicconstructions. It is found that there are oscillations in some of thecorrelations and a new connection with the field theory of the Lee-Yang edge ispresented.
