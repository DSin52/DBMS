Using our recently proposed covariant algebraic approach the heat kernel fora Laplace-like differential operator in low-energy approximation is studied.Neglecting all the covariant derivatives of the gauge field strength(Yang-Mills curvature) and the covariant derivatives of the potential term ofthird order and higher a closed formula for the heat kernel as well as itsdiagonal is obtained. Explicit formulas for the coefficients of the asymptoticexpansion of the heat kernel diagonal in terms of the Yang-Mills curvature, thepotential term and its first two covariant derivatives are obtained.
