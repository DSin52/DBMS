We study gauge theories which are associated with classical vacua ofperturbative Type II string theory that allows for a conformal field theorydescription. We show that even if we compactify seven spatial dimensions(allowing for one macroscopic dimension to arise non-perturbatively) theStandard Model cannot be obtained from the perturbative sector of Type IIsuperstrings. Therefore, the construction of the Standard Model (or extensionsthereof) from M theory must involve fields that are non-perturbative from theType II perspective. We also address the case of eight compact dimensions.
