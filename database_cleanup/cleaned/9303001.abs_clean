A covariant formalism for physical perturbations propagating along a stringin an arbitrary curved spacetime is developed. In the case of a stationarystring in a static background the propagation of the perturbations is describeddescribing the time-dilation and the second is connected with the curvature ofspace. As applications of the developed approach the propagation ofperturbations along a stationary string in Rindler, de Sitter, Schwarzschildand Reissner-Nordstrom spacetimes are investigated.
