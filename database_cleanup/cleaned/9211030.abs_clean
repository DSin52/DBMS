Magnetically charged dilatonic black holes have a perturbatively infiniteground state degeneracy associated with an infinite volume throat region of thegeometry. A simple argument based on causality is given that these states donot have a description as ordinary massive particles in a low-energy effectivefield theory. Pair production of magnetic black holes in a weak magnetic fieldis estimated in a weakly-coupled semiclassical expansion about an instanton andfound to be finite, despite the infinite degeneracy of states. This suggeststhat these states may store the information apparently lost in black holescattering processes.
