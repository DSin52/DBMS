The proposed by Bastianelli and van Nieuwenhuizen new method of calculationsof trace anomalies is applied in the conformal gauge field case. The result isthen reproduced by the heat equation method. An error in previous calculationis corrected. It is pointed out that the introducing gauge symmetries into agiven system by a field-enlarging transformation can result in unexpectedquantum effects even for trivial configurations.
