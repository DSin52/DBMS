We derive an expression in closed form for the action of a finite element ofthe Virasoro Group on generalized vertex operators. This complements earlierresults giving an algorithm to compute the action of a finite string ofgenerators of the Virasoro Algebra on generalized vertex operators. The mainnew idea is to use a first order formalism to represent the infinitesimal groupelement as a loop variable. To obtain a finite group element it is necessary tothicken the loop to a band of finite thickness. This technique makes thecalculation very simple.
