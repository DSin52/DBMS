We construct a vertex operator realization for the simple current primaryfields of WZW theories which are based on simply laced affine Lie algebras g.This is achieved by employing an embedding of the integrable highest weightmodules of g into the Fock space for a bosonic string compactified on theweight lattice of g. Our vertex operators are universal in the sense that asingle expression for the vertex operator holds simultaneously for all positiveintegral values of the level of g.
