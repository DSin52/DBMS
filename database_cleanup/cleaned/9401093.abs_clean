We discuss a quantum \qa symmetry in Landau problem, which naturally arisesdue to the relation between the \qa and the group of magnetic translations. Thelast one is connected with the \w and area-preserving (symplectic)diffeomorphisms which are the canonical transformations in the two-dimenssionalphase space. We shall discuss the hidden quantum symmetry in a $2+1$ gaugetheory with the Chern-Simons term and in aQuantum Hall system which are bothconnected with the Landau problem.
