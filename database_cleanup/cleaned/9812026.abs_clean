We extend the notion of central charge superspace to the case of localsupersymmetry. Gauged central charge transformations are identified asdiffeomorphisms at the same footing as space-time diffeomorphisms and localsupersymmetry transformations. Given the general structure we then proceed tothe description of a particular vector-tensor supergravity multiplet of 24+24components, identified by means of rather radical constraints.
