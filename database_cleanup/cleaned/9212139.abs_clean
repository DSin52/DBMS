The renormalization structure of two-dimensional quantum gravity isinvestigated, in a covariant gauge. One-loop divergences of the effectiveaction are calculated. All the surface divergent terms are taken into account,thus completing previous one-loop calculations of the theory. It is shown thatthe on-shell effective action contains only surface divergences. The off-shellrenormalizability of the theory is discussed and classes of renormalizabledilaton and Maxwell potentials are found.
