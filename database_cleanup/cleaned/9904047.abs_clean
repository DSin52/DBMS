The winding number transition in the Mottola-Wipf model with and withoutSkyrme term is examined. For the model with Skyrme term the number of discretemodes of the fluctuation operator around sphaleron is shown to be dependent onthe value of $\lambda m^2$. Following Gorokhov and Blatter we derive asufficient condition for the sharp first-order transition, which indicates thatfirst-order transition occurs when $0< \lambda m^2 < 0.0399$ and $2.148 <\lambda m^2$. In the intermediate region of $\lambda m^2$ the winding numbertransition is conjectured to be smooth second order. For the model withoutSkyrme term the winding number transition is always first order regardless ofthe value of parameter.
