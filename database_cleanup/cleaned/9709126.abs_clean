Title: Geometrising the closed string field theory action

Authors: Sabbir Rahman

Comments: 9 pages, phyzzx

We complete the set of string vertices of non-negative dimension byintroducing in a consistent manner those moduli spaces which had previouslybeen excluded. As a consequence we obtain a `geometrised' string action takingthe simple form $S=f(\B)$ where `$\B$' is the sum of the string vertices. Thatthe action satisfies the B-V master equation follows from the recursionrelations for the string vertices which take the form of a `geometrical'quantum master equation.
