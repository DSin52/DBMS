We show that the classic results of Schwinger on the exact propagation ofparticles in the background of constant field-strengths and plane waves can bereadily extended to the case of non-commutative QED. It is shown thatnon-perturbative effects on constant backgrounds are the same as theircommutative counterparts, provided the on-shell gauge invariant dynamics isreferred to a non-perturbatively related space-time frame. For the case of theplane wave background, we find evidence of the effective extended nature ofnon-commutative particles, producing retarded and advanced effects inscattering. Besides the known `dipolar' character of non-commutative neutralparticles, we find that charged particles are also effectively extended, butthey behave instead as `half-dipoles'.
