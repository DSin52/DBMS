We propose that large quantum fluctuations of the conformal factordrastically modify classical general relativity at cosmological distancescales, resulting in a scale invariant phase of quantum gravity in the farinfrared. We derive scaling relations for the partition function and physicalobservables in this conformal phase, and suggest quantitative tests of theserelations in numerical simulations of simplicial four geometries with $S^4$topology. In particular, we predict the form of the critical curve in thecoupling constant plane, and determine the scaling of the Newtonian couplingwith volume which permits a sensible continuum limit. The existing numericalresults already provide some evidence of this new conformal invariant phase ofquantum gravity.
