Non-Abelian duality transformations built on non-semi-simple isometry groupsare analysed. We first give the conditions under which the original non-linearsigma model and its non-Abelian dual are equivalent. The existence of aninvariant and non-degenerate bilinear form for the isometry Lie algebra iscrucial for this equivalence. The non-Abelian dual of a conformally invariantsigma model, with non-semi-simple isometries, is then constructed and its betafunctions are shown to vanish. This study resolves an apparent obstruction tothe conformal invariance of sigma models obtained via non-Abelian duality basedon non-semi-simple groups.
