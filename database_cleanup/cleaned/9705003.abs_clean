We examine the low energy structure of N=1 supersymmetric SO(10) gauge theorywith matter chiral superfields in N_Q spinor and N_f vector representations. Weconstruct a dual to this model based upon an SU(N_f+2N_Q-7) x Sp(2N_Q-2) gaugegroup without utilizing deconfinement methods. This product theory generalizesall previously known Pouliot-type duals to SO(N_c) models with spinor andvector matter. It also yields large numbers of new dual pairs along variousflat directions. The dual description of the SO(10) theory satisfies multipleconsistency checks including an intricate renormalization group flow analysiswhich links it with Seiberg's duality transformations. We discuss itsimplications for building grand unified theories that contain all StandardModel fields as composite degrees of freedom.
