A class of exact non-renormalized extremal correlators of half-BPS operatorsin N=4 SYM, with U(N) gauge group, is shown to satisfy finite factorizationequations reminiscent of topological gauge theories. The finite factorizationequations can be generalized, beyond the extremal case, to a class ofcorrelators involving observables with a simple pattern of SO(6) charges. Thesimple group theoretic form of the correlators allows equalities between ratiosof correlators in N=4 SYM and Wilson loops in Chern-Simons theories atk=\infty, correlators of appropriate observables in topological G/G models andWilson loops in two-dimensional Yang-Mills theories. The correlators also obeysum rules which can be generalized to off-extremal correlators. The simplestsum rules can be viewed as large k limits of the Verlinde formula using theChern-Simons correspondence. For special classes of correlators, the saturationof the factorization equations by a small subset of the operators in the largeN theory is related to the emergence of semiclassical objects like KK modes andgiant gravitons in the dual ADS \times S background. We comment on anintriguing symmetry between KK modes and giant gravitons.
