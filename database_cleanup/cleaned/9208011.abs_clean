We introduce the A-D-E resonance factorized models as an appropriateanalytical continuation of the Toda S-matrices to the complex values of theircoupling constant. An investigation of the associated Casimir energy, via thethermodynamic Bethe ansatz, reveals a rich pattern of renormalization grouptrajectories interpolating between the central charges of the $G_1 \otimes G_k/ G_{k+1}$ GKO coset models. We have also constructed the simplest resonancefactorized model satisfying the ``$\phi^3$''-property. From this resonancescattering, we predict new flows in non-unitary minimal models.
