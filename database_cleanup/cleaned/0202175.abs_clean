We construct a D3-brane wrapped on S^1, which is fibred over the resolvedconifold as its transverse space. Whereas a fractional D3-brane on the resolvedconifold is not supersymmetric and has a naked singularity, our solution issupersymmetric and regular everywhere. We also consider an $S^1$-wrappedD3-brane on the resolved cone over T^{1,1}/Z_2, as well as on the deformedconifold. In the former case, we obtain a regular supergravity dual to acertain four-dimensional field theory whose Lorentz and conformal symmetriesare broken in the IR region and restored in the UV limit.
