We construct the N=2, D=9 supergravity theory up to the quartic fermionicterms and derive the supersymmetry transformation rules for the fields modulocubic fermions. We consider a class of p-brane solutions of this theory, thestainless p-branes, which cannot be isotropically oxidized into higherdimensions. The new stainless elementary membrane and elementary particlesolutions are found. It is explicitly verified that these solutions preservehalf of the supersymmetry.
