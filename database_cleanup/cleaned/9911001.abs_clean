Quantum mechanics on the moduli space of N supersymmetric Reissner-Nordstromblack holes is shown to admit 4 supersymmetries using an unconventionalsupermultiplet which contains 3N bosons and 4N fermions. A near-horizon limitis found in which the quantum mechanics of widely separated black holesdecouples from that of strongly-interacting, near-coincident black holes. Thisnear-horizon theory is shown to have an enhanced D(2,1;0) superconformalsymmetry. The bosonic symmetries are SL(2,R) conformal symmetry and SU(2)xSU(2)R-symmetry arising from spatial rotations and the R-symmetry of N=2supergravity.
