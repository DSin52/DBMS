We uncover a surprising correspondence between a non-perturbative formulationof three-dimensional Lorentzian quantum gravity and a hermitian two-matrixmodel with ABAB-interaction. The gravitational transfer matrix can be expressedas the logarithm of a two-matrix integral, and we deduce from the knownstructure of the latter that the model has two phases. In the phase of weakgravity, well-defined two-dimensional universes propagate in proper time,whereas in the strong-coupling phase the spatial hypersurfaces disintegrateinto many components connected by wormholes.
