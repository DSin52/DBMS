1997 Complete abstract appears on the main body of the ThesisGeometry; Symplectic Geometry; Mathematical Physics; Metric GeometryWe discuss aspects of the heterotic string effective field theories inorbifold constructions of the heterotic string. We calculate the modulidependence of threshold corrections to gauge couplings in (2,2) symmetricorbifold compactifications. We perform the calculation of the thresholdcorrections for a particular class of abelian (2,2) symmetric non-decomposableorbifold models... internal twist is realized as generalized Coxeterautomorphism. We define the limits for the existence of states causingsingularities in the moduli space in the perturbative regime for a genericvacuum of the heterotic string. The 'proof' provides evidence for theexplanation of the stringy 'Higgs effect'. Furthermore, we calculate the modulidependence of threshold corrections as target space invariant free energies fornon-decomposable orbifolds, identifying the Hauptmodul' functions for therelevant congruence subgroups. The required solutions provide for the \mu massterm generation in the effective low energy theory and affect the inducedsypersymmetry breaking by gaugino condensation. In addition, we discuss the oneloop gauge and gravitational couplings in (0,2) non-decomposable orbifoldcompactifications. In the second part of the Thesis the one loop correction tothe Kahler metric for a generic N=2 orbifold compactification of the heteroticstring is calculated... In this way, with the use of the one loop stringamplitudes, the prepotential of the vector multiplets of the N=2 effectivelow-energy heterotic string is calculated in decomposable toroidalcompactifications of the heterotic string ... This method provides the solutionfor the one loop correction to the prepotential of the vector multiplets of theheterotic string compactified on the K_3 \times T^2...
