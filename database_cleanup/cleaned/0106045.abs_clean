Linear recursion relations for the instanton corrections to the effectiveprepotential are derived for two cases of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories;the first case with an arbitrary number of hypermultiplets in the fundamentalrepresentation of an arbitrary classical gauge group, and the second case withone hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation of SU(N). The construction forboth cases proceed from the Seiberg-Witten solutions and the renormalizationgroup type equations for the prepotential. Successive iterations of theserecursion relations allow us to simply obtain instanton corrections to anarbitrarily high order. Checks with previous results in the literature wereperformed. Other theoretical properties and generalizations are also discussed.
