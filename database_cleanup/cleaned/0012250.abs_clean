We study the confinement scenario in N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) gauge theorynear the monopole point upon breaking of N=2 supersymmetry by the adjointmatter mass term. We confirm claims made previously that theAbrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen string near the monopole point fails to be a BPS stateonce next-to-leading corrections in the adjoint mass parameter taken intoaccount. Our results shows that type I superconductivity arises upon monopolecondensation. This conclusion allows us to make qualitative predictions on thestructure of the hadron mass spectrum near the monopole point.
