Title: The Supersymmetric Two Boson Hierarchy

Comments: To appear in the proceedings of the Workshop in Theoretical and

Mathematical Physics, CAM'95, University of Laval, Quebec, Canada, June 1995;11 pages, Plain TeXWe summarize all the known properties of the supersymmetric integrable TwoBoson equation. We present its nonstandard Lax formulation and tri-Hamiltonianstructure, its reduction to the supersymmetric nonlinear Schr\"odinger equationand the local as well as nonlocal conserved charges. We also present thealgebra of the conserved charges and identify its second Hamiltonian structurewith the twisted $N=2$ superconformal algebra.
