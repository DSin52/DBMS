The massive Schwinger model with two flavors is studied in the strongcoupling region by using light-front Tamm-Dancoff approximation. The massspectrum of the lightest particles is obtained numerically. We find that themass of the lightest isotriplet (``pion'') behaves as $m^{0.50}$ for the strongcouplings, where $m$ is the fermion mass. We also find that the lightestisosinglet is not in the valence state (``eta'') which is much heavier in thestrong coupling region, but can be interpreted as a bound state of two pions.It is 1.762 times heavier than pion at $m=1.0\times10^{-3}(e/\sqrt\pi)$, whileColeman predicted that the ratio is $\sqrt3$ in the strong coupling limit. The``pion decay constant'' is calculated to be 0.3945.
