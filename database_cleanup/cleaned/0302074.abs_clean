Title: Noncommutative Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory, duality and a new

noncommutative Chern-Simons theory in d=3Comments: 6 pages

Noncommutative Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in 3-dimensions is defined interms of star product and noncommutative fields. Seiberg-Witten map is employedto write it in terms of ordinary fields. A parent action is introduced and thedual action is derived. For spatial noncommutativity it is studied up to secondorder in the noncommutativity parameter \theta. A new noncommutativeChern-Simons action is defined in terms of ordinary fields, inspired by thedual action. Moreover, a transformation between noncommuting and ordinaryfields is proposed.
