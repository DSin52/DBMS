A symplectic structure on the space of nondegenerate and nonparametrizedcurves in a locally affine manifold is defined. We also consider severalinteresting spaces of nondegenerate projective curves endowed with Poissonstructures. This construction connects the Virasoro algebra and theGel'fand-Dikii bracket with the projective differential geometry.
