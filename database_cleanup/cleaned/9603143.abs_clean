A gauge theory with an underlying SU_q(2) quantum group symmetry isintroduced, and its properties examined. With suitable assumptions, this modelis found to have many similarities with the usual SU(2)\times U(1) StandardModel, specifically, the existence of four generators and thus four gaugefields. However, the two classical symmetries are unified into one quantumsymmetry, and therefore there is only a single coupling constant, rather thantwo. By incorporating a Higgs sector into the model, one obtains severalexplicit tree-level predictions in the undeformed limit, such as the Weinbergconstant alpha as inputs, one can also obtain predictions for the weak couplingconstant, the mass of the W, and the Higgs VEV. The breaking of the quantuminvariance also results in a remaining undeformed U(1) gauge symmetry.
