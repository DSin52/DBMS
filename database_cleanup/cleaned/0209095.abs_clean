A semiclassical string description is given for correlators of Wilson loopswith local operators in N=4 SYM theory in the regime when operators carryparametrically large R-charge. The OPE coefficients of the circular Wilson loopin chiral primary operators are computed to all orders in the alpha' expansionin AdS_5xS^5 string theory. The results agree with field-theory predictions.
