Exploring the Future of High-Energy Physics", McGill University, Montreal,Canada, may 1994, UdeM-LPN-TH-94-202We present the one-loop scalar field effective potential for the $N=2$supersymmetric nonrelativistic self-interacting matter fields coupled to anAbelian Chern-Simons gauge field and for its generalization when bosonic matterfields are coupled to non-Abelian Chern-Simons field. In both models, Gauss'slaw linearly relates the magnetic field to the matter field densities; hence,we also include radiative effects from the background gauge field. We computethe scalar field effective potentials in two gauge families, a gaugereminiscent of the $R_\xi$-gauge in the limit $\xi\rightarrow 0$ and in theCoulomb family gauges. We regularize the theory with operator regularizationand a cutoff to demonstrate that the results are independent of theregularization scheme.
