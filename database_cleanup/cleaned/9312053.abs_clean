In the framework of the compactified closed bosonic string theory with theextra spatial coordinates being circular with radius $R$, we perform both thezero-slope limit and the $R \rightarrow 0$ limit of the tree scatteringamplitude of four massless scalar particles. We explicitly show that thisdouble limit leads to amplitudes involving scalars which interact through theexchange of a scalar, spin 1 and spin 2 particle. In particular, this lattercase reproduces the same result obtained in linearized quantum gravity.
