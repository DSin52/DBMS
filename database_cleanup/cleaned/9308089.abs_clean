Leading corrections to Planck's formula and photon thermodynamics arisingfrom the pair-mediated photon-photon interaction are calculated. Thisinteraction is attractive and causes an increase in occupation number for allmodes. Possible consequences, including the role of the cosmic photon gas instructure formation, are considered.
