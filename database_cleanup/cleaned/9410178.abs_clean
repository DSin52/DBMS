We discuss the properties and interpretation of a discrete sequence of astatic spherically symmetric solutions of the Yang-Mills-dilaton theory. Thissequence is parametrized by the number $n$ of zeros of a component of the gaugefield potential. It is demonstrated that solutions with odd $n$ posses all theproperties of the sphaleron. It is shown that there are normalizable fermionzero modes in the background of these solutions. The question of instability iscritically analysed.
