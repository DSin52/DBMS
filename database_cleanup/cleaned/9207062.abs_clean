In this note we investigate the generalised critical $N=2$ superstrings in$(1,2p)$ spacetime signature. We calculate the four-point functions for thetachyon operators of these theories. In contrast to the usual $N=2$ superstringin $(2,2)$ spacetime, the four-point functions do not vanish. The exchangedparticles of the four-point function are included in the physical spectrum ofthe corresponding theory and have vanishing fermion charge.
