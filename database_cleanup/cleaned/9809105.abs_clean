We discuss the semi-classical perturbation spectra produced in the masslessfields of the low energy string action in a pre big bang type scenario. Axionfields may possess an almost scale-invariant spectrum on large scales dependentupon the evolution of the dilaton and moduli fields to which they are coupled.As an example we calculate the spectra for three axion fields present in atruncated type IIB model and show that they are related with at least one ofthe fields having a scale-invariant or red perturbation spectrum. In thesimplest pre big bang scenario this may be inconsistent with the observedisotropy of the microwave background. More generally, relations between theperturbation spectra in low energy string cosmologies reflect the symmetries ofthe theory.
