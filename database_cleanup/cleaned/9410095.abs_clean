The most usual procedure for deriving curvature corrections to effectiveactions for topological defects is subjected to a critical reappraisal. Alogically unjustified step (leading to overdetermination) is identified andrectified, taking the standard domain wall case as an illustrative example.Using the appropriately corrected procedure, we obtain a new exact (analytic)expression for the corresponding effective action contribution of quadraticorder in the wall width, in terms of the intrinsic Ricci scalar $R$ and theextrinsic curvature scalar $K$. The result is proportional to $cK^2-R$ with thecoefficient given by $c\simeq 2$. The resulting form of the ensuing dynamicalequations is obtained in terms of the second fundamental form and theDalembertian of its trace, K. It is argued that this does not invalidate thephysical conclusions obtained from the "zero rigidity" ansatz $c=0$ used inprevious work.
