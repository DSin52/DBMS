Title: Motion of a Rigid Body in Body-Fixed Coordinate System -- for

Autoparrallel Trajectories in Spaces with TorsionComments: Postscript in src. For related work see the www adress

We use a recently developed action principle in spaces with curvature andtorsion to derive the Euler equations of motion for a rigid body within thebody-fixed coordinate system. This serves as an example that the particletrajectories in a space with curvature and torsion follow the straightest paths(autoparallels), not the shortest paths (geodesics), as commonly believed.
