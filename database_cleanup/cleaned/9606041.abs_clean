Authors: D.V. Gal'tsov

Comments: Published in ``Quantum Field Theory under the Influence of External

Conditions'', M. Bordag (Ed.) (Proc. of the International Workshop, Leipzig,Germany, 18--22 September 1995), B.G. Teubner Verlagsgessellschaft,Stuttgart--Leipzig, 1996, pp. 228-237Kinnersley--type representation is constructed for the four--dimensionalEinstein--Maxwell--dilaton--axion system restricted to space--times possessingtwo non--null commuting Killing symmetries. New representation essentially usesthe matrix--valued $SL(2,R)$ formulation and effectively reduces theconstruction of the Geroch group to the corresponding problem for the vacuumEinstein equations. An infinite hierarchy of potentials is introduced in termsof $2\times 2$ real symmetric matrices generalizing the scalar hierarchy ofKinnersley--Chitre known for the vacuum Einstein equations.
