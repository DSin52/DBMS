Title: Some Speculations about Black Hole Entropy in String Theory

Authors: Leonard Susskind

Comments: 11 pp., 5 figures (amstex)

The classical Bekenstein entropy of a black hole is argued to arise fromconfigurations of strings with ends which are frozen on the horizon. Quantumcorrections to this entropy are probably finite unlike the case in quantumfield theory. Finally it is speculated that all black holes are single stringstates. The level density of strings is of the right order of magnitude toreproduce the Bekenstein entropy.
