We investigate the quantum aspects of three-dimensional gravity with apositive cosmological constant. The reduced phase space of thethree-dimensional de Sitter gravity is obtained as the space which consists ofthe Kerr-de Sitter space-times and their Virasoro deformations. A quantizationof the phase space is carried out by the geometric quantization of thecoadjoint orbits of the asymptotic Virasoro symmetries. The Virasoro algebraswith real central charges are obtained as the quantum asymptotic symmetries.The states of globally de Sitter and point particle solutions become theprimary states of the unitary irreducible representations of the Virasoroalgebras. It is shown that those states are perturbatively stable at thequantum level. The Virasoro deformations of these solutions correspond to theexcited states in the unitary irreducible representations. In view of thedS/CFT correspondence, we also study the relationship between the Liouvillefield theory obtained by a reduction of the SL(2;$\mathbb{C}$) Chern-Simonstheory and the three-dimensional gravity both classically and quantummechanically. In the analyses of the both theories, the Kerr-de Sittergeometries with nonzero angular momenta do not give the unitary representationsof the Virasoro algebras.
