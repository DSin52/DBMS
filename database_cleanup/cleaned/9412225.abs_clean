The Pauli Hamiltonian for a spin $\frac{1}{2}$ charged particle interactingwith a point magnetic vortex and $1/r^{2}$ potential exhibits a dynamicalsupersymmetry $Osp(1,1)$ on the plane except at the origin. Using thissymmetry, the spectrum and the wave functions have been obtained. And, thedynamical supersymmetry could be imported to the case when an external harmonicpotential is added.
