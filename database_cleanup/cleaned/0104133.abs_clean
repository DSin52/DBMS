We extend our previous work on the quasi-particle excitations in N=4non-commutative U(1) Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature. We show thatabove some critical temperature there is a tachyon in the spectrum ofexcitations. It is a collective transverse photon mode polarized in thenon-commutative plane. Thus the theory seems to undergo a phase transition athigh temperature. Furthermore we find that the group velocity ofquasi-particles generically exceeds the speed of light at low momentum.
