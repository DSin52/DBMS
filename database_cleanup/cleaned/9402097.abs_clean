Motivated by some questions in the path integral approach to (topological)map from a manifold $M$ to a compact group $G$, is it possible to smoothly`diagonalize' it, i.e.~conjugate it into a map to a maximal torus $T$ of $G$?We analyze the local and global obstructions and give a complete solution tothe problem for regular maps. We establish that these can always be smoothlydiagonalized locally and that the obstructions to doing this globally arenon-trivial Weyl group and torus bundles on $M$. We show how the patching oflocal diagonalizing maps gives rise to non-trivial $T$-bundles, explain therelation to winding numbers of maps into $G/T$ and restrictions of thestructure group and examine the behaviour of gauge fields under thisdiagonalization. We also discuss the complications that arise for non-regularmaps and in the presence of non-trivial $G$-bundles. In particular, weestablish a relation between the existence of regular sections of a non-trivialadjoint bundle and restrictions of the structure group of a principal$G$-bundle to $T$. We use these results to justify a Weyl integral formula forfunctional integrals which, as a novel feature not seen in thefinite-dimensional case, contains a summation over all those topological$T$-sectors which arise as restrictions of a trivial principal $G$ bundle andwhich was used previously to solve completely Yang-Mills theory and the $G/G$model in two dimensions.
