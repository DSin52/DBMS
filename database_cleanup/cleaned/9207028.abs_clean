It is shown that the probability distribution $P(\lambda)$ for the effectivecosmological constant is sharply peaked at $\lambda=0$ in stochastic (or"fifth-time") stabilized quantum gravity. The effect is similar to theBaum-Hawking mechanism, except that it comes about due to quantum fluctuations,rather than as a zeroth-order (in $\hbar$) semiclassical effect.
