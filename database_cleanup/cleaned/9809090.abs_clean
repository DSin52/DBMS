Title: Geometrical Superconformal Anomalies

Authors: Johanna Erdmenger and Christian Rupp

Comments: 7 pages, LaTeX, AMSLaTeX

We determine the structure of geometrical superconformal anomalies for N=1supersymmetric quantum field theories on curved superspace to all orders in hbar. For the massless Wess-Zumino model we show how these anomalies contributeto the local Callan-Symanzik equation which expresses the breakdown ofsuperconformal symmetry in terms of the usual beta and gamma functions.
