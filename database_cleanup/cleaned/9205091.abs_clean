In recent work, several classes of solitonic solutions of string theory withhigher-membrane structure have been obtained. These solutions can be classifiedaccording to the symmetry possessed by the solitons in the subspace of thespacetime transverse to the membrane. Solitons with four-dimensional sphericalsymmetry represent instanton solutions in string theory, while those withthree-dimensional spherical symmetry represent magnetic monopole-typesolutions. For both of these classes, we discuss bosonic as well as heteroticsolutions.
