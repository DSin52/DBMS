This review is devoted to the application of bosonization techniques to twodimensional QCD. We start with a description of the ``abelian bosonization".The methods of the abelian bosonization are applied to several examples likethe Thirring model, the Schwinger model and QCD$_2$. The failure of this schemeto handle flavored fermions is explained. Witten's non-abelian bosonizationrules are summarized including the generalization to the case of fermions withcolor and flavor degrees of freedom. We discuss in details the bosonic versionof the mass bilinear of colored-flavored fermions in various schemes. The colorgroup is gauged and the full bosonized version of massive multiflavor QCD iswritten down. The strong coupling limit is taken in the ``product scheme" andthen in the $U(N_F\times N_C)$ scheme. Once the multiflavor $QCD_2$ action inthe interesting region of the low energies is written down, we extract thesemiclassical low lying baryonic spectrum. First classical soliton solutions ofthe bosonic action are derived. Quantizing the flavor space around thoseclassical solutions produces the masses as well as the flavor properties of thetwo dimensional baryons. In addition low lying multibaryonic solutions arepresented, as well as wave functions and matrix elements of interest, like$q\bar q$ content.
