We compute all string tree level correlation functions of vertex operators in$c<1$ string theory. This is done by using the ring structure of the theory. Inorder to study the multicritical behaviour, we calculate the correlationfunctions after perturbation by physical vertex operators. We show that the$(2k-1,2)$ models can be obtained from the $(1,2)$ model and the minimal modelscan be obtained from the $(1,p)$ model by perturbing the action by appropriatephysical operators. Our results are consistent with known results from matrixmodels.
