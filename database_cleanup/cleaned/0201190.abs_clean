We consider the su(2) and su(3) affine theories on a cylinder, from the pointof view of their discrete internal symmetries. To this end, we adapt the usualtreatment of boundary conditions leading to the Cardy equation to take thesymmetry group into account. In this context, the role of the Ishibashi statesfrom all (non periodic) bulk sectors is emphasized. This formalism is thenapplied to the su(2) and su(3) models, for which we determine the action of thesymmetry group on the boundary conditions, and we compute the twisted partitionfunctions. Most if not all data relevant to the symmetry properties of aspecific model are hidden in the graphs associated with its partition function,and their subgraphs. A synoptic table is provided that summarizes the manyconnections between the graphs and the symmetry data that are to be expected ingeneral.
