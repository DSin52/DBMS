We comment on some calculations concerning the finite-thickness correctionsto the (generalized) Nambu action for a curved domain wall in Minkowski space.Contrary to a recent claim in the literature, we find no first ordercorrections in the wall-thickness, and only one second order correctionproportional to the Ricci curvature of the wall. These results are obtained byconsistently expanding the action and the equations of motion for the scalarfield.
