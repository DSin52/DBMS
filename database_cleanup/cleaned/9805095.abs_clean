Certain (3+1)-dimensional chiral non-Abelian gauge theories have been shownto exhibit a new type of global gauge anomaly, which in the Hamiltonianformulation is due to the fermion zero-modes of a Z-string-like configurationof the gauge potential and the corresponding spectral flow. Here, we clarifythe relation between this Z-string global gauge anomaly and other anomalies inboth 3+1 and 2+1 dimensions. We then point out a possible trade-off between the(3+1)-dimensional Z-string global gauge anomaly and the violation of CPT andLorentz invariance.
