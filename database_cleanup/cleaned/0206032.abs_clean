We present a class of static membrane solutions, with non-flat worldvolumegeometry, in the eleven dimensional supergravity with source terms. This classof solutions contains supersymmetric as well as a large class ofnon-supersymmetric configurations. We comment about near horizon limit andstability of these solutions and point out an interesting relation with certaintwo dimensional dilaton gravity system.
