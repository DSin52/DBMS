The extension structure of the 2-dimensional current algebra of non-linearsigma models is analysed by introducing Kostant Sternberg $(L,M)$ systems. Itis found that the algebra obeys a two step extension by abelian ideals. Thesecond step is a non-split extension of a representation of the quotient of thealgebra by the first step of the extension. The cocycle which appears isanalysed.
