We study dilaton-electrodynamics in flat spacetime and exhibit a set ofglobal cosmic string like solutions in which the magnetic flux is confined.These solutions continue to exist for a small enough dilaton mass but cease todo so above a critcal value depending on the magnetic flux. There also existdomain wall and Dirac monopole solutions. We discuss a mechanism wherebymagnetic monopolesmight have been confined by dilaton cosmic strings during anepoch in the early universe during which the dilaton was massless.
