A subclass of recently discovered class of solutions in multidimensionalgravity with intersecting p-branes related to Lie algebras and governed by aset of harmonic functions is considered. This subclass in case of threeEuclidean p-branes (one electric and two magnetic) contains a cosmological-typesolution (in 11-dimensional model with two 4-forms) related to hyperbolicKac-Moody algebra ${\cal F}_3$ (of rank 3). This solution describes thenon-Kasner power-law inflation.
