Title: More on scattering of Chern-Simons vortices

Comments: discussion around Eq.(45) is generalised, one more condition for the

local right-angle scattering is addedJournal-ref: Phys.Rev. D51 (1995) 7052-7059

I derive a general formalism for finding kinetic terms of the effectiveLagrangian for slowly moving Chern-Simons vortices. Deformations of fieldslinear in velocities are taken into account. From the equations they mustsatisfy I extract the kinetic term in the limit of coincident vortices. Forvortices passing one over the other there is locally the right-anglescattering. The method is based on analysis of field equations instead ofaction functional so it may be useful also for nonvariational equations innonrelativistic models of Condensed Matter Physics.
