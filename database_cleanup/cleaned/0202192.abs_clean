We consider an extension of the gauge-fixing procedure in the framework ofthe Lagrangian superfield BRST and BRST-antiBRST quantization schemes forarbitrary gauge theories, taking into account the possible ambiguity in thechoice of the superfield antibracket. We show that this ambiguity is fixed bythe algebraic properties of the antibracket and the form of the BRST andantiBRST transformations, realized in terms of superspace translations. TheWard identities related to the generalized gauge-fixing procedure are obtained.
