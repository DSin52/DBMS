The purpose of the present thesis is to give a self-contained review of thesolvable Lie algebra approach to supergravity problems related with S, T and Udualities. After recalling the general features of dualities in bothSuperstring theory and Supergravity, we introduce the solvable Lie algebraformalism as an alternative description of the scalar manifold in a broad classof supergravity theories. It is emphasized how this mathematical technique onone hand allows to achieve a geometrical intrinsic characterization ofRamond-Ramond, Neveu-Schwarz and Peccei-Quinn scalars, once the supergravitytheory is interpreted as the low energy limit of a suitably compactifiedsuperstring theory, on the other hand provides a convenient framework in whichto deal with several non-perturbative problems. Using solvable Lie algebras forinstance we find a general mechanism for spontaneous N=2 to N=1 localsupersymmetry breaking. Moreover solvable Lie algebras are used to define ageneral method for studying systematically BPS saturated Black Hole solutionsin supergravity.
