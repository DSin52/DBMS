We consider \caln=1 supersymmetric SO(N) gauge theory with a symmetrictraceless tensor. This theory saturates 't Hooft matching conditions at theorigin of the moduli space. This naively suggests a confining phase, butBrodie, Cho, and Intriligator have conjectured that the origin of the modulispace is in a Non-Abelian Coulomb phase. We construct a dual description by thedeconfinement method, and also show that the theory indeed has an infraredfixed point for certain values of N. This result supports their argument.
