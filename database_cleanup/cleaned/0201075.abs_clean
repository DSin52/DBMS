We describe a new technique for calculating instanton effects insupersymmetric gauge theories applicable on the Higgs or Coulomb branches. Inthese situations the instantons are constrained and a potential is generated onthe instanton moduli space. Due to existence of a nilpotent fermionic symmetrythe resulting integral over the instanton moduli space localizes on thecritical points of the potential. Using this technology we calculate the one-and two-instanton contributions to the prepotential of SU(N) gauge theory withN=2 supersymmetry and show how the localization approach yields the predictionextracted from the Seiberg-Witten curve. The technique appears to extend toarbitrary instanton number in a tractable way.
