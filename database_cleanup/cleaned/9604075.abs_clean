Title: Kink States in $P(\phi)_2$-Models (An Algebraic Approach)

Comments: 37pp, latex2e

Several two-dimensional quantum field theory models have more than one vacuumstate. Familiar examples are the Sine-Gordon and the $\phi^4_2$-model. It isknown that these models possess states, called kink states, which interpolatedifferent vacua. A general construction scheme for kink states in the frameworkof algebraic quantum field theory is developed in a previous paper. However,for the application of this method, the crucial condition is the split propertyfor wedge algebras in the vacuum representations of the considered models. Itis believed that the vacuum representations of $P(\phi)_2$-models fulfill thiscondition, but a rigorous proof is only known for the massive free scalarfield. Therefore, we investigate in a construction of kink states which candirectly be applied to $P(\phi)_2$-model, by making use of the properties ofthe dynamic of a $P(\phi)_2$-model.
