In this paper the $c=1$ string theory is studied from the point of view oftopological field theories. Calculations are done for arbitrary genus. A changein the prescription is proposed, which reproduces the results of the $1/x^2$deformed matrix model. It is proposed that the deformed matrix model is relatedto a D-series Landau-Ginzburg superpotential.
