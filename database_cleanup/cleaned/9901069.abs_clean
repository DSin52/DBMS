It is well known that, in the first-order formalism, pure three-dimensionalgravity is just the BF theory. Similarly, four-dimensional general relativitycan be formulated as BF theory with an additional constraint term added to theLagrangian. In this paper we show that the same is true also foras a constrained BF theory. Moreover, in any dimension these constraints arequadratic in the B field. After describing in details the structure of theseconstraints, we scketch the ``spin foam'' quantization of these theories, whichproves to be quite similar to the spin foam quantization of general relativityin three and four dimensions. In particular, in any dimension, we solve thequantum constraints and find the so-called simple representations andintertwiners. These exhibit a simple and beautiful structure that is common toall dimensions.
