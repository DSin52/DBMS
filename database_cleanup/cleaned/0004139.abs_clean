Title: Regulating the $P^+ = 0$ Singularity

Comments: 6 pages and uses sprocl.sty

I shall discuss the regulation of the $P^+ = 0$ singularity and give someexamples. Regulating the singularity induces new operators into the theory.This process seems rather different for the case of ultraviolet singularitiesthan for the case of infrared singularities.
