We consider the Nielsen identities for the two-point functions of full QCDand QED in the class of Lorentz gauges. For pedagogical reasons the identitiesare first derived in QED to demonstrate the gauge independence of the photonself-energy, and of the electron mass shell. In QCD we derive the generalidentity and hence the identities for the quark, gluon and ghost propagators.The explicit contributions to the gluon and ghost identities are calculated toone-loop order, and then we show that the quark identity requires that inon-shell schemes the quark mass renormalisation must be gauge independent.Furthermore, we obtain formal solutions for the gluon self-energy and ghostpropagator in terms of the gauge dependence of other, independent Greenfunctions.
