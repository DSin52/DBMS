We present an effective quantum action for the gauged WZW model$G_{-k}/H_{-k}$. It is conjectured that it is valid to all orders of thecentral extension $(-k)$ on the basis that it reproduces the exact spacetimegeometry of the zero modes that was previously derived in the algebraicHamiltonian formalism. Besides the metric and dilaton, the new results thatfollow from this approach include the exact axion field and the solution of thegeodesics in the exact geometry. It is found that the axion field is generallynon-zero at higher orders of $1/k$ even if it vanishes at large $k$. We workout the details in two specific coset models, one non-abelian, i.e.$SO(2,2)/SO(2,1)$ and one abelian, i.e $SL(2,\IR)\otimesSO(1,1)^{d-2}/SO(1,1)$. The simplest case $SL(2,\IR)/\IR$ corresponds to alimit.
