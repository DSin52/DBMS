The masses of the matter fields of N=2 Super-Yang-Mills theories can bedefined as parameters of deformed supersymmetry transformations. Theformulation used involves central charges for the matter fields. The explicitform of the deformed supersymmetry transformations and of the invariantLagrangian in presence of the gauge supermultiplet are constructed. This worksgeneralizes a former one, due to the same authors, which presented the freematter case.
