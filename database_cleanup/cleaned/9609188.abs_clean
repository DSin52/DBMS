We construct asymptotic solutions of the functional Schroedinger equation fora scalar field in the Gaussian approximation at large proper time. Thesesolutions describe the late proper time stages of the expansion of a meson gaswith boost invariant boundary conditions. The relevance of these solutions forthe formation of a disoriented chiral condensate in ultra relativisticcollisions is discussed.
