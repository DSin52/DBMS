Comments: 35 papes, 15 figures, LaTeX

We present a self-contained calculation of the hydrostatic pressure in$\lambda \phi^{4}$ theory with O(N) internal symmetry. In the large N limit thepressure can be expressed in a resummed form. Our calculations are based oncomposite-operator renormalization. As a byproduct, the renormalized (orimproved) energy-momentum tensor is obtained. The Dyson-Schwinger equations areused to discuss both the mass and coupling constant renormalization. We alsocalculate the high-temperature expansion for the pressure in D=4. The latter isdone by means of the Mellin transform technique.
