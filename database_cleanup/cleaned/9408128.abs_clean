We present a construction of fermionic operators in 3+1 dimensions in termsof bosonic fields in the framework of $QED_4$. The basic bosonic variables arethe electric fields $E_i$ and their conjugate momenta $A_i$. Our constructiongeneralizes the analogous constuction of fermionic operators in 2+1 dimensions.Loosely speaking, a fermionic operator is represented as a product of anoperator that creates a pointlike charge and an operator that creates aninfinitesimal t'Hooft loop of half integer strength. We also show how the axial$U(1)$ transformations are realized in this construction.
