Using a modified version of the tetrahedron equations we construct a newfamily of $N$-state three-dimensional integrable models with commutingtwo-layer transfer-matrices. We investigate a particular class of solutions tothese equations and parameterize them in terms of elliptic functions. Thecorresponding models contain one free parameter $k$ -- an elliptic modulus.
