commandA generalized theory of two-dimensional isotropic turbulence is developedbased on conformal symmetry. A number of minimal models of conformal turbulenceare solved under an extended constraint including both the enstrophy cascade byKraichnan and the discontinuity of vorticity by Saffman. There are an infinitenumber of solutions which fall into two different categories. An explicitrelation is derived in one of the categories between the central charge ofVirasoro algebra, the lowest anomalous dimension and the power of the energyspectrum. Some statistical properties such as energy spectrum, skewness,flatness and Casimir invariants are predicted and compared with numericalsimulation by the pseudospectral method.
