We propose a simple method to reduce a general p-form electrodynamics withrespect to the standard Gauss constraints. The canonical structure of thereduced theory displays a p-dependent sign which makes the essential differencebetween theories with different parities of p. This feature was observedrecently in the corresponding quantization condition for p-brane dyons. Itsuggests that these two structures are closely related.
