We study percolation on the worldsheets of string theory for $c=0,1/2,1$ and$2$. For $c<1$ we find that critical exponents measured from simulations agreequite well with the theoretical values. For $c=1$ we show how log correctionsdetermined from the exact solution reconcile numerical results with the KPZpredictions. We extend this analysis to the large $c$ regime and estimate howfinite-size effects will effectively raise the ground state energy, masking thepresence of the tachyon for moderate values of $c > 1$. It thus appears likelythat simulations for $c=2,3 \ldots$ on numerically accessible lattices willfail to even capture the qualitative behavior of the continuum limit.
