The CP-violating phases in the soft supersymmetry-breaking sector in orbifoldcompactifications with a continuous Wilson line are investigated. In this casethe modular symmetry is the Siegel modular group $Sp(4,Z)$ of genus two. Inparticular, we study the case that the hidden sector non-perturbativesuperpotential is determined by the Igusa cusp form ${\cal C}_{12}$ of modularweight 12. The effect of large non-perturbative corrections to the dilatonK\"ahler potential on the resulting CP-violating phases is also investigated.
