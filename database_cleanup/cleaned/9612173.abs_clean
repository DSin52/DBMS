The energy spectrum of the three-particle Hamiltonian obtained by replacingthe two-body trigonometric potential of the Sutherland problem by a three-bodyone of a similar form is derived. When expressed in appropriate variables, thecorresponding wave functions are shown to be expressible in terms of Jackpolynomials. The exact solvability of the problem with three-body interactionis explained by a hidden sl(3,\R) symmetry.
