Various approaches to high energy forward scattering in quantum gravity arecompared using the eikonal approximation. The massless limit of the eikonal isshown to be equivalent to other approximations for the same process,specifically the semiclassical calculation due to G. 't Hooft and thetopological field theory due to H. and E. Verlinde. This comparison clarifiesthese previous results, as it is seen that the amplitude arises purely from alinearised gravitational interaction. The interpretation of poles in thescattering amplitude is also clarified.
