Motivated by applications of twisted current algebras in description of theentropy of $Ads_3$ black hole, we investigate the simplest twisted currentalgebra $sl(3,{\bf C})^{(2)}_k$. Free field representation of the twistedalgebra and the corresponding twisted Sugawara energy-momentum tensor areobtained by using three $(\beta,\gamma)$ pairs and two scalar fields. Primaryfields and two screening currents of the first kind are presented.
