We give an intrinsic definition of the special geometry which arises inglobal N=2 supersymmetry in four dimensions. The base of an algebraicintegrable system exhibits this geometry, and with an integrality hypothesisany special Kahler manifold is so related to an integrable system. Thecotangent bundle of a special Kahler manifold carries a hyperkahler metric. Wealso define special geometry in supergravity in terms of the special geometryin global supersymmetry.
