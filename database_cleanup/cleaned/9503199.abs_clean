We consider a nonrelativistic Chern-Simons theory of planar matter fieldsinteracting with the Chern-Simons gauge field in a $SU(N)_{global} \timesU(1)_{local}$ invariant fashion. We find that this model admits staticzero-energy self-dual soliton solutions. We also present a set of exact solitonsolutions. The exact time-dependent solutions are also obtained, when thismodel is considered in the background of an external uniform magnetic field.
