Title: Schwinger-Dyson Equation, Area Law and Chiral Symmetry in QCD

Comments: 29 pages, RevTex file, Phys. Rev. macro

A Schwinger-Dyson equation for the quark propagator is derived in the contextof a Bethe-Salpeter second order formalism developped in preceding papers andof the Minimal Area Law model for the evaluation of the Wilson loop. We discusshow the equal time straight line approximation has to be modified to includecorrectly trajectories going backwards in time. We also show, by an appropriateselection of the solution of the SD equation, that in the limit of zero quarkmass chiral symmetry breaking and a zero mass pseudoscalar meson actuallyoccur. The inclusion of backward quark trajectories proves to be essential tomake the model consistent with Goldstone's theorem.
