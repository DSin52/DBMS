We investigate the tachyon coupling in a static Robertson--Walker like metricbackground. For a tachyon and dilaton field which are only time dependent onecan rewrite this model as a SU(2) Wess--Zumino--Witten model and a scalarFeigin--Fuchs theory. In this case the restriction to a real exponentialtachyon field fixes the level $k$ of the Wess--Zumino--Witten model. For aspatially dependent tachyon the world radius and the dilaton are quantized interms of $k$ and the tachyon by two integers, i.e. one has a discrete set offields. The spatial part of the tachyon is given by Chebyshev polynomials ofthe second kind. An investigation of the tachyon mass shows that the tachyon ismassless for $k=1$.
