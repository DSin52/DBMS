In this talk we construct BPS-saturated domain walls in supersymmetric QCD,for any values of the masses of the chiral matter superfields. We compare ourresults to those already obtained in the literature and we also discuss theirrange of applicability, as well as future directions that would be desirable toexplore in order to achieve a complete understanding of supersymmetricgluodynamics as a step in improving our knowledge of how QCD works.
