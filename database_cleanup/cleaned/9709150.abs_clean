It is shown that, in QED$_{3}$, the Pauli-Villars regularization involving apair of auxiliary fermion fields with masses of opposite sign leads to resultsthat are consistent with those obtained using all other parity-preservingschemes of regularization. At the same time, ambiguity problems remain unsolvedin non-Abelian models (QCD$_{3}$).
