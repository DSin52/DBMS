We continue our study of matrix models of dually weighted graphs. Among theattractive features of these models is the possibility to interpolate betweenensembles of regular and random two-dimensional lattices, relevant for thestudy of the crossover from two-dimensional flat space to two-dimensionalquantum gravity. We further develop the formalism of large $N$ characterexpansions. In particular, a general method for determining the large $N$ limitof a character is derived. This method, aside from being potentially useful fora far greater class of problems, allows us to exactly solve the matrix modelsof dually weighted graphs, reducing them to a well-posed Cauchy-Riemannproblem. The power of the method is illustrated by explicitly solving a newmodel in which only positive curvature defects are permitted on the surface, anarbitrary amount of negative curvature being introduced at a single insertion.
