International Conference "Problems of Quantum Field Theory" (Dubna, Russia,Efremov. Publishing Department of JINR, Dubna, 1999A new attempt is demonstrated that QFTs can be UV finite if they are viewedas the low energy effective theories of a fundamental underlying theory(complete and well-defined in all respects) according to the modern standardpoint of view. This approach is much simpler in principle and in technologycomparing to any known renormalization program. Some subtle and difficultissues can be easily resolved. The importance of the procedure for defining theambiguities is fully appreciated in the new approach. Some simple but importantnonperturbative examples are discussed to show the power and plausibility ofthe new approach.
