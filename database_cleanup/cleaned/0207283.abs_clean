We consider branes embedded in spacetimes of codimension one and two, with awarped metric tensor for the subspace parallel to the brane. We study a varietyof brane-world solutions arising by introducing a Schwarzschild-like black holemetric on the brane and we investigate the properties of the correspondinghigher-dimensional spacetime. We demonstrate that normalizable bulk modes leadto a vanishing flow of energy through the naked singularities. From this pointof view, these singularities are harmless.
