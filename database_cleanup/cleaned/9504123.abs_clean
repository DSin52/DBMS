It has been argued by Grigoriev and Rubakov that one can simulate real timeprocesses involving baryon number non-conservation at high temperature usingreal time evolution of classical equations, and summing over initial conditionswith a classical thermal weight. It is known that such a naive algorithm isplagued by ultraviolet divergences. In quantum theory the divergences areregularized, but the corresponding graphs involve the contributions from thehard momentum region and also the new scale $\sim gT$ comes into play. Wepropose a modified algorithm which involves solving the classical equations ofmotion for the effective hard thermal loop Hamiltonian with an ultravioletcutoff $\mu \gg gT$ and integrating over initial conditions with a properthermal weight. Such an algorithm should provide a determination of theinfrared behavior of real time correlation function $<Q(t) Q(0)>_T$ determiningthe baryon violation rate. Hopefully, the results obtained in this modifiedalgorithm would be cutoff-independent.
