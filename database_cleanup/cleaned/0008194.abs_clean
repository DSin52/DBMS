A large class of D-branes in Calabi-Yau spaces can be constructed at theGepner points using the techniques of boundary conformal field theory. In thisnote we develop methods that allow to compute open string amplitudes for suchD-branes. In particular, we present explicit formulas for the products of openstring vertex operators of untwisted A-type branes. As an application we showthat the boundary theories of the quintic associated with the specialLagrangian submanifolds Im \omega_i z_i = 0 where \omega_i^5=1 possess nocontinuous moduli.
