We extend a previous calculation which treated Schwarschild black holehorizons as quantum mechanical objects to the case of a charged, dilaton blackhole. We show that for a unique value of the dilaton parameter `a', which isdetermined by the condition of unitarity of the S matrix, black holes transformat the extremal limit into strings.
