Title: No absorption in de Sitter space

Comments: 11 pages, REVTEX

We study the wave equation for a minimally coupled massive scalar inD-dimensional de Sitter space. We compute the absorption cross section toinvestigate its cosmological horizon in the southern diamond. By analogy of thequantum mechanics, it is found that there is no absorption in de Sitter space.This means that de Sitter space is usually in thermal equilibrium, like theblack hole in anti de Sitter space. It confirms that the cosmological horizonnot only emits radiation but also absorbs that previously emitted by itself atthe same rate, keeping the curvature radius of de Sitter space fixed.
