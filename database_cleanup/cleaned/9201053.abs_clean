In the light of recent blackhole solutions inspired by string theory, wereview some old statements on field theoretic hair on blackholes. We alsodiscuss some stability issues. In particular we argue that the two dimensionalstring blackhole solution is semi-classically stable while the nakedsingularity is unstable to tachyon fluctuations. Finally we comment on therelation between the linear dilaton theory and the $2d$ blackhole solution.
