A certain class of surface motions, including those of a relativisticmembrane minimizing the 3-dimensional volume swept out in Minkowski-space, isshown to be equivalent to 3-dimensional steady-state irrotational inviscidisentropic gas-dynamics. The SU($\infty $) Nahm equations turn out tocorrespond to motions where the time $t$ at which the surface moves through thepoint $\ssatop\rhup{r}$ is a harmonic function of the three space-coordinates.This solution also implies the linearisation of a non-trivial-looking scalarfield theory.
