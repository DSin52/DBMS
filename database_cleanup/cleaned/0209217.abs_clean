We point out some intriguing analogies between field theoretic solitons(topological defects) and D-branes. Annihilating soliton-antisoliton pairs canproduce stable solitons of lower dimensionality. Solitons that localizemassless gauge fields in their world volume automatically imply the existenceof open flux tubes ending on them and closed flux tubes propagating in thebulk. We discuss some aspects of this localization on explicit examples ofunstable wall-anti-wall systems. The annihilation of these walls can bedescribed in terms of tachyon condensation which renders the world-volume gaugefield non-dynamical. During this condensation the world volume gauge fields(open string states) are resonantly excited. These can later decay into closedstrings, or get squeezed into a network flux tubes similar to a network ofcosmic strings formed at a cosmological phase transition. Although, as in the$D$-brane case, perturbatively one can find exact time-dependent solutions,when the energy of the system stays localized in the plane of the originalsoliton, such solutions are unstable with respect to decay into open and closedstring states. Thus, when a pair of such walls annihilates, the energy iscarried away (at least) by closed string excitations (``glueballs''), which arethe lowest energy excitations about the bulk vacuum. Suggested analogies can beuseful for the understanding of the complicated D-brane dynamics and of theproduction of topological defects and reheating during brane collision in theearly universe.
