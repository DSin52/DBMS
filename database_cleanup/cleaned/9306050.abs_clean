We examine the problem of determining which representations of the braidgroup on a Riemann surface are carried by the wave function of a quantizedAbelian Chern-Simons theory interacting with non-dynamical matter. Wegeneralize the quantization of Chern-Simons theory to the case where thecoefficient of the Chern-Simons term, $k$, is rational, the Riemann surface hasarbitrary genus and the total matter charge is non-vanishing. We find anexplicit solution of the Schr\"odinger equation. We find that the wavefunctions carry a representation of the braid group as well as a projectiverepresentation of the discrete group of large gauge transformations. We find afundamental constraint which relates the charges of the particles, $q_i$, thecoefficient $k$ and the genus of the manifold, $g$.
