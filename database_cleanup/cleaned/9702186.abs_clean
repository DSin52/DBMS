It is known that the high-energy quark-quark scattering amplitude can bedescribed by the expectation value of two lightlike Wilson lines, running alongthe classical trajectories of the two colliding particles. Generalizing theresults of a previous paper, we give here the general proof that theexpectation value of two infinite Wilson lines, forming a certain hyperbolicangle in Minkowski space-time, and the expectation value of two infiniteEuclidean Wilson lines, forming a certain angle in Euclidean four-space, areconnected by an analytic continuation in the angular variables. This resultcould be used to evaluate the high-energy scattering amplitude directly on thelattice.
