The model of point particle in general external fields is considered and thegeneralized equivalence principle is suggested identifying all backgroundswhich give rise to equivalent particle dynamics. The equivalencetransformations for external fields are interpreted as gauge ones. The gaugegroup appears to be a semidirect product of all phase space canonicaltransformations to an abelian ideal of "hyperWeyl" transformations and includesU(1) and general coordinate symmetries as a subgroup. The implications of thisgauge symmetry are considered and a connection of general backgrounds to theinfinite collection of Fronsdal gauge fields is studied. Although the result isnegative and no direct connection arises, it is discussed how higher spinfields could be found among general external fields if one relaxes somehow theequivalence principle. Besides, the particle action in general backgrounds isshown to reproduce the De Wit-Freedman point particle -- symmetric tensorsfirst order interaction suggested many years ago, and generalizes their resultto all orders in interaction.
