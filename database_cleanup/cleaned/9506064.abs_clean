Quantum integrable models that possess $N=2$ supersymmetry are investigatedon the half-space. Conformal perturbation theory is used to identify some $N=2$supersymmetric boundary integrable models, and the effective boundaryLandau-Ginzburg formulations are constructed. It is found that $N=2$supersymmetry largely determines the boundary action in terms of the bulk, andin particular, the boundary bosonic potential is $|W|^2$, where $W$ is the bulksuperpotential. Supersymmetry is also investigated using the affine quantumgroup symmetry of exact scattering matrices, and the affine quantum groupsymmetry of boundary reflection matrices is analyzed both for supersymmetricand more general models. Some $N=2$ supersymmetry preserving boundaryreflection matrices are given, and their connection with the boundaryLandau-Ginzburg actions is discussed.
