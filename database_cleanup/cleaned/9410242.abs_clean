Title: A Scheme Independent Definition of $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$

Authors: Hidenori Sonoda

Comments: 4 pages, harvmac

Given a renormalization scheme of QCD, one can define a mass scale$\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$ in terms of the beta function. Under a change of therenormalization scheme, however, $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$ changes by amultiplicative constant. We introduce a scheme independent $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$using a connection on the space of the coupling constant.
