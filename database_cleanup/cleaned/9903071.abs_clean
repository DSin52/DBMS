The current algebra generated by fermions coupled to external gaugepotentials and metrics on a manifold with boundary is discussed. It is shownthat the previous methods, based on index theory arguments and used in the casewithout boundaries, carry over to the present problem. The resulting currentalgebra is the same as obtained from a quantization of bosonic Chern-Simonstheories on space-times with nonempty boundaries. This means that also in thefermionic setting the construction is 'holographic', the Schwinger terms resideon the boundary.
