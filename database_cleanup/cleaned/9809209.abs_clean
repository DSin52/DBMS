We consider Yang-Mills theories with general gauge groups $G$ and twists onthe four torus. We find consistent boundary conditions for gauge fields in allinstanton sectors. An extended Abelian projection with respect to the Polyakovloop operator is presented, where $A_0$ is independent of time and in theCartan subalgebra. Fundamental domains for the gauge fixed $A_0$ areconstructed for arbitrary gauge groups. In the sectors with non-vanishinginstanton number such gauge fixings are necessarily singular. The singularitiescan be restricted to Dirac strings joining magnetically charged defects. Themagnetic charges of these monopoles take their values in the co-root lattice ofthe gauge group. We relate the magnetic charges of the defects and the windingsof suitable Higgs fields about these defects to the instanton number.
