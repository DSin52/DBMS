We construct several new G(2) holonomy metrics that play an important role inrecent studies of geometrical transitions in compactifications of M-theory tofour dimensions. In type IIA string theory these metrics correspond to D6branes wrapped on the three-cycle of the deformed conifold and the resolvedconifold with two-form RR flux on the blown-up two-sphere, which are related bya conifold transition. We also study a G(2) metric that is related in type IIAto the line bundle over S^2 x S^2 with RR two-form flux. Our approach exploitssystematically the definition of torsion-free G(2) structures in terms ofthree-forms which are closed and co-closed. Besides being an elegant formalismthis turns out to be a practical tool to construct G(2) holonomy metrics.
