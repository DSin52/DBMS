We investigate the evolution of a scalar field propagating inReissner--Nordstr\"{o}m Anti--de Sitter spacetime. Due to the characteristic ofspacetime geometry, the radiative tails associated with a massless scalar fieldpropagation have an oscillatory exponential decay. The object--picture of thequasinormal ringing has also been obtained. For small charges, the approach tothermal equilibrium is faster for larger charges. However, after the black holecharge reaches a critical value, we get the opposite behavior for the imaginaryfrequencies of the quasinormal modes. Some possible explanations concerning thewiggle of the imaginary frequencies have been given. The picture of thequasinormal modes depending on the multipole index has also been illustrated.
