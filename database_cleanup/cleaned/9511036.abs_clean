Polytechnique, Palaiseau (May 1995), to appear in ProcAn effective lagrangian analysis of gaugino condensation is performed in asupersymmetric gauge theory with field-dependent gauge couplings described witha linear multiplet. An original aspect of this effective lagrangian is the useof a real vector superfield to describe composite gauge invariant degrees offreedom. The duality equivalence of this approach with the more familiarformulation using a chiral superfield is demonstrated. These results stronglysuggest that chiral-linear duality survives nonperturbative effects insuperstrings.
