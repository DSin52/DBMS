We analize the algebraic structure of consistent and covariant anomalies init is possible to describe them in a unified way. Then we study theirrepresentations by means of functional determinants, showing how the algebraicsolution determines the relevant operators for the definition of the effectivefunctional methods the covariant anomaly for the spin-current and for theenergy-momentum tensor in presence of a curved background. With regard to theconsistent sector we are able to give a general functional solution only forcontinuous family of operators whose determinant describes the effective actionof chiral spinors in curved space. We compute this action and we generalize theresult in presence of a $U(1)$ gauge connection. Accepted for publication inFortschritte der Physik.
