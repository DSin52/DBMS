Nonabelian DualityDynamics of many supersymmetric monopoles are studied in the low energyapproximation. A conjecture for the exact moduli space metric is given for allcollections of fundamental monopoles of distinct type, and various partialconfirmations of the conjecture are discussed. Upon the quantization of theresulting multi-monopole dynamics in the context of $N=4$ supersymmetricYang-Mills-Higgs theories, one recovers the missing magnetic states that aredual to some of the massive vector mesons. A generalization to monopoles withnonabelian charges is also discussed.
