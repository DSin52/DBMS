We show how Higgs mechanism for non-abelian N=2 gauge theories in fourdimensions is geometrically realized in the context of type II strings astransitions among compactifications of Calabi-Yau threefolds. We use thisresult and T-duality of a further compacitification on a circle to derive N=4,d=3 dual field theories. This reduces dualities for N=4 gauge systems in threedimensions to perturbative symmetries of string theory. Moreover we find thatthe dual of a gauge system always exists but may or may not correspond to alagrangian system. In particular we verify a conjecture of Intriligator andSeiberg that an ordinary gauge system is dual to compactification ofExceptional tensionless string theory down to three dimensions.
