Title: Actions for Integrable Systems and Deformed Conformal Theories

Authors: Jeremy Schiff

Comments: (based on a talk given at the NSERC-CAP Workshop, "Quantum Groups,

Integrable Models and Statistical Systems", Kingston, Ontario, Canada, July1992), 11 pages, plain tex, no figures, IASSNS-HEP-92/76I report on work on a Lagrangian formulation for the simplest 1+1 dimensionalintegrable hierarchies. This formulation makes the relationship betweenconformal field theories and (quantized) 1+1 dimensional integrable hierarchiesvery clear.
