"Supersymmetry and Quantum Symmetries", JINR, Dubna, Russia, July 26-31,1999(to appear in Proceedings)We review the interactions of massive fields of arbitrary integer spins withthe constant electromagnetic field and symmetrical Einstein space in the gaugeinvariant framework. The problem of obtaining the gauge-invariant Lagrangiansof integer spin fields in an external field is reduced to purely algebraicproblem of finding a set of operators with certain features using therepresentation of the higher-spin fields in the form of vectors in apseudo-Hilbert space. Such a construction is considered up to the second orderfor the electromagnetic field and at linear approximation for symmetricalEinstein space. The results obtained are valid for space-time of arbitrarydimensionality.
