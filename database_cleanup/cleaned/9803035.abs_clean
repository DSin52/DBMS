A lattice gauge theory with an action polynomial in independent fieldvariables is considered. The link variables are described by unconstrainedcomplex matrices instead of unitary ones. A mechanism which permits to switchoff in the continuous limit the arising extra fields is discussed. TheEuclidean version of the theory with an 4-dimensional lattice is described. Thecanonical form of this theory in Lorentz coordinates with continuous time isgiven. The canonical formulation in the light-front coordinates is investigatedfor the lattice in 2-dimensional transverse space and for the 3-dimensionallattice including one of the light-like coordinates. The light-front zero modeproblem is considered in the framework of this canonical formulation.
