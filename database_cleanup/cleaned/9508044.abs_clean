We demonstrate that type II string theory compactified on a singularCalabi-Yau manifold is related to $c=1$ string theory compactified at theself-dual radius. We establish this result in two ways. First we show thatcomplex structure deformations of the conifold correspond, on the mirrormanifold, to the problem of maps from two dimensional surfaces to $S^2$. Usingtwo dimensional QCD we show that this problem is identical to $c=1$ stringtheory. We then give an alternative derivation of this correspondence bymapping the theory of complex structure deformations of the conifold toChern-Simons theory on $S^3$. These results, in conjunction with similarresults obtained for the compactification of the heterotic string on $K_3\timesT^2$, provide strong evidence in favour of S-duality between type II stringscompactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold and the heterotic string on $K_3\timesT^2$.
