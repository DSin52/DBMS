Null vectors are generalized to the case of indecomposable representationswhich are one of the main features of logarithmic conformal field theories.This is done by developing a compact formalism with the particular advantagethat the stress energy tensor acting on Jordan cells of primary fields andtheir logarithmic partners can still be represented in form of lineardifferential operators. Since the existence of singular vectors is subject tomuch stronger constraints than in regular conformal field theory, they alsoprovide a powerful tool for the classification of logarithmic conformal fieldtheories.
