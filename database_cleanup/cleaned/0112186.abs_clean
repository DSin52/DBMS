We transform static solutions of space-noncommutative Dirac-Born-Infeldtheory (DBI) into static solutions of space-time noncommutative DBI. ViaSeiberg-Witten map we match this symmetry transformation with a correspondingmonopoles, with constant electric and magnetic background and describe themboth in the commutative and in the noncommutative setting; 2) relate byS-duality space-noncommutative magnetic monopoles to space-noncommutativeelectric monopoles
