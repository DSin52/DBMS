Title: String Vacua with N=2 Supersymmetry in Four Dimensions

Authors: Dieter Lust

Comments: 50 pages; review based on talks at SUSY '97 in Philadelphia,

Symposium Ahrenshoop 1997 in Buckow and TMR-meeting 1997 in Neuchatel;one reference added in replaced versionIn this article we review four-dimensional string vacua with N=2 space-timesupersymmetry. In particular, we will discuss several aspects of thestring-string duality between the heterotic string, compactified on $K3\timesT^2$, and the type II superstring compactified on a Calabi-Yau three-fold. Weinvestigate the massless supersymmetric spectra, showing agreement for a largeclass of dual heterotic/type II string pairs. Some emphasis is given tonon-perturbative heterotic phenomena, such as non-perturbative transitionsamong different vacua and strong coupling singularities, and to their geometricCalabi-Yau description on the type II side. We compare the effective N=2supergravity actions of dual heterotic/type II string compactifications, andshow that the N=2 prepotentials and also higher order gravitational couplingsnicely agree in the weak heterotic coupling limit. Finally we consider extremalblack hole solutions of N=2 supergravity which arise in the context ofheterotic or type II N=2 compactifications. For the type II backgrounds we showhow the entropies of these black holes depend on the topological data of theunderlying Calabi-Yau spaces; we also construct massless black holes which arerelevant for the conifold transition among different Calabi-Yau vacua.
