Analogues of the KP and the Toda lattice hierarchy called dispersionless KPand Toda hierarchy are studied. Dressing operations in the dispersionlesshierarchies are introduced as a canonical transformation, quantization of whichis dressing operators of the ordinary KP and Toda hierarchy. An alternativeconstruction of general solutions of the ordinary KP and Toda hierarchy isgiven as twistor construction which is quatization of the similar constructionof solutions of dispersionless hierarchies. These results as well as thoseobtained in previous papers are presented with proofs and necessary technicaldetails.
