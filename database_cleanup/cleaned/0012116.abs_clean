Using a metric-based formalism to treat cosmological perturbations, wediscuss the connection between anisotropic stress on the brane and branebending. First we discuss gauge-transformations, and draw our attention togauges, in which the brane-positions remain unperturbed. We provide a uniquegauge, where perturbations both on the brane and in the bulk can be treatedwith generality. For vanishing anisotropic stresses on the brane, this gaugereduces to the generalized longitudinal gauge. We further comment on thegravitational interaction between the branes and the bulk.
