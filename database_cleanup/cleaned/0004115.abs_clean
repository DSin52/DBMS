We study a non-commutative non-relativistic scalar field theory in 2+1dimensions. The theory shows the UV/IR mixing typical of QFT on non-commutativespaces. The one-loop correction to the two-point function turns out to be givenby a delta-function in momentum space. The one-loop correction to thefour-point function is of logarithmic type. We also evaluate the thermodynamicpotential at two-loop order. To avoid an IR-singularity we have to introduce achemical potential. The suppression of the non-planar contribution with respectto the planar one turns out to depend crucially on the value of the chemicalpotential.
