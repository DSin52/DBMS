We consider the 1+1 dimensional N = (2,2) supersymmetric matrix model whichis obtained by dimensionally reducing N = 1 super Yang-Mills from four to twodimensions. The gauge groups we consider are U(Nc) and SU(Nc), where Nc isfinite but arbitrary. We adopt light-cone coordinates, and choose to work inthe light-cone gauge. Quantizing this theory via Discretized Light-ConeQuantization (DLCQ) introduces an integer, K, which restricts the light-conemomentum-fraction of constituent quanta to be integer multiples of 1/K.Solutions to the DLCQ bound state equations are obtained for K=2,3,...,6 bydiscretizing the light-cone supercharges, which results in a supersymmetricspectrum. Our numerical results imply the existence of normalizable masslessstates in the continuum limit K -> infinity, and therefore the absence of amass gap. The low energy spectrum is dominated by string-like (or many parton)states. Our results are consistent with the claim that the theory is in ascreening phase.
