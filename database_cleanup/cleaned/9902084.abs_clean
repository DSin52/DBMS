We apply the formalism of extended BRS symmetry to the investigation of thegauge dependence of the effective potential in a spontaneously symmetry brokengauge theory. This formalism, which includes a set of Grassmann parametersdefined as the BRS variations of the gauge-fixing parameters, allows us toderive in a quick and unambiguous way the related Nielsen identities, whichexpress the physical gauge independence, in a class of generalized 't Hooftgauges, of the effective potential. We show in particular that the validity ofthe Nielsen identities does not require any constraint on the gauge-fixingparameters, to the contrary of some claims found in the literature. We use themethod of algebraic renormalization, which leads to results independent of theparticular renormalization scheme used.
