We analyze an abelian gauge model in 3 dimensions which includes masslessscalar matter fields. By controlling the trace anomalies with a localdilatation Ward identity, we show that, in perturbation theory and within theBPHZL scheme, the Chern-Simons term has no radiative corrections. This implies,in particular, the vanishing of the corresponding $\beta$ function in therenormalization group equation.
