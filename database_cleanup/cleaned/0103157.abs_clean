We analyze the vacuum structure of spontaneously broken N=2 supersymmetricgauge theory with the Fayet-Iliopoulos term. Our theory is based on the gaugegroup SU(2) \times U(1) with N_f=1,2 massless quark hypermultiplets having thesame U(1) charges. In the classical potential, there are degenerate vacua evenin the absence of supersymmetry. It is shown that this vacuum degeneracy issmoothed out, once quantum corrections are taken into account. In N_f=1 case,the effective potential is found to be so-called runaway type, and there isneither well-defined vacuum nor local minimum. On the other hand, in N_f=2case, while there is also the runaway direction in the effective potential, wefind the possibility that there appears the local minimum with brokensupersymmetry at the degenerate dyon point.
