Title: q-Deformed Brownian Motion

Comments: 6 pages

Brownian motion may be embedded in the Fock space of bosonic free field inone dimension.Extending this correspondence to a family of creation andannihilation operators satisfying a q-deformed algebra, the notion ofq-deformation is carried from the algebra to the domain of stochasticprocesses.The properties of q-deformed Brownian motion, in particular itsnon-Gaussian nature and cumulant structure,are established.
