The Bethe-Salpeter equation provides the most widely used technique toextract bound states and resonances in a relativistic Quantum Field Theory.Nevertheless a thorough discussion how to identify its solutions with physicalstates is still missing. The occurrence of complex eigenvalues of thehomogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation complicates this issue further. Using aperturbative expansion in the mass difference of the constituents wedemonstrate for scalar fields bound by a scalar exchange that the underlyingmechanism which results in complex eigenvalues is the crossing of a normal (orabnormal) with an abnormal state. Based on an investigation of therenormalization of one-particle properties we argue that these crossings happenbeyond the applicability region of the ladder Bethe-Salpeter equation. Theimplications for a fermion-antifermion bound state in QED are discussed, and aconsistent interpretation of the bound state spectrum of QED is proposed.
