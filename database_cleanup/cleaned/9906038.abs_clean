We present a model for high energy two body scattering in a quantum theory ofgravity. The model is applicable for center of mass energies higher than therelevant Planck scale. At impact parameters smaller than the Schwarzchildradius appropriate to the center of mass energy and total charge of the initialstate, the cross section is dominated by an inelastic process in which a singlelarge black hole is formed. The black hole then decays by Hawking radiation.The elastic cross section is highly suppressed at these impact parametersbecause of the small phase space for thermal decay into a high energy two bodystate. For very large impact parameter the amplitude is dominated byeikonalized single graviton exchange. At intermediate impact parameters thescattering is more complicated, but since the Schwarzchild radius grows withenergy, we speculate that a more sophisticated eikonal calculation which usesthe nonlinear classical solutions of the field equations may provide a goodapproximation at all larger impact parameters. We discuss the extent to whichblack hole production will be observable in theories with low scale quantumgravity and large dimensions.
