We discuss the four-dimensional cosmological constant problem in afive-dimensional setting. A scalar field coupled to the SM forms dynamically asmooth brane with four-dimensional Poincare invariance, independently of SMphysics. In this respect, our solution may be regarded as a self-tuningsolution, free of any singularities and fine-tuning problems.
