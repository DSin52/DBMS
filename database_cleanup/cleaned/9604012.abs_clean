The problem of a nonrelativistic particle with an internal color degree offreedom, with and without spin, moving in a free random gauge background isdiscussed. Freeness is a concept developed recently in the mathematicalliterature connected with noncommuting random variables. In the context oflarge-N hermitian matrices, it means that the the multi-matrix model consideredcontains no bias with respect to the relative orientations of the matrices. Insuch a gauge background, the spectrum of a colored particle can be solved foranalytically. In three dimensions, near zero momentum, the energy distributionfor the spinless particle displays a gap, while the energy distribution for theparticle with spin does not.
