Phys. Lett. A (some comments are added in the final parts)We derive a new version of SU(3) non-Abelian Stokes theorem by making use ofthe coherent state representation on the coset space $SU(3)/(U(1)\timesU(1))=F_2$, the flag space. Then we outline a derivation of the area law of theWilson loop in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory in the maximal Abelian gauge (Thedetailed exposition will be given in a forthcoming article). This derivation isperformed by combining the non-Abelian Stokes theorem with the reformulation ofthe Yang-Mills theory as a perturbative deformation of a topological fieldtheory recently proposed by one of the authors. Within this framework, we showthat the fundamental quark is confined even if $G=SU(3)$ is broken by partialgauge fixing into $H=U(2)$ just as $G$ is broken to $H=U(1) \times U(1)$. Anorigin of the area law is related to the geometric phase of the Wilczek-Zeeholonomy for U(2). Abelian dominance is an immediate byproduct of these resultsand magnetic monopole plays the dominant role in this derivation.
