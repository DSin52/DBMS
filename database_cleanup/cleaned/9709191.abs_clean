Under the assumption of axial symmetry we introduce a map from dilatonicgravity to a string-like action. This map allows one to introduce, in a rathersimple way, the equivalent of string theory T-duality in dilatonic gravity.Here we choose the duality group to be an $SO(2,1)$ group and, for a particularrotation, we recover a symmetry of dilatonic gravity discussed previously inthe literature.
