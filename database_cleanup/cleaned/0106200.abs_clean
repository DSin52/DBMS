The dynamics of totally symmetric free massless higher spin fields in $AdS_d$is reformulated in terms of the compensator formalism for AdS gravity. The$AdS_5$ higher spin algebra is identified with the star product algebra withthe $su(2,2)$ vector (i.e., $o(4,2)$ spinor) generating elements. Cubicinteractions of the totally symmetric bosonic higher spin gauge fields in$AdS_5$, including the interaction with gravity, are formulated at the actionlevel.
