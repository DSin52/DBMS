We study supersymmetric $SU(N-4)$ gauge theories with a symmetric tensor and$N$ antifundamental representations. The theory with $W=0$ has a dualdescription in terms of a non-chiral $Spin(8)$ theory with one spinor and $N$vectors. This duality flows to the $SO(N)$ duality of Seiberg and to a dualityproposed by one of us. It also flows to dualities for a number of $Spin(m)$theories, $m\le 8$. For $N=6$, when an ${\cal N}=2$ SUSY superpotential isadded, the singularities of Seiberg and Witten are recovered. For $N\le 6$, amass for the spinor generates the branches of $SO(8)$ theories found byIntriligator and Seiberg. Other phenomena include a classical constraint mappedto an anomaly equation under duality and an intricate consistency check on therenormalization group flow.
