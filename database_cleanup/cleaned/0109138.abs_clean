We introduce three non-local observables for the two-dimensional Ising model.At criticality, conformal field theory may be used to obtain theoreticalpredictions for their behavior. These formulae are explicit enough to show thattheir asymptotics are described by highest weights $h_{pq}$ from the Kac tablefor c=1/2 distinct from those of the three unitary representations (0, 1/16 and1/2).
