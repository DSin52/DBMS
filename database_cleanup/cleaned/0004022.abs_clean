Branes are ubiquitous elements of any low-energy limit of string theory. Wepoint out that negative tension branes violate all the standard energyconditions of the higher-dimensional spacetime they are embedded in; this opensthe door to very peculiar solutions of the higher-dimensional Einsteinequations. Building upon the (3+1)-dimensional implementation of fundamentalstring theory, we illustrate the possibilities by considering a toy modelconsisting of a (2+1)-dimensional brane propagating through our observable(3+1)-dimensional universe. Developing a notion of "brane surgery", based onthe Israel--Lanczos--Sen "thin shell" formalism of general relativity, weanalyze the dynamics and find traversable wormholes, closed baby universes,voids (holes in the spacetime manifold), and an evasion (not a violation) ofboth the singularity theorems and the positive mass theorem. These featuresincludes the Randall--Sundrum models and their variants.
