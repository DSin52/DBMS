We find the finite volume QCD partition function for arbitrary quark masses.This is a generalization of a result obtained by Leutwyler and Smilga for equalquark masses. Our result is derived in the sector of zero topological chargeusing a generalization of the Itzykson-Zuber integral appropriate for arbitrarycomplex matrices. We present a conjecture regarding the result for arbitrarytopological charge which reproduces the Leutwyler-Smilga result in the limit ofequal quark masses. We derive a formula of the Itzykson-Zuber type forarbitrary {\em rectangular\/} complex matrices, extending the result of Guhrand Wettig obtained for {\em square\/} matrices.
