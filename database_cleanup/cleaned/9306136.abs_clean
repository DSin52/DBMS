We analyze the subdivision properties of certain lattice gauge theories forthe discrete abelian groups $Z_{p}$, in four dimensions. In these particularmodels we show that the Boltzmann weights are invariant under all $(k,l)$subdivision moves, when the coupling scale is a $p$th root of unity. For thecase of manifolds with boundary, we demonstrate analytically that Alexandertype $2$ and $3$ subdivision of a bounding simplex is equivalent to theinsertion of an operator which equals a delta function on trivial boundingholonomies. The four dimensional model then gives rise to an effective gaugeinvariant three dimensional model on its boundary, and we compute thecombinatorially invariant value of the partition function for the case of$S^{3}$ and $S^{2}\times S^{1}$.
