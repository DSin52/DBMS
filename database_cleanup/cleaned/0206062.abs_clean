We elaborate on the symmetry breaking pattern involved in the Penrose limitof $AdS_{d+1} \times S^{d+1}$ spacetimes and the corresponding limit of the CFTdual. For d=2 we examine in detail how the symmetries contract to products ofrotation and Heisenberg algebras, both from the bulk and CFT points of view.Using a free field realization of these algebras acting on products ofelementary fields of the CFT with SO(2) R charge +1, we show that this processof contraction restricts all the fields to a few low angular momentum modes andensures that the field with R charge -1 does not appear. This provides anunderstanding of several important aspects of the proposal of Berenstein,Maldacena and Nastase. We also indicate how the contraction can be performed oncorrelation functions.
