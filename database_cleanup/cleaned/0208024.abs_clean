Title: Perturbative Inaccessibility of Conformal Fixed Points in

Nonsupersymmetric Quiver TheoriesAuthors: Paul H. Frampton and Peter Minkowski

Comments: 2 pages LaTeX

The possibility that non-supersymmetric quiver theories may have arenormalization-group fixed point at which there is conformal invariancerequires non-perturbative information.
