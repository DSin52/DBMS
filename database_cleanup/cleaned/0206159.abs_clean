The definition of ``Lie derivative'' of spinors with respect to Killingvectors is extended to all kinds of Lorentz tensors. This Lie-Lorentzderivative appears naturally in the commutator of two supersymmetrytransformations generated by Killing spinors and vanishes for Vielbeins. It canbe identified as the generator of the action of isometries on supergravityfields and its use for the calculation of supersymmetry algebras is revised andextended.
