We extend the Galilei group of space-time transformations by gradation,construct interacting field-theoretic representations of this algebra, and showthat non-relativistic Super-Chern-Simons theory is a special case. We alsostudy the generalization to matrix valued fields, which are relevant to theformulation of superstring theory as a $1/N_c$ expansion of a field theory. Wefind that in the matrix case, the field theory is much more restricted by thesupersymmetry.
