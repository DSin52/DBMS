(figures available viaanonymous ftp to dept.physics.upenn.edu /pub/cvetic/UPR-596-T; severaltypographical errors corrected), UPR-596-TWithin four dimensional (4d) N=1 supergravity theories we present extremedilatonic domain wall solutions with a general overall coupling $\alpha$ in thedilaton K\" ahler potential. We concentrate on extreme Type I walls, which arestatic, planar configurations, interpolating between Minkowski space-time and anew type of space-time with a varying dilaton field. $\alpha=0$ case yieldsextreme ``ordinary'' supergravity walls between Minkowski and anti-de Sitterspace-times. For $\alpha=1$ the walls are extreme ``stringy dilatonic'' wallsof the three level superstring vacua interpolating between the constant andlinear dilaton vacuum. Extreme stringy dilatonic walls ($\alpha =1$) serve as adividing line between the walls ($0<\alpha<1$) with the (planar) singularitycovered by the horizon and those ($\alpha>1$) with the naked singularity.Striking similarities between the global space-time structure of such domainwalls and and the one of the corresponding extreme charged black holes with ageneral dilaton coupling are pointed out.
