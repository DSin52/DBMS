Title: Breaking SUSY on the Horizon

Authors: T. Banks

Comments: JHEP Latex

I present a heuristic calculation of the critical exponent relating thegravitino mass to the cosmological constant in a de Sitter universe. Theingredients for the calculation are the area law for entropy, an R symmetry ofthe low energy effective Lagrangian, and a crude picture of the degeneratelevels of the cosmological horizon.
