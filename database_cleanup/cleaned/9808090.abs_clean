Topological defects can arise in symmetry breaking models where the scalarfield potential $V(\phi)$ has no minima and is a monotonically decreasingfunction of $|\phi|$. The properties of such vacuumless defects are quitedifferent from those of the ``usual'' strings and monopoles. In some modelssuch defects can serve as seeds for structure formation, or produce anappreciable density of mini-black holes.
