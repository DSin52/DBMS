I show that the classical Toda models built on superalgebras, and obtainedfrom a reduction with respect to an $Sl(2)$ algebra, are "linearlysupersymmetrizable" (by adding spin 1/2 fields) if and only if the $Sl(2)$ isthe bosonic part of an $OSp(1|2)$ algebra. In that case, the model isequivalent to the one constructed from a reduction with respect to the$OSp(1|2)$ algebra, up to spin 1/2 fields. The corresponding $W$ algebras arerelated through a factorization of spin 1/2 fields (bosons and fermions). Ion $Sl(n+1|2)$.
