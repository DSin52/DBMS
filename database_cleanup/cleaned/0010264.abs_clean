It is pointed out that the space noncommutativity parameters $theta^{\mu\nu}$ in noncommutative gauge theory can be considered as a set ofsuperselection parameters, in analogy with the theta-angle in ordinary gaugetheories. As such, they do not need to enter explicitly into the action. Asimple generic formula is then suggested to reproduce the Chern-Simons actionin noncommutative gauge theory, which reduces to the standard action in thecommutative limit but in general implies a cascade of lower-dimensionalChern-Simons terms. The presence of these terms in general alters the vacuumstructure of the theory and nonstandard gauge theories can emerge around thenew vacua.
