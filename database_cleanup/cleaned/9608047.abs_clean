We obtain the elliptic curve corresponding to an $N=2$ superconformal fieldtheory which has an $E_6$ global symmetry at the strong coupling point$\tau=e^{\pi i/3}$. We also find the Seiberg-Witten differential $\lambda_{SW}$for this theory. This differential has 27 poles corresponding to thefundamental representation of $E_6$. The complex conjugate representation hasits poles on the other sheet. We also show that the $E_6$ curve reduces to the$D_4$ curve of Seiberg and Witten. Finally, we compute the monodromies and usethese to compute BPS masses in an $F$-Theory compactification.
