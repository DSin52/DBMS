A gauge invariant regularisation for dealing with pure Yang-Mills theorieswithin the exact renormalization group approach is proposed. It is based on theregularisation via covariant higher derivatives and includes auxiliaryPauli-Villars fields which amounts to a spontaneously broken SU(N|N)super-gauge theory. We demonstrate perturbatively that the extended theory isultra-violet finite in four dimensions and argue that it has a sensible limitwhen the regularization cutoff is removed.
