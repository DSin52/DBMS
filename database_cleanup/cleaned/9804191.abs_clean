Using the underlying algebraic structures of Natanzon potentials, we discussconditions that generate shape invariant potentials. In fact, these conditionsgive all the known shape invariant potentials corresponding to a translationalchange of parameters. We also find that while the algebra for the generalNatanzon potential is $SO(2,2)$, a subgroup $SO(2,1)$ suffices for all theshape invariant problems of Natanzon type.
