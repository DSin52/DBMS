We describe in superspace a classical theory of of two dimensional $(1,1)$dilaton supergravity coupled to a super-Liouville field, and find exact superblack hole solutions to the field equations that have non-constant curvature.We consider the possibility that a gravitini condensate forms and look at theimplications for the resultant spacetime structure. We find that all suchcondensate solutions have a condensate and/or naked curvature singularity.
