In recent times quantum corrections for N=2 black holes in 4 dimensions havebeen addressed in the framework of double extreme black hole solutions, whichare characterised by constant scalar fields. In this paper we generalize thesesolutions to non-constant scalar fields. This enables us to discuss quantumcorrections for massless black holes and for configurations that areclassically singular. We also discuss the relation to the 5-dimensionalmagnetic string solution.
