We examine the intersections, fluctuations and deformations of codimensiontwo solitons in field theory on noncommutative $R^4$, in the limit of largenoncommutativity. We find that holomorphic deformations are zero modes of flatbranes, and we show that there is a zero mode localized at the intersection oftwo solitons.
