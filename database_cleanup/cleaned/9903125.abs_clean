We present the evidence that $(-1)^{F_L}$ is a nonperturbative symmetry ofType II string theory. We argue that $(-1)^{F_L}$ is a symmetry of stringtheory as much as the $SL(2, Z)$ of the Type II string is and how the branesare mapped under the $(-1)^{F_L}$ modding. NS branes are mapped into the NSbranes with the same world volume dimensions but with the different chiralstructure. Supersymmetric Dp-branes (bound with anti-Dp branes) are mapped tounstable nonsupersymmetric Dp-branes, which has D(p-1)-branes as kink solutionsaccording to Horava.
