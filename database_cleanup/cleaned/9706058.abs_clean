The complete structure of curvature squared terms is analyzed in the contextof chirally extended supergravity, with special emphasis on the gravitationallyinduced Fayet-Iliopoulos D--term. Coupling of (chiral) matter is discussed inrelation with a possible extension to U(1) supergravity of the equivalencemechanism between $\cR+\al\cR^2$ and General Relativity coupled to a scalar.
