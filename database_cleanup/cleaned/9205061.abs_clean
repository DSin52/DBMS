We describe the quantum mechanical scattering of slowly moving maximallycharged black holes. Our technique is to develop a canonical quantizationprocedure on the parameter space of possible static classical solutions. Withthis, we compute the capture cross sections for the scattering of two blackholes. Finally, we discuss how quantization on this parameter space relates toquantization of the degrees of freedom of the gravitational field.
