We discuss several aspects of superconformal field theories in fourdimensions (CFT_4), in the context of electric-magnetic duality. We analyse thebehaviour of anomalous currents under RG flow to a conformal fixed point inN=1, D=4 supersymmetric gauge theories. We prove that the anomalous dimensionof the Konishi current is related to the slope of the beta function at thecritical point. We extend the duality map to the (nonchiral) Konishi current.As a byproduct we compute the slope of the beta function in the strong couplingregime. We note that the OPE of $T_{\mu\nu}$ with itself does not close, butmixes with a special additional operator $\Sigma$ which in general is theKonishi current. We discuss the implications of this fact in genericinteracting conformal theories. In particular, a SCFT_4 seems to be naturallyequipped with a privileged off-critical deformation $\Sigma$ and this allows usto argue that electric-magnetic duality can be extended to a neighborhood ofthe critical point. We also stress that in SCFT_4 there are two centralcharges, c and c', associated with the stress tensor and $\Sigma$,respectively; c and c' allow us to count both the vector multiplet and thematter multiplet effective degrees of freedom of the theory.
