A Wilson loop is defined, in 4-D pure Einstein gravity, as the trace of theholonomy of the Christoffel connection or of the spin connection, and itsinvariance under the symmetry transformations of the action is showed(diffeomorphisms and local Lorentz transformations). We then compute the loopperturbatively, both on a flat background and in the presence of an externalsource; we also allow some modifications in the form of the action, and testthe action of ``stabilized'' gravity. A geometrical analysis of the results interms of the gauge group of the euclidean theory, $SO(4)$, leads us to theconclusion that the correspondent statistical system does not develope anyconfiguration with localized curvature at low temperature. This ``non-local''behavior of the quantized gravitational field strongly contrasts with that ofusual gauge fields. Our results also provide an explanation for the absence ofany invariant correlation of the curvature in the same approximation.
