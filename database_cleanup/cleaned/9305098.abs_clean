The quantization of a free boson whose momentum satisfies a cubic constraintleads to a $c=\ha$ conformal field theory with a BRST symmetry. The theory alsohas a $W_\infty $ symmetry in which all the generators except the stress-tensorare BRST-exact and so topological. The BRST cohomology includes states ofconformal dimensions $0,\si,\ha$, together with \lq copies' of these statesobtained by acting with picture-changing and screening operators. The 3-pointand 4-point correlation functions agree with those of the Ising model,suggesting that the theory is equivalent to the critical Ising model. At treelevel, the $W_3$ string can be viewed as an ordinary $c=26$ string whoseconformal matter sector includes this realisation of the Ising model. Thetwo-boson $W_3$ string is equivalent to the Ising model coupled totwo-dimensional quantum gravity. Similar results apply for other W-strings andminimal models.
