We study logarithmic operators in Coulomb gas models, and show that theyoccur when the ``puncture'' operator of the Liouville theory is included in themodel. We also consider WZNW models for $SL(2,R)$, and for SU(2) at level 0, inwhich we find logarithmic operators which form Jordan blocks for the current aswell as the Virasoro algebra.
