We discuss the canonical quantization of Chern-Simons theory in $2+1$dimensions, minimally coupled to a Dirac spinor field, first in the temporalgauge and then in the Coulomb gauge. In our temporal gauge formulation, Gauss'slaw and the gauge condition, $A_0 = 0$, are implemented by embedding theformulation in an appropriate physical subspace. We construct a Fock space ofcharged particle states that satisfy Gauss's law, and show that they obeyfermion, not fractional statistics. The gauge-invariant spinor field thatcreates these charged states from the vacuum obeys the anticommutation rulesthat generally apply to spinor fields. The Hamiltonian, when described in therepresentation in which the charged fermions are the propagating particleexcitations that obey Gauss's law, contains an interaction between charge andtransverse current densities. We observe that the implementation of Gauss's lawand the gauge condition does not require us to use fields with gradedcommutator algebras or particle excitations with fractional statistics. In ourCoulomb gauge formulation, we implement Gauss's law and the gauge condition,$\partial_lA_l=0$, by the Dirac-Bergmann procedure. In this formulation, theconstrained gauge fields become functionals of the spinor fields, and are notindependent degrees of freedom. The formulation in the Coulomb gauge confirmsanticommutation rule for the charged spinor fields $\psi$ and $\psi^\dagger$that have both been constrained to obey Gauss's law, is precisely identical tothe canonical spinor anticommutation rule that generates standard fermionstatistics. And we also show that the Hamiltonians for charged particle statesin our temporal and Coulomb gauge formulations are identical, once Gauss's law
