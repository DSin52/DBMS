It is shown that the local quantum field theory of the chiral energy-momentum tensor with central charge $c=1$ coincides with the gauge invariantsubtheory of the chiral $SU(2)$ current algebra at level 1, where the gaugegroup is the global $SU(2)$ symmetry. At higher level, the same scheme givesrise to $W$-algebra extensions of the Virasoro algebra.
