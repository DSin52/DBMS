We present new exact solutions (in 3+1 and 2+1 dimensions) of relativisticwave equations (Klein-Gordon and Dirac) in external electromagnetic fields ofspecial form. These fields are combinations of Aharonov-Bohm solenoid field andsome additional electric and magnetic fields. In particular, as such additionalfields, we consider longitudinal electric and magnetic fields, some crossedfields, and some special non-uniform fields. The solutions obtained can beuseful to study Aharonov-Bohm effect in the corresponding electromagneticfields.
