It was argued that there are two different descriptions of the effectiveLagrangian of gauge fields on D-branes by non-commutative gauge theory and byordinary gauge theory in the presence of a constant B field background. In thecase of bosonic string theory, however, it was found in the previous works thatthe two descriptions are incompatible under the field redefinition whichrelates the non-commutative gauge field to the ordinary one found by Seibergand Witten. In this paper we resolve this puzzle to observe the necessity ofgauge-invariant but B-dependent correction terms involving metric in the fieldredefinition which have not been considered before. With the problem resolved,we establish a systematic method under the alpha' expansion to derive theconstraints on the effective Lagrangian imposed by the compatibility of the twodescriptions where the form of the field redefinition is not assumed.
