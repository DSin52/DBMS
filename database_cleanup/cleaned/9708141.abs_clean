We introduce a finite-dimensional algebra that controls the possible boundaryconditions of a conformal field theory. For theories that are obtained bymodding out a Z_2 symmetry (corresponding to a so-called D_odd-type, orhalf-integer spin simple current, modular invariant), this classifying algebracontains the fusion algebra of the untwisted sector as a subalgebra. Propertreatment of fields in the twisted sector, so-called fixed points, leads tostructures that are intriguingly close to the ones implied by modularinvariance for conformal field theories on closed orientable surfaces.
