figuresSymplectic geometry of the vortex filament in a curved three-manifold isinvestigated. There appears an infinite sequence of constants of motion ininvolution in the case of constant curvature. The Duistermaat-Heckman formulais examined perturbatively for the classical partition function in our modeland verified up to the 3-loop order.
