Beginning with the work of Dirac and Arnowitt, Deser, Misner in the latefifties and early sixties, and then after subsequent development by Kucha\v r,the canonical dynamical structure of general relativity has often been viewedas that of a parametrized field theory in which the many-fingered spacetimevariables are hidden amongst the geometrodynamical field variables. Thisparadigm of general relativity as an ``already parametrized theory'' forms thebasis for one of the most satisfactory resolutions of the problems of time andobservables in classical and quantum gravity. However, despite decades ofeffort, no identification of many-fingered spacetime variables has ever beensatisfactorily obtained for vacuum general relativity. We point out that thereis an obstruction to identifying the constraint surface of general relativity(for the case of a closed universe) with that of any parametrized theory.Therefore, strictly speaking, general relativity cannot be viewed as aparametrized field theory. We discuss implications for the canonicalquantization program.
