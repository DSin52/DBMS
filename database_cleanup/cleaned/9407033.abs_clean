We construct the action-angle variables of a classical integrable modeldefined on complex projective phase space and calculate the quantum mechanicalpropagator in the coherent state path integral representation using thestationary phase approximation. We show that the resulting expression for thepropagator coincides with the exact propagator which was obtained by solvingthe time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation.
