Title: Dirac Operators and Clifford Geometry - New Unifying Principles in

Particle Physics ?Comments: 8 pages, plain tex, Lecture at the IV th Conference on Clifford

Algebras and their Applications in Mathematical Physics, Aachen, Germany, May28 - 31, 1996, some misprints in corollary 4 and (16) correctedIn this lecture I will report on some recent progress in understanding therelation of Dirac operators on Clifford modules over an even-dimensional closedRiemannian manifold $M$\ and (euclidean) Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs models.
