proceedings of the Cargese '99 ASI "Progress in string theory and M-theory"The Chern-Simons formulation of $AdS_3$ supergravity is considered.Asymptotic conditions on the Rarita-Schwinger fields are given. Together withthe known boundary conditions on the bosonic fields, these ensure that theasymptotic algebra is the superconformal algebra, with the same central chargeas the one of pure gravity. It is also indicated that the asymptotic dynamicsis described by super-Liouville.
