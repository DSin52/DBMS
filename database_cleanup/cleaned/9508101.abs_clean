We rederive non-perturbatively the Coleman-Weinberg expression for theeffective potential for massless scalar QED. Our result is not restricted tosmall values of the coupling constants. This shows that the Coleman- Weinbergresult can be established beyond the range of validity of perturbation theory.Also, we derive it in a manifestly renormalization group invariant way. It isshown that with the derivation given no Landau ghost singularity arises. Thefinite temperature case is discussed.
