The large N limit of a one-dimensional infinite chain of random matrices isinvestigated. It is found that in addition to the expected Kosterlitz--Thoulessphase transition this model exhibits an infinite series of phase transitions atspecial values of the lattice spacing \epsilon_{pq}=\sin(\pi p/2q). An unusualproperty of these transitions is that they are totally invisible in the doublescaling limit. A method which allows us to explore the transition regionsanalytically and to determine certain critical exponents is developed. It isargued that phase transitions of this kind can be induced by the interaction oftwo-dimensional vortices with curvature defects of a fluctuating randomlattice.
