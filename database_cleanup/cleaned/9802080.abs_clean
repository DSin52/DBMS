It is well-known that the low energy string theory admits a non-singularsolitonic super five-brane solution which is the magnetic dual to thefundamental string solution. By using the symmetry of the type IIB stringtheory, we construct an SL(2, Z) multiplet of magnetically charged superfive-branes starting from this solitonic solution. These solutions arecharacterized by two integral three-form charges $(q_1, q_2)$ and are stablewhen the integers are coprime. We obtain an expression for the tension of these$(q_1, q_2)$ five-branes as envisaged by Witten. The SL(2, Z) multiplets ofblack strings and black fivebranes and the existence of similar magnetic dualsolutions of strings in type II string theory in $D < 10$ have also beendiscussed.
