The conformal-gauge two-dimensional quantum gravity is formulated in theframework of the BRS quantization and solved completely in the Heisenbergfield-equation anomaly is shown to exist as in other gauges, but there is noother subtlety. At the critical dimension D=26 of the bosonic string, thefield-equation anomaly is shown to be absent. However, this result is notequivalent to the statement that the conformal anomaly is proportional to D-26.The existence of the FP-ghost number current anomaly is seen to be an illusion.
