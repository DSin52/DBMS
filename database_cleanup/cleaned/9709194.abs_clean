Self-consistent Ansaetze are presented for the left- and right-handedisodoublet fermion zero-modes of the constrained instanton Istar in the vacuumsector of euclidean SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. These left- and right-handedfermion wave functions do not coincide and, most likely, have maxima atdifferent positions. This may be important for the fermion zero-modecontribution to the euclidean 4-point Green's function in chiralYang-Mills-Higgs theory and the high-energy behaviour of fermion-fermionscattering processes.
