We probe the AdS/CFT correspondence by comparing the thermodynamics of arotating black hole in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space with that of aconformal field theory on $S^3$, whose parameters come from the boundary ofspacetime. In the high temperature limit, we find agreement between gaugetheory and gravity in all thermodynamic quantities upto the same factor of 4/3that appears for nonrotating holes.
