We study, for the first time, the phase structure of the Gross--Neveu modelwith a combination of a (constant) gravitational and a magnetic field. This hasbeen made possible by our finding of an exact solution to the problem, namelythe effective potential for the composite fermions. Then, from thecorresponding implicit equation the phase diagram for the dynamical fermionmass is calculated numerically for some values of the magnetic field. %(whatcan be done with arbitrary precision). For a small magnetic field the phasediagram hints to the possibility of a second order phase transition at somecritical curvature. With growing magnetic field only the phase with brokenchiral symmetry survives, because the magnetic field prevents the decay of thechiral condensate. This result is bound to have important consequences in earlyuniverse cosmology.
