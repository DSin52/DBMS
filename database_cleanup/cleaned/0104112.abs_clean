We study the discrete light-cone quantization (DLCQ) of closed strings in thebackground of Minkowski space-time and a constant Neveu-Schwarz $B$-field. Forthe Bosonic string, we identify the $B$-dependent part of the thermodynamicfree energy to all orders in string perturbation theory. For every genus, $B$appears in a constraint in the path integral which restricts the world-sheetgeometries to those which are branched covers of a certain torus. This is theextension of a previous result where the $B$-field was absentMatrix model of M-theory. We show that, when we consider this theory at finitetemperature and in a finite $B$-field, the Matrix variables are functions whichlive on a torus with the same Teichm\"uller parameter as the one that weidentified in string theory. We show explicitly that the thermodynamicpartition function of the Matrix string model in the limit of free stringsreproduces the genus 1 thermodynamic partition function of type IIA string.This is strong evidence that the Matrix model can reproduce perturbative stringtheory. We also find an interesting behavior of the Hagedorn temperature.
