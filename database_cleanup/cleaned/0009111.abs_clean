conference ``Non-perturbative quantum effects 2000'', Paris, September 2000The correlation functions of a two-dimensional rational conformal fieldtheory, for an arbitrary number of bulk and boundary fields and arbitrary worldsheets can be expressed in terms of Wilson graphs in appropriatethree-manifolds. We present a systematic approach to boundary conditions thatbreak bulk symmetries. It is based on the construction, by `alpha-induction',of a fusion ring for the boundary fields. Its structure constants are theannulus coefficients and its 6j-symbols give the OPE of boundary fields.Symmetry breaking boundary conditions correspond to solitonic sectors.
