Recently, gauged supergravities in three dimensions with Yang-Mills andChern-Simons type interactions have been constructed. In this article, wedemonstrate that any gauging of Yang-Mills type with semisimple gauge groupG_0, possibly including extra couplings to massive Chern-Simons vectors, isequivalent on-shell to a pure Chern-Simons type gauging with non-semisimplegauge group $G_0 \ltimes T \subset G$, where T is a certain translation group,and where G is the maximal global symmetry group of the ungauged theory. Wediscuss several examples.
