A thorough analysis of stochastically stabilised hermitian one matrix modelsfor two dimensional quantum gravity at all its $(2,2k-1)$ multicritical pointsis made. It is stressed that only the zero fermion sector of the supersymmetrichamiltonian, i.e., the forward Fokker-Planck hamiltonian, is relevant for theanalysis of bosonic matter coupled to two dimensional gravity. Therefore,supersymmetry breaking is not the physical mechanism that creates nonperturbative effects in the case of points of even multicriticality $k$. Nonperturbative effects in the string coupling constant $g_{str}$ result in a lossof any explicit relation to the KdV hierarchy equations in the latter case,while maintaining the perturbative genus expansion. As a by-product of ouranalysis it is explicitly proved that polynomials orthogonal relative to anarbitrary weight $\exp (-\beta V(x))$ along the whole real line obey anHartree-Fock equation.
