We propose a general mechanism for stabilizing the dilaton against runaway toweak coupling. The method is based on features of the effective superpotentialwhich arise for supersymmetric gauge theories which are not asymptoticallyfree. Consideration of the 2PI effective action for bilinear operators ofmatter and gauge superfields allows one to overcome the obstacles toconstructing a nonvanishing superpotential.
