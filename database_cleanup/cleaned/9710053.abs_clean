We study the two-point correlators of the currents of the $E_8$ globalsymmetry in the $N=(1,0)$ superconformal six-dimensional theory as well as inthe 4D superconformal theories upon toroidal compactification. From thehigh-energy behavior of the correlator we deduce that in 4D 10 copies of thesuperconformal theory with $E_8$ global symmetry can be coupled to an N=2 $E_8$gauge theory. We present three alternative derivations for the expression forthe correlators. One from field-theory, one from M-theory and one fromF-theory.
