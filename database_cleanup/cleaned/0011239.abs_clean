In this review we discuss hidden symmetries of toroidal compactifications ofeleven-dimensional supergravity. We recall alternative versions of this theorywhich exhibit traces of the hidden symmetries when still retaining the massiveKaluza-Klein states. We reconsider them in the broader perspective of M-theorywhich incorporates a more extended variety of BPS states. We also argue for anew geometry that may underly these theories. All our arguments point towardsan extension of the number of space-time coordinates beyond eleven.
