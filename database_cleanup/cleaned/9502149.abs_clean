The topological $\sigma$ model with the black hole metric of the target spaceis considered. It has been shown before that this model is in the phase withBRST-symmetry broken. In particular, vacuum energy is non-\-zero andcorrelation functions of observables show the coordinate dependence. Howeverthese quantities turned out to be infrared (IR) divergent. It is shown herethat IR divergences disappear after the sum over an arbitrary number ofadditional instanton-\-anti-\-instanton pairs is performed. The model appearsto be equivalent to Coulomb gas/Sine Gordon system.
