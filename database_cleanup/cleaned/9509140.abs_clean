The multiplets that occur in four dimensional rigidly supersymmetric theoriescan be described either by chiral superfields in Minkowski superspace oranalytic superfields in harmonic superspace. The superconformal Ward identitiesfor Green's functions of gauge invariant operators of these types are derived.It is shown that there are no chiral superconformal invariants. It is furthershown that the Green's functions of analytic operators are severely restrictedby the superconformal Ward when analyticity is taken into account.
