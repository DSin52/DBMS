We investigate the exact results of the Navier-Stokes equations using themethods developed by Polyakov. It is shown that when the velocity field and thedensity are not independent, the Burgers equation is obtained leading to exactN-point generating functions of velocity field. Our results show that, theoperator product expansion has to be generalized both in the absence and thepresence of pressure. We find a method to determine the extra terms in theoperator product expansion and derive its coefficients and find the firstcorrection to probablity distribuation function. In the general case and forsmall pressure, we solve the problem perturbatively and find the probablitydistribuation function for the Navier-Stokes equation in the mean fieldapproximation.
