We study the configuration of a typical highly excited string as one slowlyincreases the string coupling. The dominant interactions are the long rangedilaton and gravitational attraction. In four spacetime dimensions, the stringslowly contracts from its initial (large) size until it approaches the stringscale where it forms a black hole. In higher dimensions, the string stays largeuntil the coupling reaches a critical value, and then it rapidly collapses to ablack hole. The implications for the recently proposed correspondence principleare discussed.
