Exact instanton solutions to $D=11$ spherical supermembranes moving in flattarget spacetime backgrounds are construted. Our starting point is SuperYang-Mills theories, based on the infinite dimensional $SU(\infty)$ group,dimensionally reduced to one time dimension. In this fashion the super-Todamolecule equation is recovered preserving only one supersymmetry out of the$N=16$ that one would have obtained otherwise. It is conjectured that theexpected critical target spacetime dimensions for the (super) membrane,($D=11$) $D=27$ is closely related to that of the $noncritical$ (super)$W_{\infty}$ strings. A BRST analysis of these symmetries should yieldinformation about the quantum consistency of the ($D=11$) $D=27$ dimensional(super) membrane. Comments on the role that Skyrmions might play in the twotypes of Spinning- Membrane actions construted so far is presented at theconclusion. Finally, the importance that integrability on light-lines incomplex superspaces has in other types of solutions is emphasized.
