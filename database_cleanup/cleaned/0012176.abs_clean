We consider a (3+1)-dimensional local field theory defined on the sphere. Themodel possesses exact soliton solutions with non trivial Hopf topologicalcharges, and infinite number of local conserved currents. We show that thePoisson bracket algebra of the corresponding charges is isomorphic to that ofthe area preserving diffeomorphisms of the sphere. We also show that theconserved currents under consideration are the Noether currents associated tothe invariance of the Lagrangian under that infinite group of diffeomorphisms.We indicate possible generalizations of the model.
