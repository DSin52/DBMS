In this note we provide an explicit example of type IIB supersymmetricD3-branes solution on a pp-wave like background, consisting in the product ofan eight-dimensional pp-wave times a two-dimensional flat space. An interestingproperty of our solution is the fully localization of the D3-branes (i.e. thesolution depends on all the transverse coordinates). Then we show thegeneralization to other Dp-branes and to the D1/D5 system.
