I explore the possibility of finding an equivalent string representation oftwo dimensional QCD. I develop the large N expansion of the ${\rm QCD_2}$partition function on an arbitrary two dimensional Euclidean manifold. If thisis related to a two-dimensional string theory then many of the coefficients ofthe ${1\over N}$ expansion must vanish. This is shown to be true to all orders,giving strong evidence for the existence of a string representation.
