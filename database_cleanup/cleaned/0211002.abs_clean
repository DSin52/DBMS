We give a geometrical derivation of the Dirac equation by considering aspin-1/2 particle travelling with the speed of light in a cubic spacetimelattice. The mass of the particle acts to flip the multi-component wavefunctionat the lattice sites. Starting with a difference equation for the case of onespatial and one time dimensions, we generalize the approach to higherdimensions. Interactions with external electromagnetic and gravitational fieldsare also considered. One logical interpretation is that only at the latticesites is the spin-1/2 particle aware of its mass and the presence of externalfields.
