We show how topological open string theory amplitudes can be computed byusing relative stable morphisms in the algebraic category. We achieve our goalby explicitly working through an example which has been previously consideredby Ooguri and Vafa from the point of view of physics. By using the method ofvirtual localization, we successfully reproduce their results for multiplecovers of a holomorphic disc, whose boundary lies in a Lagrangian submanifoldof a Calabi-Yau 3-fold, by Riemann surfaces with arbitrary genera and number ofboundary components. In particular we show that in the case we consider thereare no open string instantons with more than one boundary component ending onthe Lagrangian submanifold.
