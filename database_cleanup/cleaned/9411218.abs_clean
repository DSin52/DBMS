Report)The symmetry algebra of the N-dimensional anisotropic quantum harmonicoscillator with rational ratios of frequencies is constructed by a method ofgeneral applicability to quantum superintegrable systems. The special case ofthe 3-dim oscillator is studied in more detail, because of its relevance in thedescription of superdeformed nuclei and nuclear and atomic clusters. In thiscase the symmetry algebra turns out to be a nonlinear extension of the u(3)algebra. A generalized angular momentum operator useful for labeling thedegenerate states is constructed, clarifying the connection of the presentformalism to the Nilsson model in nuclear physics.
