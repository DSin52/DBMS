The massless degrees of freedom of type 0 NS5-branes are derived. Anon-chiral, purely bosonic spectrum is found in both type 0A and 0B. Thisnon-chirality is confirmed by a one-loop computation in the bulk. Some puzzlesconcerning type 0B S-duality are pointed out in this context. An interpretationof the spectra in terms of ``type 0 little strings'' is proposed.
