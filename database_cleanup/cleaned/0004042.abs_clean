We discuss the mapping of the conservative part of two-body electrodynamicsonto that of a test charged particle moving in some external electromagneticfield, taking into account recoil effects and relativistic corrections up tosecond post-Coulombian order. Unlike the results recently obtained in generalrelativity, we find that in classical electrodynamics it is not possible toimplement the matching without introducing external parameters in the effectiveelectromagnetic field. Relaxing the assumption that the effective test particlemoves in a flat spacetime provides a feasible way out.
