A general form of multi-channel Bethe-Salpeter equation is considered. Incontradistinction to the hitherto applied approaches, our coupled system ofequations leads to the simultaneous solutions for all relativistic four-pointGreen functions (elastic and inelastic) appearing in a given theory. A set ofrelations which may be helpful in approximate treatments is given. An examplethe most general trilinear coupling of N different scalar fields and obtain -in the ladder approximation - closed expressions for the Regge trajectories andtheir couplings to different channels in the vicinity of l = -1. Sum rules andan example containing non-obvious symmetry are discussed.
