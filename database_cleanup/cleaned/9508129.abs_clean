Using the symmetry reductions of the self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) equations in(2+2) dimensions, we introduce new integrable equations which are nonautonomousversions of the chiral model in (2+1) dimensions, generalized nonlinearSchrodinger, Korteweg-de Vries, Toda lattice, Garnier and Euler-Arnoldequations. The Lax pairs for all of these equations are derived by the symmetryreductions of the Lax pair for the SDYM equations.
