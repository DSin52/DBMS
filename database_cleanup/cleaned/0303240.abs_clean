Title: Unitary-Matrix Integration on 2D Yang-Mills Action

Authors: Yoshinobu Habara

Comments: 8 pages

Using the idea of Itzykson-Zuber integral, unitary-matrix integration of 2DYang-Mills action is presented. The uniqueness of the solution of heat equationenables us to integrate out the unitary-matrix parts of hermite matrices and toobtain the expression of integration over vectors, also in this case.
