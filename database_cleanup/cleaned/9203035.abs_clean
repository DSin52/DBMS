We show that the anisotropic Heisenberg-Ising chains with higher spin allow,for special values of the anisotropy, integrable deformations intimatelyrelated to the theory of quantum groups at roots of unity. For the spin onecase we construct and study the symmetries of the hamiltonian which depends ona spectral variable belonging to an elliptic curve. One of the points of thiscurve yields the Fateev-Zamolodchikov hamiltonian of spin one and anisotropy$\Delta = \frac{ q^2 + q^{-2}}{2} $ with $q$ a cubic root of unity. In someother special points the spin degrees of freedom as well as the hamiltoniansplits into pieces governed by a larger symmetry.
