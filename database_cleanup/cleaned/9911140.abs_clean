We perform canonical quantization of open strings in the $D$-brane backgroundwith a $B$-field. Treating the mixed boundary condition as a primaryconstraint, we get a set of secondary constraints. Then these constraints areshown to be equivalent to orbifold conditions to be imposed on normal stringmodes. These orbifold conditions are a generalization of the familiar orbifoldconditions which arise when we describe open strings in terms of closedstrings. Solving the constraints explicitly, we obtain a simple Hamiltonian forthe open string, which reveals the nature of noncommutativity transparently.
