Title: Quantum (2,2) supergravity

Authors: M.T. Grisaru and M.E. Wehlau

Comments: Talk presented at the July 1995 Leuven (Belgium) meeting on Gauge

Theories, Appplied supersymmetry, and Quantum Gravity. 11 pages, LatexWe describe various aspects of two-dimensional $N=2$ supergravity insuperspace. We present the solution to the constraints in terms ofunconstrained prepotentials, and the different superspace measures (full andchiral) used in the construction of invariant actions. We discuss aspects ofthe theory in light-cone gauge, including the Ward identities for correlationfunctions defined with respect to the induced supergravity action.
