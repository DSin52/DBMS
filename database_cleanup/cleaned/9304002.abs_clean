The string propagation in the two-dimensional stringy black-hole isinvestigated from a new approach. We completely solve the classical and quantumstring dynamics in the lorentzian and euclidean regimes. In the lorentzian caseall the physics reduces to a massless scalar particle described by aKlein-Gordon type equation with a singular effective potential. The scatteringmatrix is found and it reproduces the results obtained by coset CFT techniques.absorption part. In both parts, an infinite sequence of imaginary poles in theenergy appear. The generic features of string propagation in curvedD-dimensional backgrounds (string stretching, fall into spacetimesingularities) are analyzed in the present case. A new physical phenomenonthe speed of light. We find $c_{quantum} = \sqrt{{k\o{k-2}}}~c_{classical}$,where $k$ is the integer in front of the WZW action. This feature is, however,a pathology. Only for $ k \to \infty$ the pathology disappears (although theconformal anomaly is present). We analyze all the classical euclidean stringsolutions and exactly compute the quantum partition function. No criticalHagedorn temperature appears here.
