Proceedings of the YITP workshop YITP-W-01-15 ``Braneworld - Dynamics ofspacetime with boundary", brief comments on brane inflation and referencesaddedRecently, we proposed a new braneworld model [GIT] in which the collision ofa brane universe and a vacuum bubble coming from the extra-dimension isutilized as a trigger of brane big-bang. In this article, mainly reviewing thismodel, we briefly summarize cosmological braneworld scenarios in whichcollision of branes plays an important role.
