The quantum Hamiltonian reduction on the OSp(1,2) super Kac-Moody algebra isdescribed in the BRST formalism. Using a free field representation of the KMcurrents, the super Kac-Moody algebra is shown to be reduced to asuperconformal one via the Hamiltonian reduction. This reduction is manifestlysupersymmetric because of supersymmetric constraints imposed on the algebra.
