Title: Quantum and Braided Lie Algebras

Comments: 56 pages

We introduce the notion of a braided Lie algebra consisting of afinite-dimensional vector space $\CL$ equipped with a bracket $[\ ,\\CL\tens\CL$ obeying some axioms. We show that such an object has an envelopingbraided-bialgebra $U(\CL)$. We show that every generic $R$-matrix leads to sucha braided Lie algebra with $[\ ,\ ]$ given by structure constants $c^{IJ}{}_K$determined from $R$. In this case $U(\CL)=B(R)$ the braided matrices introducedpreviously. We also introduce the basic theory of these braided Lie algebras,including the natural right-regular action of a braided-Lie algebra $\CL$ bybraided vector fields, the braided-Killing form and the quadratic Casimirassociated to $\CL$. These constructions recover the relevant notions forusual, colour and super-Lie algebras as special cases. In addition, thestandard quantum deformations $U_q(g)$ are understood as the envelopingalgebras of such underlying braided Lie algebras with $[\ ,\ ]$ on $\CL\subsetU_q(g)$ given by the quantum adjoint action.
