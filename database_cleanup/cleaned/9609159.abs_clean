We interpret certain strong coupling singularities of the $E_8\times E_8$heterotic string on K3 in terms of exotic six-dimensional theories in which$E_8$ is a gauge symmetry. These theories are closely related to theoriesobtained at small instanton singularities, which have $E_8$ as a globalsymmetry.
