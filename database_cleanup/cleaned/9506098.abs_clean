We give a simple description of the classical moduli space of vacua forsupersymmetric gauge theories with or without a superpotential. The keyingredient in our analysis is the observation that the lagrangian is invariantunder the action of the complexified gauge group $\Gc$. From this point of viewthe usual $D$-flatness conditions are an artifact of Wess--Zumino gauge. Byusing a gauge that preserves $\Gc$ invariance we show that every constantmatter field configuration that extremizes the superpotential is $\Gc$gauge-equivalent (in a sense that we make precise) to a unique classicalvacuum. This result is used to prove that in the absence of a superpotentialthe classical moduli space is the algebraic variety described by the set of allholomorphic gauge-invariant polynomials. When a superpotential is present, weshow that the classical moduli space is a variety defined by imposingadditional relations on the holomorphic polynomials. Many of these points arealready contained in the existing literature. The main contribution of thepresent work is that we give a careful and self-contained treatment of limitpoints and singularities.
