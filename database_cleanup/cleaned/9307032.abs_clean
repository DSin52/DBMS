Title: Is it possible to extend the deformed Weyl algebra $W_q(n)$ to a Hopf

algebra?Comments: 6 pages

We argue that the algebra $W_q(n)$, generated by $n$ pairs of deformed$q$-bosons, does not allow a Hopfalgebra structure. To this end we show that itis impossible to define a comultiplication even for the usual, nondeformedcase. We indicate how the comultiplication on $U_q[osp(1/2n)]$ can be used inorder to construct representations of deformed (not necessarily Hopf) algebrasin tensor products of Fock spaces.
