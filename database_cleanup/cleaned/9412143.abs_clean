A comparative dynamical study of axial gauge QED and QCD is presented.Elementary excitations associated with particular field configurations areinvestigated. Gluonic excitations analogous to linearly polarized photons areshown to acquire infinite energy. Suppression of this class of excitations inQCD results from quantization of the chromelectric flux and is interpreted as adual Meissner effect, i.e. as expulsion from the QCD vacuum of chromo-electricfields which are constant over significant distances. This interpretation issupported by a comparative evaluation of the interaction energy of staticcharges in the axial gauge representation of QED and QCD.
