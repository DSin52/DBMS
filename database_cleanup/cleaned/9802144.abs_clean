Title: The Superworld

Authors: Nathan Seiberg

Comments: Based on talks given at various conferences and will appear in

various proceedings. 13 pages, 5 figuresAn overview of supersymmetry and its different applications is presented. Wemotivate supersymmetry in particle physics. We then explain how supersymmetryhelps us analyze field theories exactly, and what dynamical lessons thesesolutions teach us. Finally, we describe how supersymmetry is used to deriveexact results in string theory. These results have led to a revolution in ourunderstanding of the theory.
