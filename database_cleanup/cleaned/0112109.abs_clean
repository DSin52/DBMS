We show how the elliptic Calogero-Moser integrable systems arise from asymplectic quotient construction, generalising the construction for A_{N-1} byGorsky and Nekrasov to other algebras. This clarifies the role of (twisted)affine Kac-Moody algebras in elliptic Calogero-Moser systems and allows for anatural geometric construction of Lax operators for these systems. We elaborateon the connection of the associated Hamiltonians to superpotentials for N=1*deformations of N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory, and argue how non-perturbativephysics generates the elliptic superpotentials. We also discuss the relevanceof these systems and the associated quotient construction to open problems instring theory. In an appendix, we use the theory of orbit algebras to show thesystematics behind the folding procedures for these integrable models.
