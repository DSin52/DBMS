We construct a non-perturbative, single-valued solution for the metric andthe motion of two interacting particles in ($2+1$)-Gravity, by using a Coulombgauge of conformal type. The method provides the mapping from multivalued (minkowskian ) coordinates to single-valued ones, which solves the non-abelianmonodromies due to particles's momenta and can be applied also to the generalN-body case.
