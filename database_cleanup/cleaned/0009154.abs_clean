We show that the functional bosonization procedure can be generalized in sucha way that, to any field theory with a conserved Abelian charge in (2+1)dimensions, there corresponds a dual Abelian gauge field theory. The propertiesof this mapping and of the dual theory are discussed in detail, presentingdifferent explicit examples. In particular, the meaning and effect of thecoefficient of the Chern-Simons term in the dual action is interpreted in termsof the spin and statistics connection.
