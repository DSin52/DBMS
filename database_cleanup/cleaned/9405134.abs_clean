The matrix model of random surfaces with c = inf. has recently been solvedand found to be identical to a random surface coupled to a q-states Potts modelwith q = inf. The mean field-like solution exhibits a novel type of treestructure. The natural question is, down to which--if any--finite values of cand q does this behavior persist? In this work we develop, for the Potts model,an expansion in the fluctuations about the q = inf. mean field solution. In thelowest--cubic--non-trivial order in this expansion the corrections to meanfield theory can be given a nice interpretation in terms of structures (treesand ``galaxies'') of spin clusters. When q drops below a finite q_c, thegalaxies overwhelm the trees at all temperatures, thus suppressing mean fieldbehavior. Thereafter the phase diagram resembles that of the Ising model, q=2.
