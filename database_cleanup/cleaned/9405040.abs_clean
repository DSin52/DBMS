The well-known geometric approach to field theory is based on description ofclassical fields as sections of fibred manifolds, e.g. bundles with a structuregroup in gauge theory. In this approach, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalismsincluding the multiomentum Hamiltonian formalism are phrased in terms of jetmanifolds. Then, configuration and phase spaces of fields arefinite-dimensional. Though the jet manifolds have been widely used for theoryof differential operators, the calculus of variations and differentialgeometry, this powerful mathematical methods remains almost unknown forphysicists. This Supplementary to our previous article (hep-th/9403172) aims tosummarize necessary requisites on jet manifolds and general connections.
