We present the formalism of q-stars with local or global U(1) symmetry. Theequations we formulate are solved numerically and provide the main features ofthe soliton star. We study its behavior when the symmetry is local in contrastto the global case. A general result is that the soliton remains stable anddoes not decay into free particles and the electrostatic repulsion preserves itfrom gravitational collapse. We also investigate the case of a q-star withnon-minimal energy-momentum tensor and find that the soliton is stable even insome cases of collapse when the coupling to gravity is absent.
