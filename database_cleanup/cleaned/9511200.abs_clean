Seminar on Quantum Gravity, Moscow, 12-17 June '95 and the Conference onGauge theories, Applied Supersymmetry and Quantum Gravity, Leuven, 10-14 July'95We investigate the gauging of conformal algebras with relations between thegenerators. We treat the $W_{5/2}$--algebra as a specific example. We show thatthe gauge-algebra is in general reducible with an infinite number of stages. Weshow how to construct the BV-extended action, and hence the classical BRSTcharge. An important conclusion is that this can always be done in terms of thegenerators of the $W$--algebra only, that is, independent of the realisation.The present treatment is still purely classical, but already enables us tolearn more about reducible gauge algebras and the BV-formalism.
