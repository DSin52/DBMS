We construct the SO(32) spinor state in weakly coupled type I string theoryas a kink solution of the tachyon field on the D-string - anti-D-string pairand calculate its mass. We also give a description of this system in terms ofan exact boundary conformal field theory and show that in this description thisstate can be regarded as a non-supersymmetric D0-brane in type I string theory.This construction can be generalised to represent the D0-brane in type IIAstring theory as a vortex solution of the tachyon field on the membraneanti-membrane pair, and the D-string of type I string theory as a topologicalsoliton of the tachyon field on the D5-brane anti- D5-brane pair.
