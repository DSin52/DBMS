An extension of dimensional regularization to the case of compact dimensionsis presented. The procedure preserves the Kaluza-Klein tower structure, but hasa regulator specific to the compact dimension. Possible 5 and 4 dimensionaldivergent as well as manifest finite contributions of (one-loop) Feynman graphscan easily be identified in this scheme.
