We consider a class of multi-matrix models with an action which is O(D)invariant, where D is the number of NxN Hermitian matrices X_\mu, \mu=1,...,D.The action is a function of all the elementary symmetric functions of thematrix $T_{\mu\nu}=Tr(X_\mu X_\nu)/N$. We address the issue whether the O(D)symmetry is spontaneously broken when the size N of the matrices goes toinfinity. The phase diagram in the space of the parameters of the model revealsthe existence of a critical boundary where the O(D) symmetry is maximallybroken.
