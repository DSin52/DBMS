Photon splitting in a very strong magnetic field is analyzed for energy$\omega < 2m$. The amplitude obtained on the base of operator-diagram techniqueis used. It is shown that in a magnetic field much higher than critical one thesplitting amplitude is independent on the field. Our calculation is in a goodagreement with previous results of Adler and in a strong contradiction withrecent paper of Mentzel et al.
