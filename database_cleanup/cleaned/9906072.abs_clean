We reconsider the problem of finding all local symmetries of a Lagrangian.Our approach is completely Hamiltonian without any reference to the associatedaction. We present a simple algorithm for obtaining the restrictions on thegauge parameters entering in the definition of the generator of gaugetransformations.
