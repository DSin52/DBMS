Title: Cosmological Particle Creation and Dynamical Casimir Effect

Authors: M.R. Setare

Comments: 6, no figures

In this paper we have considered the particle creation in the spatiallyclosed Robertson-Walker space-time. We considered a real massive scalar fieldwhich conformally coupled to the Robertson-Walker background. With thedependence of the scale factor on time, the case under consideration is adynamical Casimir effect with moving boundaries.
