We construct massive open string states around a classical solution in theoscillator formulation of Vacuum String Field Theory. In order for the correctmass spectrum to be reproduced, the projection operators onto the modes of theleft- and right-half of the string must have an anomalous eigenvalue 1/2, andthe massive states are constructed using the corresponding eigenvector. Weanalyze numerically the projection operators by regularizing them to finitesize matrices and confirm that they indeed have eigenvalue 1/2. Beside thedesired massive states, we have spurious massive as well as massless states,which are infinitely degenerate. We show that these unwanted states can begauged away.
