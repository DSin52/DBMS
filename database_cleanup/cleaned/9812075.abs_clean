Title: Relativistically Invariant Description of Fluctuations Against the

Background of Classical Kink SolutionsComments: 11 pages, LaTex, corrected some typos

A relativistically invariant scheme for the description of excited states ina one-kink sector is formulated. The normal oscillations of fluctuationsagainst the background of a moving kink are determined. Zero mode of theseoscillations is excluded automatically due to the properties of the integralequation describing normal oscillations. A Hamiltonian for elementaryexcitations is obtained reflecting the relativistic nature of the problemconsidered. (35 kb)
