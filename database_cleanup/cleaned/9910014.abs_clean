We present a representation independent solution to the continuum Schwingermodel in light-cone ($A^+ = 0$) gauge. We then discuss the problem of findingthat solution using various quantization schemes. In particular we shallconsider equal-time quantization and quantization on either characteristicsurface, $x^+ = 0$ or $x^- = 0$.
