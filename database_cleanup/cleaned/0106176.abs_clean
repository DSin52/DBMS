We consider chiral condensates in SU(2) gauge theory with broken N=2supersymmetry and one fundamental flavor in the matter sector. Matter andgaugino condensates are determined by integrating out the adjoint field. Theonly nonperturbative input is the Affleck-Dine-Seiberg one-instantonsuperpotential. The results are consistent with those obtained by the`integrating in' procedure. We then calculate monopole, dyon, and chargecondensates using the Seiberg-Witten approach. The key observation is that themonopole and charge condensates vanish at the Argyres-Douglas point where themonopole and charge vacua collide. We interpret this phenomenon as adeconfinement of electric and magnetic charges at the Argyres-Douglas point.
