Title: Electric-Magnetic Black Hole Duality

Journal-ref: Phys.Rev. D55 (1997) 826-828

We generalize duality invariance for the free Maxwell action in an arbitrarybackground geometry to include the presence of electric and magnetic charges.In particular, it follows that the actions of equally charged electric andmagnetic black holes are equal.
