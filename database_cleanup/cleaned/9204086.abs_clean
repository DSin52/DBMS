Field-theoretic models for fields taking values in quantum groups areinvestigated. First we consider $SU_q(2)$ $\sigma$ model ($q$ real) expressedin terms of basic notions of noncommutative differential geometry. We discussthe case in which the $\sigma$ models fields are represented as products ofconventional $\sigma$ fields and of the coordinate-independent algebra. Anexplicit example is provided by the $U_q(2)$ $\sigma$ model with $q\sp{N}=1$,in which case quantum matrices $U_q(2)$ are realised as $2N\times 2N$ unitarymatrices. Open problems are pointed out.
