We provide an axiomatic framework for Quantum Field Theory at finitetemperature which implies the existence of general analyticity properties ofthe $ n $-point functions; the latter parallel the properties derived from theusual Wightman axioms in the vacuum representation of Quantum Field Theory.Complete results are given for the propagators, including a generalization ofthe K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation. Some known examples of``hard-thermal-loop calculations'' and the representation of ``quasiparticles''are discussed in this general framework.
