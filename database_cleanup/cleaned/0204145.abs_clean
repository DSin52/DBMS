It is shown that the super Higgs mechanism that occurs in a wide class ofmodels with vanishing cosmological constant (at the classical level) isobtained by the gauging of a flat group which must be an electric subgroup ofthe duality group. If the residual massive gravitinos which occur in thepartial supersymmetry breaking are BPS saturated, then the flat group is nonabelian. This is so for all the models obtained by a Scherk-Schwarzsupersymmetry breaking mechanism. If gravitinos occur in long multiplets, thenthe flat groups may be abelian. This is the case of supersymmetry breaking bystring compactifications on an orientifold T^6/Z_2 with non trivial branefluxes.
