We analyze string theory backgrounds that include different kinds oforientifold planes and map out a natural correspondence to (twisted) affineKac-Moody algebras. The low-energy description of specific BPS states in thesebackgrounds leads to a construction of explicit twisted magnetic monopolesolutions on R^3 x S^1. These backgrounds yield new low-energy field theorieswith twisted boundary conditions and the link with affine algebras yields anatural guess for the superpotentials of the corresponding pure N=1, and N=1*gauge theories.
