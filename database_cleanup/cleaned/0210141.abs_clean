Comments: 12 pages, updated comment to three contributions to the ICRC 2001

ConferenceLorentz symmetry violation (LSV) can be generated at the Planck scale, or atsome other fundamental length scale, and naturally preserve Lorentz symmetry asa low-energy limit (deformed Lorentz symmetry, DLS). DLS can have importantimplications for ultra-high energy cosmic-ray physics (see papersphysics/0003080 - hereafter referred to as I -, astro-ph/0011181 andastro-ph/0011182, and references quoted in these papers). A crucial question ishow DLS can be extended to a deformed Poincar\'e symmetry (DPS), and what canbe the dynamical origin of this phenomenon. In a recent paper (hep-th/0208064,hereafter referred to as II), we started a discussion of proposals to identifyDPS with a symmetry incorporating the Planck scale (like doubly specialrelativity, DSR) and suggested new ways in similar directions. Implications formodels of quadratically deformed relativistic kinematics (QDRK) and linearlydeformed relativistic kinematics (LDRK) were also discussed. We pursue here ourstudy of these basic problems, focusing on the possibility to relate deformedrelativistic kinematics (DRK) to new space-time dimensions and compare our QDRKmodel, in the form proposed since 1997, which the Kirzhnits-Chechin (KCh) andSato-Tati (ST) models. It is pointed out that, although the KCh model does notseem to work such as it was formulated, our more recent proposals can berelated to suitable extensions of this model generalizing the Finsler algebras(even to situations where a preferred physical inertial frame exists) and usingthe Magueijo-Smolin transformation as a technical tool.
