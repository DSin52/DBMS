I study tachyon condensate perturbations to the action of the two dimensionalstring theory corresponding to the c=1 matrix model. These are shown to deformthe action of the ground ring on the tachyon modules, confirming a conjectureof Witten. The ground ring structure is used to derive recursion relationswhich relate (N+1) and N tachyon bulk scattering amplitudes. These recursionrelations allow one to compute all bulk amplitudes.
