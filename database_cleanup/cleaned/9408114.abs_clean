A `discrete differential manifold' we call a countable set together with analgebraic differential calculus on it. This structure has already been exploredin previous work and provides us with a convenient framework for theformulation of dynamical models on networks and physical theories with discretespace and time. We present several examples and introduce a notion ofdifferentiability of maps between discrete differential manifolds. Particularattention is given to differentiable curves in such spaces. Every discretedifferentiable manifold carries a topology and we show that differentiabilityof a map implies continuity.
