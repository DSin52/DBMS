The bound state spectrum and the associated reflection factors are determinedfor the sine-Gordon model with arbitrary integrable boundary condition byclosing the bootstrap. Comparing the symmetries of the bound state spectrumwith that of the Lagrangian it is shown how one can "derive" the relationshipbetween the UV and IR parameters conjectured earlier.
