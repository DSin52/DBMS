Dual super Dp-brane actions are constructed by carrying out a dualitytransformation of the world-volume U(1) gauge field. The resulting world-volumeactions, which contain a (p - 2)-form gauge field, are shown to have theexpected properties. Specifically, the D1-brane and D3-brane transform in waysthat can be understood on the basis of the SL(2, Z) duality of type IIBsuperstring theory. Also, the D2-brane and the D4-brane transform in ways thatare expected on the basis of the relationship between type IIA superstringtheory and 11d M theory. For example, the dual D4-brane action is shown tocoincide with the double-dimensional reduction of the recently constructedM5-brane action. The implications for gauge-fixed D-brane actions are discussedbriefly.
