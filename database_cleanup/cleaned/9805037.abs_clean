Using the well-known Chern-Weil formula and its generalization, wesystematically construct the Chern-Simons forms and their generalizationinduced by torsion as well as the Nieh-Yan (N-Y) forms. We also give anargument on the vanishing of integration of N-Y form on any compact manifoldwithout boundary. A systematic construction of N-Y forms in D=4n dimension isalso given.
