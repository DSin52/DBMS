Title: Solitons and Instantons with(out) Supersymmetry

Authors: Zvonimir Hlousek and Donald Spector

Comments: 15 pages, harvmac. The major change is the addition of an important

discussion on constructing the supersymmetric generalizations ofnon-supersymmetric theories. The paper has also been re-organized. Thisrevision was inadvertently not submitted to the archive at the time of itscompletion last yearJournal-ref: Nucl. Phys. B442 (1995) 413

We give model-independent arguments, valid in nearly any number of spacetimedimensions, that topological solitons and instantons satisfy Bogomol'nyi-typebounds and, when these bounds are saturated, satisfy self-duality equations. Inthe supersymmetric case, we also show that, in spacetime dimensions greaterthan two, theories with topological charges necessarily exhibit extendedsupersymmetry, in which the topological charge appears as the central charge.The significance of our arguments lies in their generality. In thesupersymmetric case, we obtain insight into the contrast observed betweentopological charges in 1+1 and higher dimensional models. The centerpiece ofour method is to require that the supersymmetric extension of a generic(non-supersymmetric) field theory be self-consistent. Our discussion ofsupersymmetric extensions is quite detailed, and introduces the notion of the"associated superfield" to construct such extensions.
