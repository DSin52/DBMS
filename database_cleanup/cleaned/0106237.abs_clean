We consider a static brane in the background of a topological black hole, inarbitrary dimensions. For hyperbolic horizons, we find a solution only when theblack hole mass assumes its minimum negative value. In this case, the tensionof the brane vanishes, and the brane position coincides with the location ofthe horizon. For an elliptic horizon, we show that the massless mode ofRandall-Sundrum is recovered in the limit of large black hole mass.
