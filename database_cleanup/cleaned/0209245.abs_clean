Title: Nonperturbative flipped SU(5) vacua in Horava-Witten theory

Authors: A.E. Faraggi, R. Garavuso, J.M. Isidro

Comments: Invited talk presented by J.M.I. at the 1st International Conference

on String Phenomenology, Oxford, 6-11 July 2002There is good support for the embedding of the Standard Model fermions in thechiral 16 representation of SO(10). Such an embedding is provided by therealistic free fermionic heterotic-string models. In this talk we demonstratethe existence of solutions with 3 generations and SO(10) observable gaugegroup, in the case of compactification on a torus-fibred Calabi-Yau space overa Hirzebruch base surface. The SO(10)symmetry is broken to SU(5)xU(1) by aWilson line. The overlap with the realistic free fermionic heterotic-stringmodels is discussed.
