A straightforward derivation of the effective quark Lagrangian is presentedfor the topologically neutral chiral broken phase of the dilute instanton gas.The resulting quark Lagrangian is a nonlocal NJL-type and contains 4q, 6q,...vertices for any number of flavours. Correspondence of this result withpreviously known in literature is discussed in detail.
