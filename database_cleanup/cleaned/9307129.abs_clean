Title: Correlation functions of the spin-1 analog of the XXZ model

Comments: 28 pages

SystemsExact integral representations of spin one-point functions (ground stateexpectation values) are reported for the spin-1 analog of the XXZ model in theregion $-1<q<0$. The method enables one to calculate arbitrary $n$-pointfunctions in principle. We also report a construction of level 2 irreduciblehighest weight representations of $U_q(\hat{sl}_2)$ in terms of boson andfermion operators, and explicit forms of related vertex operators.
