We determine all Lie groups compatible with the gauge structure of theStandard Elementary Particle Model (SM) and their representations. The groupsare specified by congruence equations of quantum numbers. By comparison withthe experimental results, we single out one Lie group and show that this choiceimplies certain old and new correlations between the quantum numbers of the SMquantum fields as well as some hitherto unknown group theoretical properties ofthe Higgs mechanism.
