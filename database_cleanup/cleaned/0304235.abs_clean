Title: Quantum Mechanics in Infinite Symplectic Volume

Authors: J.M. Isidro

Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX

We quantise complex, infinite-dimensional projective space CP(H). We applythe result to quantise a complex, finite-dimensional, classical phase space Cwhose symplectic volume is infinite, by holomorphically embedding it intoCP(H). The embedding is univocally determined by requiring it to be an isometrybetween the Bergman metric on C and the Fubiny-Study metric on CP(H). Then theHilbert-space bundle over C is the pullback, by the embedding, of theHilbert-space bundle over CP(H).
