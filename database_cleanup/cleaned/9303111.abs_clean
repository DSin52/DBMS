Recently, Rogers' dilogarithm identities have attracted much attention in thesetting of conformal field theory as well as lattice model calculations. One ofthe connecting threads is an identity of Richmond-Szekeres that appeared in thecomputation of central charges in conformal field theory. We show that theRichmond-Szekeres identity and its extension by Kirillov-Reshetikhin can beinterpreted as a lift of a generator of the third integral homology of a finitecyclic subgroup sitting inside the projective special linear group of all $2\times 2$ real matrices viewed as a {\it discrete} group. This connectionallows us to clarify a few of the assertions and conjectures stated in the workof Nahm-Recknagel-Terhoven concerning the role of algebraic $K$-theory andThurston's program on hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Specifically, it is not relatedto hyperbolic 3-manifolds as suggested but is more appropriately related to thegroup manifold of the universal covering group of the projective special lineargroup of all $2 \times 2$ real matrices viewed as a topological group. Thisalso resolves the weaker version of the conjecture as formulated by Kirillov.We end with the summary of a number of open conjectures on the mathematicalside.
