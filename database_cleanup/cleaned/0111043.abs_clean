Title: Note on mirror symmetry and coisotropic D-branes on tori

Authors: Christian van Enckevort

Comments: 9 pages

We describe mirror symmetry on higher dimensional tori, paying specialattention to the behaviour of D-branes under mirror symmetry. To find themirror D-branes the description of mirror symmetry on D-branes due to Ooguri,Oz en Yin is used. This method allows us to deal with the coisotropic D-branesrecently introduced by Kapustin and Orlov. We compare this to the descriptionof mirror symmetry on D-branes using the Fourier-Mukai transform of charges.
