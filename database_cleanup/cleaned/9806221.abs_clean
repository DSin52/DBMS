We investigate canonical structure of the Abelian Higgs model within theframework of DLCQ. Careful boundary analysis of differential equations, such asthe Euler-Lagrange equations, leads us to a novel situation where the canonicalstructure changes in a drastic manner depending on whether the (light-front)spatial Wilson line is periodic or not. In the former case, the gauge-field ZMtakes discrete values and we obtain the so-called ``Zero-Mode Constraints''(ZMCs), whose semiclassical solutions give a nonzero vev to the scalar fields.Contrary, in the latter case, we have no ZMC and the scalar ZMs remaindynamical as well as the gauge-field ZM. In order to give classically nonzerovev to the scalar field, we work in a background field which minimizes thelight-front energy.
