We study domain walls in two different extensions of super Yang--Millscharacterized by the absence of a logarithmic term in their effectivesuperpotential. The models, defined by the usual gaugino condensate and anextra field Y, give different patterns of domain walls despite both leading tothe same effective limit for heavy Y, i.e. the Veneziano--Yankielowiczeffective Lagrangian of super Yang--Mills. We explain the origin of thosedifferences and also give a physical motivation for introducing the field Y.
