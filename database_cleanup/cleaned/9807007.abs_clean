The field equations for both generic bosonic and generic locallysupersymmetric 2D dilatonic gravity theories in the absence of matter arewritten as free differential algebras. This constitutes a generalization of thegauge theoretic formulation. Moreover, it is shown that the condition of freedifferential algebra can be used to obtain the equations in the locallysupersymmetric case. Using this formulation, the general solution of the fieldequations is found in the language of differential forms. The relation with theordinary formulation and the coupling to supersymmetric conformal matter arealso studied.
