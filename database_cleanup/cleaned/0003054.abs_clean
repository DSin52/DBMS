Theories with infinite volume extra dimensions open exciting opportunitiesfor particle physics. We argued recently that along with attractive featuresthere are phenomenological difficulties in this class of models. In fact, thereis no graviton zero-mode in this case and 4D gravity is obtained by means ofcontinuum bulk modes. These modes have additional degrees of freedom which donot decouple at low energies and lead to inconsistent predictions for lightbending and the precession of Mercury's perihelion. In a recent papers,[hep-th/0003020] and [hep-th/0003045] the authors made use of brane bending inorder to cancel the unwanted physical polarization of gravitons. In this notewe point out that this mechanism does not solve the problem since it uses a{\it ghost} which cancels the extra degrees of freedom. In order to have aconsistent model the ghost should be eliminated. As soon as this is done, 4Dgravity becomes unconventional and contradicts General Relativity. Newmechanisms are needed to cure these models. We also comment on the possibledecoupling of the ghost at large distances due to an apparent flat-5D nature ofspace-time and on the link between the presence of ghosts and the violation ofpositive-energy conditions.
