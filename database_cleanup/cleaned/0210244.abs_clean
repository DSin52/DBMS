and amssym.texWe consider a pure U(1) quantum gauge field theory on a general Riemanniancompact four manifold. We compute the partition function with Abelian Wilsonloop insertions. We find its duality covariance properties and derivetopological selection rules. Finally, we show that, to have manifest duality,one must assume the existence of twisted topological sectors besides thestandard untwisted one.
