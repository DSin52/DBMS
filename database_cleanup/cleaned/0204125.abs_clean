We study the $\theta$ dependence of four-dimensional SU($N$) gauge theories,for $N\geq 3$ and in the large-N limit. We use numerical simulations of theWilson lattice formulation of gauge theories to compute the first few terms ofthe expansion of the ground-state energy $F(\theta)$ around $\theta=0$,$F(\theta)-F(0) = A_2 \theta^2 (1 + b_2 \theta^2 + ...)$. Our results supportsufficiently small values of $\theta$, $\theta < \pi$.Indeed we verify that the topological susceptibility has a nonzero large-Nlimit $\chi_\infty=2 {\cal A}$ with corrections of $O(1/N^2)$, in substantialagreement with the Witten-Veneziano formula which relates $\chi_\infty$ to the$\eta^\prime$ mass. Furthermore, higher order terms in $\theta$ are suppressed;in particular, the $O(\theta^4)$ term $b_2$ (related to the $\eta^\prime -$b_2=-0.023(7)$ for N=3, and its absolute value decreases with increasing $N$,consistently with the expectation $b_2=O(1/N^2)$.
