finiteness conditionAuthors: Wolfgang Lucha and Michael Moser

An arbitrary renormalizable quantum field theory is considered as finite ifits dimensionless couplings conspire to yield, at every order of itsperturbative expansion, no ultraviolet-divergent renormalizations of thephysical parameters of the theory. The "finiteness conditions" resulting fromthese requirements form highly complicated, non-linear systems of relations. Apromising type of solution to the condition for one-loop finiteness of theYukawa couplings involves Yukawa couplings which are equivalent to thegenerators of Clifford algebras with identity element. However, our attempt toconstruct even one finite model based on such Clifford-like Yukawa couplingsthe gauge couplings, at least for every simple gauge group of rank less than orequal to 8.
