We can recast the Yang-Baxter equation as a triple product equation. Assumingthe triple product to satisfy some algebraic relations, we can find newsolutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. This program has been completed here forthe simplest triple systems which we call octonionic and quaternionic. Thesolutions are of rational type.
