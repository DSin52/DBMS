We have studied the kinetics of $q$-deformed bosons and fermions, within asemiclassical approach. This investigation is realized by introducing ageneralized exclusion-inclusion principle, intrinsically connected with thequantum $q$-algebra by means of the creation and annihilation operators matrixelements. In this framework, we have derived a non-linear Fokker-Planckequation for $q$-deformed bosons and fermions which can be seen as a timeevolution equation, appropriate to consider non-equilibrium or near-equilibriumsystems in a semiclassical approximation. The steady state of this equationreproduces in a simple mode the $q$-oscillators equilibrium statistics.
