The canonical theory of $N=1$ supergravity is applied to Bianchi class Aspatially homogeneous cosmologies. The full set of quantum constraints are thensolved with the possible ordering ambiguity taken into account by introducing afree parameter. The wave functions are explicitly given for all the Bianchiclass A models in a unified way. Some comments are made on the Bianchi type IXcases.
