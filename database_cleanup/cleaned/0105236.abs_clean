The Casimir stress on two concentric spherical shell in de Sitter backgroundfor massless scalar field is calculated. The scalar field satisfies Dirichletboundary conditions on the spheres. The metric is written in conformally flatform to make maximum use of Minkowski space calculations. Then the Casimirstress is calculated for inside and outside of the shell with differentbackgrounds. This model may be used to study the effect of the Casimir stresson the dynamics of the domain wall formation in inflationary models of earlyuniverse.
