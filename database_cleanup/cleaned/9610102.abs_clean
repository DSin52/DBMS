We study d=2, N=(2,2) non-linear sigma-models in (2,2) superspace. Byanalyzing the most general constraints on a superfield, we show that through anappropriate choice of coordinates, there are no other superfields than chiral,twisted chiral and semi-chiral ones. We study the resulting sigma-models and wespeculate on the possibility that all (2,2) non-linear sigma-models can beU(1) and the SU(2) x SU(2) WZW model. Pending upon the choice of complexstructures, the former can be described in terms of either one semi-chiralmultiplet or a chiral and a twisted chiral multiplet. The latter is formulatedin terms of one semi-chiral and one twisted chiral multiplet. For both cases weobtain the potential explicitely.
