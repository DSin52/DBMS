A novel technique based on Schwinger's proper time method is applied to theCasimir problem of the M.I.T. bag model. Calculations of the regularized vacuumenergies of massless scalar and Dirac spinor fields confined to a static andspherical cavity are presented in a consistent manner. While our results agreepartly with previous calculations based on asymptotic methods, the mainadvantage of our technique is that the numerical errors are under control.Interpreting the bag constant as a vacuum expectation value, we investigatepotential cancellations of boundary divergences between the canonical energyand its bag constant counterpart in the fermionic case. It is found that suchcancellations do not occur.
