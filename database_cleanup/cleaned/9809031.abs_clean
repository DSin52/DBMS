The squared Laplace operator acting on symmetric rank-two tensor fields isstudied on a (flat) Riemannian manifold with smooth boundary. Symmetry of thisfourth-order elliptic operator is obtained provided that such tensor fields andtheir first (or second) normal derivatives are set to zero at the boundary.Strong ellipticity of the resulting boundary-value problems is also proved.Mixed boundary conditions are eventually studied which involve complementaryprojectors and tangential differential operators. In such a case, strongellipticity is guaranteed if a pair of matrices are non-degenerate. Theseresults find application to the analysis of quantum field theories on manifoldswith boundary.
