Title: Creation of scalar particles in the presence of a constant electric

field in an anisotropic cosmological universeAuthors: Victor M. Villalba

Comments: 7 pages, REVTEX

In the present article we analyze the phenomenon of particle creation in acosmological anisotropic universe when a constant electric field is present. Wecompute, via the Bogoliubov transformations, the density number of particlescreated.
