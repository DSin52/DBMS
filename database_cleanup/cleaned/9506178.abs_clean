The string one loop renormalization of the gauge coupling constants isexamined in abelian orbifold models. The contributions to string thresholdcorrections independent of the compactification moduli fields are evaluatednumerically for several representative examples of orbifold models. We considercases with standard and non-standard embeddings as well as cases with discreteWilson lines background fields which match reasonably well with low energyphenomenology. We examine one loop gauge coupling constants unification in adescription incorporating the combined effects of moduli dependent andindependent threshold corrections, an adjustable Kac-Moody level for thehypercharge group factor and a large mass threshold associated with ananomalous $U(1)$ mechanism.
