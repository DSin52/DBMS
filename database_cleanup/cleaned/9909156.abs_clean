Title: Confining Properties of Abelian-Projected Theories and Field Strength

CorrelatorsAuthors: Dmitri Antonov (ITEP, Moscow) and Dietmar Ebert (CERN, Geneva and

Humboldt University, Berlin)Comments: Invited talk given at the Euroconference ``QCD 99'', 7-13th July

1999, Montpellier (France), to appear in Nucl. Phys. B (Proc. Suppl.)Journal-ref: Nucl.Phys.Proc.Suppl. 86 (2000) 456-459

We review the string representations of Abelian-projected SU(2)- andSU(3)-gauge theories and their application to the evaluation of bilocal fieldstrength correlators. The large distance asymptotic behaviours of the latterones are shown to be in agreement with the Stochastic Vacuum Model of QCD andexisting lattice data.
