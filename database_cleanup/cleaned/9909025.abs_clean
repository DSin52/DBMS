We consider typeIIA supergravity solution of D2-branes and D3-braneslocalized within D6-branes in the near-core region of D6-branes. With thesesolutions we can calculate the spectrum of the glueball mass in QCD3 and QCD4.The equation of motion describing the dilaton has the same eigenvalues and thesame glueball masses in QCD3 and QCD4. Glueball mass spectrum is the same inthe near core region of D6-branes of their M-theory counterpart is KK monopole.We conclude that the glueball mass spectrum is the same in QCD3 and QCD4 byconsidering the `near-core' limit of D6-branes of which M-theory counterpart(KK monopole background) becomes an ALE space with an $A_{N-1}$ singularitytimes 7 dimensional Minkowski space $M^{(6,1)}$.
