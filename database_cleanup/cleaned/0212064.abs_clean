Supersymmetric pure Yang-Mills theory is formulated with a local, i.e.space-time dependent, complex coupling in superspace. Super-Yang-Mills theorieswith local coupling have an anomaly, which has been first investigated in theWess-Zumino gauge and there identified as an anomaly of supersymmetry. In amanifest supersymmetric formulation the anomaly appears in two otherterm, the second relates the renormalization of the gauge coupling to therenormalization of the complex supercoupling. Only one of the two identitiescan be maintained in perturbation theory. We discuss the two versions andderive the respective beta function of the local supercoupling, which isnon-holomorphic in the first version, but directly related to the couplingrenormalization, and holomorphic in the second version, but has a non-trivial,i.e.anomalous, relation to the beta function of the gauge coupling.
