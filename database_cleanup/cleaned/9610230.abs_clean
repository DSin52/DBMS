ParameterAuthors: Jerzy Lukierski (Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of

Wroclaw, Poland)Comments: 4 pages, LaTeX, uses file stwol.sty, to be published in the

Proceedings of XXXII International Rochester Conference in High EnergyPhysics (Warsaw, 24.07-31.07 1996)The difficulties with the measurability of classical space-time distances areconsidered. We outline the framework of quantum deformations of D=4 space-timesymmetries with dimensionfull deformation parameter, and present some recentresults.
