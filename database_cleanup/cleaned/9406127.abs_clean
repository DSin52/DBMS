The unified theory of string and two-dimensional quantum gravity isconsidered. The action for two-dimensional gravity is choosen in a well-knowninduced form and thus gravity posesses it's oun nontrivial dynamics even on theclassical level. Three classically equivalent forms of the action of theunified theory are described, that is $D$, $D+1$ and $D+2$ formulations wherethe last one corresponds to the special kind of nonlinear sigma model on thebackground of classical two-dimensional metric. In all cases we find the actionof the theory to be invariant under generalized symmetry transformations, andpoint out the arbitrariness of renormalization which reflects this symmetry.The one - loop counterterms are calculated in a general covariant gauge andalso in conformal gauge. The difference between the counterterms for allclassically equivalent variants of the theory is trivial on mass-shell. Sincethe different versions of the theory lead to the one-loop contributions whichcoincide on mass shell, the corresponding arbitrariness is related with theonly generalized reparametrizations of the theory. Hence one can formulate theconditions of Weyl symmetry for any equivalent form of the action. Such aconditions are written for the $D+2$ formulation and then are reduced to otherones. The equations for the background interaction fields differ from the onesin standard approach and look much more complicated.
