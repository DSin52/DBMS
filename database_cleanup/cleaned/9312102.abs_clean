We study massless QED_2 with N flavors using path integrals. We identify thesector that is generated by the N^2 classically conserved vector currents. Oneof them (the U(1) current) creates a massive particle, while the others createmassless ones. We show that the mass spectrum obeys a Witten-Veneziano typeformula. Two theorems on n-point functions clarify the structure of the Hilbertspace. Evaluation of the Fredenhagen-Marcu order parameter indicates that aconfining force exists only between charges that are integer multiples of +/-Ne, whereas charges that are nonzero mod(N) screen their confining forces andlead to non-vacuum sectors. Finally we identify operators that violateclustering, and decompose the theory into clustering theta vacua.
