The Landau potentials of $W_3$-algebra models are analyzed withalgebraic-geometric methods. The number of ground states and the number ofindependent perturbations of every potential coincide and can be computed. Thisnumber agrees with the structure of ground states obtained in a previous paper,namely, as the phase structure of the IRF models of Jimbo et al. Thesingularities associated to these potentials are identified.
