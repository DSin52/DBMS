We give a sequence of equivalent formulations of the $ADE$ and $\hat A\hatsurfaces immersed in Dynkin diagrams, chains of coupled random matrices,Coulomb gases, and multicomponent Bose and Fermi systems representing soliton$\tau$-functions. We also formulate a set of loop-space Feynman rules allowingto calculate easily the partition function on a random surface with arbitrarytopology. The formalism allows to describe the critical phenomena on a randomsurface in a unified fashion and gives a new meaning to the $ADE$classification.
