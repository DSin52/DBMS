We study the post-Newtonian limit of a generalized dilaton gravity in whichgravity is coupled to dilaton and eletromagnetic fields. The field equationsare derived using the post-Newtonian scheme, and the approximate solution ispresented for a point mass with electric and dilaton charges. The resultindicates that the dilaton effect can be detected, in post-Newtonian level,using a charged test particle but not a neutral one. We have also checked thatthe approximate solution is indeed consistent with the weak field expansion ofcharged dilaton black hole solution in the harmonic coordinate.
