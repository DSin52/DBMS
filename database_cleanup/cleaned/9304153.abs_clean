Title: Quantum Fluctuations and Irreversibility

Authors: J. Perez-Mercader

Comments: LaTeX, 14 pages plus 4 Figures (available from the author upon

request), LAEFF--93/003We study how the effects of quantum corrections lead to notions ofirreversibility and clustering in quantum field theory. In particular, weconsider the virtual ``charge" distribution generated by quantum correctionsand adopt for it a statistical interpretation. Then, this virtual charge isshown to ($a$) describe a system where the equilibrium state is at itsclassical limit ($\hbar \rightarrow 0$), ($b$) give rise to spatial diffusionof the virtual cloud that decays as the classical limit is approached and ($c$)lead to a scenario where clustering takes place due to quantum dynamics, and anatural transition from a ``fractal" to a homogeneous regime occurs asdistances increase.
