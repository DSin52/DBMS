Campbell et al. demonstrated the existence of axion ``hair'' for Kerr blackholes due to the non-trivial Lorentz Chern-Simons term and calculated itexplicitly for the case of slow rotation. Here we consider the dilaton couplingto the axion field strength, consistent with low energy string theory andcalculate the dilaton ``hair'' arising from this specific axion source.
