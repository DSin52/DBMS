We construct a seven-dimensional brane world in a slice of AdS_7, where theboundary matter content is fixed by the cancellation of anomalies. Theseven-dimensional minimal N=2 gauged supergravity is compactified on theorbifold S^1/Z_2, and the supersymmetric bulk-boundary Lagrangian isconsistently derived for boundary vector and hypermultipets up to fermionicbilinear terms. Anomaly cancellation then fixes the boundary gauge coupling interms of the seven-dimensional Planck mass, and a topological mass parameter ofthe Chern-Simons term. In addition for gauge groups containing the standardmodel, anomaly cancellation restricts the gauge groups on the six-dimensionalboundaries to be only one of the exceptional groups. There are also specialvalues of the separation of the two boundaries, where the boundary couplingsbecome singular, and lead to a possible phase transition in the boundarytheory. Furthermore, by the AdS/CFT correspondence our brane world is dual to asix-dimensional conformal field theory, suggesting that our bulk theorydescribes the strong coupling dynamics of six-dimensional theories.
