Title: A Quantum Integrable System with Two Colour-Components in Two Dimensions

Comments: LaTeX file, 18 pages, no figure

The Davey-Stewartson 1(DS1) system[9] is an integrable model in twodimensions. A quantum DS1 system with 2 colour-components in two dimensions hasbeen formulated. This two-dimensional problem has been reduced to twoone-dimensional many-body problems with 2 colour-components. The solutions ofthe two-dimensional problem under consideration has been constructed from theresulting problems in one dimensions. For latters with the $\delta $-functioninteractions and being solved by the Bethe ansatz, we introduce symmetrical andantisymmetrical Young operators of the permutation group and obtain the exactsolutions for the quantum DS1 system. The application of the solusions isdiscussed.
