Title: Plane Waves and Vacuum Interpolation

Authors: Guillermo A. Silva

Comments: 13 pages, 3 figures

A 1/2-BPS family of time dependent plane wave spacetimes which give rise toexactly solvable string backgrounds is presented. In particular a solutionwhich interpolates between Minkowski spacetime and the maximally supersymmetrichomogeneous plane wave along a timelike direction is analyzed. We work in d=4,N=2 supergravity, but the results can be easily extended to d=10,11. Theconformal boundary of a particular class of solutions is studied.
