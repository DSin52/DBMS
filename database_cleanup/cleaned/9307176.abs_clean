Two-dimensional topological field theories possessing a non-abelian currentsymmetry are constructed. The topological conformal algebra of these models isanalysed. It differs from the one obtained by twisting the $N=2$ superconformalmodels and contains generators of dimensions $1$, $2$ and $3$ that close alinear algebra. Our construction can be carried out with one and two bosoniccurrents and the resulting theories can be interpreted as topological sigmamodels for group manifolds
