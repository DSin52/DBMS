Dimensional reduction of a self-dual tensor gauge field in 6d gives anAbelian vector gauge field in 5d. We derive the conditions under which aninteracting 5d theory of an Abelian vector gauge field is the dimensionalreduction of a 6d Lorentz invariant interacting theory of a self-dual tensor.Then we specialize to the particular 6d theory that gives 5d Born-Infeldtheory. The field equation and Lagrangian of this 6d theory are formulated withmanifest 5d Lorentz invariance, while the remaining Lorentz symmetries arerealized nontrivially. A string soliton with finite tension and self-dualcharge is constructed.
