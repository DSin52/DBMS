A field theoretic formulation of the Marinari-Parisi supersymmetric matrixmodel is established and shown to be equivalent to a recently proposedsupersymmetrization of the bosonic collective string field theory. It alsocorresponds to a continuum description of super-Calogero models. Theperturbation theory of the model is developed and, in this approach, aninfinite sequence of vertices is generated. A class of potentials is identifiedfor which the spectrum is that of a massless boson and Majorana fermion. Forthe harmonic oscillator case, the cubic vertices are obtained in an oscillatorbasis. For a rather general class of potentials it is argued that one cannotgenerate from Marinari-Parisi models a continuum limit similar to that of thed=1 bosonic string.
