A new framework is found for the compactification of supersymmetric stringtheory. It is shown that the massless spectra of Calabi--Yau manifolds ofcomplex dimension $D_{crit}$ can be derived from noncritical manifolds ofcomplex dimension $2k + D_{crit}$, $k\geq 1$. These higher dimensionalmanifolds are spaces whose nonzero Ricci curvature is quantized in a particularway. This class is more general than that of Calabi--Yau manifolds because itcontains spaces which correspond to critical string vacua with no K\"ahlerdeformations, i.e. no antigenerations, thus providing mirrors of rigidCalabi--Yau manifolds. The constructions introduced here lead to new insightsinto the relation between exactly solvable models and their mean field theorieson the one hand and Calabi--Yau manifolds on the other. They also raisefundamental questions about the Kaluza--Klein concept of stringcompactification, in particular regarding the r\^{o}le played by the dimensionof the internal theories.
