Energy Physics, Merida, Mexico, Nov. 5, 1996After defining the concept of duality in the context of general $n$-formabelian gauge fields in 2$n$ dimensions, we show by explicit example thedifference between apparent but unrealizable duality transformations, namelythose in $D=4k+2$, and those, in $D=4k$, that can be implemented by explicitdynamical generators. We then consider duality transformations in Maxwelltheory in the presence of gravitation, particularly electrically andmagnetically charged black hole geometries. By comparing actions in which boththe dynamical variables and the charge parameters are "rotated," we show theirequality for equally charged electric and magnetic black holes, thusestablishing their equivalence for semiclassical processes which depend on thevalue of the action itself.
