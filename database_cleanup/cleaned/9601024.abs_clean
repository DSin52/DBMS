A construction of conservation laws for $\sigma$-models in two dimensions isgeneralized in the framework of noncommutative geometry of commutativealgebras. This is done by replacing the ordinary calculus of differential formswith other differential calculi and introducing an analogue of the Hodgeoperator on the latter. The general method is illustrated with severalexamples.
