A general method is presented for deriving on-shell Ward-identities in (2D)string theory. It is shown that all tree-level Ward identities can besummarized in a quadratic differential equation for the generating function oftree-amplitudes. This result is extended to loop amplitudes and leads to amaster equation {\it \`{a} la} Batalin-Vilkovisky for the complete partitionfunction.
