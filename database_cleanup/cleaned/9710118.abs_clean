We propose a new integrable N=2 supersymmetric Toda lattice hierarchy whichmay be relevant for constructing a supersymmetric one-matrix model. We defineits first two Hamiltonian structures, the recursion operator and Lax--pairrepresentation. We provide partial evidence for the existence of aninfinite-dimensional N=2 superalgebra of its flows. We study its bosonic limitand introduce new Lax-pair representations for the bosonic Toda latticehierarchy. Finally we discuss the relevance this approach for constructing N=2supersymmetric generalized Toda lattice hierarchies.
