We review the holographic correspondence between field theories and string/Mtheory, focusing on the relation between compactifications of string/M theoryon Anti-de Sitter spaces and conformal field theories. We review the backgroundfor this correspondence and discuss its motivations and the evidence for itscorrectness. We describe the main results that have been derived from thecorrespondence in the regime that the field theory is approximated by classicalor semiclassical gravity. We focus on the case of the N=4 supersymmetric gaugetheory in four dimensions, but we discuss also field theories in otherdimensions, conformal and non-conformal, with or without supersymmetry, and inparticular the relation to QCD. We also discuss some implications for blackhole physics.
