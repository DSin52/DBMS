In the light front quantisation scheme initial conditions are usuallyprovided on a single lightlike hyperplane. This, however, is insufficient toyield a unique solution of the field equations. We investigate under whichadditional conditions the problem of solving the field equations becomes wellposed. The consequences for quantisation are studied within a Hamiltonianformulation by using the method of Faddeev and Jackiw for dealing withfirst-order Lagrangians. For the prototype field theory of massive scalarfields in 1+1 dimensions, we find that initial conditions for fixed light conetime {\sl and} boundary conditions in the spatial variable are sufficient toyield a consistent commutator algebra. Data on a second lightlike hyperplaneare not necessary. Hamiltonian and Euler-Lagrange equations of motion becomeequivalent; the description of the dynamics remains canonical and simple. Inthis way we justify the approach of discretised light cone quantisation.
