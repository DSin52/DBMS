We derive a formula that expresses the local spin and field operators offundamental graded models in terms of the elements of the monodromy matrix.This formula is a quantum analogue of the classical inverse scatteringtransform. It applies to fundamental spin chains, such as the XYZ chain, and toa number of important exactly solvable models of strongly correlated electrons,such as the supersymmetric t-J model or the the EKS model.
