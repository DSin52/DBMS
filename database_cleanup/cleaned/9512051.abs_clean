Title: Additional analytically exact solutions for three-anyons

Comments: 10 pages (RevTex) including 1 postcript figure

We present new family of exact analytic solutions for three anyons in aharmonic potential (or in free space) in terms of generalized harmonics on$S^3$, which supplement the known solutions. The new solutions satisfy thehard-core condition when $\alpha={1\over 3},1$ ($\alpha$ being the statisticalparameter) but otherwise, have finite non-vanishing two-particle collidingprobability density, which is consistent with self-adjointness of theHamiltonian. These solutions, however, do not have one-to-one mapping propertybetween bosonic and fermionic spectra.
