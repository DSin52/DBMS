Title: Dynamics in a noncommutative space

Comments: LaTeX, 12 pages, major changes in Sects. 2 and 3, refs. added

We discuss the dynamics of a particular two-dimensional (2D) physical systemin the four dimensional (4D) (non-)commutative phase space by exploiting theconsistent Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalisms based on the symplecticstructures defined on the 4D (non-)commutative cotangent manifolds. Thenoncommutativity exists {\it equivalently} in the coordinate or the momentumplanes embedded in the 4D cotangent manifolds. The signature of thisnoncommutativity is reflected in the derivation of the first-order Lagrangianswhere we exploit the most general form of the Legendre transformation definedon the (non-)commutative (co-)tangent manifolds. The second-order Lagrangian,defined on the 4D {\it tangent manifold}, turns out to be the {\it same}irrespective of the noncommutativity present in the 4D cotangent manifolds forthe discussion of the Hamiltonian formulation. A connection with thenoncommutativity of the dynamics, associated with the quantum groups on theq-deformed 4D cotangent manifolds, is also pointed out.
