Title: Singular Perturbations in Quantum Field Theory

Authors: V.E. Rochev and P.A. Saponov

Comments: Talk given at XVIII International Workshop on HEP and QFT in

Protvino, June 26 - 30 1995 and at X International Workshop on HEP and QFT inZvenigorod, September 20 - 26 1995. LaTex, 7 pagesIn this talk we discuss a new approximation scheme for non-perturbativecalculations in a quantum field theory which is based on the fact that theSchwinger equation of a quantum field model belongs to the class of singularlyperturbed equations. The self-interacting scalar field and the Gross-Neveumodel are taken as the examples and some non-perturbative solutions of anequation for the propagator are found for these models. The application to QCDis also discussed.
