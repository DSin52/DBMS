Title: Instantons and Quaternions

Authors: Stefan Vandoren

Comments: 5 pages, JHEP style. Invited talk at the TMR conference

"Nonperturbative Quantum Effects 2000", Paris, September 2000We relate the moduli space of Yang-Mills instantons to quaternionicmanifolds. For instanton number one, the Wolf spaces play an important role. Weapply these ideas to instanton calculations in N=4 SYM theory.
