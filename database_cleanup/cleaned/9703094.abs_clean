Since the lightcone self dual spherical membrane, moving in flat targetbackgrounds, has a direct correspondence with the $SU(\infty)$ Nahm equationsand the continuous Toda theory, we construct the Moyal deformations of the selfdual membrane in terms of the Moyal deformations of the continuous Toda theory.This is performed by using the Weyl-Wigner-Moyal quantization technique of the3D continuous Toda field equation, and its associated 2D continuous Todamolecule, based on Moyal deformations of rotational Killing symmetry reductionsof Plebanski first heavenly equation associated with 4D Self Dual Gravity.
