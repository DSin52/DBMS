Emission of hard microscopic string (graviton) by an excited macroscopicstring may be viewed as a model of branching of a $(1+1)$-dimensional babyuniverse off large parent one. We show that, apart from a trivial factor, thetotal emission rate is not suppressed by the size of the macroscopic string.This implies unsuppressed loss of quantum coherence in $(1+1)$-dimensionalparent universe.
