Kaluza-Klein approach in an N(=1+3+D)-dimensional Friedmann-Robertson-Walkertype space is often adopted in the literature. We derive a compact expressionfor the Friedmann equation in a (1+3+D)-dimensional space. The redundancy ofthe associated field equations due to the Bianchi identity is analyzed. We alsostudy the dilaton gravity theory with higher-derivative gravitationalcouplings. It turns out that higher-order terms will not affect the Friedmannequation in a constant flat internal space. This is true only for the flat-DeSitter external space. The inflationary solution in an induced-gravity model isalso discussed as an application.
