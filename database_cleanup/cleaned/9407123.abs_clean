We define pure gauge $QCD$ on an infinite strip of width $L$. Techniquessimilar to those used in finite $TQCD$ allow us to relate $3D$-observables topure $QCD_2$ behaviors. The non triviality of the $L \arrow 0$ limit is provenand the generalization to four dimensions described. The glueball spectrum ofthe theory in the small width limit is calculated and compared to that of thetwo dimensional theory.
