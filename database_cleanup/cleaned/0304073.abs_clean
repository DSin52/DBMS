Title: Triviality of Higher Derivative Theories

Authors: Victor O. Rivelles

Comments: 4 pages

We show that some higher derivative theories have a BRST symmetry. Thissymmetry is due to the higher derivative structure and is not associated to anygauge invariance. If physical states are defined as those in the BRSTcohomology then the only physical state is the vacuum. All negative normstates, characteristic of higher derivative theories, are removed from thephysical sector. As a consequence, unitarity is recovered but the S-matrix istrivial. We show that a class of higher derivative quantum gravity theorieshave this BRST symmetry so that they are consistent as quantum field theories.Furthermore, this BRST symmetry may be present in both relativistic andnon-relativistic systems.
