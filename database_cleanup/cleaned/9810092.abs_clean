We construct BPS-exact solutions of the worldvolume Born-Infeld plus WZWaction of a D5-brane in the background of N D3-branes. The non-trivialbackground metric and RR five-form field strength play a crucial role in thesolution. When a D5-brane is dragged across a stack of N D3-branes a bundle ofN fundamental strings joining the two types of branes is created, as in theHanany-Witten effect. Our solutions give a detailed description of this bundlein terms of a D5-brane wrapped on a sphere. We discuss extensions of thesesolutions which have an interpretation in terms of gauge theory multi-quarkstates via the AdS/CFT correspondence.
