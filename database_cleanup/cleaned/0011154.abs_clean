The coefficient of the Chern-Simons term in the effective action for massiveDirac fermions in three dimensions is computed by using the point-splittingregularization method. We show that in this framework no ambiguities arise.This is related to the fact that the point-splitting regularization does notintroduce additional parity breaking effects, implementing one possiblephysical criterion in order to uniquely characterize the system.
