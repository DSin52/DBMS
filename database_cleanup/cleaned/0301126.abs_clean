Title: Effective Actions Near Singularities

Authors: Marco Zagermann

Comments: 6 pages, LaTeX. Contribution to the proceedings of the 35th Symposium

format adjustedWe derive the low energy effective action of the STU-model in four and fivedimensions near the line T=U, where SU(2) gauge symmetry enhancement occurs. By`integrating in' the light W^{\pm} bosons together with their superpartners,the quantum corrected effective action becomes non-singular at T=U andmanifestly SU(2) invariant. The four-dimensional theory is found to beconsistent with modular invariance and the five-dimensional decompactificationlimit. This talk concisely summarizes results that have been obtained incollaboration with J. Louis and T. Mohaupt.
