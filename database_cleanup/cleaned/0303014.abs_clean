Title: Abelianization of Constraints in SU(N) Yang-Mills Theory

Authors: F. Loran

The abelian form of the first class constraints of SU(N) Yang-Mills theory in$D=3+1$ is obtained explicitly. Considering the abelian constraints, it isshown that Coulomb gauge does not lead to Gribov copies. We also show that inthe strong coupling limit, the gauge symmetry of the theory is similar to thatof QED.
