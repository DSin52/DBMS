Title: The Quantum Liouville Equation for the Effective Action

Authors: Herbert Nachbagauer

Comments: 9 Pages, 1 epsf figure

Starting from the von Neumann equation, we construct the quantum evolutionequation for the effective action for systems in mixed states. This allows usto find the hierarchy of equations which describe the time evolution of equaltime correlators. The method is applied explicitly to a scalar theory withquartic self-interaction.
