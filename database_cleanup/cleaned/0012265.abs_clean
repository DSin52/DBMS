Title: Dark Energy in Extra Dimensions and String Theory

ConditionsComments: 13 pages, Latex, Contribution to the Proceedings of Dark00,

HeidelbergThe smallness of the cosmological constant is one of the basic problems inparticle physics and cosmology. Various attempts have been made to explain thismystery, but no satisfactory solution has been found yet. The appearance ofextra dimensions in the framework of brane world systems seems to provide somenew ideas to address this problem from a different point of view. We shalldiscuss some of these new approaches and see whether or not they lead to animprovement of the situation. We shall conclude that we are still far from asolution of the problem.
