Title: Matrix Models of AdS Gravity

Authors: Emil J. Martinec

Comments: 24 pages, harvmac; errors corrected (esp. eqs 3.9 and 4.11),

references added; a few additional comments and explanationsWe explore the connection between anti-deSitter supergravity and gaugetheory, in the context of bound states of many D1 and D5 branes. Thenear-horizon $AdS_3$ supergravity describes the identity sector of theconformal field theory produced by the brane dynamics. A variant of anomalyinflow (for the 2d conformal anomaly) is involved. Dynamical matter fields on$AdS_3$ couple to the chiral ring and its descendant fields on the branes. Wepropose a map between boundary conformal field theory and bulksupergravity/matter dynamics, which is strongly reminiscent of matrix models of2d gravity.
