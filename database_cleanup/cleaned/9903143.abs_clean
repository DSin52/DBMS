Electrically charged solutions breaking half of the supersymmetry in Anti-DeSitter four dimensional N=2 supergravity coupled to vector supermultiplets areconstructed. These static black holes live in an asymptotic $AdS_4$ space-time.The Killing spinor, i. e., the spinor for supersymmetry variation is explicitlyconstructed for these solutions.
