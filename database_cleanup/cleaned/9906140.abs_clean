Title: Construction of the effective Poincare algebra

Authors: Tomasz Maslowski and Stanislaw D. Glazek

We derive expressions for Poincar\'e group generators using preturbativesimilarity renormalization group procedure for Hamiltonians. We show thatgenerators obtained in second-order perturbation theory satisfy requiredcommutation relations in weak sense, i.e. in matrix elements between states offinite invariant masses.
