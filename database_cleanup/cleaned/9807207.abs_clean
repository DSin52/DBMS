Complete wetting is a universal phenomenon associated with interfacesseparating coexisting phases. For example, in the pure gluon theory, at $T_c$an interface separating two distinct high-temperature deconfined phases splitsinto two confined-deconfined interfaces with a complete wetting layer ofconfined phase between them. In supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, distinctconfined phases may coexist with a Coulomb phase at zero temperature. In thatcase, the Coulomb phase may completely wet a confined-confined interface.Finally, at the high-temperature phase transition of gluons and gluinos,confined-confined interfaces are completely wet by the deconfined phase, andsimilarly, deconfined-deconfined interfaces are completely wet by the confinedphase. For these various cases, we determine the interface profiles and thecorresponding complete wetting critical exponents. The exponents depend on therange of the interface interactions and agree with those of correspondingcondensed matter systems.
