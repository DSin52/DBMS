We use minimal area metrics to generate all nonorientable string diagrams.The surfaces in unoriented string theory have nontrivial open curves andnontrivial closed curves whose neighborhoods are either annuli or Mobiusstrips. We define a minimal area problem by imposing length conditions on opencurves and on annular closed curves only. We verify that the minimal areaconditions are respected by the sewing operations. The natural objects thatsatisfy recursion relations involving the propagator, which performs bothorientable and nonorientable sewing, are classes of moduli spaces grouped byEuler characteristic.
