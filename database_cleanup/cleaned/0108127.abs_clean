Title: Searching for string theories of the standard model

Authors: D. Bailin, G. V. Kraniotis, A. Love

Comments: 21 pages, LaTeX file, Based on a talk given by D. Bailin, at the

first Cairo International Conference on High Energy Physics, (CICHEP 2001),Jan.2001. To be published in the proceedingsWe briefly review attempts to construct string theories that yield thestandard model, concentrating on models with a geometric interpretation.Calabi-Yau compactifications are discussed in the context of both the weaklycoupled heterotic string and the strongly coupled version, heterotic M-theory.Similarly, we consider orbifold compactifications of weakly coupled heterotictheory and of Type II theories in the presence of D-branes. The latter allows a"bottom-up" construction that so far seems the most natural and direct route tothe standard model.
