The partition function of $D_{N+1}$ topological string, the coupled system oftopological gravity and $D_{N+1}$ topological minimal matter , is proposed inthe framework of KP hierarchy. It is specified by the elements of $GL(\infty)$which constitute the deformed family from the $A_{2N-1}$ topological string.Its dispersionless limit is investigated from the view of both dispersionlessKP hierarchy and singularity theory. In particular the free energy restrictedon the small phase space coincides with that for the topologicalLandau-Ginzburg model of type $D_{N+1}$.
