We consider the entropy of near extremal black holes with multiple charges inthe context of the recently proposed correspondence principle of Horowitz andPolchinski, including black holes with two, three and four Ramond-Ramondcharges. We find that at the matching point the black hole entropy can beaccounted for by massless open strings ending on the D-branes for all casesexcept a black hole with four Ramond-Ramond charges, in which case a possibleresolution in terms of brane-antibrane excitations is considered.
