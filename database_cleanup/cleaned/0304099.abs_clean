Title: Riemann bilinear form and Poisson structure in Hitchin-type systems

Authors: D. Talalaev (ITEP, Moscow)

Comments: 15 pages

In this paper we reinterpret the Poisson structure of the Hitchin-type systemin cohomological terms. The principal ingredient of a new interpretation in thecase of the Beauville system is the meromorphic cohomology of the spectralcurve, and the main result is the identification of the Riemann bilinear formand the symplectic structure of the model. Eventual perspectives of thisapproach lie in the quantization domain.
