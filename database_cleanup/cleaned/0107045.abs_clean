The adiabatic invariant nature of black hole horizon area in classicalgravity suggests that in quantum theory the corresponding operator has adiscrete spectrum. I here develop further an algebraic approach to black holequantization which starts from very elementary assumptions, and proceeds byexploiting symmetry. It predicts a uniformly spaced area spectrum for allcharges and angular momenta. Area eigenvalues are degenerate; correspondencewith black hole entropy then dictates a precise value for the interval betweeneigenvalues.
