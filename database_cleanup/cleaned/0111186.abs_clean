Critical behaviour of the 2D scalar field theory in the LC framework isreviewed. The notion of dynamical zero modes is introduced and shown to lead toa non trivial covariant dispersion relation only for Continuous LC Quantization(CLCQ). The critical exponent $\eta$ is found to be governed by the behaviourof the infinite volume limit under conformal transformations propertiespreserving the local LC structure. The $\beta$-function is calculated exactlyand found non-analytic, with a critical exponent $\omega=2$, in agreement withthe conformal field theory analysis of Calabrese et al.
