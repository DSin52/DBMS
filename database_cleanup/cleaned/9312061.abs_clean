The generalised quasienergy states are introduced as eigenstates of the newintegral of motion for periodically and nonperiodically kicked quantumsystems.The photon distribution function of polymode generalised correlatedlight expressed in terms of multivariable Hermite polynomials is discussed andthe relation of its properties to Schrodinger uncertainty relation is given.
