We discuss new realisations of $W$ algebras in which the currents areexpressed in terms of two arbitrary commuting energy-momentum tensors togetherwith a set of free scalar fields. This contrasts with the previously-knownrealisations, which involve only one energy-momentum tensor. Since realisationsof non-linear algebras are not easy to come by, the fact that this new classexists is of intrinsic interest. We use these new realisations to build thecorresponding $W$-string theories and show that they are effectively describedby two independent ordinary Virasoro-like strings.
