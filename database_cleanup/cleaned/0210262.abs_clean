We investigate the supersymmetric D-brane configurations in the pp-wavebackgrounds proposed by Maldacena and Maoz. We study the survivingsupersymmetry in a D-brane configuration from the worldvolume point of view.When we restrict ourselves to the background with N=(2,2) supersymmetry and noholomorphic Killing vector term, there are two types of supersymmetricsubmanifold, and the imaginary part of the superpotential should be constant onits worldvolume. On the other hand, a B-type brane is wrapped on a complexsubmanifold, and the superpotential should be constant on its worldvolume. Theresults are almost consistent with the worldsheet theory in the lightconegauge. The inclusion of gauge fields is also discussed and found BPS D-braneswith the gauge field excitations. Furthermore, we consider the backgrounds withholomorphic Killing vector terms and N=(1,1) supersymmetric backgrounds.
