version of hep-th 9302104Previous studies of high-energy scattering in QCD have shown a remarkablecorrespondence with two-dimensional field theory. In this paper we formulate asimple effective model in which this two-dimensional nature of the interactionsis manifest. Starting from the (3+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills action, weimplement the high energy limit $s\! >\! > \! t$ via a scaling argument and wederive from this a simplified effective theory. This effective theory is still(3+1)-dimensional, but we show that its interactions can to leading order besummarized in terms of a two-dimensional sigma-model defined on the transverseplane. Finally, we verify that our formulation is consistent with knownperturbative results. This is a revised and extended version of hep-th 9302104.In particular, we have added a section that clarifies the connection withLipatov's gluon emission vertex.
