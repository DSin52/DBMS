Title: Note on Seiberg Duality in Matrix Model

Authors: Bo Feng

Comments: 10 pages

In this note, we give a method to derive the Seiberg duality by the matrixmodel. The key fact we used is that the effective actions given by matrix modelmethod should be identical for both electric and magnetic theories. Wedemonstrate our method for SQCD with U(N), SO(N) and Sp(N) gauge groups.
