We explore the Dirac equation in external electromagnetic and torsion fields.Motivated by the previous study of quantum field theory in an external torsionfield, we include a nonminimal interaction of the spinor field with torsion. Asa consequence, the torsion axial vector and the electromagnetic potential enterthe action in a similar form. The existence of an extra local symmetry isemphasized and the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation is performed to an accuracyof next to the leading order. We also discuss the motion of a classical testparticle in a constant torsion field.
