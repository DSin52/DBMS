The effect of quantum corrections to a conformally invariant field theory fora self-interacting scalar field on a curved manifold with boundary isconsidered. The analysis is most easily performed in a space of constantcurvature the boundary of which is characterised by constant extrinsiccurvature. An extension of the spherical formulation in the presence of aboundary is attained through use of the method of images. Contrary to theconsolidated vanishing effect in maximally symmetric space-times thecontribution of the massless "tadpole" diagram no longer vanishes indimensional regularisation. As a result, conformal invariance is broken due toboundary-related vacuum contributions. The evaluation of one-loop contributionsto the two-point function suggests an extension, in the presence of mattercouplings, of the simultaneous volume and boundary renormalisation in theeffective action.
