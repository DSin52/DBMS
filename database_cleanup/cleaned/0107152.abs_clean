Title: (Dis)assembling Special Lagrangians

Authors: Frederik Denef

Comments: 35 pages, 12 figures, v2

We explain microscopically why split attractor flows, known to underliecertain stationary BPS solutions of four dimensional N=2 supergravity, are therelevant data to describe wrapped D-branes in Calabi-Yau compactifications oftype II string theory. We work entirely in the context of the classicalgeometry of A-branes, i.e. special Lagrangian submanifolds, avoiding both theuse of homological algebra and explicit constructions of special Lagrangians.Our results provide a way to disassemble and assemble arbitrary specialLagrangians to and from more simple building blocks, giving a concrete way todetermine for example marginal stability walls and deformation moduli spaces.
