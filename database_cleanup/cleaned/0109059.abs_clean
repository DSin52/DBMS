In the SL(2) conformal field theory, we write down and analyze the analyticexpression of the three-point functions of generic primary fields with definiteSL(2) weights. Using these results, we discuss the operator product expansionin the SL(2,R) WZW model. We propose a prescription of the OPE, the classicallimit of which is in precise agreement with the tensor products of therepresentations of SL(2,R).
