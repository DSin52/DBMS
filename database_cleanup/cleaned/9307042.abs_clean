We consider modifications to general relativity by the non-local (classicaland quantum) string effects for the case of a D-dimensional Scwarzschild blackhole. The classical non-local effects do not alter the spacetime topology (thehorizon remains unshifted, at least perturbatively). We suggest a simpleanalytic continuation of the perturbative result into the non-perturbativedomain, which eliminates the black hole singularity at the origin and yields anultraviolet-finite theory of quantum gravity. We investigate the quantum non-local effects (including massive modes) and argue that the inclusion of theseback reactions resolves the problem of the thermal spectrum in the semi-classical approach of field quantization in a black hole background, throughthe bootstrap condition. The density of states for both the quantum and thermalinterpretation of the WKB formula are finally shown to differ quant- itativelywhen including the non-local effects.
