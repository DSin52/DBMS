We determine the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the harmonicoscillator where the coordinates and momenta are assumed to obey the modifiedcommutation relations [x_i,p_j]=i hbar[(1+ beta p^2) delta_{ij} + beta' p_ip_j]. These commutation relations are motivated by the fact they lead to theminimal length uncertainty relations which appear in perturbative stringtheory. Our solutions illustrate how certain features of string theory maymanifest themselves in simple quantum mechanical systems through themodification of the canonical commutation relations. We discuss whether sucheffects are observable in precision measurements on electrons trapped in strongmagnetic fields.
