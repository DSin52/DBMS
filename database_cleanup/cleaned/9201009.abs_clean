The simplest toroidally compactified string theories exhibit a dualityinvariant under R goes to 1/R. Compactification on more general Lorentzianlattices (i.e. toroidal compactification in the presence of background metric,antisymmetric tensor, and gauge fields) yields theories for which large-smallinvariance is not so simple. Here an equivalence is demonstrated between largeand small geometries for all toroidal compactifications. By repeatedlytransforming the momentum mode corresponding to the smallest winding length toanother mode on the lattice, it is possible to increase the volume to exceed afinite lower bound.
