Recent work in the literature has proposed the use of non-local boundaryconditions in Euclidean quantum gravity. The present paper studies first a moregeneral form of such a scheme for bosonic gauge theories, by adding to theboundary operator for mixed boundary conditions of local nature a two-by-twomatrix of pseudo-differential operators with pseudo-homogeneous kernels. Therequest of invariance of such boundary conditions under infinitesimal gaugetransformations leads to non-local boundary conditions on ghost fields. InEuclidean quantum gravity, an alternative scheme is proposed, where non-localboundary conditions and the request of their complete gauge invariance aresufficient to lead to gauge-field and ghost operators of pseudo-differentialnature. The resulting boundary conditions have a Dirichlet and apseudo-differential sector, and are pure Dirichlet for the ghost. This approachis eventually extended to Euclidean Maxwell theory.
