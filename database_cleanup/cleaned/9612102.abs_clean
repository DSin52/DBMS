The string field theory of N=(2,1) heterotic strings describes a set ofself-dual Yang-Mills fields coupled to self-dual gravity in 2+2 dimensions. Weshow that the exact classical action for this field theory is a certaincomplexification of the Green-Schwarz/Dirac-Born-Infeld string action, closelyrelated to the four dimensional Wess-Zumino action describing self-dual gaugefields. This action describes the world-volume of a 2+2d ``M-brane'', whichgives rise upon different null reductions to critical strings and membranes. Wediscuss a number of further properties of N=2 heterotic strings, such as thegeometry of null reduction, general features of a covariant formulation, andpossible relations to BPS and GKM algebras.
