Title: Classical Stringy Black Holes Modify the Thermal Spectrum

Authors: B. Harms and Y. Leblanc

Comments: 8 pages, REVTEX

Non-local (alpha prime) corrections to Schwarzschild black holes are shown toinvalidate the thermodynamical interpretation of black holes. In particular,the canonical and Bekenstein-Hawking temperatures are not equal. The particlenumber density of fields quantized in the (alpha prime modified) black holebackground is no longer thermal. In the non-perturbative region (alpha primegoing to infinity or mass going to zero), an analytic continuation to thenumber density is shown to vanish exponentially.
