The hierarchical nonlinear super-differential equations are identified whichdescribe universal behavior of the discretized model of $2d$ supergravityrecently proposed. This is done by first taking a double scaling limit of thesuper Virasoro constraints ( at finite $N$) of the model and by rederiving itfrom the $\tilde{G}_{-1/2}$ constraint and the two reduction of the super KPhierarchy discussed. The double-scaled constraints are found to be described bya twisted scalar and a Ramond fermion.
