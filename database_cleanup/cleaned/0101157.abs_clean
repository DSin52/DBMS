Using the higher covariant derivatives regularization of gauge theories inthe framework of the background field method, supplemented with one-loopPauli-Villars regulator fields, we obtain a version of the renormalizationgroup equation for the regulator fields, whose vacuum energy depends on thebackground gauge field. It is evaluated using an anomalous Ward-Takahashiidentity, which is related to the rescaling anomaly of the auxiliary fields,obtained by the Fujikawa approach. In this way the anomalous origin of theone-loop beta-function in QCD is clearly shown in terms of scaling of effectiveLagrangians without the use of any Feynman diagram. The simplicity of themethod is due to the preservation of the background and quantum gaugeinvariance in any step of the calculation.
