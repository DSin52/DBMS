Title: The wave function of the universe and spontaneaus breaking of

supersymmetryComments: 11 pages, 1 figure, revtex

In this work we define a scalar product ``weighted'' with the scalar factor$R$ and show how to find a normalized wave function for the supersymmetricquantum FRW cosmological model using the idea of supersymmetry breakingselection rules under local n=2 conformal supersymmetry. We also calculate theexpectation value of the scalar factor R in this model and its correspondingbehaviour.
