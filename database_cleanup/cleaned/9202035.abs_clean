We describe the (chiral) BRST-cohomology of matter with central charge$1<c_M<25$ coupled to a ``Liouville" theory, realized as a free field with amatter is realized by one free field with an imaginary background charge, b)states can be labelled by integers $r,s$ of a rotated $c_M =1$ theory, buthermiticity imposes $r=s$. Thus there is still a discrete set of momenta$p_M(r,r),\ p_L(r,r)$ such that there are non- trivial (relative) cohomologystates at level $r^2$ with ghost-numbers 0 or 1 (for $r>0$) and ghost-numbers 0or $-1$ (for $r<0$). The (chiral) ground ring is isomorphic to a subring of the$c_M =1$ theory which is $(xy)^n,\ n=0,1,2,\ldots$, and there are {\it no}non-trivial currents acting on the ground ring. In case b) there is nonon-trivial relative cohomology for non-zero ghost numbers and, for zero ghostnumber, the cohomology groups are isomorphic to a $(D-1)$-dimensional on-shell``transverse" Fock space. The only exceptions are at level 1 for vanishingmatter momentum and $p_L=Q_L(1+r)$ with $r=\pm 1$, where one has one moreghost-number zero and a ghost-number $r$ cohomology state. All these resultsfollow quite easily from the existing literature.
