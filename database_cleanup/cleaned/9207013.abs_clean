A two-boson realization of the second hamiltonian structure for the KPhierarchy has recently appeared in the literature. Furthermore, it has beenclaimed that this is also a realization of the hierarchy itself. This issurprising because it would mean that the dynamics of the KP hierarchy---whichin its usual formulation requires an infinite number of fields---can bedescribed with only two. The purpose of this short note is to point out thealmost obvious fact that the hierarchy described by the two bosons is not theKP hierarchy but rather a reduction thereof---one which is moreoverincompatible with the reduction to the KdV-type subhierarchies.
