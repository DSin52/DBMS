We present a detailed analysis of $AdS_3$ gravity, the BTZ black hole and theassociated conformal field theories (CFTs). In particular we focus on thenon-extreme six-dimensional string solution with background metric $AdS_3\times S^3$ near the horizon. In addition we introduce momentum modes along thestring, corresponding to a BTZ black hole, and a Taub-NUT soliton in thetransverse Euclidean space. We show that the $AdS_3$ space-time of thisconfiguration has the spatial geometry of an annulus with a Liouville model atthe outer boundary and a two-dimensional black hole at the inner boundary.These CFTs provide the dynamical degrees of freedom of the three-dimensionaleffective model and, together with the CFT corresponding to $S^3$, provide astatistical interpretation of the corresponding Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Wetest the proposed exact black hole entropy, which should hold to all orders in$\alpha^\prime$, by an independent field theoretical analysis includinghigher-order curvature corrections. We find consistent results that yield arenormalization of the classical parameters, only. In addition we find alogarithmic subleading black hole entropy coming from gravitational fivebraneinstantons in a special limit in moduli space.
