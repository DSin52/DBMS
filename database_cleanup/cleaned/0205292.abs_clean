In this note we investigate a new type of non-commutative field theory basedon a constant skew-symmetric three-form parameter. In 3+1 dimensions such athree-form parameter can be viewed as a short-distance regulator whichnevertheless preserves spatial-rotation and at long range preserves Lorentzinvariance approximately. For a scalar field theory with quarticself-interaction we obtain drastically improved ultra-violet behavior of thediagrams, due to the oscillatory dependence of the interaction vertex on themomenta. The radiative corrections to the coupling are rendered finite alreadyat the one-loop level. The key finding of this paper is that what appears asthe reemergence of UV divergences as IR singularity in $p \to 0$ limit, must beinterpreted simply as the logarithmic running of the coupling. Thus at lowenergies the theory is virtually indistinguishable from the standard theory.Conversely at high energies the diagram converges exponentially fast, therunning of the coupling stops and the theory avoids developing the Landau pole.Bare coupling defined at high energy can be kept small, and in this sense thetheory is similar to asymptotically free theories.
