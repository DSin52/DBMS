Title: A geometry for the electroweak field

Authors: Peter Morgan

Comments: 3 pages, RevTeX

The structure of the electroweak theory is suggested by classical geometricalideas. A nonlinear map is constructed, from a 12-dimensional linear space ofthree Weyl spinors onto the 12-dimensional tangent bundle of the Stiefelmanifold of orthonormal tetrads associated with the Lorentz group -- except,inevitably, for a set of measure zero. In the approach of this paper, theelectroweak field is more natural than the Dirac field. This may be just acuriosity since it may not survive quantization, but it suggests a path tobosonization of the electroweak field in (3+1) dimensions.
