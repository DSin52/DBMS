Perturbative TreatmentAuthors: Kazuya Yuasa and Hiromichi Nakazato (Dept. of Phys., Waseda Univ.,

The quantum mechanical transition amplitudes are calculated perturbatively onthe basis of the stochastic quantization method of Parisi and Wu. It is shownthat the stochastic scheme reproduces the ordinary result for the amplitude andsystematically incorporates higher-order effects, even at the lowest order.
