Understanding the nontrivial features of light-front QCD is a central goal incurrent investigations of nonperturbative light-front field theory. We findthat, with the choice of light-front gauge with antisymmetric boundaryconditions for the field variables, the residual gauge freedom is fixed and thelight-front QCD vacuum is trivial. The nontrivial structure in light-front QCDis determined by non-vanishing asymptotic physical (transverse) gauge fields atlongitudinal infinity, which are responsible for nonzero topological windingnumber.
