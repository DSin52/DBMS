Title: Noncompact Coset Spaces in String Theory

Authors: Fernando Quevedo

Comments: 12 pages. 2 figures. Talk at Black Holes, Membranes, Wormholes

and Strings Workshop, Houston, January 92A brief overview of strings propagating on noncompact coset spaces G/H ispresented in terms of WZW models. The role played by isometries in theexistence of target space duality and by fixed points of the gaugetransformations in the existence of singularities and horizons, is emphasized.A general classification of the spaces with a single time-like coordinate ispresented. The spacetime geometry of a class of models, existing for everydimension and having cosmological and black hole-like interpretations, isdiscussed.
