Orientifold vacua allow the simultaneous presence of supersymmetric bulks,with one or more gravitinos, and non-supersymmetric combinations of BPS branes.This ``brane supersymmetry breaking'' raises the issue of consistency for theresulting gravitino couplings, and Dudas and Mourad recently providedconvincing arguments to this effect for the ten-dimensional $USp(32)$ model.These rely on a non-linear realization of local supersymmetry {\it \`a la}Volkov-Akulov, although no gravitino mass term is present, and the couplingshave a nice geometrical interpretation in terms of ``dressed'' bulk fields,aside from a Wess-Zumino-like term, resulting from the supersymmetrization ofthe Chern-Simons couplings. Here we show that {\it all} couplings can be givena geometrical interpretation, albeit in the dual 6-form model, whose bulkincludes a Wess-Zumino term, so that the non-geometric ones are in factdemanded by the geometrization of their duals. We also determine the low-energycouplings for six-dimensional (1,0) models with brane supersymmetry breaking.Since these include both Chern-Simons and Wess-Zumino terms, only the resultingfield equations are geometrical, aside from contributions due to vectors ofsupersymmetric sectors.
