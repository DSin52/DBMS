We discuss a new mechanism of obtaining a period of cosmological inflation inthe context of string theory. This mechanism is based on embedded defects whichform dynamically on higher dimensional D-branes. Such defects generatetopological inflation, but unlike topological inflation from stable defects,defect. We demonstrate the idea in the context of a brane-antibraneannihilation process. The graceful exit mechanism suggested here appliesgenerically to all realizations of inflation on D-branes.
