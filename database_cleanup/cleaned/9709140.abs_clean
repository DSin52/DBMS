Through introducing a notion of renormalization of particle-number density, asimple perturbation scheme of nonequilibrium quantum-field theory is proposed.In terms of the renormalized particle-distribution functions, whichcharacterize the system, the structure of the scheme (and then also thestructure of amplitudes and reaction rates) are the same as in the equilibriumthermal field theory. Then, as an obvious consequence, the amplitudes andreaction rates computed in this scheme are free from pinch singularities due tomultiple products of $\delta$-functions, which inevitably present intraditional perturbation scheme.
