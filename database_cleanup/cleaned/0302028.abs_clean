Hiroshi Ezawa, World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd. SingaporeBPS wall solutions are obtained for N=2 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma modelwith Eguchi-Hanson target manifold in a manifestly supersymmetric manner. Themodel is constructed by a massive hyper-Kahler quotient method both in the N=1superfield and in the N=2 superfield (harmonic superspace). We describe themodel in simple terms and give relations between various parameterizationswhich are useful to describe the model and the solution. Some more details canbe found in our previous paper [hep-th/0211103]. This article is dedicated toProfessor Hiroshi Ezawa on the occasion of his seventieth birthday.
