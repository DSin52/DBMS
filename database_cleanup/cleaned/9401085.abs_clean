It is shown that the principle of locality and noncommutative geometry can beconnnected by a sheaf theoretical method. In this framework quantum spaces areintroduced and examples in mathematical physics are given. With the language ofquantum spaces noncommutative principal and vector bundles are defined andtheir properties are studied. Important constructions in the classical theoryof principal fibre bundles like associated bundles and differential calculi arecarried over to the quantum case. At the end $q$-deformed instanton models areintroduced for every integral index.
