We investigate quantum corrections to the moduli space for hypermultipletsfor type IIA near a conifold singularity. We find a unique quantum deformationbased on symmetry arguments which is consistent with a recent conjecture. Thecorrection can be interpreted as an infinite sum coming from multiple wrappingsof the Euclidean D-branes around the vanishing cycle.
