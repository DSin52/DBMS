We revisit the treatment of the multiflavor massive Schwinger model bynon-Abelian Bosonization. We compare three different approximations to theinteractions), ii) semi-classical quantization of the static soliton, iii)approximate semi-classical quantization of the ``breather'' solitons. A numberof new points are made in this process. We also suggest a different ``effectivelow-energy Lagrangian'' for the theory which permits easy calculation of thelow-energy scattering amplitudes. It correlates an exact mass formula of thesystem with the requirement of the Mermin-Wagner theorem.
