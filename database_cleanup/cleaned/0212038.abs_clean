Authors: Daniel H.T. Franco and Caio M.M. Polito

Comments: 45 pages, some details added, misprints corrected

We propose an extension of some structural aspects that have successfullybeen applied in the development of the theory of quantum fields propagating ona general spacetime manifold so as to include superfield models on asupermanifold.
