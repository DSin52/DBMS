We analyze the possibility of constructing a supersymmetric invariant thatcontains the $R^4$ term among its components as a superpotential term in typeIIB on-shell superspace. We consider a scalar superpotential, i.e. an arbitraryholomorphic function of a chiral scalar superfield. In general, IIB superspacedoes not allow for the existence of chiral superfields, but the obstructionvanishes for a specific superfield, the dilaton superfield. This superfieldcontains all fields of type IIB supergravity among its components, and itsexistence is implied by the solution of the Bianchi identities. Theconstruction requires the existence of an appropriate chiral measure, and wefind an obstruction to the existence of such a measure. The obstruction isclosely related to the obstruction for the existence of chiral superfields andis non-linear in the fields. These results imply that the IIB superinvariantrelated to the $R^4$ term is not associated with a scalar chiralsuperpotential.
