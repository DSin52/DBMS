Title: On dispersionless Hirota type equations

Comments: 10 pages, latex (need only run once)

Dispersionless Hirota type equations are extracted from the dispersionlesslimit of the Fay differential identity due to Takasaki- Takebe. A few otherresults are sketched between inverse scattering, dKdV, and gravity.
