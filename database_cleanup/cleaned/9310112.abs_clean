We present a conformal field theory which desribes a homogeneous fourdimensional Lorentz-signature space-time. The model is an ungauged WZW modelbased on a central extension of the Poincar\'e algebra. The central charge ofthis theory is exactly four, just like four dimensional Minkowski space. Themodel can be interpreted as a four dimensional monochromatic plane wave. Asthere are three commuting isometries, other interesting geometries are expectedto emerge via $O(3,3)$ duality.
