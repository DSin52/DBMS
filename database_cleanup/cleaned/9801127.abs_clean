We attempt to settle the issue as to what is the correct non-abeliangeneralisation of the Born-Infeld action, via a consideration of the two-loop$\beta$--function for the non-abelian background gauge field in open stringtheory. An analysis of the bosonic theory alone shows the recent proposal ofTseytlin's to be somewhat lacking. For the superstring, however, this proposalwould seem to be correct, and not just within the approximation used in\cite{tseytlin}. Since it is this latter case that is relevant to thedescription of D-branes we, in effect, obtain an independent verification ofTseytlin's result. Some issues involved in the concept of non-abelianT--duality are discussed; and it is shown how the interaction between separatedand parallel branes, in the form of massive string states, emerges.
