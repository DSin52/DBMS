A version of the kappa-symmetric super D-p-brane action is presented in whichthe tension is a dynamical variable, equal to the flux of a p-form worldvolumegauge field. The Lagrangian is shown to be invariant under all(super)isometries of the background for appropriate transformations of theworldvolume gauge fields, which determine the central charges in the symmetryalgebra. We also present the Hamiltonian form of the action in a generalsupergravity background.
