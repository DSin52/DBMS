The quantum-induced dilatonic brane world (New Brane World) is created bybrane CFT quantum effects (giving effective brane tension) in accordance withAdS/CFT set-up which also defines surface term. Considering the bosonic sectorof 5d gauged supergravity with single scalar and taking the boundary action aspredicted by supersymmetry, the possibility to supersymmetrize dilatonic NewBrane World is discussed. It is demonstrated that for a number ofsuperpotentials the flat SUSY dilatonic brane-world (with dynamically inducedbrane dilaton) or quantum-induced de Sitter dilatonic brane-world (not Anti-deSitter one) where SUSY is broken by the quantum effects occurs. The analysis ofgraviton perturbations indicates that gravity is localized on such branes.
