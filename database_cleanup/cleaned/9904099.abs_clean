Title: Curvature relations in almost product manifolds

Authors: Magnus Holm and Niclas Sandstr\"{o}m

New relations involving curvature components for the various connectionsappearing in the theory of almost product manifolds are given and the conformalbehaviour of these connections are studied. New identities for the irreducibleparts of the deformation tensor are derived. Some direct physical applicationsin Kaluza-Klein and gauge theory are discussed.
