The conformal limit over an anti-ferromagnetic vacuum of the fermionic spin$\frac{1}{2}$ Calogero-Sutherland Model is derived by using the wedge productformalism. The space of states in the conformal limit is identified with theFock space of two complex fermions, or, equivalently, with a tensor product ofan irreducible level-1 module of $\slt$ and a Fock space module of theHeisenberg algebra.The Hamiltonian and the Yangian generators of theCalogero-Sutherland Model are represented in terms of $\slt$ currents andbosons. At special values of the coupling constant they give rise to theHamiltonian and the Yangian generators of the conformal limit of theHaldane-Shastry Model acting in an irreducible level-1 module of $\slt$. Atgeneric values of the coupling constant the space of states is decomposed intoirreducible representations of the Yangian.
