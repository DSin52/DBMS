We consider a $2d$ sigma model with a $2+N$ - dimensional Minkowski signaturetarget space metric having a covariantly constant null Killing vector. We studysolutions of the conformal invariance conditions in $2+N$ dimensions and findthat generic solutions can be represented in terms of the RG flow in $N$ -dimensional ``transverse space'' theory. The resulting conformal invariantsigma model is interpreted as a quantum action of the $2d$ scalar (``dilaton")quantum gravity model coupled to a (non-conformal) `transverse' sigma model.The conformal factor of the $2d$ metric is identified with a light conecoordinate of the $2+N$ - dimensional sigma model. We also discuss the casewhen the transverse theory is conformal (with or without the antisymmetrictensor background) and reproduce in a systematic way the solutions with flattransverse space known before.
