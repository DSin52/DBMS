D-brane technology and strong/weak coupling duality supplement traditionalorbifold techniques by making certain background geometries more accessible. Inthis spirit, we consider some of the geometric properties of the type IIBtheory on R^6 \times M where M is an `Asymptotically Locally Euclidean (ALE)'gravitational instanton. Given the self-duality of the theory, we can extractthe geometry (both singular and resolved) seen by the weakly coupled IIB stringby studying the physics of a D1-brane probe. The construction is both amusingand instructive, as the physics of the probe completely captures themathematics of the construction of ALE instantons via `HyperKahler Quotients',as presented by Kronheimer. This relation has been noted by Douglas and Moorefor the A-series. We extend the explicit construction to the case of the D- andE-series -- uncovering a quite beautiful structure -- and highlight how all ofthe elements of the mathematical construction find their counterparts in thephysics of the type IIB D-string. We discuss the explicit ALE metrics which maybe obtained using these techniques, and comment on the role duality plays inrelating gauged linear sigma models to conformal field theories.
