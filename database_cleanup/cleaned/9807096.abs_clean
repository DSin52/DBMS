In this lecture we give an elementary introduction to the natural realizationof non-perturbative N=2 quantum field theories as a low energy limit ofclassical string theory. We review a systematic construction of six, five, andfour dimensional gauge theories using geometrical data, which provides theexact, non-perturbative solution via mirror symmetry. This construction haslead to the exact solution of a large class of gravity free gauge theories,including Super Yang Mills (SYM) theories as well as non-conventional quantumfield theories without a known Lagrangian description.
