We study the trace anomaly of the (2,0) tensor multiplet in d=6 in thepresence of a background SO(5) vector field acting as a source for theR-current. Using both a free-field theory calculation and AdS_7/CFT_6correspondence, we find that only one of the two possible anomaly structures isnon-zero and that its coefficient at strong-coupling differs by the well-knownoverall factor 4N^3 from the corresponding weak coupling result. We alsodiscuss the relevance of our result to studies of the R-current anomaly in the(2,0) multiplet.
