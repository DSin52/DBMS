We study the classical theory of a non-Abelian gauge field (gauge group$SU(2)$) coupled to a massive dilaton, massive axion and Einstein gravity.The theory is inspired by the bosonic part of the low-energy heterotic stringaction for a general Yang-Mills field, which we consider to leading order aftercompactification to $(3+1)$ dimensions. We impose the condition that spacetimebe static and spherically symmetric, and we introduce masses via adilaton-axion potential associated with supersymmetry (SUSY)-breaking bygaugino condensation in the hidden sector. In the course of describing thepossible non-Abelian solutions of the simplified theory, we consider in detailfield, and a massive axion field coupled to a non-Abelian dyonic configuration,in which the electric and magnetic fields decay too rapidly to correspond toany global gauge charge. We discuss the feasibility of solutions with andwithout a nontrivial dilaton for the latter case, and present numerical regularand black hole solutions for the former.
