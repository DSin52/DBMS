A way to break supersymmetry in perturbative superstring theory is the stringversion of the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism. There, the fermions and bosons havemass splitting due to different compactification boundary conditions. Weconsider the implementation of this mechanism in abelian orbifoldcompactifications with Wilson line backgrounds. For $Z_N$ and $Z_N\times Z_M$orbifolds, we give the possible $U(1)$ R-symmetries which determine the masssplitting, and thus, the supersymmetry breaking at the perturbative level. Thephenomenlogical viability of this mechanism implies some dimension(s) to be aslarge as the TeV scale. We explain how the lighter Kaluza-Klein statesassociated with the extra-dimension(s) have quantum numbers depending on theWilson lines used.
