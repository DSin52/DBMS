Title: $N=2$ Superconformal Field Theories in $4$ Dimensions and A-D-E

ClassificationAuthors: Tohru Eguchi and Kentaro Hori

Comments: 19 pages LaTeX; Talk given by T. Eguchi at "Mathematical Beauty of

Physics in Memory of Claude Itzykson", Saclay, June 5-7, 1996Making use of the exact solutions of the $N=2$ supersymmetric gauge theorieswe construct new classes of superconformal field theories (SCFTs) byfine-tuning the moduli parameters and bringing the theories to critical points.In the case of SCFTs constructed from pure gauge theories without matter $N=2$critical points seem to be classified according to the A-D-E classification asin the two-dimensional SCFTs.
