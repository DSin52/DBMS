Title: Effective Dilaton Potential in Linearized Gravity

Authors: HoSeong La

Comments: Latex, 11 pages

Considering the linearized gravity with matter fields, the effectivepotential of the ``conformal dilaton'' in the string frame is generatedsemiclassically by one-loop contribution of heavy matter fields. This in turngenerates a nontrivial potential for the physical dilaton in the Einstein framewith the trace of the graviton in the Einstein frame gauged away. The remainingmanifest local spacetime symmetry is only the volume preserving diffeomorphismsymmetry. The consistency of this procedure is examined and the possibility ofspontaneous diffeomorphism symmetry breaking is suggested.
