A short proof is given to the fact that the additional symmetries of the KPhierarchy defined by their action on pseudodifferential operators, according toFuchssteiner-Chen-Lee-Lin-Orlov-Shulman, coincide with those defined by theiraction on $\tau$-functions as Sato's B\"acklund transformations. Also a newsimple formula for the generator of additional symmetries is presented.
