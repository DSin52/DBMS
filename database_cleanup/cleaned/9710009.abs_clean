We consider the compactification of M theory on a light-like circle as alimit of a compactification on a small spatial circle boosted by a largeamount. Assuming that the compactification on a small spatial circle is weaklycoupled type IIA theory, we derive Susskind's conjecture that M theorycompactified on a light-like circle is given by the finite $N$ version of theMatrix model of Banks, Fischler, Shenker and Susskind. This point of viewprovides a uniform derivation of the Matrix model for M theory compactified ona transverse torus $T^p$ for $p=0,...,5$ and clarifies the difficulties forlarger values of $p$.
