We describe a scenario for inflation in the framework of non-critical stringtheory, which does not employ an inflaton field. There is an exponentialexpansion of the volume of the Universe, induced by enormous entropy productionin the early stages of cosmological evolution. This is associated with the lossof information carried by global string modes that cross the particle horizon.It is the same loss of information that induces irreversible time flow whentarget time is identified with the world-sheet Liouville mode. The resultingscenario for inflation is described by a string analogue of the Fokker-Planckequation that incorporates diffusion and dissipative effects. Cosmologicaldensity perturbations are naturally small.
