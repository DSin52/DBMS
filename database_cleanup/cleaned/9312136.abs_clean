Black hole spacetimes are semiclassically not static. For black holes whoselifetime is larger than the age of the universe we compute, in leading order,the power spectrum of deviations of the electromagnetic charge from it'saverage value, zero. Semiclassically the metric itself has a statisticalinterpretation and we compute a lowerbound on its variance. (1 figure, at endin encapsulated postscript - to locate use 'find figs')
