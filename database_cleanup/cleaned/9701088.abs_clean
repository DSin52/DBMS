Comments: 53 pages, 4 figures, Latex, uses epsf.sty. Lectures presented at 1996

ICTP Summer School, Trieste. (References added.)We review the properties of classical p-brane solutions to supergravitytheories, i.e. solutions that may be interpreted as Poincare-invarianthyperplanes in spacetime. Topics covered include the distinction betweenelementary/electric and solitonic/magnetic solutions, examples of singularityand global structure, relations between mass densities, charge densities andthe preservation of unbroken supersymmetry, diagonal and vertical Kaluza-Kleinreduction families, Scherk-Schwarz reduction and domain walls, and theclassification of multiplicities using duality symmetries.
