Noncommutative IR singularities and UV/IR mixing in relation with theGoldstone theorem for complex scalar field theory are investigated. Theclassical model has two coupling constants, $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$,associated to the two noncommutative extensions$\phi^*\star\phi\star\phi^*\star\phi$ and $\phi^*\star\phi^*\star\phi\star\phi$of the interaction term $|\phi|^4$ on commutative spacetime. It is shown thatthe symmetric phase is one-loop renormalizable for all $\lambda_1$ and$\lambda_2$ compatible with perturbation theory, whereas the broken phase isproved to exist at one loop only if $\lambda_2=0$, a condition required by theWard identities for global U(1) invariance. Explicit expressions for thenoncommutative IR singularities in the 1PI Green functions of both phases aregiven. They show that UV/IR duality does not hold for any of the phases andthat the broken phase is free of quadratic noncommutative IR singularities.More remarkably, the pion selfenergy does not have noncommutative IRsingularities at all, which proves essential to formulate the Goldstone theoremat one loop for all values of the spacetime noncommutativity parameter$\theta$.
