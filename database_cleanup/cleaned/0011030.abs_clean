In the early Universe matter can be described as a conformal invariantultra-relativistic perfect fluid, which does not contribute, on classicallevel, to the evolution of the isotropic and homogeneous metric. If we supposethat there is some desert in the particle spectrum just below the Planck mass,then the effect of conformal trace anomaly is dominating at the correspondingenergies. With some additional constraints on the particle content of theunderlying gauge model (which favor extended or supersymmetric versions of theStandard Model rather than the minimal one), one arrives at the stableinflation. We review the model and report about the calculation of thegravitational waves on the background of the anomaly-induced inflation. Theresult for the perturbation spectrum is close to the one for the conventionalinflaton model, and is in agreement with the existing Cobe data (see also[hep-th/0009197]).
