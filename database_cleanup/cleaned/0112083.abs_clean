We discuss the gravity dual description for a non-commutative Yang-Millstheory, which reduces to that on AdS_{5} x S_{5} in the commutative limit. Itis found that doubletons do not decouple in this dual gravity descriptionunless one takes the commutative limit. The decoupling of the doubletons inAdS_{5} space implies that the dual gauge theory has SU(N) gauge symmetry. Ourresult implies that this gravity description is dual to non-commutative U(N)gauge theory. It is compatible with the claim that U(1) and SU(N) gaugesymmetries can not separate in non-commutative U(N) gauge theory.
