Title: Cartan Calculus for Hopf Algebras and Quantum Groups

Comments: 15 pages (submitted to Comm. Math. Phys.)

A generalization of the differential geometry of forms and vector fields tothe case of quantum Lie algebras is given. In an abstract formulation thatincorporates many existing examples of differential geometry on quantum groups,we combine an exterior derivative, inner derivations, Lie derivatives, formsand functions all into one big algebra. In particular we find a generalizedCartan identity that holds on the whole quantum universal enveloping algebra ofthe left-invariant vector fields and implicit commutation relations for aleft-invariant basis of 1-forms.
