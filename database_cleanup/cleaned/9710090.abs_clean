We derive the spectral representations of QED 3-point functions and thenexplicitly calculate the 3-point spectral densities in hard thermal loopapproximation within the real time formalism. The Ward identities obeyed by theretarded and advanced 2- and 3-point functions are discussed. We compare ourresults with those for hot QCD .
