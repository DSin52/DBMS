The consistency condition of the Faddeev-Niemi ansatz for the gauge-fixedmassless SU(2) gauge field is discussed. The generality of the ansatz isdemonstrated by obtaining a sufficient condition for the existence of thethree-component field introduced by Faddeev and Niemi. It is also shown thatthe consistency conditions determine this three-component field as a functionalof two arbitrary functions. The consistency conditions corresponding to thePeriwal ansatz for the SU(N) gauge field with N larger than 2 are alsoobtained. It is shown that the gauge field obeying the Periwal ansatz mustsatisfy extra (N-1)(N-2)/2 conditions.
