Target space duality transformations are considered for bosonic sigma modelsand strings away from RG fixed points. A set of consistency conditions arederived, and are seen to be nontrivially satisfied at one-loop order forarbitrary running metric, antisymmetric tensor and dilaton backgrounds. Suchconditions are sufficiently stringent to enable an independent determination ofthe sigma model beta functions at this order.
