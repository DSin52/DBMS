This paper revisits the conundrum faced when one attempts to understand thedynamics of black hole formation and evaporation without abandoning unitaryevolution. Previous efforts to resolve this puzzle assume that informationescapes in corrections to the Hawking process, that an arbitrarily large amountof information is transmitted by a planckian energy or contained in aPlanck-sized remnant, or that the information is lost to another universe. Eachof these possibilities has serious difficulties. This paper considers anotherand mass depend on their information content. The existence of such objects issuggested by attempts to incorporate a Planck scale cutoff into physics. Theywould greatly alter the late stages of the evaporation process. The maindrawback of this scenario is apparent acausal behavior behind the horizon.
