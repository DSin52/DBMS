Tests of duality between heterotic strings on $K3\times T^2$ (restricted oncertain Narain moduli subspaces) and type IIA strings on K3-fiberedCalabi-Yau threefolds are attempted in the weak coupling regime on theheterotic side by identifying pertinent modular forms related to thecomputations of string threshold corrections. Concretely we discuss inparallel the three cases associated with Calabi-Yau manifolds
