A free fermionic string quantum model is constructed directly in thelight-cone variables in the range of dimensions $1<d<10$. It is shown thatafter the GSO projection this model is equivalent to the fermionic massivestring and to the non-critical Rammond-Neveu-Schwarz string. The spin spectrumof the model is analysed. For $d=4$ the character generating functions isobtained and the particle content of first few levels is numericallycalculated.
