We present exact solutions characterised by Bianchi-type I,II,III,V,VIfour-dimensional metric, space-independent dilaton, and vanishing torsionbackground, for the low energy string effective action with zero central chargedeficit. We show that, in such a context, curvature singularities cannot beavoided, except for the trivial case of flat spacetime and constant dilaton. Wealso provide a further example of the failure of the standard prescription forconnecting conformal string backgrounds through duality transformationsassociated to non-semisimple, non-Abelian isometry group.
