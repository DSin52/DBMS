Three explicit and equivalent representations for the monodromy of theconformal blocks in the SL(2,C)/SU(2) WZNW model are proposed in terms of thesame quantity computed in Liouville field theory. We show that there are twopossible fusion matrices in this model. This is due to the fact that theconformal blocks, being solutions to the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation, havea singularity when the SL(2,C) isospin coordinate x equals the worldsheetvariable z. We study the asymptotic behaviour of the conformal block when xgoes to z. The obtained relation inserted into a four point correlationfunction in the SL(2,C)/SU(2) WZNW model gives some expression in terms of twocorrelation functions in Liouville field theory.
