In this lecture we summarize some recent work on the understanding ofinstanton effects in string theories with 16 supersymmetries. In particular, weconsider F^4 couplings using the duality between the heterotic string on T^4and type IIA on K_3 at an orbifold point, as well as higher and lowerdimensional versions of this string-string duality. At the perturbative level anon-trivial test of the duality, requiring several miraculous identities, ispresented by matching a purely one-loop heterotic amplitude to a purelytree-level type II result. A wide variety of non-perturbative effects is shownto occur in this setting, including D-brane instantons for type IIA on K_3 xS^1 and NS5-brane instantons for type IIA on K_3 x T^2. Moreover, the analysisof the three-dimensional case, which possesses a non-perturbative SO(8,24,Z)U-duality, reveals the presence of Kaluza-Klein 5-brane instanton effects, bothon the heterotic and the type II side.
