Title: p-Brane Democracy

Comments: Some typos, and typographical problems, of previous revised version

corrected. 15 pp. Latex. This paper will appear in the proceedings of theMarch 95 PASCOS/Johns Hopkins conferenceThe ten or eleven dimensional origin of central charges in the N=4 or N=8standard Kaluza-Klein interpretation as momenta in compact dimensions, mostarise from $p$-form charges in the higher-dimensional supersymmetry algebrathat are carried by $p$-brane `solitons'. Although $p=1$ is singled out bysuperstring perturbation theory, U-duality of N=8 superstring compactificationsimplies a complete `$p$-brane democracy' of the full non-perturbative theory.An `optimally democratic' perturbation theory is defined to be one in which theperturbative spectrum includes all particles with zero magnetic charge. Whereasthe heterotic string is optimally democratic in this sense, the type IIsuperstrings are not, although the 11-dimensional supermembrane might be.
