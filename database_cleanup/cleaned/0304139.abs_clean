Title: On semiclassical approximation and spinning string vertex operators in

AdS_5 x S^5Comments: 35 pages, harvmac; v2

Following earlier work by Polyakov and Gubser, Klebanov and Polyakov, weattempt to clarify the structure of vertex operators representing string stateswhich have large (``semiclassical'') values of AdS energy (equal to 4-ddimension \Delta) and angular momentum J in S^5 or spin S in AdS_5. We commenton the meaning of semiclassical limit in the context of \alpha' perturbativeexpansion for the 2-d anomalous dimensions of the corresponding vertexoperators. We consider in detail the leading-order 1-loop renormalization ofthese operators in AdS_5 x S^5 sigma model (ignoring fermionic contributions).We find new examples of operators for which, as in the case considered inhep-th/0110196, the 1-loop anomalous dimension can be made small by tuningquantum numbers. We also comment on a possibility of deriving the semiclassicalrelation between \Delta and J or S from the marginality condition for thevertex operators, using a stationary phase approximation in the path integralexpression for their 2-point correlator on a complex plane.
