We find a universal SO(2) symmetry of a p-form Maxwell theory for both oddand even p. For odd p it corresponds to the duality rotations but for even p itdefines a new set of transformations which is not related to duality rotations.In both cases a symmetry group defines a subgroup of the O(2,1) group ofR-linear canonical transformations which has also a natural representation onthe level of quantization condition for p-brane dyons.
