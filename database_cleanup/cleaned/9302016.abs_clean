Wheeler-DeWitt equation is applied to $k > 0$ Friedmann Robertson Walkermetric with various types of matter. It is shown that if the Universe ends inthe matter dominated era (e.g., radiation or pressureless gas) with zerocosmological constant, then the resulting Wheeler-DeWitt equation describes abound state problem. As solutions of a non-degenerate bound state system, theeigen-wave functions are real (Hartle-Hawking) and the usual issue associatedwith the ambiguity in the boundary conditions for the wave functions isresolved. Furthermore, as a bound state problem, there exists a quantizationcondition that relates the curvature of the three space with the energy densityof the Universe. Incorporating a cosmological constant in the early Universe(inflation) is given as a natural explanation for the large quantum numberassociated with our Universe, which resulted from the quantization condition.It is also shown that if there is a cosmological constant $\Lambda > 0$ inour Universe that persists for all time, then the resulting Wheeler-DeWittequation describes a non-bound state system, regardless of the magnitude of thecosmological constant. As a consequence, the wave functions are in generalcomplex (Vilenkin) and the initial conditions for wave functions are a freeparameters not determined by the formalism.
