We study a functional field theory of membranes coupled to a rank--threetensor gauge potential. We show that gauge field radiative corrections lead tomembrane condensation which turns the gauge field into a {\it massive spin--0field}. This is the Coleman--Weinberg mechanism for {\it membranes}. An analogyis also drawn with a type--II superconductor. The ground state of the systemconsists of a two--phase medium in which the superconducting backgroundcondensate is ``pierced'' by four dimensional domains, or ``bags'', of nonsuperconducting vacuum. Bags are bounded by membranes whose physical thicknessis of the order of the inverse mass acquired by the gauge field.
