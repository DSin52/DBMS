An O($\tilde{d}$, $\tilde{d}$) transformation is given which relates ungaugedstring actions to the gauged ones for a large class of models discussedrecently by Giveon and Rocek. Interestingly, the transformation is backgroundindependent and has a unique matrix representation in a given space-timedimension.
