Comments: LaTex, 42 pages

Within the operator manifold approach (part I, hep-th/9812181) we derive theGell-Mann-Nishijima relation and flavour group, whereas the leptons areparticles with integer electric and leptonic charges and free of confinement,while quarks carry fractional electric and baryonic charges and imply theconfinement. We consider the unified electroweak interactions with small numberof free parameters, exploit the background of the local expanded symmetry$SU(2)\otimes U(1)$ and P-violation. The Weinberg mixing angle is shown to havefixed value at $30^{o}$. The Higgs bosons arise on an analogy of the Cooperpairs in superconductivity. Within the present microscopic approach we predictthe Kobayashi-Maskawa quark flavour mixing; the appearance of the CP-violationphase; derive the mass-spectrum of leptons and quarks, as well as otheremerging particles, and also some useful relations between their masses.
