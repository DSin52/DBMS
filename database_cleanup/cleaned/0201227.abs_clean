In this note we study warped compactifications of M-theory on manifolds ofSpin(7) holonomy in the presence of background 4-form flux. The explicit formof the superpotential can be given in terms of the self -dual Cayleycalibration on the Spin(7) manifold, in agreement with the general formulapropsed in hep-th/9911011.
