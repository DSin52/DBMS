A simple method for calculating the Casimir energy for a sphere is developedwhich is based on a direct mode summation and counter integration in a complexplane of eigenfrequencies. The method uses only classical equations determiningthe eigenfrequencies of the quantum field under consideration. Efficiency ofthis approach is demonstrated by calculation of the Casimir energy for aperfectly conducting spherical shell and for a massless scalar field obeyingthe Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on sphere. The possibility ofrationalizing the removal of divergences in this problem as a renormalizationof both the energy and the radius of the sphere is discussed.
