Whereas the usual understanding is that the entropy of only a non-extremalblack hole is given by the area of the horizon, there are derivations of anarea law for extremal black holes in some model calculations. It is explainedhere how such results can arise in an approach where one sums over topologiesand imposes the extremality condition after quantization.
