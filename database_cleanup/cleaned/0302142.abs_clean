Title: Gauge covariant heat kernel expansion at finite temperature

Authors: Stefan Leupold (Giessen U., Germany)

Comments: 12 pages, Revtex4, no figures

The heat kernel method is extended to the case of finite temperature. Specialemphasis is given to the study of gauge theories. Due to the compactness ofspace in the Euclidean time direction (inverse temperature) the field strengthcannot completely characterize the gauge fields. This is just a manifestationof the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The field strength has to be supplemented by thePolyakov loop. Only if the latter is taken into account one obtains gaugecovariant results for the generalized Seeley-DeWitt coefficients of the heatkernel expansion.
