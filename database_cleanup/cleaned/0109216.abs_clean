We present a general setup for junctions of semi-infinite 4-branes in $AdS_6$with the Gauss-Bonnet term. The 3-brane tension at the junction of 4-branes canbe nonzero. Using the brane junctions as the origin of the $Z_N$ discreterotation symmetry, we identify 3-brane tensions at three fixed points of theorbifold $T^2/Z_3$ in terms of the 4-brane tensions. As a result, the three3-brane tensions can be simultaneously positive, which enables us to explainthe mass hierarchy by taking one of two branes apart from the hidden brane asthe visible brane, and hence does not introduce a severe cosmological problem.
