We analyze the algebraic constraints of the generalized vielbein in SO(1,2) xSO(16) invariant d=11 supergravity, and show that the bosonic degrees offreedom of d=11 supergravity, which become the physical ones upon reduction tod=3, can be assembled into an E_8-valued vielbein already in eleven dimensions.A crucial role in the construction is played by the maximal nilpotent commutingsubalgebra of E_8, of dimension 36, suggesting a partial unification of generalcoordinate and tensor gauge transformations.
