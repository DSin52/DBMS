Two-dimensional sigma models are defined for the new manifestly spacetimesupersymmetric description of four-dimensional compactified superstrings. Theresulting target-superspace effective action is constrained by the way thesuperstring, the worldsheet curvature couples to the real part of a chiralmultiplet, and for Type II it couples to the real part of the sum of a vectormultiplet and a tensor hypermultiplet.For the Type II superstring, this contradicts the standard folklore thatonly a hypermultiplet counts string-loops, explains the peculiar dilatoncoupling of Ramond-Ramond fields, and allows the effective action to be easilywritten in N=2 $4D$ superspace. It also implies that vector multipletinteractions get no quantum corrections, while hypermultiplet interactions canonly get corrections if mirror symmetry is non-perturbatively broken.
