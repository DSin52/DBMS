We give a model-independent derivation of general intersecting rules fornon-extreme $p$-branes in arbitrary dimensions $D$. This is achieved bydirectly solving bosonic field equations for supergravity coupled to a dilatonand antisymmetric tensor fields with minimal ans\"{a}tze. We compare theresults with those in eleven-dimensional supergravity. Supersymmetry isrecovered in the extreme limit if the backgrounds are taken to be independent.Consistency with non-supersymmetric solutions is also discussed. Finally thegeneral formulae for the ADM mass, entropy and Hawking temperature are given.
