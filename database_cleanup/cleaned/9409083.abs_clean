String theories should reduce to ordinary four-dimensional field theories atlow energies. Yet the formulation of the two are so different that such aconnection, if it exists, is not immediately obvious. With the Schwingerproper-time representation, and the spinor helicity technique, it has beenshown that field theories can indeed be written in a string-like manner, thusresulting in simplifications in practical calculations, and providing novelinsights into gauge and gravitational theories. This paper continues the studyof string organization of field theories by focusing on the question of localduality. It is shown that a single expression for the sum of many diagrams canindeed be written for QED, thereby simulating the duality property in strings.The relation between a single diagram and the dual sum is somewhat analogous tothe relation between a old- fashioned perturbation diagram and a Feynmandiagram. Dual expressions are particularly significant for gauge theoriesbecause they are gauge invariant while expressions for single diagrams are not.
