Chiral symmetry breaking in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in a constantmagnetic field is studied in spacetimes of dimension D > 4. It is shown that aconstant magnetic field can be characterized by [(D-1)/2] parameters. For themaximal number of nonzero field parameters, we show that there is an effectivereduction of the spacetime dimension for fermions in the infrared region D$\to$ 1 + 1 for even-dimensional spacetimes and D $\to$ 0 + 1 forodd-dimensional spacetimes. Explicit solutions of the gap equation confirm ourconclusions.
