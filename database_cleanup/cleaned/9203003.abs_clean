We compute the $S$-matrix of the Tricritical Ising Model perturbed by thesubleading magnetic operator using Smirnov's RSOS reduction of theIzergin-Korepin model. We discuss some features of the scattering theory weobtain, in particular a non trivial implementation of crossing-symmetry,interesting connections between the asymptotic behaviour of the amplitudes, thepossibility of introducing generalized statistics, and the monodromy propertiesof the OPE of the unperturbed Conformal Field Theory.
