In the framework of the $2(2S+1)$-- theory of Joos-Weinberg for masslessparticles, the dynamical invariants have been derived from the Lagrangiandensity which is considered to be a 4-- vector. A l\'a Majorana interpretationof the 6-- component spinors, the field operators of $S=1$ particles, as theleft-- and right--circularly polarized radiation, leads us to the conservedquantities which are analogous to ones obtained by Lipkin and Sudbery. Thescalar Lagrangian of Joos-Weinberg theory is shown to be equivalent to theLagrangian of a free massless field, introduced by Hayashi. As a consequence ofa new "gauge" invariance this skew-symmetric field describes physical particleswith the longitudinal components only.
