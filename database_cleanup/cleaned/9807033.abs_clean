The one-instanton contributions to various correlation functions ofsupercurrents in four-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills theoryare evaluated to the lowest order in perturbation theory.Expressions of thesame form are obtained from the leading effects of a single D-instantonextracted from the IIB superstring effective action around the AdS5*S5background. This is in line with the suggested AdS/Yang-Mills correspondence.The relation between Yang--Mills instantons and D-instantons is furtherconfirmed by the explicit form of the classical D-instanton solution in theAdS5*S5 background and its associated supermultiplet of zero modes.Speculations are made concerning instanton effects in the large-N_c limit ofthe SU(N_c) Yang-Mills theory.
