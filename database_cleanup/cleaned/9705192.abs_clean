We derive the wave equation for a minimally coupled scalar field in thebackground of a general rotating five-dimensional black hole. It is written ina form that involves two types of thermodynamic variables, defined at the innerand outer event horizon, respectively. We model the microscopic structure as aneffective string theory, with the thermodynamic properties of the left andright moving excitations related to those of the horizons. Previously knownsolutions to the wave equation are generalized to the rotating case, and theirregime of validity is sharpened. We calculate the greybody factors andinterpret the resulting Hawking emission spectrum microscopically in severallimits. We find a U-duality invariant expression for the effective stringlength that does not assume a hierarchy between the charges. It accounts forthe universal low-energy absorption cross-section in the general non-extremalcase.
