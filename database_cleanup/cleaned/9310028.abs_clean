Title: Resummed Effective Action in Inhomogeneous External Field at Zero and

Finite TemperatureAuthors: A. Leonidov

Comments: BI-TP 93/53, Plain LaTeX

The two ways of resumming the efffective action for the massless testparticles in inhomogeneous external field at zero and finite temperatureproviding the infrared finite answer are discussed. The case of the massivetest particles having a mass which is parametrically small with respect to ascale set by the inhomogeneous external field is briefly considered.
