To entirely determine the resulting functions of one-loop integrals it isnecessary to find the correct analytic continuation to all relevant kinematicalregions. We argue that this continuation procedure may be performed in ageneral and mathematical accurate way by using the ${\cal R}$ function notationof these integrals. The two- and three-point cases are discussed explicitly inthis manner.
