Title: Unique Deformation of Local Quantum Field Theory Resulting in

Divergence-free AmplitudesComments: 7 pages

An essentially unique deformation of the product of quantum fields at thesame spacetime point is obtained. It is proposed to replace local quantum fieldtheory with another structure which uses a *-product. The resulting theorycontains a fundamental length and is free from divergences. This provides thethird deformation suggested by Faddeev.
