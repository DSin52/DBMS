We consider domain walls embedded in curved backgrounds as an approximationfor braneworld scenarios. We give a large class of new exact solutions,exhausting the possibilities for describing one and two walls for the caseswhere the curvature of both the bulk and the wall is locally constant. In thecase of two walls, we find solutions where each wall has positive tension. Aninteresting property of these solutions is that the curvature of the walls canbe much smaller than the tension, leading to a significant cancellation of theeffective cosmological constant, which however is still much larger than theobservational limits. We further discuss some aspects of inflation in modelsbased on wall solutions.
