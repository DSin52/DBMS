We study, through path-integral methods, an extension of the massive Thirringmodel in which the interaction between currents is non-local. By examining themass-expansion of the partition function we show that this non-local massiveThirring model is equivalent to a certain non-local extension of thesine-Gordon theory. Thus, we establish a non-local generalization of the famousColeman's equivalence. We also discuss some possible applications of thisresult in the context of one-dimensional strongly correlated systems andfinite-size Quantum Field Theories.
