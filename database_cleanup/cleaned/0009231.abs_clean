An equation for the quantum average of the gauge invariant Wilson loop innon-commutative Yang-Mills theory with gauge group U(N) is obtained. In the 'tHooft limit, the equation reduces to the loop equation of ordinary Yang-Millstheory. At finite $N$, the equation involves the quantum averages of theadditional gauge invariant observables of the non-commutative theory associatedwith open contours in space-time. We also derive equations for correlators ofseveral gauge invariant (open or closed) Wilson lines. Finally, we discuss aperturbative check of our results.
