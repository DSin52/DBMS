Title: A dual description of decoherence in de Sitter space

Comments: 11 pages, latex; a reference added

Decoherence associated with super-Hubble modes in de Sitter space may have adual description, in which it is attributed to interaction of sub-Hubble modeswith an ``environment'' residing just inside the observer's horizon. We presenta version of such description, together with some consistency checks, which itis shown to pass.
