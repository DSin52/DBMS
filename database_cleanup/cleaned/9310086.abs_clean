denjoe@stp.dias.ie, preprint numbers THU-93/18, DIAS-STP-93-18Series for the Wilson functions of an ``environmentally friendly''renormalization group are computed to two loops, for an $O(N)$ vector model, interms of the ``floating coupling'', and resummed by the Pad\'e method to yieldcrossover exponents for finite size and quantum systems. The resultingeffective exponents obey all scaling laws, including hyperscaling in terms ofan effective dimensionality, ${d\ef}=4-\gl$, which represents the crossover inthe leading irrelevant operator, and are in excellent agreement with knownresults.
