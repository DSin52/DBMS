In a recent work, Unruh showed that Hawking radiation is unaffected by atruncation of free field theory at the Planck scale. His analysis was performednumerically and based on a hydrodynamical model. In this work, by analyticalmethods, the mathematical and physical origin of Unruh's result is revealed. Analternative truncation scheme which may be more appropriate for black holephysics is proposed and analyzed. In both schemes the thermal Hawking radiationremains unaffected even though transplanckian energies no longer appear. Theuniversality of this result is explained by working in momentum space. In thatrepresentation, in the presence of a horizon, the d'Alembertian equationbecomes a singular first order equation. In addition, the boundary conditionscorresponding to vacuum before the black hole formed are that the in--modescontain positive momenta only. Both properties remain valid when the spectrumis truncated and they suffice to obtain Hawking radiation.
