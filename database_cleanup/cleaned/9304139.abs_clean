The connection between supersymmetric quantum mechanics and the Korteweg- deVries (KdV) equation is discussed, with particular emphasis on the KdVconservation laws. It is shown that supersymmetric quantum mechanics aids inthe derivation of the conservation laws, and gives some insight into the Miuratransformation that converts the KdV equation into the modified KdV equation.The construction of the $\tau$-function by means of supersymmetric quantummechanics is discussed.
