Title: One loop corrections to coupling constants in String Effective Field

TheoryAuthors: M. Petropoulos

In the framework of a recently proposed method for computing exactly stringamplitudes regularized in the infra-red, I determine the one-loop correlatorsfor auxiliary fields in the symmetric $Z_2\times Z_2$ orbifold model. The$D$-field correlation function turns out to give the one-loop corrections forthe gauge couplings, which amounts to a string-theory supersymmetry Wardidentity. The two-point function for uncharged $F$ fields leads to the one-looprenormalization of the moduli K\"ahler metric, and eventually to thecorrections for the Yukawa couplings.
