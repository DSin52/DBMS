Karpacz, Poland, February 1992We describe the quasitriangular structure (universal $R$-matrix) on thenon-standard quantum group $U_q(H_1,H_2,X^\pm)$ associated to theAlexander-Conway matrix solution of the Yang-Baxter equation. We show that thisHopf algebra is connected with the super-Hopf algebra $U_qgl(1|1)$ by a generalprocess of superization.
