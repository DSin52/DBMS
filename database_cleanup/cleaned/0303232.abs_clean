We construct new intersecting S-brane solutions in 11-dimensionalsupergravity which do not have supersymmetric analogs. They are obtained byletting brane charges to be proportional to each other. Solutions fall into twocategories with respect to whether there is a non-diagonal term to be cancelledin the field equations or not. In each case we show that they can beconstructed by using a simple set of rules which is similar to the harmonicfunction rule of the usual static p-branes. Furthermore, we study anintersection where the Chern-Simons term makes a non-zero contribution to thefield equations. We show that this configuration has a singularity like otherS-branes.
