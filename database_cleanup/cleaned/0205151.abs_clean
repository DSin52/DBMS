We calculate the exact eigenvalues of the adjoint scalar fields in themassive vacua of N=1* SUSY Yang-Mills with gauge group SU(N). This provides afield theory prediction for the distribution of D3 brane charge in the AdSdual. We verify the proposal of Polchinski and Strassler that the D3-brane'slie on a fuzzy sphere in the supergravity limit and determine the correctionsto this distribution due to worldsheet and quantum effects. The calculationalso provides several new results concerning the equilibrium configurations ofthe N-body Calogero-Moser Hamiltonian.
