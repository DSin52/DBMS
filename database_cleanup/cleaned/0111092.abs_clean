We study gauge invariant operators of open string field theory and find aprecise correspondence with on-shell closed strings. We provide a detailedproof of the gauge invariance of the operators and a heuristic interpretationof their correlation functions in terms of on-shell scattering amplitudes ofclosed strings. We also comment on the implications of these operators tovacuum string field theory.
