A flow invariant in quantum field theory is a quantity that does not dependon the flow connecting the UV and IR conformal fixed points. We study the flowinvariance of the most general sum rule with correlators of the trace Theta ofthe stress tensor. In even (four and six) dimensions we recover the resultsknown from the gravitational embedding. We derive the sum rules for the traceanomalies a and a' in six dimensions. In three dimensions, where thegravitational embedding is more difficult to use, we find a non-trivialvanishing relation for the flow integrals of the three- and four-pointfunctions of Theta. Within a class of sum rules containing finitely many terms,we do not find a non-vanishing flow invariant of type a in odd dimensions. Wecomment on the implications of our results.
