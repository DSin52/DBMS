We give necessary conditions for the existence of perturbative heterotic andcommon sector type II string warped compactifications preserving four and eightsupersymmetries to four spacetime dimensions, respectively. In particular, wefind that the only compactifications of heterotic string with the spinconnection embedded in the gauge connection and type II strings are those onCalabi-Yau manifolds with constant dilaton. We obtain similar results forcompactifications to six and to two dimensions.
