We give a microscopic explanation for the recently observed equivalence amongthermodynamics of supergravity solutions for Dp-branes with or without NSB-field and for D(p-2)-branes with vanishing B-field and two delocalizedtransverse directions by showing that these D-brane configurations are relatedto one another through T-duality transformations. This result also gives anevidence for the equivalence among the noncommutative and the ordinaryYang-Mills theories corresponding to the decoupling limits of the worldvolumetheories of such D-brane configurations.
