In a space-time with torsion, the action for the gravitational field can beextended with a parity-violating piece. We show how to obtain such a piece fromgeometry itself, by suitably modifying the affine connection so as to include apseudo-tensorial part. A consistent method is thus suggested for incorporatingparity-violation in the Lagrangians of all matter fields with spin in aspace-time background with torsion.
