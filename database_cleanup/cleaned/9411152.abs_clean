We consider gauged Wess-Zumino models based on the non compact group$SU(2,1)$. It is shown that by vector gauging the maximal compact subgroup$U(2)$ the resulting backgrounds obey the gravity-dilaton one loop stringvacuum equations of motion in four dimensional euclidean space. The torsionlesssolution is then interpreted as a pseudo-instanton of the $d=4$ Liouvilletheory coupled to gravity. The presence of a traslational isometry in the modelallows to get another string vacuum backgrounds by using target duality that weidentify with those corresponding to the axial gauging. We also compute theexact backgrounds. Depending on the value of $k$, they may be interpreted asinstantons connecting a highly singular big bang like universe with a staticsingular or regular black plane geometry.
