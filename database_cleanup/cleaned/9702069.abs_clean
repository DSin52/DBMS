Title: Algebraic versus Topologic Anomalies

Authors: V. Aldaya, M. Calixto and J. Guerrero

Comments: 10 pages, Latex. Talk given at the Conference on Differential

Geometry and Applications, Brno, Czech Republic, 1995Within the frame of a Group Approach to Quantization anomalies arise in aquite natural way. We present in this talk an analysis of the basicobstructions that can be found when we try to translate symmetries of theand topologic according to the local or global character of the obstruction. Wepresent here one explicit example of each.
