Feynman's path integrals provide a hidden variable description of quantummechanics (and quantum field theories). The expectation values defined throughpath integrals obey Bell's inequalities in Euclidean time, but not in Minkowskitime. This observation allows us to pinpoint the origin of violation of Bell'sinequalities in quantum mechanics. % This article is not precise enough formathematicians and not vague % enough for philosophers, but it should beinteresting for physicists. % Contributed to the XVI International Symposium onLepton-Photon % Interactions, Cornell University, August 10-15, 1993.
