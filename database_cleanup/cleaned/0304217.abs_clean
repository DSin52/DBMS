We argue that the N=1 higher-spin theory on AdS4 is holographically dual tothe N=1 supersymmetric critical O(N) vector model in three dimensions. Thisappears to be a special form of the AdS/CFT correspondence in which bothregular and irregular bulk modes have similar roles and their interplay leadssimultaneously to both the free and the interacting phases of the boundarytheory. We study various boundary conditions that correspond to boundarydeformations connecting, for large-N, the free and interacting boundarytheories. We point out the importance of parity in this holography andelucidate the Higgs mechanism responsible for the breaking of higher-spinsymmetry for subleading N.
