Titled 'Can QFT be UV finite as well as effective?' at the XIth InternationalConference, 'Problems of quantum field theory' held in JINR, Dubna, Russia,July 13-17, 1998A new attempt is demonstrated that QFTs can be UV finite if they are viewedas the low energy effective theories of a fundamental underlying theory (thatis complete and well-defined in all respects) according to the modern standardpoint of view. This approach works for any interaction model and space-timedimension. It is much simpler in principle and in technology comparing to anyknown renormalization program.Unlike the known renormalization methods, theimportance of the procedure for defining the ambiguities (corresponding to thechoice of the renormalization conditions in the conventional program) is fullyappreciated in the new approach. It is shown that the high energy theory(s) orthe underlying theory(s) in fact 'stipulates (stipulate)' the low energy andeffective ones through these definitions within our approach while all theconventional methods miss this important point. Some simple but importantnonperturbative examples are discussed to show the power and plausibility ofthe new approach. Other related issues (especially the IR problem and theimplication of our new approach for the canonical quantization procedure) arebriefly touched.
