Authors: H.M. Fried, Y. Gabellini

Comments: 23 pages, 5 figures

A physically reasonable model is introduced in order to estimate, in afunctional way, the vast number of distinct graphs which are conventionallyneglected in eikonal scattering models that lead to total cross sectionsincreasing with energy in the form of the Froissart bound.
