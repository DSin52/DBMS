The form of the most general orbifold breaking of gauge, global andsupersymmetries with a single extra dimension is given. In certain theories theHiggs boson mass is ultraviolet finite due to an unbroken local supersymmetry,\times U(1) theory with 1 bulk Higgs hypermultiplet, a 2 parameter SU(3) \timesSU(2) \times U(1) theory with 2 bulk Higgs hypermultiplets, and a 2 parameterSU(5) \to SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1) theory with 2 bulk Higgshypermultiplets, and demonstrate that these theories are unique. We compute theHiggs mass and compactification scale in the SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)theory with 1 bulk Higgs hypermultiplet.
