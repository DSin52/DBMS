Title: D-braneworld cosmology

Authors: Tetsuya Shiromizu, Takashi Torii, Tomoko Uesugi

Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures

We discuss D-braneworld cosmology, that is, the brane is described by theBorn-Infeld action. Compared with the usual Randall-Sundrum braneworldcosmology where the brane action is the Nambu-Goto one, we can see some drasticaccelerating phase (ii)the closed universe may avoid the initial singularity.We also briefly address the dynamics of the cosmology in the open stringmetric, which might be favorer than the induced metric from the view point ofthe D-brane.
