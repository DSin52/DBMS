For a class of system, the potential of whose Bosonic Hamiltonian has aFourier representation in the sense of tempered distributions, we calculate theGaussian effective potential within the framework of functional integralformalism. We show that the Coleman's normal-ordering prescription can beformally generalized to the functional integral formalism.
