The conductivity of a finite temperature 1+1 dimensional fermion gasdescribed by the massive Thirring model is shown to be related to the retardedpropagator of the dual boson sine-Gordon model. Duality provides a naturalresummation which resolves infra-red problems, and the boson propagator can berelated to the fermion gas at non-zero temperature and chemical potential ordensity. In addition, at high temperatures, we can apply a dimensionalreduction technique to find resummed closed expressions for the bosonself-energy and relate them to the fermion conductivity. Particular attentionis paid to the discussion of analytic continuation. The resummation implicit induality provides a powerful alternative to the standard diagrammatic evaluationof transport coefficients at finite temperature.
