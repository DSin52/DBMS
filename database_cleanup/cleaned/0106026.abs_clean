Title: Supersymmetric M3-branes and G_2 Manifolds

Authors: M. Cvetic, G.W. Gibbons, H. Lu and C.N. Pope

Comments: Latex, 29 pages. This corrects a previous version in which it was

claimed that the M3-brane solutions were pseudo-supersymmetric rather thansupersymmetricJournal-ref: Nucl.Phys. B620 (2002) 3-28

We obtain a generalisation of the original complete Ricci-flat metric of G_2holonomy on R^4\times S^3 to a family with a non-trivial parameter \lambda. Forgeneric \lambda the solution is singular, but it is regular when\lambda={-1,0,+1}. The case \lambda=0 corresponds to the original G_2 metric,and \lambda ={-1,1} are related to this by an S_3 automorphism of the SU(2)^3isometry group that acts on the S^3\times S^3 principal orbits. We thenconstruct explicit supersymmetric M3-brane solutions in D=11 supergravity,where the transverse space is a deformation of this class of G_2 metrics. Theseare solutions of a system of first-order differential equations coming from asuperpotential. We also find M3-branes in the deformed backgrounds of newG_2-holonomy metrics that include one found by A. Brandhuber, J. Gomis, S.Gubser and S. Gukov, and show that they also are supersymmetric.
