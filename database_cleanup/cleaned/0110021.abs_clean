We find considerable evidence supporting the conjecture that four-dimensionalQuantum Einstein Gravity is ``asymptotically safe'' in Weinberg's sense. Thiswould mean that the theory is likely to be nonperturbatively renormalizable andthus could be considered a fundamental (rather than merely effective) theorywhich is mathematically consistent and predictive down to arbitrarily smalllength scales. For a truncated version of the exact flow equation of theeffective average action we establish the existence of a non-Gaussianrenormalization group fixed point which is suitable for the construction of anonperturbative infinite cutoff-limit. The truncation ansatz includes theEinstein-Hilbert action and a higher derivative term.
