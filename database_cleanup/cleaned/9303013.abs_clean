We review recent results concerning the representation of conformal fieldtheory characters in terms of fermionic quasi-particle excitations, anddescribe in detail their construction in the case of the integrable three-statePotts chain. These fermionic representations are $q$-series which aregeneralizations of the sums occurring in the Rogers-Ramanujan identities.
