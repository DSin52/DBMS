We introduce a topological field theory with a Bogomol'nyi structurepermitting BPS electric, magnetic and dyonic monopoles. From the generalarguments given by Montonen and Olive the particle spectrum and mass comparefavourably with that of the intermediate vector bosons. In most, if not in all,of its essential features the topological field theory introduced here providesan example of a dual field theory, the existence of which was conjectured byMontonen and Olive.
