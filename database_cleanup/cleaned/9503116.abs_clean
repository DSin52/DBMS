Journal-ref: Phys. Lett. B357 (1995) 12

We have examined a modified dilaton gravity whose action is separable into thekinetic and the cosmological terms for the sake of the quantization. The blackhole solutions survive even in the quantized theory, but the ADM mass of thestatic solution is unbounded from below. Quantum gravitational effect on theinteracting matter field and the string susceptibility of the dilaton gravityare also examined.
