Starting from a self-dual $SU(\infty)$ Yang-Mills theory in $(2+2)$dimensions, the Plebanski second heavenly equation is obtained after a suitabledimensional reduction. The self-dual gravitational background is the cotangentspace of the internal two-dimensional Riemannian surface required in theformulation of $SU(\infty)$ Yang-Mills theory. A subsequent dimensionalreduction leads to the KP equation in $(1+2)$ dimensions after the relationshipfrom the Plebanski second heavenly function, $\Omega$, to the KP function, $u$,is obtained. Also a complexified KP equation is found when a differentdimensional reduction scheme is performed . Such relationship between $\Omega$and $u$ is based on the correspondence between the $SL(2,R)$ self-dualityconditions in $(3+3)$ dimensions of Das, Khviengia, Sezgin (DKS) and the onesof $SU(\infty)$ in $(2+2)$ dimensions . The generalization to theSupersymmetric KP equation should be straightforward by extending theconstruction of the bosonic case to the previous Super-Plebanski equation,found by us in [1], yielding self-dual supergravity backgrounds in terms of thelight-cone chiral superfield, $\Theta$, which is the supersymmetric analog of$\Omega$. The most important consequence of this Plebanski-KP correspondence isthat $W$ gravity can be seen as the gauge theory of $\phi$-diffeomorphisms inthe space of dimensionally-reduced $D=2+2,~SU^*(\infty)$ Yang-Mills instantons.These $\phi$ diffeomorphisms preserve a volume-three-form and are, precisely,the ones which provide the Plebanski-KP correspondence.
