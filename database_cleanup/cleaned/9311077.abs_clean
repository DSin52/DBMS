We review briefly the thermodynamical interpretation of black hole physicsand discuss the problems and inconsistencies in this approach. We provide analternative interpretation of black holes as quantum objects and investigatethe statistical mechanics of a gas of such objects in the microcanonicalensemble. We argue that the theory of black holes has the conformal propertiesof duality and satisfaction of the statistical bootstrap condition. We show inthe context of mean field theory that the thermal vacuum is the false vacuumfor a black hole and define a microcanonical vacuum which leads to a numberdensity characteristic of pure states for the Hawking radiation.
