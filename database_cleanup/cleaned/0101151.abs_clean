We define generalised chiral vertex operators covariant under the Ocneanu``double triangle algebra'' {\cal A}, a novel quantum symmetry intrinsic to agiven rational 2-d conformal field theory. This provides a chiral approach,which, unlike the conventional one, makes explicit various algebraic structuresencountered previously in the study of these theories and of the associatedcritical lattice models, and thus allows their unified treatment. Thetriangular Ocneanu cells, the 3j-symbols of the weak Hopf algebra {\cal A},reappear in several guises. With {\cal A} and its dual algebra {hat A} oneassociates a pair of graphs, G and {\tilde G}. While G are known to encodecomplete sets of conformal boundary states, the Ocneanu graphs {\tilde G}classify twisted torus partition functions. The fusion algebra of the twistoperators provides the data determining {\hat A}. The study of bulk fieldcorrelators in the presence of twists reveals that the Ocneanu graph quantumsymmetry gives also an information on the field operator algebra.
