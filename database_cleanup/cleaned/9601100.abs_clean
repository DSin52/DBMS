Title: Poincare Algebra in Chiral QCD_2

Comments: LATEX file, 10 pp

Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B372 (1996) 283-288

For the chiral QCD_2 on a cylinder, we give a construction of a quantumtheory consistent with anomaly. We construct the algebra of the Poincaregenerators and show that it differs from the Poincare one.
