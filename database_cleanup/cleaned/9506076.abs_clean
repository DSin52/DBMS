This paper is a sequel to one in which we examined the affine symmetryalgebras of arbitrary classical principal chiral models and symmetric spacemodels in two dimensions. It examines the extension of those results in thepresence of gravity. The main result is that even though the symmetrytransformations of the fields depend on the gravitational background, thesymmetry algebras of these classical theories are completely unchanged by thepresence of arbitrary gravitational backgrounds. On the other hand, we areunable to generalize the Virasoro symmetries of the flat-space theories totheories with gravity.
