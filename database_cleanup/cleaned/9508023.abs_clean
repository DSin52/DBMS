Title: Total Divergences in Hamiltonian Formalism of Field Theory

Comments: 5 pages, LaTeX, no figures

In this report it is proposed to generalize the definition of Poissonbrackets in order to treat spatial integrals of divergences as Hamiltonianswhich generate a kind of Hamiltonian equations on the boundary. NonlinearSchrodinger equation is used as an illustrative example.
