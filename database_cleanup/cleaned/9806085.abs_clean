We show that a simple OSp(1/2) worldline gauge theory in 0-brane phase space(X,P), with spin degrees of freedom, formulated for a d+2 dimensional spacetimewith two times X^0,, X^0', unifies many physical systems which ordinarily aredescribed by a 1-time formulation. Different systems of 1-time physics emergeby choosing gauges that embed ordinary time in d+2 dimensions in differentways. The embeddings have different topology and geometry for the choice oftime among the d+2 dimensions. Thus, 2-time physics unifies an infinite numberof 1-time physical interacting systems, and establishes a kind of duality amongthem. One manifestation of the two times is that all of these physical systemshave the same quantum Hilbert space in the form of a unique representation ofSO(d,2) with the same Casimir eigenvalues. By changing the number n of spinningdegrees of freedom the gauge group changes to OSp(n/2). Then the eigenvalue ofthe Casimirs of SO(d,2) depend on n and then the content of the 1-time physicalsystems that are unified in the same representation depend on n. The models westudy raise new questions about the nature of spacetime.
