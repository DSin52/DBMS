A simple description of the KP hierarchy and its multi-hamiltonian structureis given in terms of two Bose currents. A deformation scheme connecting variousW-infinity algebras and relation between two fundamental nonlinear structuresare discussed. Properties of Fa\'a di Bruno polynomials are extensivelyexplored in this construction. Applications of our method are given for theConformal Affine Toda model, WZNW models and discrete KP approach to Todalattice chain.
