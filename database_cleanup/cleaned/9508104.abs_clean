The first quantum corrections to the free energy for massive fields in$D$-dimensional space-times of the form $\R\times\R^+\times\M^{N-1}$, where$D=N+1$ and $\M^{N-1}$ is a constant curvature manifold, is investigated bymeans of the $\zeta$-function regularization. It is suggested that the natureof the divergences, which are present in the thermodynamical quantities, mightbe better understood making use of the conformal related optical metric andassociated techniques. The general form of the horizon divercences of the freeenergy is obtained as a function of free energy densities of fields havingnegative square masses (absence of the gap in the Laplace operator spectrum) onultrastatic manifolds with hyperbolic spatial section $H^{N-2n}$ and of theSeeley-DeWitt coefficients of the Laplace operator on the manifold $\M^{N-1}$.Furthermore, recurrence relations are found relating higher and lowerdimensions. The cases of Rindler space, where $\M^{N-1}=\R^{N-1}$ and verymassive $D$-dimensional black holes, where $\M^{N-1}=S^{N-1}$ are treated asexamples. The renormalization of the internal energy is also discussed.
