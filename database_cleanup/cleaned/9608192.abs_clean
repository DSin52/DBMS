We introduce the chemical potential in a system of massless fermions in a bagby impossing boundary conditions in the Euclidean time direction. We expressthe fermionic mean number in terms of a functional trace involving the Green'sfunction of the boundary value problem, which we study analytically. Numericalevaluations are made, and an application to a simple hadron model is discussed.
