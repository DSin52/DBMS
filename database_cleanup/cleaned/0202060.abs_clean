We consider braneworld scenarios including the leading correction to theEinstein-Hilbert action suggested by superstring theory, the Gauss-Bonnet term.We obtain and study the complete set of equations governing the cosmologicaldynamics. We find they have the same form as those in Randall-Sundrum scenariosbut with time-varying four-dimensional gravitational and cosmologicalconstants. Studying the bulk geometry we show that this variation is producedby bulk curvature terms parameterized by the mass of a black hole. Finally, weshow there is a coupling between these curvature terms and matter that can berelevant for early universe cosmology.
