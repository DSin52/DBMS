Compactifications of M-theory on manifolds with reduced holonomy arise as thelocal eleven-dimensional description of D6-branes wrapped on supersymmetriccycles in manifolds of lower dimension with a different holonomy group.Whenever the isometry group SU(2) is present, eight-dimensional gaugedsupergravity is a natural arena for such investigations. In this paper we usethis approach and review the eleven dimensional description of D6-braneswrapped on coassociative 4-cycles, on deformed 3-cycles inside Calabi-Yauthreefolds and on Kahler 4-cycles.
