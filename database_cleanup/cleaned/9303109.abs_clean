We analyze actions for 2D supergravities induced by chiral conformalsupermatter. The latter may be thought as described at the classical level bysuperspace actions invariant under super-reparametrization, super-Weyl andsuper-Lorentz transformations. Upon quantization various anomalies appear whichcharacterize the non-trivial induced actions for the supergravitational sector.We derive these induced actions using a chiral boson to represent the chiralinducing matter. We show that they can be defined in a super-reparametrizationinvariant way, but with super-Weyl and super-Lorentz anomalies. We consider thecase of $(1,0)$ and $(1,1)$ supergravities by working in their respectivesuperspace formulations and investigate their quantization in the conformalgauge. The actions we consider arise naturally in off-critical heterotic andspinning strings. In the conformal gauge, they correspond to chiral extensionsof the super-Liouville theory.
