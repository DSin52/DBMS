In the light of $\phi $--mapping method and topological current theory, thetopological structure of the vortex state in TDGL model and the topologicalquantization of the vortex topological charges are investigated. It is pointedout that the topological charges of the vortices in TDGL model are described bythe Winding numbers of $\phi $--mapping which are determined in terms of theHopf indices and the Brouwer degrees of $\phi $--mapping.
