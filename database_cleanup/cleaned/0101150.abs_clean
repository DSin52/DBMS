International Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics (July 31 -August 5, 2000, Dubna, Russia)Solvable and Integrable SystemsTopological Chern-Simons (CS) and BF theories and their holomorphic analoguesare discussed in terms of de Rham and Dolbeault cohomologies. We show that Cechcohomology provides another useful description of the above topological andholomorphic field theories. In particular, all hidden (nonlocal) symmetries ofnon-Abelian CS and BF theories can be most clearly seen in the Cech approach.We consider multidimensional Manin-Ward integrable systems and describe theirconnections with holomorphic BF theories. Dressing symmetries of these genericintegrable systems are briefly discussed.
