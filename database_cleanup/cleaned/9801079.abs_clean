The general solution of a 7D analogue of the 3D Euler top equation is shownto be given by an integration over a Riemann surface with genus 9. The 7D modelis derived from the 8D $Spin(7)$ invariant self-dual Yang-Mills equationdepending only upon one variable and is regarded as a model describingself-dual membrane instantons. Several integrable reductions of the 7D top tolower target space dimensions are discussed and one of them gives 6, 5, 4Ddescendants and the 3D Euler top associated with Riemann surfaces with genus 6,5, 2 and 1, respectively.
