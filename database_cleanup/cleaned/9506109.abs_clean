We consider a space-time invariant duality symmetric action for a freeMaxwell field and an $SL(2,{\bf R})\times SO(6,22)$ invariant effective actiondescribing a low-energy bosonic sector of the heterotic string compactified ona six-dimensional torus. The manifest Lorentz and general coordinate invariantformulation of the models is achieved by coupling dual gauge fields to anauxiliary vector field from an axionic sector of the theory.
