It is shown that purely bosonic field theories can have configurations withhalf-integral angular momentum even when the topological magnetic charge of theconfiguration vanishes. This result is applicable whenever there is anon-Abelian gauge theory with particles that transform in the fundamentalrepresentation of the non-Abelian symmetry group.
