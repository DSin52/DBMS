Based on the idea of quantum groups and paragrassmann variables, we presentageneralization of supersymmetric classical mechanics with a deformationparameter $q= \exp{\frac{2 \pi i}{k}}$ dealing with the $k =3$ case. Thecoordinates of the $q$-superspace are a commuting parameter $t$ and aparagrassmann variable $\theta$, where $% \theta^3 = 0$. The generator andcovariant derivative are obtained, as well as the action for some possiblesuperfields.
