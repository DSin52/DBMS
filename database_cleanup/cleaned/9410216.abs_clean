A class of two dimensional conformal field theories is known to correspond tothree dimensional Chern-Simons theory. Here we claim that there is an analogousclass of four dimensional field theories corresponding to five dimensionalChern-Simons theory. The four dimensional theories give a coupling between ascalar field and an external divergenceless vector field and they may have someapplication in magnetohydrodynamics. Like in conformal theories they possess adiffeomorphism symmetry, which for us is along the direction of the vectorfield, and their generators are analogous to Virasoro generators. Our analysisof the abelian Chern-Simons system uses elementary canonical methods for thequantization of field theories defined on manifolds with boundaries. Edgestates appear for these systems and they yield a four dimensional currentalgebra. We examine the quantization of these algebras in several special casesand claim that a renormalization of the $5D$ Chern-Simons coupling is necessaryfor removing divergences.
