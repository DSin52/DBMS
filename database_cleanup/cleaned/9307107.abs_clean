Mappings between certain infinite series of N=2 superconformal coset modelsare constructed. They make use of level-rank dualities for B, C and D typetheories. While the WZW level-rank dualities do not constitute isomorphisms ofthe theories, they lead to level-rank dualities of N=2 coset models thatpreserve the cft properties in such a manner that the coset models related byduality are expected to be isomorphic as conformal field theories. Theconstruction also gives some further insight in the nature of the resolution offield identification fixed points of coset theories.
