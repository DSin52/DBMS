Dynamical systems of a new kind are described, which are motivated by theproblem of constructing diffeomorphism invariant quantum theories. These arebased on the extremization of a non-local and non-additive quantity that wecall the variety of a system. In these systems all dynaqmical variables referto relative coordinates or, more generally, describe relations betweenparticles, so that they are invariant under discrete analogues ofdiffeomorphisms in which the labels of all particles are permutted arbitrarily.The variety is a measures of how uniquely each of the elements of the systemcan be distinguished from the others in terms of the values of these relativecoordinates. Thus a system with extremal variety is one in which the parts arerelated to the whole in as distinct a way as possible.We study numerically several dynamical systems which are defined by settingthe action of the system equal to its variety. We find evidence that suggeststhat such systems may serve as the basis for a new kind of pregeometry theoriesin which the geometry of low dimensional space emerges in the thermodynamiclimit from a system which is defined without the use of any background space.The mathematical definition of variety may also provide a quantitative toolto study self-organizing systems, because it distinguishes highly structured,but asymmetric, configurations such as one finds in biological systems fromboth random configurations and highly ordered configurations.
