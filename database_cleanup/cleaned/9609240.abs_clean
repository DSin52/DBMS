The two--dimensional topological BF model is quantized in the axial gauge. Weshow that this theory is trivially ultraviolet finite and that the usualinfrared problem of the propagator of the scalar field in two dimensions isreplaced by an easily solvable long distances problem inherent to the axialgauge. It will also be shown that contrarily to the 3--dimensional case, theaction principle cannot be completely replaced by the various Ward identitiesexpressing the symmetries of the model; some of the equation of motion areneeded.
