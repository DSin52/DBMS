We consider a Kaluza-Klein theory whose ground state is ${\bf R}^4 \times{\bf M } \times {\bf K}$ where ${\bf M}$ and ${\bf K}$ are compact,irreducible, homogenous internal mani folds. This is the simplest ground statecompatible with the existence of the graviton, gauge fields, massless scalarfields and the absence of the cosmological constan t. The requirement for theseconditions to be satisfied are the odd dimensionality of ${\bf M}$ and ${\bfK}$, and the choice of a dimensionally continued Euler form action whosedimension is the same as the dimension of ${\bf M} \times {\bf K}$. We showthat in such a theory, which is not simple due to presence of two internalmanifolds, the gauge couplings $g^2_M$ and $g^2_K$ are actually unifiedprovided that the internal space sizes are constant. For ${\bf M} \times {\bfK} = S^{2m+ 1} \times S^{2k+1}$ this gauge coupling unification relation reads$g^2_M / g^2_K = m / k$.
