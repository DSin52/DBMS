We study a system of functional relations among a commuting family ofrow-to-row transfer matrices in solvable lattice models. The role of exactsequences of the finite dimensional quantum group modules is clarified. We finda curious phenomenon that the solutions of those functional relations alsosolve the so-called thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations in the hightemperature limit for $sl(r+1)$ models.  Based on this observation, we proposepossible functional relations for models associated with all the simple Liealgebras.  We show that these functional relations certainly fulfill strongconstraints coming from the fusion procedure analysis.  The application to thecalculations of physical quantities will be presented in the subsequentpublication.
