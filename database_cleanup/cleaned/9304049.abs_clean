Comments: 28 pages, 6 pictures available on request; in the revised version

some misprints are correctedWe study the nonunitary representations of N=2 Super Virasoro algebra for therational central charges c<3. The resolutions for the irreduciblerepresentations of N=2 SVir in terms of the "2-d gravity modules" are obtainedand their characters are computed. The correspondence between the N=2nonunitary "minimal" models and the Virasoro minimal models coupled to 2-dgravity is shown at the level of states. We also define the hamiltonianreduction of the BRST complex of sl(N)/sl(N) coset to the BRST complex of theW-gravity coupled to the W matter. The case of sl(2) is considered explicitly.It leads to the presentation of N=2 Super Virasoro algebra by the Lie algebracohomology. Finally, we reveal the mechanism of the correspondence betweensl(2)/sl(2)$ coset and 2-d gravity.
