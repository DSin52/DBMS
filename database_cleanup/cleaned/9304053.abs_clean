Motivated by the problem of background independence of closed string fieldtheory we study geometry on the infinite vector bundle of local fields over thespace of conformal field theories (CFT's). With any connection we can associatean excluded domain $D$ for the integral of marginal operators, and an operatorone-form $\omega_\mu$. The pair $(D, \omega_\mu)$ determines the covariantderivative of any correlator of local fields. We obtain interesting classes ofconnections in which $\omega_\mu$'s can be written in terms of CFT data. Forthese connections we compute their curvatures in terms of four-pointcorrelators, $D$, and $\omega_\mu$. Among these connections three are ofparticular interest. A flat, metric compatible connection $\HG$, andconnections $c$ and $\bar c$ having non-vanishing curvature, with $\bar c$being metric compatible. The flat connection cannot be used to do paralleltransport over a finite distance. Parallel transport with either $c$ or $\barc$, however, allows us to construct a CFT in the state space of another CFT afinite distance away. The construction is given in the form of perturbationtheory manifestly free of divergences.
