Physicists Annual Congress, Quebec City, June 2-5, 2002We show that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy associated with any black holeundergoes logarithmic corrections when small thermodynamic fluctuations aroundequilibrium are taken into account. Thus, the corrected expression for blackhole entropy is given by $S= A/4 - k \ln(A)$, where $A$ is the horizon area and$k$ is a constant which depends on the specific black hole. We apply our resultto BTZ black hole, for which $k=3/2$, as found earlier, as well as to anti-deSitter-Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom black hole in arbitrary spacetimedimensions. Finally, we examine the role of conformal field theory in blackhole entropy and its corrections.
