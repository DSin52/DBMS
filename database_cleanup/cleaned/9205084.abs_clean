In a previous paper we derived a relation between the operator productcoefficients and anomalous dimensions. We explore this relation in the$(\phi^4)_4$ theory and compute the coefficient functions in the products of$\phi^2$ and $\phi^4$ to first order in the parameter $\lambda$. Thecalculation results in two-loop beta functions.
