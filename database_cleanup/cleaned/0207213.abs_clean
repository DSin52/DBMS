Exact cosmological solutions for effective actions in D dimensions inspiredby the tree-level superstring action are studied. For a certain range of freeparameters existing in the model, nonsingular bouncing solutions are found.Among them, of particular interest can be open hyperbolic models, in which,without any fine tuning, the internal scale factor and the dilaton field(connected with string coupling in string theories) tend to constant values atlate times. A cosmological singularity is avoided due to nonminimaldilaton-gravity coupling and, for D > 11, due to pure imaginary nature of thedilaton, which conforms to currently discussed unification models. Theexistence of such and similar solutions supports the opinion that the Universehad never undergone a stage driven by full-scale quantum gravity.
