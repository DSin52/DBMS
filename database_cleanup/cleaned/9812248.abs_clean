A general condition for sharp transition of decay rate from quantum tothermal regimes is derived in dissipative tunneling models when positiondependent mass is involved. It is shown that the effect of dissipation ingeneral changes the order of the phase transition. Especially, for the modelswith constant mass the Ohmic dissipation enlarges the range of parameters forfirst-order phase transitions. In the case of second-order phase transition theOhmic dissipation suppresses the decay rate near the transitiontemperature(T_c). For the super-Ohmic case the dissipation yields an oppositeeffects to the Ohmic dissipation within exponential approximation.
