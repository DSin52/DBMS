In this paper, we develop several general techniques to investigate modularinvariants of conformal field theories whose algebras of the holomorphic andanti-holomorphic sectors are different. As an application, we find all suchexactly seven of these, two of which seem to be new. Previously, only those ofrank $\le 3$ have been completely classified. We also find all physical modularinvariants for $su(2)_{k_1}\times su(2)_{k_2}$, for $22>k_1>k_2$, and $k_1=28$,$k_2<22$, completing the classification of ref.{} \SUSU.
