886-889The representation of scalar products of Bethe wave functions in terms of theDual Fields, proven by A.G.Izergin and V.E.Korepin in 1987, plays an importantrole in the theory of completely integrable models. The proof in\cite{Izergin87} and \cite{Korepin87} is based on the explicit expression forthe "senior" coefficient which was guessed in \cite{Izergin87} and then provento satisfy some recurrent relations, which determine it unambiguously. In thispaper we present an alternative proof based on the direct computation.
