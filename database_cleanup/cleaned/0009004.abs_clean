Rationality of the Wightman functions is proven to follow from energypositivity, locality and a natural condition of global conformal invariance(GCI) in any number D of space-time dimensions. The GCI condition allows totreat correlation functions as generalized sections of a vector bundle over thecompactification of Minkowski space and yields a strong form of locality validfor all non-isotropic intervals if assumed true for space-like separations.
