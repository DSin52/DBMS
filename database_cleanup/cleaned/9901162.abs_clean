We investigate the prepotential that describes certain F^4 couplings in eightdimensional string compactifications, and show how they can be computed fromthe solutions of inhomogenous differential equations. These appear to have theform of the Picard-Fuchs equations of a fibration of Sym^2(K3) over P^1. Ourfindings give support to the conjecture that the relevant geometry whichunderlies these couplings is given by a five-fold.
