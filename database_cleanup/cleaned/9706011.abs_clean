Title: Reduction of internal degrees of freedom in the large N limit in matrix

modelsAuthors: Oscar Diego

Comments: 26 pages, Latex, no figures. Several changes in the calculations but

the conclusions remain the sameIn this paper the large $N$ limit of one hermitian matrix models coupled toan external matrix is considered. It is shown that in the large N limit thenumber of degrees of freedom are reduced to be order N even though it is order$N^{2}$ for finite N. It is claimed that this result is the origin of thefactorization of observables in the path integral formalism.
