We study thermodynamical aspects of string theory in the limit in which itcorresponds to Noncommutative Yang-Mills. We confirm, using the AdS/CFTcorrespondence, that for general Dp branes the entropy in the planarapproximation depends neither on the value of the background magnetic field Bnor on its rank. We find 1/N corrections to the planar entropy in the WKBapproximation. For all appropriate values of p these corrections are muchsofter than the corresponding corrections for the B=0 case, and vanishaltogether in the high temperature limit.
