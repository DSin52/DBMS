Title: Classical String Solitons

Authors: Ramzi R. Khuri

Comments: 10 pages

We discuss some recent work in the field of classical solitonic solutions instring theory. In particular, we construct instanton and monopole solutions anddiscuss the dynamics of string-like solitons. Some of the motivation behindthis work is that instantons may provide a nonperturbative understanding of thevacuum structure of string theory, while monopoles may appear in stringpredictions for grand unification. The string-like solitons represent extendedstates of fundamental strings.
