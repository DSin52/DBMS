factorised S-matrix theoriesComments: 9 pages, LaTeX file. The comments about unitarity in affine Toda

theories have been improved. The basis dependence of the Hermitiananalyticity conditions is discussedJournal-ref: Phys.Lett. B455 (1999) 231-238

The constraints implied by analyticity in two-dimensional factorised S-matrixtheories are reviewed. Whenever the theory is not time-reversal invariant, itis argued that the familiar condition of `Real analyticity' for the S-matrixamplitudes has to be superseded by a different one known as `Hermitiananalyticity'. Examples are provided of integrable quantum field theories whose(diagonal) two-particle S-matrix amplitudes are Hermitian analytic but not Realanalytic. It is also shown that Hermitian analyticity is consistent with thebootstrap equations and that it ensures the equivalence between the notion ofunitarity in the quantum group approach to factorised S-matrices and thegenuine unitarity of the S-matrix.
