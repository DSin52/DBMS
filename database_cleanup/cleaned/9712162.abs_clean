We show that the fluxes of the various six-dimensional "gauge" theories areassociated to below threshold bound states of D-branes with the NS-5-branes andKK-monopoles which preserve half of bulk supersymmetry. We then present thesupergravity solutions that correspond to these bound states. In addition usingthe worldvolume solitons of IIA and IIB NS-5-branes and KK-monopoles, weinvestigate the sectors of the "gauge" theories that preserve one quarter ofbulk supersymmetry. This leads to a generalization a supergravity solutionwhich has the interpretation of two intersecting NS-5-branes at a 3-brane andto the construction of some of the worldvolume solitons of IIA and M-theoryKK-monopoles. Furthermore, using the IIA/IIB T-duality of the bulk theories, wegive the T-duality transformations of the worldvolume solitons of NS-5-branesand KK-monopoles. We find that the worldvolume 0-brane, self-dual string and2-brane solitons of NS-5-branes appear in the same T-duality chain.
