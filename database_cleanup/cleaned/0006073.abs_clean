We investigate the open string modes, describing the world-volume of a Dp-brane, for its cyclic symmetry in presence of a magnetic field. It is arguedthat the constant coordinate modes receive non-perturbative correction. We showthat they introduce the notion of noncommutativity on the D p-braneworld-volume and make it UV-renormalizable. An analogy between cyclic symmetry($\a'$-corrections) and the noncommutative geometry ($\Theta_A$-corrections) ispresented to explain some of the unusual IR phenomena often noticed in anoncommutative theory.
