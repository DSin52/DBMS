We diagonalize the anti-ferroelectric XXZ-Hamiltonian directly in thethermodynamic limit, where the model becomes invariant under the action ofaffine U_q( sl(2) ).Our method is based on the representation theory of quantum affinealgebras, the related vertex operators and KZ equation, and therebybypasses the usual process of starting from a finite lattice, taking thethermodynamic limit and filling the Dirac sea. From recent results on thealgebraic structure of the corner transfer matrix of the model, we obtainthe vacuum vector of the Hamiltonian. The rest of the eigenvectors areobtained by applying the vertex operators, which act as particle creationoperators in the space of eigenvectors.We check the agreement of our results with those obtained using the BetheAnsatz in a number of cases, and with others obtained in the scaling limit
