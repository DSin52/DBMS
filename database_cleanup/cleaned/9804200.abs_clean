We study the origins of the five ten-dimensional ``matrix superstring''theories, supplementing old results with new ones, and find that they all fitinto a unified framework. In all cases the matrix definition of the string inthe limit of vanishingly small coupling is a trivial 1+1 dimensional infra-redfixed point (an orbifold conformal field theory) characterized uniquely bymatrix versions of the appropriate Green-Schwarz action. The Fock space of thematrix string is built out of winding T-dual strings. There is an associateddual supergravity description in terms of the near horizon geometry of thefundamental string solution of those T-dual strings. The singularity at theircore is related to the orbifold target space in the matrix theory. Atintermediate coupling, for the IIB and SO(32) systems, the matrix stringdescription is in terms of non-trivial 2+1 dimensional fixed points. Theirsupergravity duals involve Anti de-Sitter space (or an orbifold thereof) andare well-defined everywhere, providing a complete description of the fixedpoint theory. In the case of the type IIB system, the two extra organizationaldimensions normally found in F-theory appear here as well. The fact that theyare non-dynamical has a natural interpretation in terms of holography.
