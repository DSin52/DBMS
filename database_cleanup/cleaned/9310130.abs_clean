The two-point correlation function of the stress-energy tensor for the$\Phi_{1,3}$ massive deformation of the non-unitary model ${\cal M}_{3,5}$ iscomputed. We compare the ultraviolet CFT perturbative expansion of thiscorrelation function with its spectral representation given by a summation overmatrix elements of the intermediate asymptotic massive particles. The fast rateof convergence of both approaches provides an explicit example of an accurateinterpolation between the infrared and ultraviolet behaviours of a QuantumField Theory.
