QED vacua under the influence of external conditions (background fields,finite temperature, boundary conditions) can be considered as dispersive mediawhose complex behaviour can no longer be described in terms of a singleuniversal vacuum velocity of light c. Beginning in the early 1950's (J.S.Toll), quantum field theoretic investigations have led to considerable insightinto the relation between the vacuum structure and the propagation of light.Recent years have witnessed a significant growth of activity in this field ofthe propagation of light in a constant homogeneous magnetic field and in aCasimir vacuum. The latter appears to be particularly interesting because theCasimir vacuum has been found to exhibit modes of the propagation of light withphase and group velocities larger than c in the low frequency domain omega<<mwhere m is the electron mass. The impact of this result on the front velocityof light in a Casimir vacuum is discussed by means of the Kramers-Kronigrelation.
