(This talk was presented at the Third International Wigner Symposium on GroupTheory, Oxford, September, 1993.) Matrix models provides us with the mostpowerful framework in which to analyze D=2 string theory, yet some of itsmiraculous features, such as discrete states and $w(\infty)$, remain ratherobscure, because the string degrees of freedom have been removed. Liouvilletheory, on the other hand, has all its string degrees of freedom intact, yet isnotoriously difficult to solve. In this paper, we present the second quantizedformulation of Liouville theory in D=2, where discrete states and $w(\infty)$have a natural, field theoretic interpretation. We generalize thenon-polynomial closed string field theory, first developed by the author andthe Kyoto and MIT groups, to the D=2 case. We find that, in second quantizedfield theory language, the rather mysterious features of matrix models have anintuitively transparent interpretation, similar to standard gauge theory. Latexfile.
