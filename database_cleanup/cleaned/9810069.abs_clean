A connection between the Hagedorn transition in string theory and thedeconfinement transition in (non-supersymmetric) Yang-Mills theory is madeusing the AdS/CFT correspondence. We modify the model of zero temperature QCDproposed by Witten by compactifying an additional space-time coordinate withsupersymmetry breaking boundary conditions thus introducing a finitetemperature in the boundary theory. There is a Hagedorn-like transitionassociated with winding modes around this coordinate, which signals a topologychanging phase transition to a new AdS/Schwarzschild blackhole where thiscoordinate is the time coordinate. In the boundary gauge theory time likeWilson loops acquire an expectation value above this temperature.
