The effects of boundary conditions of the fields for the compactified spacedirections on the supersymmetric theories are discussed. The boundaryconditions can be taken to be periodic up to the degrees of freedom oflocalized $U(1)_{R}$ transformations. The boundary condition breaks thesupersymmery to yield universal soft supersymmetry breaking terms. The4-dimensional supersymmetric QED with one flavour and the pure supersymmetricQCD are studied as toy models when one of the space coordinates is compactifiedon $S^1$.
