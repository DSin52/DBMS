We show that the tensor gauge multiplet of N=1 supersymmetry can serve as theGoldstone multiplet for partially broken rigid N=2 supersymmetry. We exploit aremarkable analogy with the Goldstone-Maxwell multiplet of hep-th/9608177 tofind its nonlinear transformation law and its invariant Goldstone action. Wedemonstrate that the tensor multiplet has two dualities. The first transformsit into the chiral Goldstone multiplet; the other leaves it invariant.
