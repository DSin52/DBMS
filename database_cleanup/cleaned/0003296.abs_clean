Authors: Dean Lee (UMass Amherst)

Comments: 7 pages, 1 figure, uses ws-p8-50x6-00.cls (included in tar file), to

appear in the proceedings of the Workshop on Light-Cone QCD andNonperturbative Hadron Physics, Adelaide, December 1999We review recent developments in non-perturbative field theory using modalfield methods. We discuss Monte Carlo results as well as a new diagonalizationtechnique known as the quasi-sparse eigenvector method.
