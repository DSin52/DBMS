We describe topological gauge theories for which duality properties areencoded by construction. We study them for compact manifolds of dimensionsfour, eight and two. The fields and their duals are treated symmetrically,within the context of field--antifield unification. Dual formulationscorrespond to different gauge-fixings of the topological symmetry. We alsodescribe novel features in eight-dimensional theories, and speculate abouttheir possible "Abelian" descriptions.
