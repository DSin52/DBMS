We study various aspects of N=(4,4) type IIA GS superstring theory in thepp-wave background, which arises as the compactification of maximallysupersymmetric eleven-dimensional pp-wave geometry along the spacelike isometrydirection. We show the supersymmetry algebra of N=(4,4) worldsheetsupersymmetry as well as non-linearly realized supersymmetry. We also givequantization of closed string and open string incorporating various boundaryconditions. From the open string boundary conditions, we find configurations ofD-branes which preserve half the supersymmetries. Among these we identify D4brane configurations with longitudinal five brane configurations in matrixmodel on the eleven-dimensional pp-wave geometry.
