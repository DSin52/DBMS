We find M-theory solutions that are holographic duals of flows of themaximally supersymmetric N=8 scalar-fermion theory in (2+1) dimensions. Inparticular, we construct the M-theory solution dual to a flow in which a singlechiral multiplet is given a mass, and the theory goes to a new infra-red fixedpoint. We also examine this new solution using M2-brane probes. The(2+1)-dimensional field theory fixed-point is closely related to that of Leighand Strassler, while the M-theory solution is closely related to thecorresponding IIB flow solution. We recast the IIB flow solution in a moregeometric manner and use this to obtain an Ansatz for the M-theory flow. We areable to generalize our solution further to obtain flows with del Pezzosub-manifolds, and we give an explicit solution with a conifold singularity.
