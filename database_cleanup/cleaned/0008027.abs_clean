We consider the quantum mechanics of a particle on a noncommutativetwo-sphere with the coordinates obeying an SU(2)-algebra. The momentum operatorcan be constructed in terms of an $SU(2)\times SU(2)$-extension and theHeisenberg algebra recovered in the smooth manifold limit. Similarconsiderations apply to the more general SU(n) case.
