Authors: Toshiaki Tanaka

Comments: 9 pages, REVTeX4

Solvable and Integrable SystemsWe construct a family of quasi-solvable quantum many-body systems by analgebraic method. The models contain up to two-body interactions and havepermutation symmetry. We classify these models under the consideration ofinvariance property. It turns out that this family includes the rational,hyperbolic (trigonometric) and elliptic Inozemtsev models as the particularcases.
