A discrete string theory --a theory of embeddings from ${\bf Z}\times {\bfZ}_C\to {\bf R}^D$, where $C$ is the number of components of the string-- isexplored. The closure of the algebra of constraints (`${\bf Z}_C$-Virasoroalgebra') is exhibited. The ${\bf Z}_C$-Virasoro `algebra' is shown to beanomaly free in arbitrary number of target space dimensions. We prove theexistence of a (manifestly unitary) light-cone gauge with anomaly free Lorentzalgebra in any dimensions. The analog of vertex operators are introduced andthe physical spectrum is analysed. There are an infinite number of higher-levelstates repeating a certain mass pattern and leading to an infinite degeneracy.The connection with the continuum string theory (in $D=26$) is investigated.Independently, following a method recently introduced by 't Hooft based onHilbert-space extension of deterministic systems, a particular one-dimensionalcellular automaton submitted to a deterministic evolution is shown to reduce toa massless scalar field theory at long distance scales. This automaton isutilized to define a (`cellular') string theory with world-sheet variablesevolving under deterministic rules, which in the framework of`first-quantization' corresponds to the ${\bf Z}_C$ string theory mentionedabove. We show that in this theory also the target space motion of free stringsis governed by deterministic laws. Finally, we discuss a model for (off-shell)interacting strings where space-time determinism is fully restored.
