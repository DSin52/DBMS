Title: Review of Matrix Theory

Authors: Daniela Bigatti, Leonard Susskind

Comments: 45 pages, LaTeX, 2 figures in .eps format

In this article we present a self contained review of the principles ofMatrix Theory including the basics of light cone quantization, the formulationof 11 dimensional M-Theory in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, theorigin of membranes and the rules of compactification on 1,2 and 3 tori. Weemphasize the unusual origins of space time and gravitation which are verydifferent than in conventional approaches to quantum gravity. Finally wediscuss application of Matrix Theory to the quantum mechanics of Schwarzschildblack holes. This work is based on lectures given by the second author at theCargese ASI 1997 and at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.
