Title: Les Houches lectures on supersymmetric Gauge Theories

Authors: D. S. Berman and E. Rabinovici

Comments: Lectures delivered in Les Houches 2001, 111 pages, 40 figures,

references added plus small correctionsWe introduce simple and more advanced concepts that have played a key role inthe development of supersymmetric systems. This is done by first describingvarious supersymmetric quantum mechanics models. Topics covered include thebasic construction of supersymmetric field theories, the phase structure ofsupersymmetric systems with and without gauge particles, superconformaltheories and infrared duality in both field theory and string theory. Adiscussion of the relation of conformal symmetry to a vanishing vacuum energy(cosmological constant) is included.
