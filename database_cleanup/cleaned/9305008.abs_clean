The renormalization group method is employed to study the effective potentialin curved spacetime with torsion. The renormalization-group improved effectivepotential corresponding to a massless gauge theory in such a spacetime is foundand in this way a generalization of Coleman-Weinberg's approach correspondingto flat space is obtained. A method which works with the renormalization groupequation for two-loop effective potential calculations in torsionful spacetimeis developed. The effective potential for the conformal factor in the conformaldynamics of quantum gravity with torsion is thereby calculated explicitly.Finally, torsion-induced phase transitions are discussed.
