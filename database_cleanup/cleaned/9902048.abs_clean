A gauge invariant formulation for the massive axion is considered. The axionacquires mass through a topological term which couples a (pseudo)scalar and athird rank antisymmetric tensor. Duality, local and canonical equivalences withthe non-gauge invariant proposal are established. The supersymmetric version ofthe gauge invariant model is constructed.
