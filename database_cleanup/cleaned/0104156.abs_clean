We analyze the possibility of constructing supersymmetric curved domain wallsolutions in five-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity, which aresupported by non-constant scalar fields belonging either to vector multipletsonly or to vector and hypermultiplets. We show that the BPS equations for thewarp factor and for the vector scalars are modified by the presence of afour-dimensional cosmological constant on the domain wall, in agreement withearlier results by DeWolfe, Freedman, Gubser and Karch. We also show that thecosmological constant on the domain wall is anti-de Sitter like and that itconstitutes an independent quantity, not related to any of the objectsappearing in the context of very special geometry.
