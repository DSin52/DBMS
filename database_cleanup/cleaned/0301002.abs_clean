We introduce a notion of universality classes for the Gregory-Laflammeinstability and determine, in the supergravity approximation, the stability ofa variety of solutions, including the non-extremal D3-brane, M2-brane, andM5-brane. These three non-dilatonic branes cross over from instability tostability at a certain non-extremal mass. Numerical analysis suggests that thewavelength of the shortest unstable mode diverges as one approaches thecross-over point from above, with a simple critical exponent which is the samein all three cases.
