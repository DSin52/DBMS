Some aspects of chiral p-forms, in particular the obstruction that makes ithard to define covariant Green functions, are discussed. It is shown that aproposed resolution involving an infinite set of gauge fields can be mademathematically rigourous in the classical case. We also give a briefdemonstration of species doubling for chiral bosons.
