The static color-Coulomb potential is calculated as the solution of anon-linear integral equation. This equation has been derived recently as aself-consistency condition which arises in the Coulomb Hamiltonian formulationof lattice gauge theory when the restriction to the interior of the Gribovhorizon is implemented. The potential obtained is in qualitative agreement withexpectations, being Coulombic with logarithmic corrections at short range andconfining at long range. The values obtained for the string tension and$\Lambda_{\overline{MS}}$ are in semi-quantitative agreement with lattice MonteCarlo and phenomenological determinations.
