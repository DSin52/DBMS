We study topological Yang-Mills-Higgs theories in two and three dimensionsand topological Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions in a unified framework ofsuperconnections. In this framework, we first show that a classical action oftopological Yang-Mills type can provide all three classical actions of thesetheories via appropriate projections. Then we obtain the BRST and anti-BRSTtransformation rules encompassing these three topological theories from anextended definition of curvature and a geometrical requirement of Bianchiidentity. This is an extension of Perry and Teo's work in the topologicalYang-Mills case. Finally, comparing this result with our previous treatment inwhich we used the ``modified horizontality condition", we provide a meaning ofBianchi identity from the BRST symmetry viewpoint and thus interpret the BRSTsymmetry in a geometrical setting.
