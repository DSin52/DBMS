Title: Planar Approximation as Two-Field Boltzmann Theory

Comments: A talk given at Quarks 96, 9 pages, latex (4 figures use bezier.sty

and emlines2.sty)A modified interaction representation for the master field describingconnected $SU(N)$-invariant Wightman's functions in the large $N$ limit ofmatrix fields is constructed. This construction is based on the representationof the master field in terms of Boltzmannian field theory found before. In themodified interaction representation we deal with two scalar Boltzmann fields({\it up} and {\it down} fields). For up and down fields only half-planardiagrams contribute and this could help to write down a recursive set ofnon-linear integral-differential equations summing up planar diagrams.
