The Seiberg-Witten curves and differentials for $\N=2$ supersymmetricYang-Mills theories with one hypermultiplet of mass $m$ in the adjointrepresentation of the gauge algebra $\G$, are constructed for arbitraryclassical or exceptional $\G$ (except $G_2$). The curves are obtained from therecently established Lax pairs with spectral parameter for the (twisted)elliptic Calogero-Moser integrable systems associated with the algebra $\G$.Curves and differentials are shown to have the proper group theoretic andcomplex analytic structure, and to behave as expected when $m$ tends either to0 or to $\infty$. By way of example, the prepotential for $\G = D_n$, evaluatedwith these techniques, is shown to agree with standard perturbative results. Arenormalization group type equation relating the prepotential to theCalogero-Moser Hamiltonian is obtained for arbitrary $\G$, generalizing aprevious result for $\G = SU(N)$. Duality properties and decoupling to theorieswith other representations are briefly discussed.
