We discuss certain integrable quantum field theories in (1+1)-dimensionsconsisting of coupled sine/sinh-Gordon theories with N=1 supersymmetry,positive kinetic energy, and bosonic potentials which are bounded from below.We show that theories of this type can be constructed as Toda models based onthe exceptional affine Lie superalgebra $D(2,1;\A)^{(1)}$ (or on relatedalgebras which can be obtained as various limits) provided one adoptsappropriate reality conditions for the fields. In particular, there is acontinuous family of such models in which the couplings and mass ratios alldepend on the parameter $\A$. The structure of these models is analyzed in somedetail at the classical level, including the construction of conserved currentswith spins up to 4. We then show that these currents generalize to the quantumtheory, thus demonstrating quantum-integrability of the models.
