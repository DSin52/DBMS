Comments: 9pp., Latex

Journal-ref: Mod.Phys.Lett. A13 (1998) 2317-2325

Static charges are introduced in Yang-Mills theory via coupling to heavyfermions. The states containing static color charges are constructed usingintegration over gauge transformations. A functional representation forinterquark potential is obtained. This representation provides a simplecriterion for confinement.
