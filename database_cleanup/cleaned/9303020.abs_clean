The van Vleck determinant is an ubiquitous object, arising in many physicallyevolution operators and Green functions. (2) Adiabatic approximations to heatkernels. (3) One loop approximations to functional integrals. (4) The theory ofcaustics in geometrical optics and ultrasonics. (5) The focussing anddefocussing of geodesic flows in Riemannian manifolds. While all of thesetopics are interrelated, the present paper is particularly concerned with thelast case and presents extensive theoretical developments that aid in thecomputation of the van Vleck determinant associated with geodesic flows inLorentzian spacetimes. {\sl A fortiori} these developments have important04.20.Cv, 04.60.+n.
