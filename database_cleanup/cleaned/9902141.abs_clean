We analyze the integrability properties of models defined on the symmetricspace SU(2)/U(1) in 3+1 dimensions, using a recently proposed approach forintegrable theories in any dimension. We point out the key ingredients for atheory to possess an infinite number of local conservation laws, and discussclasses of models with such property. We propose a 3+1-dimensional,relativistic invariant field theory possessing a toroidal soliton solutioncarrying a unit of topological charge given by the Hopf map. Construction ofthe action is guided by the requirement that the energy of static configurationshould be scale invariant. The solution is constructed exactly. The modelpossesses an infinite number of local conserved currents. The method is alsoapplied to the Skyrme-Faddeev model, and integrable submodels are proposed.
