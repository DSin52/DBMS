Title: Greybody factors at large imaginary frequencies

Authors: Andrew Neitzke

Comments: 19 pages, 3 figures

Extending a computation which appeared recently in hep-th/0301173, we computethe transmission and reflection coefficients for massless uncharged scalars andgravitational waves scattered by d>=4 Schwarzschild or d=4 Reissner-Nordstromblack holes, in the limit of large imaginary frequencies. The transmissioncoefficient has an interpretation as the "greybody factor" which determines thespectrum of Hawking radiation. The result has an interesting structure and wespeculate that it may admit a simple dual description; curiously, forReissner-Nordstrom the result suggests that this dual description shouldinvolve both the inner and outer horizons. We also discuss some numericalevidence in favor of the formulas of hep-th/0301173.
