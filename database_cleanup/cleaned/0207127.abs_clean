We study the gravity dual of several wrapped D-brane configurations inpresence of 4-form RR fluxes partially piercing the unwrapped directions. Wepresent a systematic approach to obtain these solutions from those withoutfluxes. We use D=8 gauged supergravity as a starting point to build up thesesolutions. The configurations include (smeared) M2-branes at the tip of a G_2cone on S^3 x S^3, D2-D6 branes with the latter wrapping a special Lagrangian3-cycle of the complex deformed conifold and an holomorphic sphere in itscotangent bundle T^*S^2, D3-branes at the tip of the generalized resolvedconifold, and others obtained by means of T duality and KK reduction. Weelaborate on the corresponding N=1 and N=2 field theories in 2+1 dimensions.
