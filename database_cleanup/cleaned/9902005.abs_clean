We study classical solutions of N=4 super Yang-Mills theories that areinvariant under 1/4 of the supersymmetry generators. Expressions for the massand electric charge of the configurations are derived as functions on themonopole moduli space. These functions also provide a method of determining thenumber of normalisable bosonic zero modes.
