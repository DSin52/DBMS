A new orientifold of Type-IIB theory on $K3$ is constructed that has $N=1$supersymmetry in six dimensions. The orientifold symmetry consists of a $Z_2$involution of $K3$ combined with orientation-reversal on the worldsheet. Theclosed-string sector in the resulting theory contains nine tensor multipletsand twelve neutral hypermultiplets in addition to the gravity multiplet, and isanomaly-free by itself. The open-string sector contains only 5-branes and givesrise to maximal gauge groups $SO(16)$ or $U(8)\times U(8)$ at different pointsin the moduli space. Anomalies are canceled by a generalization of theGreen-Schwarz mechanism that involves more than one tensor multiplets.
