We construct modular invariant partition functions for type II strings on aconifold and a singular Eguchi-Hanson instanton by means of the SL(2,R)/U(1)version of Gepner models. In the conifold case, we find an extra masslesshypermultiplet in the IIB spectrum and argue that it may be identified as asoliton. In the Eguchi-Hanson case, our formula is new and different from theearlier result, in particular does not contain graviton. The lightest IIBfields are combined into a six-dimensional (2,0) tensor multiplet with anegative mass square. We give an interpretation to it as a doubleton-like mode.
