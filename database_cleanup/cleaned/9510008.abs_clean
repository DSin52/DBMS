The Tricritical Ising model perturbed by the subleading energy operator\Phi_(3/5) was known to be an Integrable Scattering Theory of massive kinks andin fact preserves supersymmetry. We consider here the model defined on thehalf-plane with a boundary and computed the associated factorizable boundaryS-matrix. The conformal boundary conditions of this model were identified andthe corresponding S-matrices were found. We also show how some of theseS-matrices can be perturbed and generate ``flows'' between different boundaryconditions.
