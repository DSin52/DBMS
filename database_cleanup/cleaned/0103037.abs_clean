We propose the multiple reflection expansion as a tool for the calculation ofheat kernel coefficients. As an example, we give the coefficients for a sphereas a finite sum over reflections, obtaining as a byproduct a relation betweenthe coefficients for Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Further, wecalculate the heat kernel coefficients for the most general matching conditionson the surface of a sphere, including those cases corresponding to the presenceof delta and delta prime background potentials. In the latter case, themultiple reflection expansion is shown to be non-convergent.
