We study Z2-orbifolds of 11-dimensional M-theory on tori of variousdimensions. The most interesting model (besides the known S1/Z2 case)corresponds to T5/Z2, for which we argue that the resulting six-dimensionaltheory is equivalent to the type IIB string compactified on K3. Gravitationalanomaly cancellation plays a crucial role in determining what states appear inthe twisted sector. Most of the other models appear to break spacetimesupersymmetry. We observe that M-theory tends to produce chiralcompactifications on orbifolds, and that our results may provide an insightinto the mechanism by which twisted-sector states arise in this hypotheticaltheory.
