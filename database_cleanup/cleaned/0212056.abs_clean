We study families of PP-wave solutions of type-IIB supergravity that have(light-cone) time dependent metrics and RR five-form fluxes. They arise asPenrose limits of supergravity solutions that correspond to rotating orcontinuous distributions of D3-branes. In general, the solutions preservesixteen supersymmetries. On the dual field theory side these backgroundsdescribe the BMN limit of N=4 SYM when some scalars in the field theory havenon-vanishing expectation values. We study the perturbative string spectrum andin several cases we are able to determine it exactly for the bosons as well asfor the fermions. We find that there are special states for particular valuesof the light-cone constant P_+.
