algebraAuthors: J.L. Petersen, J. Rasmussen and M. Yu

A review is presented of the recently obtained expressions for conformalblocks for {\it admissible} representations in $SL(2)$ current algebra based onthe Wakimoto free field construction. In this realization one needs tointroduce a second screening charge, one which depends on fractional powers offree fields. The techniques necessary to deal with these complications aredeveloped, and explicit general integral representations for conformal blockson the sphere are provided. The fusion rules are discussed and as a check it isverified that the conformal blocks satisfy the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikovequations. (Talk presented by J.
