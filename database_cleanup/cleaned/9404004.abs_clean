The $1/N$ expansion of the weak coupling phase of two-dimensional QCD on asphere is constructed. It is demonstrated that the phase transition from theweak to the strong coupling phase is induced by instantons. A double scalinglimit of the theory at the point of the phase transition is constructed, thevalue of string susceptibility is determined to be $\gamma_{str}=-1$. Thepossibility of instanton induced large $N$ phase transitions in fourdimensional QCD is explored.
