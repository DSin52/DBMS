We study the properties of a non-abelian gauge theory subjected to a gaugeinvariant constraint given by the classical equations of motion. The constraintis not imposed by hand, but appears naturally when we study a particular typeof local gauge transformations. In this way, all standard techniques to treatgauge theories are available. We will show that this theory lives at one-loop.Also this model retains some quantum characteristic of the usual non-abeliangauge theories as asymptotic freedom.
