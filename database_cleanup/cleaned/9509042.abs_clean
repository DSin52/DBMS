The evidence for string/string-duality can be extended from the matching ofthe vector couplings to gravitational couplings. In this note this is shown inthe rank three example, the closest stringy analog of the Seiberg/Witten-setup,which is related to the Calabi-Yau $WP^4_{1,1,2,2,6}(12)$. I provide an exactanalytical verification of a relation checked by coefficient comparison tofourth order by Kaplunovsky, Louis and Theisen.
