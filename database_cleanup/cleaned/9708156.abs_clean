and Its ApplicationsAuthors: Guang-Jiong Ni

Comments: 9 pages, no figure

Basing on the fundamental symmetry that the space-time inversion isequivalent to particle-antiparticle transformation, a relativistic modificationon the stationary Schrodinger equation for many-particle system is made. Theeigenvalue in the center of mass system is no longer equal to the negative ofbinding energy simply. The possible applications in various fields (e.g. themodel of quarkonium) are discussed.
