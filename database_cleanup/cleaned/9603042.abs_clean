We analyze in detail the moduli space of vacua of N=2 SUSY QCD with n_ccolors and n_f flavors. The Coulomb branch has submanifolds with non-Abeliangauge symmetry. The massless quarks and gluons at these vacua are smoothlyconnected to the underlying elementary quarks and gluons. Upon breaking N=2 byan N=1 preserving mass term for the adjoint field the theory flows to N=1 SUSYQCD. Some of the massless quarks and gluons on the moduli space of the N=2theory become the magnetic quarks and gluons of the N=1 theory. In this way wederive the duality in N=1 SUSY QCD by identifying its crucial buildingblocks---the magnetic degrees of freedom---using only semiclassical physics andthe non-renormalization theorem.
