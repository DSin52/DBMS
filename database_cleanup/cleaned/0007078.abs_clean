We construct Nielsen-Olesen vortex solution in the noncommutative abelianHiggs model. We derive the quantized topological flux of the vortex solution.We find that the flux is integral by explicit computation in the large $\theta$limit as well as in the small $\theta$ limit. In the context of a tachyonvortex on the brane-antibrane system we demonstrate that it is this topologicalcharge that gives rise to the RR charge of the resulting BPS D-brane. We alsoconsider the left-right-symmetric gauge theory which does not have acommutative limit and construct an exact vortex solution in it.
