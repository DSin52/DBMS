In this papper, a quantum dynamical model describing the quantum measurementprocess is presented as an extensive generalization of the Coleman-Hepp model.In both the classical limit with very large quantum number and macroscopiclimit with very large particle number in measuring instrument, this modelgenerally realizes the wave packet collapse in quantum measurement as aconsequence of the Schrodinger time evolution in either the exactly-solvablecase or the non-(exactly-)solvable case.For the latter, its quasi-adiabatic case is explicitly analysed by making useof the high-order adiabatic approximation method and then manifests the wavepacket collapse as well as the exactly-solvable case. By highlighting theseanalysis, it is finally found that an essence of the dynamical model of wavepacket collapse is the factorization of the Schrodinger evolution other thanthe exact solvability. So many dynamical models including the well-known onesbefore, which are exactly-solvable or not, can be shown only to be the concreterealizations of this factorizability
