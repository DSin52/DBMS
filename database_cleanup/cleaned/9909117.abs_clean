The extended Yang-Mills gauge theory in Euclidean space is a renormalizable(by power counting) gauge theory describing a local interacting theory ofscalar, vector, and tensor gauge fields (with maximum spin 2). In this articlewe study the quantum aspects and various generalizations of this model inEuclidean space. In particular the quantization of the pure gauge model in acommon class of covariant gauges is performed. We generalize the pure gaugesector by including matter fermions in the adjoint representation of the gaugegroup and analyze its N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric extensions. We show that themaximum half-integer spin contained in these fermion fields in dimension 4 is3/2. Moreover we develop an extension of this theory so as to include internalgauge symmetries and the coupling to bosonic matter fields. The spontaneoussymmetry breaking of the extended gauge symmetry is also analyzed.
