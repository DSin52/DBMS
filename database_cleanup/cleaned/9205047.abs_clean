Renormalization group equations for massless GUT's in curved space-time withnon-trivial topology are formulated. The asymptotics of the effective actionboth at high and low energies are obtained. It is shown that the Casimir energycontribution at high curvature (early Universe) becomes non-essential in theeffective action.
