We analyze the moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau threefolds and their associatedconformally invariant nonlinear sigma-models and show that they are describedby an unexpectedly rich geometrical structure. Specifically, the Kahler sectorof the moduli space of such Calabi-Yau conformal theories admits adecomposition into adjacent domains some of which correspond to the(complexified) Kahler cones of topologically distinct manifolds. These domainsare separated by walls corresponding to singular Calabi-Yau spaces in which thespacetime metric has degenerated in certain regions. We show that the union ofthese domains is isomorphic to the complex structure moduli space of a singletopological Calabi-Yau space---the mirror. In this way we resolve a puzzle formirror symmetry raised by the apparent asymmetry between the Kahler and complexstructure moduli spaces of a Calabi-Yau manifold. Furthermore, using mirrorsymmetry, we show that we can interpolate in a physically smooth manner betweenany two theories represented by distinct points in the Kahler moduli space,even if such points correspond to topologically distinct spaces. Spacetimetopology change in string theory, therefore, is realized by the most basicoperation of deformation by a truly marginal operator. Finally, this work alsoyields some important insights on the nature of orbifolds in string theory.
