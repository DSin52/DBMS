We discuss a model in which the fundamental scale of gravity is restricted to10^{-3} eV. An observable modification of gravity occurs simultaneously at theHubble distance and at around 0.1 mm. These predictions can be tested both bythe table-top experiments and by cosmological measurements. The model isformulated as a brane-world theory embedded in a space with two or moreinfinite-volume extra dimensions. Gravity on the brane reproduces thefour-dimensional laws at observable distances but turns to the high-dimensionalbehavior at larger scales. To determine the crossover distance we smooth outthe singularities in the Green's functions by taking into account softening ofthe graviton propagator due to the high-dimensional operators that aresuppressed by the fundamental scale. We find that irrespective of the precisenature of microscopic gravity the ultraviolet and infrared scales ofgravity-modification are rigidly correlated. This fixes the fundamental scaleof gravity at 10^{-3} eV. The result persists for nonzero thickness branes.
