An expansion in the number of spatial covariant derivatives is carried out tocompute the $\zeta$-function regularized effective action of 2+1-dimensionalfermions at finite temperature in an arbitrary non-Abelian background. The realand imaginary parts of the Euclidean effective action are computed up to termswhich are ultraviolet finite. The expansion used preserves gauge and paritysymmetries and the correct multivaluation under large gauge transformations aswell as the correct parity anomaly are reproduced. The result is shown tocorrectly reproduce known limiting cases, such as massless fermions, zerotemperature, and weak fields as well as exact results for some Abelianconfigurations. Its connection with chiral symmetry is discussed.
