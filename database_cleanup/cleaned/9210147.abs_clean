During the last few years, interest has arisen in using light-frontTamm-Dancoff field theory to describe relativistic bound states for theoriessuch as QCD. Unfortunately, difficult renormalization problems stand in theway. We introduce a general, non-perturbative approach to renormalization thatis well suited for the ultraviolet and, presumably, the infrared divergencesfound in these systems. We reexpress the renormalization problem in terms of aset of coupled inhomogeneous integral equations, the ``counterterm equation.''The solution of this equation provides a kernel for the Tamm-Dancoff integralequations which generates states that are independent of any cutoffs. We alsointroduce a Rayleigh-Ritz approach to numerical solution of the countertermequation. Using our approach to renormalization, we examine several ultravioletdivergent models. Finally, we use the Rayleigh-Ritz approach to find thecounterterms in terms of allowed operators of a theory.
