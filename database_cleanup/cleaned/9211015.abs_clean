We present a detailed calculation of the entropy and action of $U(1)~2$dilaton black holes, and show that both quantities coincide with one quarter ofthe area of the event horizon. Our methods of calculation make it possible tofind an explanation of the rule $S = A/4$ for all static, spherically symmetricblack holes studied so far. We show that the only contribution to the entropycomes from the extrinsic curvature term at the horizon, which gives $S = A/4$independently of the charge(s) of the black hole, presence of scalar fields,etc. Previously, this result did not have a general explanation, but wasestablished on a case-by-case basis. The on-shell Lagrangian for maximallysupersymmetric extreme dilaton black holes is also calculated and shown tovanish, in agreement with the result obtained by taking the limit of theexpression obtained for black holes with regular horizon.The physical meaningof the entropy is discussed in relation to the issue of splitting of extremeblack holes.
