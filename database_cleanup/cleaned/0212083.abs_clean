In this note we investigate U(N) gauge theories with matter in thefundamental and adjoint representations of the gauge group, interacting viageneralized Yukawa terms of the form Tr[Q \Phi^n {\tilde Q}]. We find agreementbetween the matrix model and the gauge theory descriptions of these theories.The analysis leads to a partial description of the Higgs branch of the gaugetheory. We argue that the transition between phases with different unbrokenflavor symmetry groups is related to the appearance of cuts in the matrix modelcomputation.
