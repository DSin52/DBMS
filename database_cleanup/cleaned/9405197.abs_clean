The ground state of the $\SO(2n)_{1} \times \SO(2n)_{1} \over \SO(2n)_{2}$coset theories, perturbed by the $\phi^{id,id}_{adj}$ operator and those of thesine-Gordon theory, for special values of the coupling constant in theattracting regime, is the same. In the first part of this paper we extend theseresults to the $\SO(2n-1)$ cases. In the second part, we analyze the AlgebraicBethe Ansatz procedure for special points in the repulsive region. We find aone-to-one ``duality'' correspondence between these theories and those studiedin the first part of the paper. We use the gluing procedure at the massive nodeproposed by Fendley and Intriligator in order to obtain the TBA systems for thegeneralized parafermionic supersymmetric sine-Gordon model. In the third partwe propose the TBA equations for the whole class of perturbed coset models $G_k\times G_l \over G_{k+l}$ with the operator $\phi^{id,id}_{adj}$ and $G$ anon-simply-laced group generated by one of the $\G_2,\F_4,\B_n,\C_n$ algebras.
