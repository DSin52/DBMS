On the basis of Borel resummation, we propose a systematical improvement ofbounce calculus of quantum bubble nucleation rate. We study a metastablesuper-renormalizable field theory, $D$ dimensional O(N) symmetric $\phi^4$model ($D<4$) with an attractive interaction. The validity of our proposal istested in D=1 (quantum mechanics) by using the perturbation series of groundstate energy to high orders. We also present a result in D=2, based on anexplicit calculation of vacuum bubble diagrams to five loop orders.
