We investigate D-branes on a noncompact singular Calabi-Yau manifold by usingthe boundary CFT description, and calculate the open string Witten indicesbetween the boundary states. The B-type D-branes turn out to be characterizedby the properties of a compact positively curved manifold. We give geometricinterpretations to these boundary states in terms of coherent sheaves of themanifold.
