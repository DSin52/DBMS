We present a definition of the non-abelian generalisations of affine Todatheory related from the outset to vertex operator constructions of thecorresponding Kac-Moody algebra $\gh$. Reuslts concerning conjugacy classes ofthe Weyl group of the finite Lie algebra $\fing$ to embeddings of $A_1$ in$\fing$ are used both to present the theories, and to elucidate their solitonspectrum. We confirm the conjecture of \cite{OSU93} for the solitonspecialisation of the Leznov-Saveliev solution. The energy-momentum tensor ofsuch theories is shown to split into a total derivative part and a partdependent only on the free fields which appear in the general solution, andvanish for the soliton solutions. Analogues are provided of the results knownfor the classical solitons of abelian Toda theories.
