Title: The quantum de Rham complexes associated with $SL_h(2)$

Comments: 15 pages

Quantum de Rham complexes on the quantum plane and the quantum group itselfare constructed for the Zakrewski deformation of $ Fun ( SL(2)) $. As aby-product a new deformation of the two dimensional Heisenberg algeb ra isconstructed which can be used to construct models of h-deformed quantummechanics.
