refs. added. in v3 organization changed, more detailed investigationpresentedWe discuss the relations of the M-9-brane with other branes via dimensionalreductions, mainly focusing on their Wess-Zumino (WZ) actions. It is shown thaton three kinds of dimensional reductions, the WZ action of the M-9-branerespectively gives those of the D-8-brane, the ``KK-8A brane'' (which we regardas a kind of D-8-brane) and the ``NS-9A brane'', the last two actions of whichwere obtained via dualities. Based on these results, we conclude that therelation of p-branes for $p\ge 8$, proposed previously, is consistent from theviewpoint of worldvolume actions.
