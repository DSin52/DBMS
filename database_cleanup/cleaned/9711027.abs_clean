We consider solutions to the cosmological equations of motion in 11dimensions with and without 4-form charges. We show explicitly thecorrespondence between some of these solutions and known solutions in 10dimensional string gravity. New solutions involving combinations of 4-formcharges are explored. We also speculate on the possibility of removingcurvature singularities present in 10D theories by oxidizing to 11D.
