The strong coupling behavior of finite temperature free energy in N=4supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory has been recently discussed by Gubser,Klebanov and Tseytlin in the context of AdS-SYM correspondence. In this note,we focus on the weak coupling behavior. As a result of a two-loop computationwe obtain, in the large N 't Hooft limit, $F(g^2N\to 0)\approxcoupling expansion provides further indication that free energy is a smoothmonotonic function of the coupling constant.
