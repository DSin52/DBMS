Title: On the Local Finite Density Relativistic Quantum Field Theories

Comments: 5 pages, 1 figure in RevTeX format. (Minor changes of the text and an

updating of the references are made)It is found that, in addition to the conventional ones, a local approach tothe relativistic quantum field theories at both zero and finite densityconsistent with the violation of Bell like inequalities should contain, andprovide solutions to at least three additional problems, namely, 1) thestatistical gauge invariance 2) the dark components of the local observablesand 3) the fermion statistical block effects, base upon an asymptoticnon-thermo ensemble. An application to models are presented to show therelevance of the discussions.
