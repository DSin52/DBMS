Title: The solution to Slavnov--Taylor identities in a general four dimensional

supersymmetric theoryAuthors: Igor Kondrashuk

Comments: 7 pages, no figures, two minor corrections, one notation is changed

A solution to Slavnov-Taylor identities in a general four dimensional N=1supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory containing arbitrary matter superfields isproposed. The solution proposed appears just a simple generalization of ananalogous solution in the pure supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.
