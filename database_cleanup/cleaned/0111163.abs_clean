We propose a correspondence between the physics of certain small charge blackholes in AdS_k x S^l and large charge black holes in AdS_l x S^k. The curvaturesingularities of these solutions arise, following Myers and Tafjord, from acondensate of giant gravitons. When the number of condensed giants N_g is muchgreater than the number of background branes N, we propose that the system hasan equivalent description in terms of N giant gravitons condensed in abackground created by N_g branes. Our primary evidence is an exactcorrespondence between gravitational entropy formulae of small and large chargesolutions in different dimensions.
