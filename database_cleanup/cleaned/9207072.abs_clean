In this paper we consider extensions of the super Virasoro algebra by one andtwo super primary fields. Using a non-explicitly covariant approach we computeall SW-algebras with one generator of dimension up to 7 in addition to thesuper Virasoro field. In complete analogy to W-algebras with two generatorsmost results can be classified using the representation theory of the superVirasoro algebra. Furthermore, we find that the SW(3/2, 11/2)-algebra can berealized as a subalgebra of SW(3/2, 5/2) at c = 10/7. We also construct somenew SW-algebras with three generators, namely SW(3/2, 3/2, 5/2), SW(3/2, 2, 2)and SW(3/2, 2, 5/2).
