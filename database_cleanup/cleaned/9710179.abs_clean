We describe mirror symmetry in N=2 superconformal field theories in terms ofa dynamical topology changing process of the principal fiber bundle associatedwith a topological membrane. We show that the topological symmetries ofCalabi-Yau sigma-models can be obtained from discrete geometric transformationsof compact Chern-Simons gauge theory coupled to charged matter fields. Wedemonstrate that the appearence of magnetic monopole-instantons, whichinterpolate between topologically inequivalent vacua of the gauge theory,implies that the discrete symmetry group of the worldsheet theory is realizedkinematically in three dimensions as the magnetic flux symmetry group. Fromthis we construct the mirror map and show that it corresponds to theinterchange of topologically non-trivial matter field and gauge degrees offreedom. We also apply the mirror transformation to the mean field theory ofthe quantum Hall effect. We show that it maps the Jain hierarchy into a newhierarchy of states in which the lowest composite fermions have the samefilling fractions.
