The algebra of conserved observables of the SO(4,1) gauge-invariant theory ofthe Dirac fermions in the external field of the Kaluza-Klein monopole isinvestigated. It is shown that the Dirac conserved operators have physicalparts associated with Pauli operators that are also conserved in the sense ofthe Klein-Gordon theory. In this way one gets simpler methods of analyzing theproperties of the conserved Dirac operators and their main algebraic structuresincluding the representations of dynamical algebras governing the Dirac quantummodes.
