We calculate the effective action for Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) in D=2,3dimensions at the quadratic approximation in the gauge fields. We analyse theanalytic structure of the corresponding nonlocal boson propagatorsnonperturbatively in k/m. In two dimensions for any nonzero fermion mass, weend up with one massless pole for the gauge boson . We also calculate in D=2the effective potential between two static charges separated by a distance Land find it to be a linearly increasing function of L in agreement with thebosonized theory (massive Sine-Gordon model). In three dimensions we findnonperturbatively in k/m one massive pole in the effective bosonic actionleading to screening. Fitting the numerical results we derive a simpleexpression for the functional dependence of the boson mass upon thedimensionless parameter e^{2}/m .
