On the basis of the collective field method, we analyze theCalogero--Sutherland model (CSM) and the Selberg--Aomoto integral, whichdefines, in particular case, the partition function of the matrix models.Vertex operator realizations for some of the eigenstates (the Jack polynomials)of the CSM Hamiltonian are obtained. We derive Virasoro constraint for thegeneralized matrix models and indicate relations with the CSM operators.Similar results are presented for the $q$--deformed case (the Macdonaldoperator and polynomials), which gives the generating functional of infinitelymany conserved charges in the CSM.
