We obtain the complete physical spectrum of the $W_N$ string, for arbitrary$N$. The $W_N$ constraints freeze $N-2$ coordinates, while the remainingcoordinates appear in the currents only {\it via} their energy-momentum tensor.The spectrum is then effectively described by a set of ordinary Virasoro-likestring theories, but with a non-critical value for the central charge and adiscrete set of non-standard values for the spin-2 intercepts. In particular,the physical spectrum of the $W_N$ string includes the usual massless states ofthe Virasoro string. By looking at the norms of low-lying states, we findstrong indications that all the $W_N$ strings are unitary.
