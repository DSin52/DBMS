Title: Membranes and Matrix Models

Authors: Jens Hoppe

Section I contains introductory remarks about surface motions. Section IIgives a detailed derivation of $H=-\Delta-Tr\sum_{i<j}[X_i,X_j]^2$ asdescribing a quantized discrete analogue of relativistically invariant membranedynamics. Section III concerns the question of zero-energy bound-states inSU(N)-invariant supersymmetric matrix models. Section IV discusses the space ofsolutions of some differential matrix equations on $(-\infty,+\infty)$,interpolating between different representations of $su(2)$. Some exercises areadded, and one remark/conjecture concerning 5-commutators.
