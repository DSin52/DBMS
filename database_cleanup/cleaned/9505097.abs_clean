Comments: Proceedings of the Meeting on Quaternionic Structures in Mathematics

and Physics, Trieste, September 1994; ILAS/FM-6/1996, p.109--134. Minorcorrection and one additional referenceWe describe special Ka\"hler geometry, special quaternionic manifolds, andvery special real manifolds and analyze the structure of their isometries. Theclassification of the homogeneous manifolds of these types is presented.
