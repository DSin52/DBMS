An $SO(9,1)$ invariant formulation of an 11-dimensional supermembrane ispresented by combining an $SO(10,1)$ invariant treatment of reparametrizationsymmetry with an $SO(9,1)$ invariant $\theta_{R} = 0$ gauge of$\kappa$-symmetry. The Lagrangian thus defined consists of polynomials indynamical variables (up to quartic terms in $X^{\mu}$ and up to the eighthpower in $\theta$), and reparametrization BRST symmetry is manifest. The areapreserving diffeomorphism is consistently incorporated and the area preservinggauge symmetry is made explicit. The $SO(9,1)$ invariant theory contains termswhich cannot be induced by a naive dimensional reduction of higher dimensionalsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The $SO(9,1)$ invariant Hamiltonian and thegenerator of area preserving diffeomorphism together with the supercharge arematrix regularized by applying the standard procedure. As an application of thepresent formulation, we evaluate the possible central charges in superalgebraboth in path integral and in canonical (Dirac) formalism, and we find only thetwo-form charge $[X^\mu, X^\nu]$.
