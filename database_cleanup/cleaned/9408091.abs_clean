The Coleman-Hill theorem prohibits the appearance of radiative corrections tothe topological mass (more precisely, to the parity-odd part of the vacuumpolarization tensor at zero momentum) in a wide class of abelian gauge theoriesin 2+1 dimensions. We re-express the theorem in terms of the effective actionrather than in terms of the vacuum polarization tensor. The theorem so restatedbroken scalar Chern-Simons electrodynamics, obeys the new non-renormalizationtheorem. Whereas the vacuum polarization {\sl does} receive a one-loop,parity-odd correction, this does not translate to a radiative contribution tothe Chern-Simons term in the effective action. We also point out a newsituation, involving scalar fields and parity-odd couplings, which wasoverlooked in the original analysis, where the conditions of the theorem aresatisfied and where the topological mass does, in fact, get a radiativecorrection.
