We study curves of marginal stability (CMS) in five-dimensional N=1 E_Ntheories compactified on a circle using the D3-brane probe realization. In thisrealization, BPS states correspond to string webs in the affine E_N 7-branebackground and junction positions of the webs deteremine CMS. We find thatthere exist string webs involving infinitely many junctions. Consequently theE_N theories have infinitely many CMS. We also find that there exists atransition from open strings to string webs involving loops. The transitiondescribes a new phenomenon occurring on CMS.
