389-401A pseudoclassical theories of Majorana, Weyl and Majorana--Weyl particles inthe space--time dimensions $D=2n$ are constructed. The canonical quantizationof these theories is carried out and as a result we obtain the quantummechanical description of neutral particle in $D=2n$ , Weyl particle in $D=2n$and neutral Weyl particle in $D=4n+2$. In $D=2,4({\rm mod}8)$ dimensionalspace--time the description of the neutral particle coincides with the fieldtheoretical description of the Majorana particle in the Foldy--Wouthuysenrepresentation. In $D=8k+2$ dimensions the neutral Weyl particle coincides withthe Majorana--Weyl particle in the Foldy--Wouthuysen representation.
