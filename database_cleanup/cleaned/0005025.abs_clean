We address the question of cosmological perturbations in the context of branecosmology, where our Universe is a three-brane where matter is confined,whereas gravity lives in a higher dimensional spacetime. The equationsgoverning the bulk perturbations are computed in the case of a general warpeduniverse. The results are then specialized to the case of a five-dimensionalspacetime, scenario which has recently attracted a lot of attention. In thiscontext, we decompose the perturbations into `scalar', `vector' and `tensor'modes, which are familiar in the standard theory of cosmological perturbations.The junction conditions, which relate the metric perturbations to the matterperturbations in the brane, are then computed.
