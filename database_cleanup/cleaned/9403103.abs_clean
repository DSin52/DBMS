For the `classical' formulation of a massive spinning particle, thepropagator is obtained along with the spin factor. We treat the system with twokinds of constraints that were recently shown to be concerned with thereparametrization invariance and `quasi-supersymmetry'. In the path integral,the BRST invariant Lagrangian is used and the same spin factor is obtained asin the pseudo-classical formulation.
