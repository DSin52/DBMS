Setting an ansats that the metric is expressible by a power series of theinverse radius and taking a particular gauge choice, we construct a "generalsolution" of (2+1)-dimensional Einstein's equations with a negativecosmological constant in the case where the spacetime is asymptotically anti-deSitter. Our general solution turns out to be parametrized by two centrallyextended quadratic differentials on $S^{1}$. In order to include 3-dimensionalBlack Holes naturally into our general solution, it is necessary to exclude theregion inside the horizon. We also discuss the relation of our general solutionto the moduli space of flat $\tilde{SL}(2,R)\times\tilde{SL}(2,R)$ connections.
