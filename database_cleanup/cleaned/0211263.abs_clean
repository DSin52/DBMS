The Seiberg-Witten limit of fermionic N=2 string theory with nonvanishingB-field is governed by noncommutative self-dual Yang-Mills theory (ncSDYM) in2+2 dimensions. Conversely, the self-duality equations are contained in theequation of motion of N=2 string field theory in a B-field background.Therefore finding solutions to noncommutative self-dual Yang-Mills theory onR^{2,2} might help to improve our understanding of nonperturbative propertiesof string (field) theory. In this paper, we construct nonlinear soliton-likeand multi-plane wave solutions of the ncSDYM equations corresponding to certainD-brane configurations by employing a solution generating technique, anextension of the so-called dressing approach. The underlying Lax pair isdiscussed in two different gauges, the unitary and the hermitean gauge. Severalexamples and applications for both situations are considered, including abeliansolutions constructed from GMS-like projectors, noncommutative U(2)soliton-like configurations and interacting plane waves. We display acorrespondence to earlier work on string field theory and argue that thesolutions found here can serve as a guideline in the search for nonperturbativesolutions of nonpolynomial string field theory.
