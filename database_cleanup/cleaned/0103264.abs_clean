In the warped compactification with a single Randall-Sundrum brane, apuzzling claim has been made that scalar fields can be bound to the brane buttheir Hodge dual higher-rank anti-symmetric tensors cannot. By explicitlyrequiring the Hodge duality, a prescription to resolve this puzzle was recentlyproposed by Duff and Liu. In this note, we implement the Hodge duality via pathintegral formulation in the presence of the background gravity fields of warpedcompactifications. It is shown that the prescription of Duff and Liu can benaturally understood within this framework.
