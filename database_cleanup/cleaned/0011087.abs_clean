an appendix addedBased on experimental evidences supporting the hypothesis that neutrinosmight be tachyonic fermions, a new Dirac-type equation is proposed and aspin-1/2 tachyonic quantum theory is developed. The new Dirac-type equationprovides a solution for the puzzle of negative mass-square of neutrinos. Thisequation can be written in two spinor equations coupled together via nonzeromass while respecting the maximum parity violation, and it reduces to one Weylequation in the massless limit. Some peculiar features of tachyonic neutrinoare discussed in this theoretical framework.
