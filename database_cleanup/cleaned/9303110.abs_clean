We study the subdivision properties of certain lattice gauge theories basedon the groups $Z_{2}$ and $Z_{3}$, in four dimensions. The Boltzmann weightsare shown to be invariant under all type $(k,l)$ subdivision moves, at certaindiscrete values of the coupling parameter. The partition function then providesa combinatorial invariant of the underlying simplicial complex, at least whenthere is no boundary. We also show how an extra phase factor arises whencomparing Boltzmann weights under the Alexander moves, where the boundaryundergoes subdivision.
