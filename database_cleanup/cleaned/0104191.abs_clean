Comments: 16 pages

SystemsThe super Moyal-Lax representation and the super Moyal momentum algebra areintroduced and the properties of simple and extended supersymmetric integrablemodels are systematically investigated. It is shown that, much like in thebosonic cases, the super Moyal-Lax equation can be interpreted as a Hamiltonianequation and can be derived from an action. Similarly, we show that theparameter of non-commutativity, in this case, is related to the central chargeof the second Hamiltonian structure of the system. The super Moyal-Laxdescription allows us to go to the dispersionless limit of these models in asingular limit and we discuss some of the properties of such systems.
