We discuss the proposal of Hata and Kawano for the tachyon fluctuation arounda solution of vacuum string field theory representing a D25 brane. We give aconformal field theory construction of their state -- a local insertion of atachyon vertex operator on the sliver surface state, and explain why theon-shell momentum condition emerges correctly. We also show that a naivecomputation of the D25-brane tension using data for the three point coupling ofthis state gives an answer that is $(\pi^2/3)(16/27\ln 2)^3 \simeq 2.0558$times the expected answer. We demonstrate that this problem arises because theHK state does not satisfy the equations of motion in a strong sense requiredfor the computation of D-brane tension from the on-shell 3-tachyon coupling.
