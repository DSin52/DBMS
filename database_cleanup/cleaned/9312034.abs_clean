We investigate recent claims concerning a new class of cosmic stringsolutions in the Weinberg-Salam model. They have the general form of previouslydiscussed semi-local and electroweak strings, but are modified by the presenceof a non-zero W-condensate in the core of the string. We explicitly constructsuch solutions for arbitrary values of the winding number $N$. We then provethat they are gauge equivalent to bare electroweak strings with winding number$N-1$. We also develop new asymptotic expressions for large-$N$ strings.
