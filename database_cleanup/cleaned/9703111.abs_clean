A many variable $q$-calculus is introduced using the formalism of braidedcovector algebras. Its properties when certain of its deformation parametersare roots of unity are discussed in detail, and related to fractionalsupersymmetry. The special cases of two dimensional supersymmetry andfractional supersymmetry are developed in detail.
