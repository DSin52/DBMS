We study low-energy propagation modes on string network lattice.Specifically, we consider an infinite two-dimensional regular hexagonal stringnetwork and analyze the low frequency propagation modes on it. The fluctuationmodes tangent to the two-dimensional plane respect the spatial rotationalsymmetry on the plane, and are described by Maxwell theory. The gauge symmetrycomes from the marginal deformation of changing the sizes of the loops of thelattice. The effective Lorentz symmetry respected at low energy will beviolated at high energy.
