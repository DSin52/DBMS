We investigate the generation of curvature and isocurvature (dilaton, moduliand axion) perturbations in a general class of axion-dilaton-modulimodels,including the pre-big bang scenario. Allowing for an arbitrary couplingconstant between the dilaton field and the axion field, we exploit the SL(2,R)symmetry of the theory to obtain the spectral indices of the fieldperturbations in a pre-big bang type scenario. Axion field fluctuations about ahomogeneous background field can yield a scale-invariant (Harrison-Zel'dovich)spectrum. As an example we present a string-motivated case with SL(2,R)xSL(2,R)symmetry, where a second axion field arises from the compactification of theten-dimensional theory to four dimensions.
