results for the wave function, version as it will appear in the MichaelMarinov Memorial Volume, "Multiple facets of quantization and supersymmetry",edited by M. Olshanetsky and A. Vainshtein (World Scientific)We attempt to deal with the orbifold singularities in the moduli space offlat connections for supersymmetric gauge theories on the torus. At thesesingularities the energy gap in the transverse fluctuations vanishes and theresulting breakdown of the adiabatic approximation is resolved by consideringthe full set of zero-momentum fields. These can not be defined globally, due tothe problem of Gribov copies. For this reason we restrict the fields to thefundamental domain, containing no gauge copies, but requiring a boundarycondition in field space.
