We study a three dimensional conformal field theory in terms of its partitionfunction on arbitrary curved spaces. The large $N$ limit of the nonlinear sigmamodel at the non-trivial fixed point is shown to be an example of a conformalfield theory, using zeta--function regularization. We compute the criticalproperties of this model in various spaces of constant curvature ($R^2 \timesS^1$, $S^1\times S^1 \times R$, $S^2\times R$, $H^2\times R$, $S^1 \times S^1\times S^1$ and $S^2 \times S^1$) and we argue that what distinguishes thedifferent cases is not the Riemann curvature but the conformal class of themetric. In the case $H^2\times R$ (constant negative curvature), the $O(N)$symmetry is spontaneously broken at the critical point. In the case $S^2\timesR$ (constant positive curvature) we find that the free energy vanishes,consistent with conformal equivalence of this manifold to $R^3$, although thecorrelation length is finite. In the zero curvature cases, the correlationlength is finite due to finite size effects. These results describe twodimensional quantum phase transitions or three dimensional classical ones.
