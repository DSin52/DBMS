The non-perturbative ultraviolet divergence of the sine-Gordon model is usedto study the $k^+ = 0$ region of light-cone perturbation theory. The light-conevacuum is shown to be unstable at the non-perturbative $\beta^2 = 8\pi$critical point by a light-cone version of Coleman's variational method. Vacuumbubbles, which are $k^+=0$ diagrams in light-cone field theory and areindividually finite and non-vanishing for all $\beta$, conspire to generateultraviolet divergences of the light-cone energy density. The $k^+ = 0$ regionof momentum also contributes to connected Green's functions; the connected twopoint function will not diverge, as it should, at the critical point unlessdiagrams which contribute only at $k^+ = 0$ are properly included. Thisanalysis shows in a simple way how the $k^+ =0$ region cannot be ignored evenfor connected diagrams. This phenomenon is expected to occur in higherdimensional gauge theories starting at two loop order in light-coneperturbation theory.
