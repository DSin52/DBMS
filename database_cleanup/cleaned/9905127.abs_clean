It has been conjectured that the Abelian projection of QCD is responsible forthe confinement of color. Using a gauge independent definition of the Abelianprojection which does {\it not} employ any gauge fixing, we provide a strongevidence for the Abelian dominance in Wilson loop integral. In specific weprove that the gauge potential which contributes to the Wilson loop integral isprecisely the one restricted by the Abelian projection.
