The structure and properties of possible $q$-Minkowski spaces is discussed,and the corresponding non-commutative differential calculi are developed indetail and compared with already existing proposals. This is done by stressingits covariance properties as described by appropriate reflection equations.Some isomorphisms among the space-time and derivative algebras aredemonstrated, and their representations are described briefly. Finally, somephysical consequences and open problems are discussed.
