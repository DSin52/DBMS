Title: Five-dimensional scenario with a fluctuating three-brane

approach to gravityAuthors: Israel Quiros (Universidad Central de Las Villas. Santa Clara. Cuba)

Comments: 2 2 pages, Revtex, no figures. Some equations in section V have been

corrected and, in correspondence, the discussion of the cosmological constantproblem has been reconsidered. The results are unchangedA five-dimensional scenario with a non compact extra dimension of infiniteextent is studied, in which a single three-brane is affected by small Gaussianfluctuations in the extra dimension. The average magnitude of the fluctuationsis of order of the electro-weak length scale ($\sigma\sim m_{EW}^{-1}$). Themodel provides an stochastic approach to gravity that accounts for analternative resolution of the mass hierarchy problem. The cosmological constantproblem can be suitably treated as well. Surprisingly the Mach's principlefinds a place in the model. It is argued that the Mach's principle, the masshierarchy and the cosmological constant problem, are different aspects of ascenarios are recovered in the "no-fluctuations" limit ($\sigma\to 0$).
