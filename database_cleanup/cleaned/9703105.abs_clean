We reformulate time evolution of systems in mixed states in terms of theclassical observables of correlators using the Weyl correspondence rule. Theresulting equation of motion for the Wigner functional of the density matrix isfound to be of the Liouville type. To illustrate the methods developed, weexplicitly consider a scalar theory with quartic self-interaction and derivethe short time behaviour with the non-interacting thermal density matrix asinitial condition. In the scalar case, the complete correlator hierarchy isstudied and restrictions are derived for spatially homogeneous initialconditions and systems with unbroken symmetry.
