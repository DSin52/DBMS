We represent a classical Maxwell-Bloch equation and related to it positivepart of the AKNS hierarchy in geometrical terms. The Maxwell-Bloch evolution isgiven by an infinitesimal action of a nilpotent subalgebra $n_+$ of affine Liealgebra $\hat {sl}_2$ on a Maxwell-Bloch phase space treated as a homogeneousspace of $n_+$. A space of local integrals of motion is described usingcohomology methods. We show that hamiltonian flows associated to theMaxwell-Bloch local integrals of motion (i.e. positive AKNS flows) areidentified with an infinitesimal action of an abelian subalgebra of thenilpotent subalgebra $n_+$ on a Maxwell- Bloch phase space. Possibilities ofquantization and latticization of Maxwell-Bloch equation are discussed.
