For the case of a first-class constrained system with an equivariant momentummap, we study the conditions under which the double process of reducing to theconstraint surface and dividing out by the group of gauge transformations $G$is equivalent to the single process of dividing out the initial phase space bythe complexification $G_C$ of $G$. For the particular case of a phase spaceaction that is the lift of a configuration space action, conditions are foundunder which, in finite dimensions, the physical phase space of a gauge systemwith first-class constraints is diffeomorphic to a manifold imbedded in thephysical configuration space of the complexified gauge system. Similarconditions are shown to hold in the infinite-dimensional example of Yang-Millstheories. As a physical application we discuss the adequateness of usingholomorphic Wilson loop variables as (generalized) global coordinates on thephysical phase space of Yang-Mills theory.
