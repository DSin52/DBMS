We present a complete string theory analysis of all mixed gauge,gravitational and target-space anomalies potentially arising in the simplestheterotic Z_N orbifold models, with N odd and standard embedding. Theseanomalies turn out to be encoded in an elliptic index, which can be easilycomputed; they are found to cancel through a universal GS mechanism induced bythe dilaton multiplet. The target-space symmetry is then shown to have a nicegeometric interpretation in terms of torsion, and the target-space dependenceof the four-dimensional GS couplings can be alternatively rederived from theimplicit torsion dependence of the standard ten-dimensional GS couplings. Theresult is universal and consists essentially of a Bianchi identity for the NSNSB field depending on all the curvatures, and in particular on the target-spacecurvature.
