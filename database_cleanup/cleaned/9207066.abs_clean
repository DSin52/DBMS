We present a new parametrisation of the space of solutions of theWess-Zumino-Witten model on a cylinder, with target space a compact, connectedLie group G. Using the covariant canonical approach the phase space of thetheory is shown to be the co-tangent bundle of the loop group of the Lie groupG, in agreement with the result from the Hamiltonian approach. The Poissonbrackets in this phase space are derived. Other formulations in the literatureare shown to be obtained by locally-valid gauge-fixings in this phase space.
