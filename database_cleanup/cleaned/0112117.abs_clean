There is remarkable relation between self-dual Yang-Mills and self-dualEinstein gravity in four Euclidean dimensions. Motivated by this we investigatethe Spin(7) and G_2 invariant self-dual Yang-Mills equations in eight and sevenEuclidean dimensions and search for their possible analogs in gravitationaltheories. The reduction of the self-dual Yang-Mills equations to one dimensionresults into systems of first order differential equations. In particular, theSpin(7)-invariant case gives rise to a 7-dimensional system which is completelyintegrable. The different solutions are classified in terms of algebraic curvesand are characterized by the genus of the associated Riemann surfaces.Remarkably, this system arises also in the construction of solutions in gaugedsupergravities that have an interpretation as continuous distributions ofbranes in string and M-theory. For the G_2 invariant case we perform twodistinct reductions, both giving rise to 6-dimensional systems. The firstreduction, which is a complex generalization of the 3-dimensional Eulerspinning top system, preserves an SU(2) X SU(2) X Z_2 symmetry and is fullyintegrable in the particular case where an extra U(1) symmetry exists. Thesecond reduction we employ, generalizes the Halphen system familiar from thedynamics of monopoles. Finally, we analyze massive generalizations and presentsolitonic solutions interpolating between different degenerate vacua.
