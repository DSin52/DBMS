The gauging of free differential algebras (FDA's) produces gauge fieldtheories containing antisymmetric tensors. The FDA's extend the Cartan-Maurerequations of ordinary Lie algebras by incorporating p-form potentials ($p >1$). We study here the algebra of FDA transformations. To every p-form in theFDA we associate an extended Lie derivative $\ell$ generating a corresponding``gauge" transformation. The field theory based on the FDA is invariant underthese new transformations. This gives geometrical meaning to the antisymmetrictensors. The algebra of Lie derivatives is shown to close and provides the dualformulation of FDA's.
