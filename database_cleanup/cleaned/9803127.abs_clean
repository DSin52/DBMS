We construct BPS saturated regular configurations of N=4 SU(3) supersymmetricYang-Mills theory carrying non-parallel electric and magnetic charges. Thesefield theory BPS states correspond to the string theory BPS states of 3-stringjunctions connecting three different D3-branes by regarding the N=4supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory as an effective field theory on parallelD3-branes.
