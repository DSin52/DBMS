We calculate conformal anomalies in noncommutative gauge theories by usingthe path integral method (Fujikawa's method). Along with the axial anomaliesand chiral gauge anomalies, conformal anomalies take the form of thestraightforward Moyal deformation in the corresponding conformal anomalies inordinary gauge theories. However, the Moyal star product leads to thedifference in the coefficient of the conformal anomalies between noncommutativegauge theories and ordinary gauge theories. The $\beta$ (Callan-Symanzik)functions which are evaluated from the coefficient of the conformal anomaliescoincide with the result of perturbative analysis.
