Asymptotically locally AdS black hole geometries of dimension d > 2 arestudied for nontrivial topologies of the transverse section. These geometriesare static solutions of a set of theories labeled by an integer 0 < k <[(d-1)/2] which possess a unique globally AdS vacuum. The transverse sectionsof these solutions are d-2 surfaces of constant curvature, allowing fordifferent topological configurations. The thermodynamic analysis of thesesolutions reveals that the presence of a negative cosmological constant isessential to ensure the existence of stable equilibrium states. In addition, itis shown that these theories are holographically related to [(d-1)/2] differentconformal field theories at the boundary.
