We construct the noncommutative deformation of the Maldacena-Nunezsupergravity solution. The background describes a bound state of D5-D3 braneswrapping an S^2 inside a Calabi-Yau three-fold, and in the presence of amagnetic B-field. The dual field theory in the IR is a N=1 U(N) SYM theory withspatial noncommutativity. We show that, under certain conditions, the massiveKaluza-Klein states can be decoupled and that UV/IR mixing seems to be visiblein our solution. By calculating the quark-antiquark potential via the Wilsonloop we show confinement in the IR and strong repulsion at closer distances. Wealso compute the beta-function and show that it coincides with the recentlycalculated commutative one.
