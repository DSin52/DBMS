In recent papers of the author, a method was developed for constructingquasitriangular Hopf algebras (quantum groups) of the quantum-double type. As aby-product, a novel non-standard example of the quantum double has been found.In the present paper, a closed expression (in terms of elementary functions)for the corresponding universal R-matrix is obtained. In reduced form, when thenumber of generators becomes two instead of four, this quantum group can beinterpreted as a deformation of the Lie algebra[x,h]=2h in the context of Drinfeld's quantization program.
