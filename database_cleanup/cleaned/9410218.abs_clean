Following on from a general observation in an earlier paper, we consider thecontinuous symmetries of a certain class of conformal field theoriesconstructed from lattices and their reflection-twisted orbifolds. It is shownthat the naive expectation that the only such (inner) symmetries are generatedby the modes of the vertex operators corresponding to the states of unitconformal weight obtains, and a criterion for this expectation to hold ingeneral is proposed.
