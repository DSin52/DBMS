Goldstone's theorem states that there is a massless mode for each brokensymmetry generator. It has been known for a long time that the naivegeneralization of this counting fails to give the correct number of masslessmodes for spontaneously broken spacetime symmetries. We explain how to get theright count of massless modes in the general case, and discuss examplesinvolving spontaneously broken Poincare and conformal invariance.
