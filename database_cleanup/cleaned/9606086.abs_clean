We provide a local geometric description of how charged matter arises in typeIIA, M-theory, or F-theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds. The basicidea is to deform a higher singularity into a lower one through Cartandeformations which vary over space. The results agree with expectations basedon string dualities.
