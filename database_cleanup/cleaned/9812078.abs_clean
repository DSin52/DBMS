The prepotential and spectral curve are described for a smooth interpolationbetween an enlarged N=4 SUSY and ordinary N=2 SUSY Yang-Mills theory in fourdimensions, obtained by compactification from five dimensions with non-trivial(periodic and antiperiodic) boundary conditions. This system provides a newsolution to the generalized WDVV equations. We show that this exhausts allpossible solutions of a given functional form.
