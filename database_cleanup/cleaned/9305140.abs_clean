Title: A symplectic structure for the space of quantum field theories

Authors: E. Ramos and O. A. Soloviev

Comments: 7 pages, plain TeX

We use the formal Lie algebraic structure in the ``space'' of hamiltoniansprovided by equal time commutators to define a Kirillov-Konstant symplecticstructure in the coadjoint orbits of the associated formal group. The dual isdefined via the natural pairing between operators and states in a Hilbertspace.
