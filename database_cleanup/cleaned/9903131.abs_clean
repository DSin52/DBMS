We find an infinite dimensional free algebra which lives at large N in anySU(N)-invariant action or Hamiltonian theory of bosonic matrices. The naturalbasis of this algebra is a free-algebraic generalization of Chebyshevpolynomials and the dual basis is closely related to the planar connectedparts. This leads to a number of free-algebraic forms of the master fieldincluding an algebraic derivation of the Gopakumar-Gross form. For actiontheories, these forms of the master field immediately give a number of newfree-algebraic packagings of the planar Schwinger-Dyson equations.
