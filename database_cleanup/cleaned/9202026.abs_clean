The $CP^N$ model in three euclidean dimensions is studied in the presence ofa Chern-Simons term using the $1/N$ expansion. The $\beta$-function for the CScoefficient $\theta$ is found to be zero to order $1/N$ in the unbroken phaseby an explicit calculation. It is argued to be zero to all orders. Some remarkson the $\theta$ dependence of the critical exponents are also made.
