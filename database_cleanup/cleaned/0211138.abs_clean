solutionIn the first part of this paper, we study the back-reaction of large-N lightcone momentum on the maximally supersymmetric anti-pp-wave background. Thisgives the type IIA geometry of large-N D0-branes on curved space with fluxes.By taking an appropriate decoupling limit, we conjecture a new duality betweenstring theory on that background and dual field theory on D0-branes which wederive by calculating linear coupling terms. Agreement of decouplingquantities, SO(3) \times SO(6) isometry and Higgs branch on both theories areshown. Also we find whenever dual field theory is weakly coupled, the curvatureof the geometry is large. In the second part of this paper, we derive thesupermembrane action on a general pp-wave background only through theproperties of null Killing vector and through this, derive the Matrix model.
