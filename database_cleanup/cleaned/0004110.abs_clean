We study a similarity transformation to construct an effective Hamiltoniansystematically, which does not contain particle-number-changing interactions,by means of Fukuda-Sawada-Taketani-Okubo's method. We show that suchHamiltonian can be constructed from Feynman diagrams and give rules forconstructing it in the Light-Front Yukawa model. We prove that it isrenormalized by the familiar covariant perturbative renormalization procedure.It is very advantageous that the effective Hamiltonian can be obtained from ourrules {\em immediately}. We also numerically diagonalize it to the second orderin the coupling constant as an exercise.
