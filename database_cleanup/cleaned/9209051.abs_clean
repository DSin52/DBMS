July 1991)The BRST cohomology analysis of Lian and Zuckerman leads to physical statesat all ghost number for $c<1$ matter coupled to Liouville gravity. We show howthese states are related to states at ghost numbers zero(pure vertex operatorstates -- DK states) and ghost number one(ring elements) by means of descentequations. These descent equations follow from the double cohomology of theString BRST and Felder BRST operators. We briefly discuss how the ring elementsallow one to determine all correlation functions on the sphere.
