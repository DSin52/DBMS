We study the classical geometry associated to fractional D3-branes of typeIIB string theory on R^4/Z_2 which provide the gravitational dual for N=2 superYang-Mills theory in four dimensions. As one can expect from the lack ofconformal invariance on the gauge theory side, the gravitational backgrounddisplays a repulson-like singularity. It turns out however, that suchsingularity can be excised by an enhancon mechanism. The complete knowledge ofthe classical supergravity solution allows us to identify the coupling constantof the dual gauge theory in terms of the string parameters and to find alogarithmic running that is governed precisely by the beta-function of the N=2super Yang-Mills theory.
