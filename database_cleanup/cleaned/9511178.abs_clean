We review the status of duality symmetries in superstring theories. Thesediscrete symmetries mark the striking differences between theories of pointlikeobjects and theories of extended objects. They prove to be very helpful inunderstanding non-perturbative effects in string theories. We will also brieflydiscuss the strange role played by open strings and their solitons in theemerging scenario.
