The complete quantum theory of covariant closed strings is constructed indetail. The action is defined by elementary vertices satisfying recursionrelations that give rise to Jacobi-like identities for an infinite chain ofstring field products. The genus zero string field algebra is the homotopy Liealgebra $L_\infty$, and the higher genus algebraic structure implies theBatalin-Vilkovisky (BV) master equation. From these structures on the off-shellstate space, we show how to derive the $L_\infty$ algebra, and the BV equationon physical states, recently constructed in d=2 string theory. The stringdiagrams are surfaces with minimal area metrics, foliated by closed geodesicsof length $2\pi$. These metrics generalize quadratic differentials in thatfoliation bands can cross. The string vertices are succinctly characterized;they include the surfaces whose foliation bands are all of height smaller than$2\pi$.--While this is not a review paper, an effort was made to give a fairlycomplete and accessible account of the quantum closed string field theory.--
