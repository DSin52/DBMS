Title: Scale Invariance in the Causal Approach to Renormalization Theory

Comments: LATEX 2e, 34 pages, some errors fixed

The dilation invariance is studied in the framework of Epstein-Glaserapproach to renormalization theory. Some analogues of the Callan-Symanzikequations are found and they are applied to the scalar field theory and toYang-Mills models. We find the interesting result that, if all the fields ofthe theory have zero masses, then from purely cohomological consideration, onecan obtain the anomalous terms of logarithmic type.
