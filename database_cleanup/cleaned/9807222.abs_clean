Title: The Confining N=1 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories

Comments: 12 pages, LaTeX. Talk presented at the 3rd Workshop on Continuous

Advances in QCD, Minneapolis, MN, 16-19 April 1998. To appear in theproceedingsWe give a classification and overview of the confining N=1 supersymmetricgauge theories. For simplicity we consider only theories based on simple gaugegroups and no tree-level superpotential. Classification of these theories canbe done according to whether or not there is a superpotential generated for theconfined degrees of freedom. The theories with the superpotential includes-confining theories and also theories where the gauge fields participate inthe confining spectrum, while theories with no superpotential include theorieswith a quantum deformed moduli space and theories with an affine moduli space.
