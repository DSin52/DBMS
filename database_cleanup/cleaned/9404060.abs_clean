The idea of minimum distance, familiar from R <-> 1/R duality when the stringtarget space is a circle, is analyzed for less trivial geometries. Theparticular geometry studied is that of a blown-up quotient singularity within aCalabi-Yau space and mirror symmetry is used to perform the analysis. It isfound that zero distances can appear but that in many cases this requires otherdistances within the same target space to be infinite. In other cases zerodistances can occur without compensating infinite distances.
