We elaborate an explicit example of dimensional reduction of the freemassless Dirac operator with SU(3)-symmetry, defined on 12-dimensionalmanifold, which is the total space of principle SU(3)-bundle over 4-dimensionalmanifold. It turns out that after the dimensional reduction we obtain the"usual" Dirac operator, defined on 4-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian (non-flat)manifold but with mass term, acting on two spinor SU(3)-octets in the presenceof gauge field with structure group SU(3) and source term depending on thestress tensor of the gauge field. The group of symmetry SU(3) is chosen becauseit is a classifying group for the Standard model and in the same time iscomplicated enough to demonstrate all the details in the general case. We payattention and point out the crucial moments in the procedure of the dimensionalreduction, where the new structures (gauge field with structure group SU(3),its stress tenzor, two spinor SU(3)-octets and mass term) arise.
