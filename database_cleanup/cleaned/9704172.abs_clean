Title: Absorption of fixed scalars

Comments: 12 pages, ReVTeX

We calculate the absorption rates of fixed scalars by near extremal fivedimensional black holes carrying general one-brane and five-brane charges bysemi-classical and D-brane methods. We find that the absorption cross-sectionsdo not in general agree for either fixed scalar and we discuss possibleexplanations of the discrepancy.
