We show that in 2+1 dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics an external magneticfield applied to a finite density of massless fermions is screened, due to a$2+1$-dimensional realization of the underlying $2$-dimensional axial anomalyof the space components of the electric current. This is shown to implyscreening of the magnetic field, i.e., the Meissner effect. We discuss thephysical implications of this result.
