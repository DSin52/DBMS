The general structure of the matter Kahler metric in the $\kappa^{2/3}$expansion of Horava-Witten M-theory with nonstandard embeddings is examined. Itis shown that phenomenological models based on this structure can lead toYukawa and V$_{\rm CKM}$ hierarchies (consistent with all data) withoutintroducing ad hoc small parameters if the 5-branes lie near the distantorbifold plane and the instanton charges of the physical plane vanish. M-theorythus offers an alternate way of describing these hierarchies, different fromthe conventional models of Yukawa textures.
