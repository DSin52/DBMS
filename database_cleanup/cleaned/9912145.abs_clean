We consider several properties of a set of anti-D$p$-branes in the presenceof orientifold $p$-planes in type II theory. This system breaks all thesupersymmetries of the theory, but is free of tachyons. In particular, wecenter on the case of a single anti-D$p$-brane stuck at a negatively chargedorientifold $p$-plane, and study its strong coupling behaviour for $p=2,3,4$.Interestingly enough, as the coupling increases the system undergoes a phasetransition where an additional antibrane is created. We conclude with someremarks on the limit of large number of antibranes on top of orientifoldplanes.
