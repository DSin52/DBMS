Using canonical method the Liouville theory has been obtained as agravitational Wess-Zumino action of the Polyakov string. From this approach itis clear that the form of the Liouville action is the consequence of thebosonic representation of the Virasoro algebra, and that the coefficient infront of the action is proportional to the central charge and measures thequantum braking of the classical symmetry.
