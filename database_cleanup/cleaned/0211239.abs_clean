Title: On the Group Structure of the Kalb-Ramond Gauge Symmetry

Authors: M. Botta Cantcheff (CBPF-GFT)

Comments: 7 pages

The transformation properties of a Kalb-Ramond field are those of a gaugefield; however, it is not clear which is the group structure thesetransformations are associated with. The purpose of this letter is to establisha basic framework in order to clarify the group structure underneath the 2-formgauge potential.
