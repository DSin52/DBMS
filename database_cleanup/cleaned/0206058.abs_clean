We study the IR/UV connection in non-commutative $\phi^{3}$ theory as well asin non-commutative QED from the point of view of the dispersion relation forthe self-energy. We show that, although the imaginary part of the self-energyis well behaved as the parameter of non-commutativity vanishes, the real partbecomes divergent as a consequence of the high energy behavior of thedispersion integral. Some other interesting features that arise from thisanalysis are also briefly discussed.
