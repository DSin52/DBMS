Title: Applications of Supersymmetric Matrix Models

Comments: 9 pages, Latex (sprocl.sty used), Talk at the 2nd Int. Sakharov Conf.

on Physics, Moscow May 20-24, 1996Matrix models have wide applications in nuclear theory, condensed mattertheory and quantum field theory. I discuss supersymmetric extensions of matrixmodels and their applications to branched polymers, the meander problem, andsuperstrings in lower dimensions.
