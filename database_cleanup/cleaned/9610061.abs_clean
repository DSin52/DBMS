The stimulated emission of massless bosons by a relativistic and the CGHSblack hole are studied for real and complex scalar fields. The radiationsinduced by one-particle and thermal states are considered and their thermalproperties investigated near the horizon. These exhibit both thermal andnon-thermal properties for the two black-hole models.
