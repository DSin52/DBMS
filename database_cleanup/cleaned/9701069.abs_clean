In these notes we attempt to give a pedagogical introduction to the work ofSeiberg and Witten on S-duality and the exact results of N=2 supersymmetricgauge theories with and without matter. The first half is devoted to a reviewof monopoles in gauge theories and the construction of supersymmetric gaugetheories. In the second half, we describe the work of Seiberg and Witten.
