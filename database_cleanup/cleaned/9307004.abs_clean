We present self-dual spin-3 and 4 actions using relevant dreibein fields.since these actions start with a Chern-Simons like kinetic term (and thereforecannot be obtained through dimensional reduction) one might wonder whether theyneed the presence of auxiliary ghost-killings fields. It turns out that theymust contain, also in this three dimensional case, auxiliary fields. They doterms.
