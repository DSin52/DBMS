We consider the S-matrix of c=1 Liouville theory with vanishing cosmologicalconstant. We examine some of the constraints imposed by unitarity. Thesecompletely determine (N,2) amplitudes at tree level in terms of the (N,1)amplitudes when the plus tachyon momenta take generic values. A surprisingfeature of the matrix model results is the lack of particle creation branchcuts in the higher genus amplitudes. In fact, we show the naive field theorylimit of Liouville theory would predict such branch cuts. However, unitarity inthe full string theory ensures that such cuts do not appear in genus one (N,1)amplitudes. We conclude with some comments about the genus one (N,2)amplitudes.
