We consider here the massive Thirring model regularized with the XYZ spinchain. We numerically calculate the mass ratios of particles which lie in thediscrete part of the spectrum and obtain results in accordance with the DHNformula and in disagreement with recent calculations in the literature based onthe numerical Bethe ansatz and infinite momentum frame methods. We also analyzethe short distance behavior of these states and evaluate the conformaldimensions. This paper, taken together with the previous one for thesine-Gordon model, confirms the duality relation between two models formulatedby Klassen and Melzer [Int. J. Mod. Phys. A 8, 4131 (1993)].
