An action for two dimensional gravity conformally coupled to two dilaton-typefields is analysed. Classically, the theory has some exact solutions. Theseinclude configurations representing black holes. A semi-classical theory isobtained by assuming that these singular solutions are caused by the collapseof some matter fields. The semi-classical equations of motion reveal then thatany generic solution must have a flat geometry.
