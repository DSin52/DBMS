We study static spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein gravity plus anaction polynomial in the Ricci scalar, $R$, of arbitrary degree, $n$, inarbitrary dimension, $D$. The global properties of all such solutions arederived by studying the phase space of field equations in the equivalent theoryof gravity coupled to a scalar field, which is obtained by a field redefinitionprovided that the coefficient of the $R^2$ term in the Lagrangian polynomial ispositive then the only static spherically symmetric asymptotically flatsolution with a regular horizon in these models is the Schwarzschild solution.Other branches of solutions with regular horizons, which are asymptoticallyanti-de Sitter, or de Sitter, are also found. An exact Schwarzschild-de Sittertype solution is found to exist in the $R+aR^2$ if $D>4$. If terms of cubic orhigher order in $R$ are included in the action, then such solutions also existin four dimensions. The general Schwarzschild-de Sitter type solution forarbitrary $D$ and $n$ is given. The fact that the Schwarzschild solution inthese models does not coincide with the exterior solution of physical bodiessuch as stars has important physical implications which we discuss. As abyproduct, we classify all static spherically symmetric solutions of$D$-dimensional gravity coupled to a scalar field with a potential consistingof a finite sum of exponential terms.
