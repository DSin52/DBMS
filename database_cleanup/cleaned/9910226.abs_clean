Summer School ``Theoretical Physics at the End of the XXth Century'', June 27- July 10, Banff (Alberta), Canada ; References are added and misprints arecorrected (See a list of revised points in the last page)In this lecture we discuss `beyond CFT' from symmetry point of view. Afterreviewing the Virasoro algebra, we introduce deformed Virasoro algebras andelliptic algebras. These algebras appear in solvable lattice models and westudy them by free field approach.
