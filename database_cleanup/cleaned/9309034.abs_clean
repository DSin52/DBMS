We show that a deformation of the Heisenberg algebra which depends on adimensionful parameter $\kappa$ is the algebraic structure which underlies thegeneralized uncertainty principle in quantum gravity. The deformed algebra andtherefore the form of the generalized uncertainty principle are fixed uniquelyby rather simple assumptions. The string theory result is reproduced expandingour result at first order in $\Delta p/M_{\rm PL}$. We also briefly comment onpossible implications for Lorentz invariance at the Planck scale.
