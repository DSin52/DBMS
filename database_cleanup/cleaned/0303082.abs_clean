We obtain the exact non-perturbative solution of a scalar field theorydefined on a space with noncommuting position and momentum coordinates. Themodel describes non-locally interacting charged particles in a backgroundmagnetic field. It is an exactly solvable quantum field theory which hasnon-trivial interactions only when it is defined with a finite ultravioletcutoff. We propose that small perturbations of this theory can produce solvablemodels with renormalizable interactions.
