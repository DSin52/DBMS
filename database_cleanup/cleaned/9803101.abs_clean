The paper gives a quick account of the simplest cases of the Hitchinintegrable systems and of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard connection atgenus 0, 1 and 2. In particular, we construct the action-angle variables of thegenus 2 Hitchin system with group SL(2) by exploiting its relation to theclassical Neumann integrable systems.
