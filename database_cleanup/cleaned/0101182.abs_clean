Title: The Gauge String Solution of the D>=3 Yang-Mills Loop Equations

Comments: 57 pages

I adapt the Gauge String, representing the strong coupling (SC) expansion inthe continuous D>=3 Yang-Mills theory (YM_{D}) with a sufficiently large barecoupling constant \lambda>\lambda_{cr} and a fixed ultraviolet cut off \Lambda,to the analysis of the regularized Wilson's loop-averages. When generalized todescribe the fat (rather than infinitely thin) flux-tubes, the pattern of thusmodified U(N) Gauge String is proved to be consistent with the chain of thejudiciously regularized U(N) Loop equations. In particular, we reveal thedimensional reduction YM_{D}=>YM_{2}, taking place in the extreme SC limit\lambda=>\infty, and compare it with the implications of the AdS/CFTcorrespondence conjecture. On the other hand, for the loop-averages associatedto the sufficiently large minimal areas, the proposed stringy pattern issupposed to be in the one infrared universality class (provided the loops arewithout zig-zag backtrackings) with the novel implementation of the noncriticalD-dimensional Nambu-Goto string. The peculiarity is due to the nonstandard\Lambda^{2}-scaling, \Lambda^{2}=O(\sigma_{ph}), of the physical string tension\sigma_{ph}. Being well-motivated from the viewpoint of the standard YM_{4}theory with \lambda=>0, this scaling is argued to entail that the consideredmodification of the Nambu-Goto system is in the stringy (rather than in thebranched polymer) regime. In sum, the confinement in the continuous D>=3 U(N)(and, similarly, SU(N)) gauge theory is justified, for the first time, at leastwhen both N and \lambda are sufficiently large. As a by-product, when continuedto N=1, the Gauge String is shown to describe the continuous U(1) gauge theorywith the monopoles.
