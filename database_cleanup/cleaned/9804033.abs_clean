We calculate the one-loop effective action for conformal matter (scalars,spinors and vectors) on spherically symmetric background. Such effective action(in large $N$ approximation and expansion on curvature) is used to studyquantum aspects of Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes (SdS BHs) in nearlydegenerated limit (Nariai BH). We show that for all types of above matter SdSBHs may evaporate or anti-evaporate in accordance with recent observation byBousso and Hawking for minimal scalars. Some remarks about energy flow for SdSBHs in regime of evaporation or anti-evaporation are also done. Study of noboundary condition shows that this condition supports anti-evaporation fornucleated BHs (at least in frames of our approximation). That indicates to thepossibility that some pair created cosmological BHs may not only evaporate butalso anti-evaporate. Hence, cosmological primordial BHs may survive much longerthan it is expected.
