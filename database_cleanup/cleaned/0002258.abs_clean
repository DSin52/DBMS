String theory usually represents quantum black holes as systems whosestatistical mechanics reproduces Hawking's thermodynamics in a verysatisfactory way. Complicated brane theoretical models are worked out, asquantum versions of Supergravity solutions. These models are then assumed to bean explanation of the seeming thermodynamical nature of black holes, so theycannot be {\it assumed} to be finite temperature systems! In the modelpresented here, the black body spectrum arises with no statistical hypothesisas an approximation of the unitary evolution of microscopic black holes, whichare always described by a 1+1 conformal field theory, characterized by someVirasoro algebra. At the end, one can state that {\it theHawking-thermodynamics of the system is a by-product of the algebraicVirasoro-symmetric nature of the event horizon}. This is {\it the centralresult} of the present work.
