We study the realization of anomalous Ward identities in deconstructed(latticized) supersymmetric theories. In a deconstructed four-dimensionaltheory with N=2 supersymmetry, we show that the chiral symmetries only appearin the infrared and that the anomaly is reproduced in the usual framework oflattice perturbation theory with Wilson fermions. We then realize the theory onthe world-volume of fractional D-branes on an orbifold. In this branerealization, we show how deconstructed theory anomalies can be computed viaclassical supergravity. Our methods and observations are more generallyapplicable to deconstructed/latticized supersymmetric theories in variousdimensions.
