Infinite set of higher spin conserved charges is found for the $sp(2M)$symmetric dynamical systems in $\f{1}{2} M (M+1)$-dimensional generalizedspacetime $\M_M$. Since the dynamics in $\M_M$ is equivalent to the conformaldynamics of infinite towers of fields in $d$-dimensional Minkowski spacetimewith $d=3,4,6,10,...$ for $M=2,4,8,16, ...$, respectively, the constructedcurrents in $\M_M$ generate infinite towers of (mostly new) higher spinconformal currents in Minkowski spacetime. The charges have a form of integralsof $M$-forms which are bilinear in the field variables and are closed as aconsequence of the field equations. Conservation implies independence of avalue of charge of a local variation of a $M$-dimensional integration surface$\Sigma \subset \M_M$ analogous to Cauchy surface in the usual spacetime. Thescalar conserved charge provides an invariant bilinear form on the space ofsolutions of the field equations that gives rise to a positive definite norm onthe space of quantum states.
