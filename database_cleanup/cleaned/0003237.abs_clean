3207-3214We revive an old result, that one-loop corrections to the graviton propagatorinduce 1/r^3 corrections to the Newtonian gravitational potential, and computethe coefficient due to closed loops of the U(N) {\cal N}=4 super-Yang-Millstheory that arises in Maldacena's AdS/CFT correspondence. We find exactagreement with the coefficient appearing in the Randall-Sundrum brane-worldproposal. This provides more evidence for the complementarity of the twopictures.
