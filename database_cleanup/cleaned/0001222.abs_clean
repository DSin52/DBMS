Conserved and commuting charges are investigated in both bosonic andsupersymmetric classical chiral models, with and without Wess-Zumino terms. Inthe bosonic theories, there are conserved currents based on symmetric invarianttensors of the underlying algebra, and the construction of infinitely manycommuting charges, with spins equal to the exponents of the algebra modulo itsCoxeter number, can be carried out irrespective of the coefficient of theWess-Zumino term. In the supersymmetric models, a different pattern ofconserved quantities emerges, based on antisymmetric invariant tensors. Thecurrent algebra is much more complicated than in the bosonic case, and it isanalysed in some detail. Two families of commuting charges can be constructed,each with finitely many members whose spins are exactly the exponents of thealgebra (with no repetition modulo the Coxeter number). The conservedquantities in the bosonic and supersymmetric theories are only indirectlyrelated, except for the special case of the WZW model and its supersymmetricextension.
