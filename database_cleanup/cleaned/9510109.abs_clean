A one-parameter class of simple models of two-dimensional dilaton gravity,which can be exactly solved including back-reaction effects, is investigated atboth classical and quantum levels. This family contains the RST model as aspecial case, and it continuously interpolates between models having a flat(Rindler) geometry and a constant curvature metric with a non-trivial dilatonfield. The processes of formation of black hole singularities from collapsingmatter and Hawking evaporation are considered in detail. Various physicalaspects of these geometries are discussed, including the cosmologicalinterpretation.
