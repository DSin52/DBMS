We study the topologically twisted string theory on the general back-ground$AdS_3\times {\cal N}$ which is compatible with the world-sheet N=2superconformal symmetry and is extensively discussed in the recent works(hep-th/9904024, hep-th/9904040). After summarizing the algebraic structure ofthe world-sheet topological theory, we show that the space-time (boundary)conformal theory should be also topological. We directly construct thespace-time topological conformal algebra (twisted N=2 superconformal algebra)from the degrees of freedom in the world-sheet topological theory. Firstly, wework on the world-sheet of the string propagating near boundary, in which wecan safely make use of the Wakimoto free field representation. Secondly, wepresent a more rigid formulation of space-time topological conformal algebrawhich is still valid far from the boundary along the line of (hep-th/9903219).We also discuss about the relation between this space-time topological theoryand the twisted version of the space-time N=2 superconformal field theory givenin (hep-th/9904024, hep-th/9904040).
