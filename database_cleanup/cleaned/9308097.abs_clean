Superstring TheoryAuthors: I.V.Volovich

We use the recently discovered universality of Einstein equations in thefirst order formalism to suggest a positive definite Euclidean action. Possibleimplications for quantum gravity are considered. We discuss the Hawking andColeman approach to the vanishing of the cosmological constant by using the newaction and find that the cosmological constant is probably zero. A possiblescenario for obtaining such an action from superstring field theory isdiscussed.
