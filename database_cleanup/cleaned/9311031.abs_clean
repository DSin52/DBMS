Title: The Liouville Theory and SL(2,R) Symmetry

Authors: M. Blagojevic

Comments: 18 pages, Plain Tex

The Liouville action emerges as the effective action of 2-d gravity in theprocess of path integral quantization of the bosonic string. It yields ameasure of the violation of classical symmetries of the theory at the quantumlevel. Certain aspects of the residual SL(2,R) invariance of the gauge-fixedLiouville theory are disscussed.
