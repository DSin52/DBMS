version 2 was an older one!As argued previously, amplitudes of quantum field theories on noncommutativespace and time cannot be computed using naive path integral Feynman rules. Oneof the proposals is to use the Gell-Mann--Low formula with time-orderingapplied before performing the integrations. We point out that the previouslygiven prescription should rather be regarded as an interaction pointtime-ordering. Causality is explicitly violated inside the region ofinteraction. It is nevertheless a consistent procedure, which seems to berelated to the interaction picture of quantum mechanics. In this framework wecompute the one-loop self-energy for a space/time noncommutative \phi^4 theory.Although in all intermediate steps only three-momenta play a role, the finalresult is manifestly Lorentz covariant and agrees with the naive calculation.Deriving the Feynman rules for general graphs, we show, however, that such apicture holds for tadpole lines only.
