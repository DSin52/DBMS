Title: Symmetries and symmetry-breaking in string theory

Authors: Gregory Moore

Comments: 11 pages, YCTP-P18-93

This is a summary of a talk based on hep-th/9305139 and presented at theSUSY-93 International Workshop. We study infinite dimensional unbroken gaugesymmetries which arise when time is toroidally compactified in string theory.
