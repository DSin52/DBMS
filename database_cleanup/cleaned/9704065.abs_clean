The fusion of Verma modules of the osp(1|2) current algebra is studied. Inthe framework of an isotopic formalism, the singular vector decouplingconditions are analyzed. The fusion rules corresponding to the admissiblerepresentations of the osp(1|2) algebra are determined. A relation between thecharacters of these last representations and those corresponding to the minimalsuperconformal models is found. A series of equations that relate thedescendants of the highest weight vectors resulting from a fusion of Vermamodules are obtained. Solving these equations the singular vectors of thetheory can be determined.
