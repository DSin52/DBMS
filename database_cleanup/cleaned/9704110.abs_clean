These lectures are intended as an introduction to some of the basic aspectsof string solitons, duality and black holes. We begin with a discussion of therole of classical solutions in duality, then focus on string/string duality andfundamental membranes. Finally, we examine the feature of compositeness ofstring solitons, and its implications for bound states and black holethermodynamics. As these lectures are aimed primarily at those less familiarwith this field, technical details are minimized.
