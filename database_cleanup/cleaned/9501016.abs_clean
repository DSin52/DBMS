Title: Another View on Massless Matter-Gravity Fields in Two Dimensions

Authors: R. Jackiw

Conventional quantization of two-dimensional diffeomorphism and Weyl invarianttheories sacrifices the latter symmetry to anomalies, while maintaining theformer. When alternatively Weyl invariance is preserved by abandoningdiffeomorphism invariance, we find that some invariance against coordinatea constant Jacobian. The alternate approach enjoys as much ``gauge'' symmetryas the conventional formulation.
