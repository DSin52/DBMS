Title: The Penrose limit of AdS*S space and holography

Authors: George Siopsis

Comments: 12 pages

In the Penrose limit, AdS*S space turns into a Cahen-Wallach (CW) space whoseKilling vectors satisfy a Heisenberg algebra. I discuss how this algebra ismapped onto the holographic screen on the boundary of AdS. Furthermore, I showthat the algebra on the boundary of AdS may be obtained directly from the CWspace by appropriately constraining the states defined on it. By viewing theconstraints as generators of gauge transformations, I obtain a ``holographicscreen'' on the CW space as a gauge-fixing condition.
