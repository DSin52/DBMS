A simple, anomaly-free chiral gauge theory can be perturbatively quantisedand renormalised in such a way as to generate fermion and gauge boson masses.This development exploits certain freedoms inherent in choosing the unperturbedLagrangian and in the renormalisation procedure. Apart from its intrinsicinterest, such a mechanism might be employed in electroweak gauge theory togenerate fermion and gauge boson masses without a Higgs sector.
