We discuss the r\^ole of quantum deformation of Weyl-Heisenberg algebra indissipative systems and finite temperature systems. We express the timeevolution generator of the damped harmonic oscillator and the generator ofthermal Bogolubov transformations in terms of operators of the quantumWeyl-Heisenberg algebra. The quantum parameter acts as a label for theunitarily inequivalent representations of the canonical commutation relationsin which the space of the states splits in the infinite volume limit.
