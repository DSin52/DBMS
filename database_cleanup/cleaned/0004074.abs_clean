The notion of a space-time uncertainty principle in string theory isclarified and further developed. The motivation and the derivation of theprinciple are first reviewed in a reasonably self-contained way. It is thenshown that the nonperturbative (Borel summed) high-energy and high-momentumtransfer behavior of string scattering is consistent with the space-timeuncertainty principle. It is also shown that, in consequence of the principle,string theories in 10 dimensions generically exhibit a characteristic lengthscale which is equal to the well-known 11 dimensional Planck length$g_s^{1/3}\ell_s$ of M-theory as the scale at which stringy effects take overthe effects of classical supergravity, even without involving D-branesdirectly. The meanings of the space-time uncertainty relation in connectionwith D-branes and black holes are discussed and reinterpreted. Finally, wepresent a novel interpretation of the Schild-gauge action for strings from aviewpoint of noncommutative geometry, which conforms to the space-timeuncertainty relation by manifestly exhibiting a noncommutativity of quantizedstring coordinates dominantly between space and time. We also discuss theconsistency of the space-time uncertainty relation with S and T dualities.
