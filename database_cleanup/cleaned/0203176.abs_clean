We investigate the quantized scalar field on the Kaluza-Klein spacetimes of$M^D\times T^d \times S_{FZ}$, where $M^D$ is the ordinary $D$ dimensional flatMinkowski spacetimes, $T^d $ is the $d$ dimensional commutative torus, and$S_{FZ}$ is a noncommutative fuzzy two sphere with a fixed quantized radius.After evaluating the one-loop correction to the spectrum we use themass-corrected term to compute the Casimir energy of the scalar field on themodel spacetime. It is seen that, for some values of $D$ and $d$, the Casimirenergy due to vacuum fluctuation in the model spacetimes could give rise arepulsive force to stabilize the commutative torus.
