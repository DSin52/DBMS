Comments: 13 pages, Latex twice

We give a brief introduction to the study of the algebraic structures -- andtheir geometrical interpretations -- which arise in the BRST construction of aconformal string background. Starting from the chiral algebra $\cA$ of a stringbackground, we consider a number of elementary but universal operations on thechiral algebra. From these operations we deduce a certain fundamental oddPoisson structure, known as a Gerstenhaber algebra, on the BRST cohomology of$\cA$. For the 2D string background, the correponding G-algebra can bepartially described in term of a geometrical G-algebra of the affine plane$\bC^2$. This paper will appear in the proceedings of {\it Strings 95}.
