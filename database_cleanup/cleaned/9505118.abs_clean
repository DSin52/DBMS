(Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, February 1995)The basic concepts underlying our analysis of {\it W-algebras} as extendedsymmetries of integrable systems are summarized. The construction starts fromthe second hamiltonian structure of ``Generalized Drinfel'd-Sokolov''hierarchies, and its correspondence with the $A_1$-embeddings is established,providing a rather simple and general scheme.
