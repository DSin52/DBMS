Authors: Gabriel Lopes Cardoso

Comments: 6 pages, LaTeX, to appear in the Proceedings of the 31st

International Symposium Ahrenshoop on the Theory of Elementary Particles,Buckow, Germany, September 2-6 1997We review various three-dimensional solutions in the low-energy descriptionof M-theory on $S^1/Z_2 \times T_7$. These solutions have an eleven dimensionalinterpretation in terms of intersecting M-branes.
