Title: Lagrangian Formalism Over Graded Algebras

Comments: 26 pages, AMS-TeX 2.1, to appear in J. Geom. Phys. (resubmitted

because of a TeX-error)Geometry; Exactly Solvable and Integrable SystemsThis paper provides a description of an algebraic setting for the Lagrangianformalism over graded algebras and is intended as the necessary first steptowards the noncommutative C-spectral sequence (variational bicomplex). Anoncommutative version of integration procedure, the notion of adjointoperator, Green's formula, the relation between integral and differentialforms, conservation laws, Euler operator, Noether's theorem is considered.
