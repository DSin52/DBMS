Title: Fermions in a Multi-Soliton Background in 1+1 Dimensions

Authors: B. Altschul

Comments: 9 pages, added related calculation

We consider the fermionic bound states associated with a soliton-antisolitonpair in 1+1 dimensions which have zero energy when the solitons are infinitelyfar apart. We calculate the energies of these states when the solitons areseparated by a finite distance. The energies decay exponentially with thedistance between the soliton and antisoliton. When the fermion mass is muchlarger than the boson mass, the energy simplifies substantially. These energiesmay be interpreted as a contribution to the effective potential between thesoliton and antisoliton. The character of this contribution depends upon whichfermionic states are occupied. Performing the analogous calculation for thesimplest (3+1)-dimensional soliton system, we find no fermionic energy shift.
