We discuss in detail the semiclassical approximation for the CGHS model oftwo-dimensional dilatonic black holes. This is achieved by a formal expansionof the full Wheeler-DeWitt equation and the momentum constraint in powers ofthe gravitational constant. In highest order, the classical CGHS solution isrecovered. The next order yields a functional Schr\"odinger equation forquantum fields propagating on this background. We show explicitly how theHawking radiation is recovered from this equation. Although described by a purequantum state, the expectation value of the number operator exhibits aPlanckian distribution with respect to the Hawking temperature.We then show how this Hawking radiation can lead to the decoherence of blackhole superpositions. The cases of a superposition of a black hole with a whitehole, as well as of a black hole with no hole, are treated explicitly.
