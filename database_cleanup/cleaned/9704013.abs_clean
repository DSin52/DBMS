We consider the gauge dyonic string solution of the K3 compactified heteroticstring theory in a four dimensional cosmological context. Since for thissolution Green-Schwarz as well as Chern-Simons corrections have been taken intoaccount it contains both world sheet and string loop corrections. Thecosmological picture is obtained by rotating the world volume of the gaugedyonic string into two space like dimensions and compactifying those dimensionson a two torus. We compare the result with gauge neutral extreme andnon-extreme cosmologies and find that the non-trivial Yang Mills backgroundleads to a solution without any singularities whereas for trivial Yang-Millsbackgrounds some of the fields become always singular at the big bang.
