We present N=2 supersymmetry transformations, both in N=1, D=4 Minkowski andanti-de Sitter superspaces, for higher superspin massless theories. It is notedthat the existence of dual versions of massless supermultiplets with arbitrarysuperspin s may provide a basis for understanding duality in N=1, D=4superstring theory. We further conjecture that the N=1, D=4 supergravitypre-potential together with all higher superspin s pre-potentials arecomponents of an N=1, D=4 superstring pre-potential.
