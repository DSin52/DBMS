The Hodge--de Rham Laplacian on spheres acting on antisymmetric tensor fieldsis considered. Explicit expressions for the spectrum are derived in a quitedirect way, confirming previous results. Associated functional determinants andthe heat kernel expansion are evaluated. Using this method, new non--localcounterterms in the quantum effective action are obtained, which can beexpressed in terms of Betti numbers.
