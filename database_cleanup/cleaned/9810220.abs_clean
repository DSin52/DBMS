A novel algebra underlying integrable systems is shown to generate and unifya large class of quantum integrable models with given $R$-matrix, throughreductions of an ancestor Lax operator and its different realizations. Alongwith known discrete and field models a new class of inhomogeneous and impuritymodels are obtained.
