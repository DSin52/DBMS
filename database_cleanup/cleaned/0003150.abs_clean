eigenenergies in perturbation theoryAuthors: Wen-ge Wang

Comments: 6 pages, no figure

We study a simple model for which perturbation theory gives ultravioletlydivergent results. We show that when the eigen-solution problem of theHamiltonian of the model is treated nonperturbatively, it is possible foreigenenergies of the Hamiltonian to be finite.
