Title: String Theory Symmetries

Comments: 13 pages, latex

A brief review of the status of duality symmetries in string theory ispresented. The evidence is accumulating rapidly that an enormous group ofduality symmetries, including perturbative T dualities and non-perturbativeS-dualities, underlies string theory. It is my hope that an understanding ofthese symmetries will suggest the right way to formulate non-perturbativestring theory. Whether or not this hope is realized, it has already beendemonstrated that this line of inquiry leads to powerful new tools forunderstanding gauge theories and new evidence for the uniqueness of stringtheory, as well as deep mathematical results.
