The one-loop effective potential for gauge models in static de Sitter spaceat finite temperatures is computed by means of the $\zeta$--function method. Wefound a simple relation which links the effective potentials of gauge andscalar fields at all temperatures.In the de Sitter invariant and zero-temperature states the potential forthe scalar electrodynamics is explicitly obtained, and its properties inthese two vacua are compared. In this theory the two states are shown tobehave similarly in the regimes of very large and very small radii a of thebackground space. For the gauge symmetry broken in the flat limit ($a \to\infty$) there is a critical value of a for which the symmetry is restored inboth quantum states. Moreover, the phase transitions which occur at large orat small a are of the first or of the second order, respectively, regardlessthe vacuum considered. The analytical and numerical analysis of the criticalparameters of the above theory is performed. We also established a class ofmodels for which the kind of phase transition occurring depends on the choiceof the vacuum.
