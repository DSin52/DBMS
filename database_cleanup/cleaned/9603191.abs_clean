Title: N=2 symplectic reparametrizations in a chiral background

Comments: LateX. To appear in the proceedings of the Workshop on recent

developments in theoretical physics, ``STU-Dualities and nonperturbativebehaviour in superstrings and supergravity, CERN Theory Division, 1995Journal-ref: Fortsch.Phys. 44 (1996) 529-538

We study the symplectic reparametrizations that are possible for theories ofN=2 supersymmetric vector multiplets in the presence of a chiral background anddiscuss some of their consequences. One of them concerns an anomaly arisingfrom a conflict between symplectic covariance and holomorphy.
