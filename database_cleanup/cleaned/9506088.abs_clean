We provide a description of W_3 transformations in terms of deformations ofconvex curves in two dimensional Euclidean space. This geometricalinterpretation sheds some light on the nature of finite W_3-morphisms. We alsocomment on how this construction can be extended to the case of W_n and``nicely curved'' curves in $\reals^{n-1}$.
