Title: Near-Horizon Conformal Structure and Entropy of Schwarzschild Black

HolesAuthors: Kumar S. Gupta

Comments: Based on the invited talk presented at the Indo-Russian International

Workshop on Quantum Gravity, Strings and Integrable Models at IMSc., Chennai,India during January 15-19, 2002Near-horizon conformal structure of a massive Schwarzschild black hole ofmass M is analyzed using a scalar field as a simple probe of the backgroundgeometry. The near-horizon dynamics is governed by an operator which is relatedto the Virasoro algebra and admits a one-parameter family of self-adjointextensions described by a real parameter z. When z satisfies a suitablecontraint, the corresponding wavefunctions exhibit scaling behaviour in aband-like region near the horizon of the black hole. This formalism isconsistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula and naturally producesthe -3/2 log M^2 correction term to the black hole entropy with othersubleading corrections exponentially suppressed. This precise form for theblack hole entropy is expected on general grounds in any conformal fieldtheoretic description of the problem. The presence of the Virasoro algebra andthe scaling properties of the associated wavefunctions in the near-horizonregion together with the appearance of the logarithmic correction to theBekenstein-Hawking entropy provide strong evidence for the near-horizonconformal structure in this system.
