We extend the Coleman-Hill analysis to non-Abelian Chern-Simons theoriescontaining a tree level topological mass term. We show, in the case of a pureYang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory, that there are no corrections to thecoefficient of the Chern-Simons term beyond one loop in the axial gauge. Ourarguments use constraints coming only from small gauge Ward identities as wellas the analyticity of the amplitudes, much like the proof in the Abelian case.Some implications of this result are also discussed.
