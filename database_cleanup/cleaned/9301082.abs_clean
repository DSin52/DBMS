Title: Evolution of Pure States into Mixed States

Comments: 6 pages

In the formulation of Banks, Peskin and Susskind, we show that one canconstruct evolution equations for the quantum mechanical density matrix $\rho$with operators which do not commute with hamiltonian which evolve pure statesinto mixed states, preserve the normalization and positivity of $\rho$ andconserve energy. Furthermore, it seems to be different from a quantummechanical system with random sources.
