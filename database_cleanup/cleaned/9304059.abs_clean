The one dimensional Fermi gas of matrix eigenvalues of the Marinari-Parisimodel at positive values of the cosmological constant is generalised.The numberof matrix eigenvalues (i.e. gas particles) is varied while keeping theeffective potential fixed. This model exhibits a transition from a phase whosecontinuum behaviour is that of $c=1$ conformal matter coupled to gravity to thewell known pure gravity phase of the original model.The former phase ischaracter- ised by an extremely large Regge slope $\alpha^\prime$ which scalesas $\beta^{2/5}$ causing the scaling regions of the two phases to overlap. Inthis way a continuous flow from one phase to the other is made poss- ible. Thisphase transition occurs in the singlet sector of the matrix model. The densityof states and the two puncture correlator at non zero momenta are calculated onthe sphere and are found to behave very differ- ently in the two phases,a factwhich demonstrates the phase transition. We comment on a possible relationbetween this transition and large \alpha^\prime$ semiclassical expansions inthe continuum.
