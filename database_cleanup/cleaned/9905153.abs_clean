section addedWe review the method of constructing dipole and string loop solutions fromthe higher-dimensional (Euclidean) Kerr black hole. We analyse the results invarious dimensions, finding solutions earlier given in the literature. Then weconstruct a new heterotic dipole with non-trivial dilaton and gauge fields.This can, in turn, be describes as a brane/anti-brane pair which interpolatesbetween the KK-dipole and the H-dipole. Finally an argument is presented on thetachyonic instability by analysing the string fluctuations on the dipolebackground.
