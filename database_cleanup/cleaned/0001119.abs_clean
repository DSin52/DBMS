The electrogravity transformation is defined by an interchange of the``active'' and ``passive'' electric parts of the Riemann tensor. Such atransformation has been used to find new solutions that are ``dual'' to theKerr family of black hole spacetimes in general relativity. In such a case, thedual solution is a similar black hole spacetime endowed with a global monopolecharge. Here, we extend this formalism to obtain solutions dual to the static,spherically symmetric solutions of two different scalar-tensor gravitytheories. In particular, we first study the duals of the charged black holesolutions of a four-dimensional low-energy effective action of heterotic stringtheory. Next, we study dual of the Xanthopoulos-Zannias solution in Brans-Dicketheory, which contains a naked singularity. We show that, analogous to generalrelativity, in these scalar-tensor gravity theories the dual solutions aresimilar to the original spacetimes, but with a global monopole charge.
