Title: W-strings from N=2 Hamiltonian reduction and classification of N=2 super

W-algebrasComments: Latex, 13 pages

We present an algebraic approach to string theory, using a Hamiltonianreduction of N=2 WZW models. An embedding of sl(1|2) in a Lie superalgebradetermines a niltopent subalgebra. Chirally gauging this subalgebra in thecorresponding WZW action leads to an extension of the N=2 superconformalprovides an exhaustive classification and characterization of all extended N=2superconformal algebras. Then, twisting these algebras, we obtain the BRSTstructure of a string theory. We characterize and classify all the stringtheories which can be obtained in this way.Based on a common work of E.
