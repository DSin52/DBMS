We construct boundary states representing D-strings in $AdS_3$. These wraptwisted conjugacy classes of SL(2,R), and the boundary states are thereforebased on continuous representations only. We check Cardy's condition and find aconsistent open string spectrum. The open string spectrum on all the D-branesis the same.
