The singularity present in cosmological instantons of the Hawking-Turok typeis resolved by a conformal transformation, where the conformal factor has alinear zero of codimension one. We show that if the underlying regular manifoldis taken to have the topology of $RP^4$, and the conformal factor is taken tobe a twisted field so that the zero is enforced, then one obtains aone-parameter family of solutions of the classical field equations, where theminimal action solution has the conformal zero located on a minimal volumenoncontractible $RP^3$ submanifold. For instantons with two singularities, thecorresponding topology is that of a cylinder $S^3\times [0,1]$ with D=4analogues of `cross-caps' at each of the endpoints.
