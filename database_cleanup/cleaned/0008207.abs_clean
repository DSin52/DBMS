Two thin conducting, electrically neutral, parallel plates forming anisolated system in vacuum exert attracting force on each other, whose origin isthe quantum electrodynamical interaction. This theoretical hypothesis, known asCasimir effect, has been also confirmed experimentally. Despite long history ofthe subject, no completely convincing theoretical analysis of this effectappears in the literature. Here we discuss the effect (for the scalar field)anew, on a revised physical and mathematical basis. Standard, but advancedmethods of relativistic quantum theory are used. No anomalous features of theconventional approaches appear. The Casimir quantitative prediction for theforce is shown to constitute the leading asymptotic term, for large separationof the plates, of the full, model-dependent expression.
