We analyze the geometric engineering of the N=2 SU(2) gauge theories with$1\leq N_f\leq 3$ massive hypermultiplets in the vector representation. The setof partial differential equations satisfied by the periods of theSeiberg-Witten differential is obtained from the Picard-Fuchs equations of thelocal B-model. The differential equations and its solutions are consistent withthe massless case. We show that the Yukawa coupling of the local A-model givesrise to the correct instanton expansion in the gauge theory, and propose thepattern of the distribution of the world-sheet instanton number from it. As aside result, we obtain the asymptotic form of the instanton number in the gaugetheories with massless hypermultiplets.
