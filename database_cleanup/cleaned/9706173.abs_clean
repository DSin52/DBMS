We perform Monte Carlo simulations of a gauge invariant spin system whichdescribes random surfaces with gonihedric action in four dimensions. TheHamiltonian is a mixture of one-plaquette and additional two- andthree-plaquette interaction terms with specially adjusted coupling constants.For the system with the large self-intersection coupling constant $k$ weobserve the second-order phase transition at temperature $\beta_{c}\simeq1.75$. The string tension is generated by quantum fluctuations as it wasexpected theoretically. This result suggests the existence of a noncriticalstring in four dimensions. For smaller values of $k$ the system undergoes thefirst order phase transition and for $k$ close to zero exhibits a smoothcrossover.
