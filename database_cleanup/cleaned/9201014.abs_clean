We generalize the known method for explicit construction of mirror pairs of$(2,2)$-superconformal field theories, using the formalism of Landau-Ginzburgorbifolds. Geometrically, these theories are realized as Calabi-Yauhypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces. This generalization makes itpossible to construct the mirror partners of many manifolds for which themirror was not previously known.
