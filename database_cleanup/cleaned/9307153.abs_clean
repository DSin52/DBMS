Title: Some cohomology operators in 2-D field theory

Comments: 19 pages, submitted to the Proceedings of the Conference on Quantum

Topology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, 24-28 March 1993It is typical for a semi-infinite cohomology complex associated with a gradedLie algebra to occur as a vertex operator (or chiral) superalgebra where allthe standard operators of cohomology theory, in particular the differential,are modes of vertex operators (fields). Although vertex operator superalgebrasTheory (CFT), a VOSA may exhibit a square-zero operator (often, but not always,the semi-infinite cohomology differential) for which the Virasoro algebra actstrivially in the cohomology. Capable of shedding its CFT features, such a VOSAis called a ``topological chiral algebra'' (TCA). We investigate thesemi-infinite cohomology of the vertex operator Weil algebra and indicate anumber of differentials which give rise to TCA structures.
