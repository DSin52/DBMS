Title: Solitons reduced from Heterotic fivebranes

Authors: HoSeong La

Comments: 14 pages

In view of the expectation that the solitonic sector of the lower dimensionalworld may be originated from the solitonic sector of string theory, varioussolitonic solutions are reduced from the heterotic fivebrane solutions in theten-dimensional heterotic string theory. These solitons in principle can appearafter proper compactifications, {\it e.g.} toroidal compactifications.
