Utilizing the techniques recently developed for N=1 super Yang-Mills theoriesby Dijkgraaf, Vafa and collaborators, we derive the linearity principle ofIntriligator, Leigh and Seiberg, for the confinement phase of the theories withsemi-simple gauge groups and matters in a non-chiral representation whichsatisfies a further technical assumption.
