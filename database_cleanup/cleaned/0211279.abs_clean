Superspace power-counting rules give estimates for the loop order at whichdivergences can first appear in non-renormalisable supersymmetric fieldtheories. In some cases these estimates can be improved if harmonic superspace,rather than ordinary superspace, is used. The new estimates are in agreementwith recent results derived from unitarity calculations for maximallysupersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in five and six dimensions. For N=8supergravity in four dimensions, we speculate that the onset of divergences maycorrespondingly occur at the six loop order.
