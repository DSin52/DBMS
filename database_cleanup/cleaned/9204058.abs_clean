We discuss the algebraic structure of the various BRST symmetries associatedwith topological Yang-Mills theory as a generalization of the BRS analysisdeveloped for the non-Abelian anomaly in the local Yang-Mills theory. We showthat our BRST algebra leads to an extended {\it Russian formula\/} and {\itdescent equations}, which contains the descent equation of Yang-Mills theory assub-relations. We propose the non-Abelian anomaly counterpart in TopologicalYang-Mills theory using the extended descent equation. We also discuss thegeometrical structure of our BRST symmetry and some explicit solutions of theextended descent equation are calculated.
