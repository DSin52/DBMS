We compute the greybody factors for classical black holes in a domain wheretwo kinds of charges and their anticharges are excited by the extra energyover extremality. We compare the result to the greybody factors expected froman effective string model which was earlier shown to give the correctentropy. In the regime where the left and right moving temperatures are muchsmaller than the square root of the effective string tension, we find anon-trivial greybody factor which agrees with the effective string model.However, if the temperatures are comparable with the square root of theeffective string tension, the greybody factors agree only at the leadingorder in energy. Nevertheless, there are several interesting relationsbetween the two results, suggesting that a modification of the effectivestring model might lead to better agreement.
