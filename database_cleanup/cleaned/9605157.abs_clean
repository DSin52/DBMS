Starting from a field theoretical description of multicomponent anyons withmutual statistical interactions in the lowest Landau level, we construct amodel of interacting chiral fields on the circle, with the energy spectrumcharacterized by a symmetric matrix $g_{\alpha\beta}$ with nonnegative entries.Being represented in a free form, the model provides a field theoreticalrealization of (ideal) fractional exclusion statistics for particles withlinear dispersion, with $g_{\alpha\beta}$ as a statistics matrix. We derive thebosonized form of the model and discuss the relation to the effectivelow-energy description of the edge excitations for abelian fractional quantumHall states in multilayer systems.
