We study scalar field theories on M^{D-1} \otimes S^1, which allow to imposetwisted boundary conditions for the S^1 direction, in detail and report severalinteresting properties overlooked so far. One of characteristic features is theappearance of critical radii of the circle S^1. A phase transition can occur atthe classical level or can be caused by quantum effects. Radiative correctionscan restore broken symmetries or can break symmetries for small radius. Asurprising feature is that the translational invariance for the S^1 directioncan spontaneously be broken. A particular class of coordinate-dependent vacuumconfigurations is clarified and the O(N) \phi^4 model on M^{D-1}\otimes S^1 isextensively studied, as an illustrative example.
