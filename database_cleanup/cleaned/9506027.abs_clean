We consider the problem of constructing a non-singular inflationary universein stringy gravity via branch changing, from a previously superexponentiallyexpanding phase to an FRW-like phase. Our approach is based on the phase spaceanalysis of the dynamics, and we obtain a no-go theorem which rules out theefficient scenario of branch changing catalyzed by dilaton potential andstringy fluid sources. We furthermore consider the effects of string-loopcorrections to the gravitational action in the form recently suggested byDamour and Polyakov. These corrections also fail to produce the desired branchchange. However, focusing on the possibility that these corrections maydecouple the dilaton, we deduce that they may lead to an inflationary expansionin the presence of a cosmological constant, which asymptotically approachesEinstein-deSitter solution.
