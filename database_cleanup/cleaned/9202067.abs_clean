We point out that the moduli sector of the $(2,2)$ string compactificationwith its nonperturbatively preserved non-compact symmetries is a framework tostudy global topological defects. Based on the target space modular invarianceof the nonperturbative superpotential of the four-dimensional $N=1$supersymmetric string vacua, topologically stable stringy domain walls arefound. Explicit supersymmetric solutions for the modulus field and the metric,which saturate the Bogomol'nyi bound, are presented. They interpolate between{\it non-degenerate} vacua. As a corollary, this defines a new notion of vacuumdegeneracy of supersymmetric vacua. Nonsupersymmetric stringy domain walls arediscussed as well. The moduli sectors with more than one modulus and thenon-compact continous symmetry preserved allow for global monopole-type andtexture-type configurations.
