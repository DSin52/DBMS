We analyse the OPE of any two 1/2 BPS operators of (2,0) SCFT$_6$ byconstructing all possible three-point functions that they can form withanother, in general long operator. Such three-point functions are uniquelydetermined by superconformal symmetry. Selection rules are derived, which allowus to infer ``non-renormalization theorems'' for an abstract superconformalfield theory. The latter is supposedly related to the strong-coupling dynamicsof $N_c$ coincident M5 branes, dual, in the large-$N_c$ limit, to the bulkM-theory compactified on AdS$_7 \times$S$_4$. An interpretation of extremal andnext-to-extremal correlators in terms of exchange of operators with protectedconformal dimension is given.
