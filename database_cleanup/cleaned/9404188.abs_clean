We demonstrate that the generalization of the Coleman-Thun mechanism may beapplied to the situation, when considering scattering processes in1+1-dimensions in the presence of reflecting boundaries. For affine Toda fieldtheories we find that the binding energies of the bound states are always halfthe sum over a set of masses having the same colour with respect to thebicolouration of the Dynkin diagram. For the case of $E_6$-affine Toda fieldtheory we compute explicitly the spectrum of all higher boundary bound states.The complete set of states constitutes a closed bootstrap.
