A basic aspect of the recently proposed approach to quantum mechanics is thatno use of any axiomatic interpretation of the wave function is made. Inparticular, the quantum potential turns out to be an intrinsic potential energyof the particle, which, similarly to the relativistic rest energy, is nevervanishing. This is related to the tunnel effect, a consequence of the fact thatthe conjugate momentum field is real even in the classically forbidden regions.The quantum stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation is defined only if the ratiopsi^D/psi of two real linearly independent solutions of the Schroedingerequation, and therefore of the trivializing map, is a local homeomorphism ofthe extended real line into itself, a consequence of the Moebius symmetry ofthe Schwarzian derivative. In this respect we prove a basic theorem relatingthe request of continuity at spatial infinity of psi^D/psi, a consequence ofthe q - 1/q duality of the Schwarzian derivative, to the existence of L^2(R)solutions of the corresponding Schroedinger equation. As a result, while in theconventional approach one needs the Schroedinger equation with the L^2(R)condition, consequence of the axiomatic interpretation of the wave function,the equivalence principle by itself implies a dynamical equation that does notneed any assumption and reproduces both the tunnel effect and energyquantization.
