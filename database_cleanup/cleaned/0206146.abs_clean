We study in a self-consistent way the impact of the emission of bulkgravitons on the (homogeneous) cosmology of a three-brane embedded in afive-dimensional spacetime. In the low energy regime, we recover the well knownresult that the bulk affects the Friedmann equation only via a radiation-liketerm $\C/a^4$, called dark or Weyl radiation. By contrast, in the high energyregime, we find that the Weyl parameter $\C$ is no longer constant but insteadgrows very rapidly as $\C\propto a^4$. As a consequence, the value of $\C$today is not a free parameter as usually considered but is a fixed number,which, generically, depends only on the number of relativistic degrees offreedom at the high/low energy transition. Our estimated amount of Weylradiation satisfies the present nucleosynthesis bounds.
