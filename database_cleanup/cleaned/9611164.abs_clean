Title: T Duality in M(atrix) Theory and S Duality in Field Theory

Comments: 5 pages in Phyzxx

The matrix model formulation of M theory can be generalized to compacttransverse backgrounds such as tori. If the number of compact directions is Kthen the matrix model must be generalized to K+1 dimensional super Yang Millstheory on a compact space. If K is greater than or equal to 3, there are Tdualities which which require highly nontrivial identifications betweendifferent SYM theories. In the simplest case we will see that the requirementreduces to the well known electric- magnetic duality of N=4 SYM theory in 3+1dimensions.
