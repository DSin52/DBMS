A world-sheet sigma model approach is applied to string theories dual tofour-dimensional gauge theories, and semi-classical soliton solutionsrepresenting highly excited string states are identified which correspond togauge theory operators with relatively small anomalous dimensions. The simplestclass of such states are strings on the leading Regge trajectory, with largespin in AdS_5. These correspond to operators with many covariant derivatives,whose anomalous dimension grows logarithmically with the space-time spin. Inthe gauge theory, the logarithmic scaling violations are similar to those foundin perturbation theory. Other examples of highly excited string states are alsoconsidered.
