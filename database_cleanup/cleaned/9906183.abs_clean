We propose a modification of the gauge-fixing procedure in the Lagrangianmethod of superfield BRST quantization for general gauge theories whichsimultaneously provides a natural generalization of the well-known BVquantization scheme as far as gauge-fixing is concerned. A superfield form ofBRST symmetry for the vacuum functional is found. The gauge-independence of theS-matrix is established.
