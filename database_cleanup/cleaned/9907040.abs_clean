In two-dimensional lattice fermion model a determinant representation for thetwo-point correlation function of the twist field in the disorder phase isobtained. This field is defined by twisted boundary conditions for latticefermion field. The large distance asymptotics of the correlation function iscalculated at the critical point and in the scaling region. The result iscompared with the vacuum expectation values of exponential fields in thesine-Gordon model conjectured by S.Lukyanov and A.Zamolodchikov.
