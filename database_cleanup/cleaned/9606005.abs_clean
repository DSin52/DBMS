We introduce and study a pure gauge abelian theory in 2+1D in which massivequantum vortex states do exist in the spectrum of excitations. This theory canbe mapped in a three dimensional gas of point particles with a logarithmicinteraction, in the grand-canonical ensemble. We claim that this theory is the2+1D analog of the Sine-Gordon, the massive vortices being the counterparts ofSine-Gordon solitons. We show that a symmetry breaking, order parameter,similar to the vacuum expectation value of a Higgs field does exist.
