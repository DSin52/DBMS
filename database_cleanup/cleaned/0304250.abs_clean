Title: Braneworld holography in Gauss-Bonnet gravity

Authors: James P. Gregory, Antonio Padilla

Comments: 23 pages, no figures

We investigate holography on an (n-1)-dimensional brane embedded in abackground of AdS black holes, in n-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Wedemonstrate that for a critical brane near the AdS boundary, the Friedmannequation corresponds to that of the standard cosmology driven by a CFT dual tothe AdS bulk. We show that there is no holographic description for non-criticalbranes, or when the brane is further away from the AdS boundary. We then derivea Cardy-Verlinde formula for the dual CFT on the critical brane near theboundary. This gives us insight into the remarkable correspondence betweenCardy-Verlinde formulae and Friedmann equations in Einstein gravity.
