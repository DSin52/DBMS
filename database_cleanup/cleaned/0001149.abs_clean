Born Simposium, Karpach, Poland, Preprint TUW-00-03We present an action functional and derive equations of motion for a coupledsystem of a bosonic Dp--brane and an open string ending on the Dp-brane. Withthis example we address the key issues of the recently proposed method(hep-th/9905144, hep-th/9906041) for the construction of manifestlysupersymmetric action functionals for interacting superbrane systems. Weclarify, in particular, how the arbitrariness in sources localized on theintersection is related to the standard description of the flat D-branes asrigid planes where the string for endpoints 'live'.
