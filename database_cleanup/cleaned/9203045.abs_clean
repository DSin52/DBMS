A list of superconformal chiral operator product expansion algebras withquadratic nonlinearity in two dimensions is completed on the basis of the knownclassification of little conformal Lie superalgebras. In addition to thepreviously known cases and the constructed in our previous paper exceptional$N=8$ superalgebra associated with $F(4)$, a novel exceptional $N=7$superconformal algebra associated with $G(3)$ is found, as well as a wholefamily of superalgebras containing affine $\widehat{su}_2 \oplus\widehat{usp}_{2N}$. A classification scheme for quasisuperconformal algebrasis also outlined.
