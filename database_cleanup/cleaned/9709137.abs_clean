A family of degenerate domain wall configurations, partially preservingsupersymmetry, is discussed in a generalized Wess-Zumino model with two scalarsuperfields. We establish some general features inherent to the models withcontinuously degenerate domain walls. For instance, for purely realtrajectories additional "integrals of motion" exist. The solution for theprofile of the scalar fields for any wall belonging to the family is found inquadratures for arbitrary ratio of the coupling constants. For a special valueof this ratio the solution family is obtained explicitly in terms of elementaryfunctions. We also discuss the threshold amplitudes for multiparticleproduction generated by these solutions. New unexpected nullifications of thethreshold amplitudes are found.
