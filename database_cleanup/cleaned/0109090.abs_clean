From the requirement of continuous matching of bulk metric around the pointof brane collision we derive a conservation law for collisions of p-branes in(p+2)-dimensional space-time. This conservation law relates energy densities onthe branes before and after the collision. Using this conservation law we areable to calculate the amount of matter produced in the collision oforbifold-fixed brane with a bulk brane in the ``ekpyrotic/pyrotechnic type''models of brane cosmologies.
