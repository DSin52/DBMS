In this paper we use the matrix string approach to begin a study of highenergy scattering processes in M-theory. In particular we exhibit aninstanton-type configuration in 1+1 super-Yang-Mills theory that can beinterpreted as a non-perturbative description of a string interaction. Thissolution is used to describe high energy processes with non-zero longitudinalmomentum exchange, in which an arbitrary number of eigenvalues get transferredbetween the two scattering states. We describe a direct correspondence betweenthese semi-classical SYM configurations and the Gross-Mende saddle points. Wealso study in detail the pair production of D-particles via a one-loopcalculation which in the 1+1D gauge theory language is described by the(perturbative) transition between states with different electric flux. Finally,we discuss a possible connection between these calculations in which D-particleproduction gives important corrections to the Gross-Mende process.
