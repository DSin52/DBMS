Comments: 14 pages, latex, no figures

It is proposed a new mechanism for the phenomenon of topological massgeneration in three spacetime dimensions as the result of the interference oftwo opposite massless chiral modes. This mechanism, already used to produce themassive vectorial mode of the 2D Schwinger model, is here exploited to producethe gauge invariant massive mode of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. Moreoveris proposed for odd and even dimensional space-times to be used as the basicbuilding blocks of the interference schemes. This is a new result that extendsthe two-dimensional Floreanini-Jackiw action to higher dimensional spaces andis in clear contrast with the twice odd dimensional chiral form extensions.
