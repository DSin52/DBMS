Title: Non-highest weight representations of the current algebra

$\hat{so}(1,n)$, and Laplace OperatorsAuthors: M. Zyskin

Comments: Replaced by revised version

We constructed canonical non-highest weight unitary irreduciblerepresentation of $\hat{so}(1,n)$ current algebra as well as canonicalnon-highest weight non-unitary representations, We constructed certainLaplacian operators as elements of the universal enveloping algebra, acting inrepresentation space. We speculated about a possible relation of thoseLaplacians with the loop operator for the Yang-Mills.
