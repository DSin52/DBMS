International Symposium Ahrenshoop on the Theory of Elementary ParticlesThe defect conformal field theory describing intersecting D3-branes at aC^2/Z_k orbifold is used to (de)construct the theory of intersecting M5-branes,as well as M5-branes wrapping the holomorphic curve xy=c. The possibility of a't Hooft anomaly due to tensionless strings at the intersection is discussed.This note is based on a talk given by Zachary Guralnik at the 35thInternational Symposium Ahrenshoop on the Theory of Elementary Particles.
