We investigate some issues regarding quantum corrections for de Sitter branesin a bulk AdS(5) spacetime. The one-loop effective action for a Majorana spinorfield is evaluated and compared with the scalar field result. We also evaluatethe cocycle function for various boundary conditions, finding that the quantumcorrections naturally induce higher order curvature terms in the originalaction and, in general, it is not possible to eliminate the cocycle function byrenormalisation. In the one brane limit care must be taken on how one extractsphysical results. The effective potential is found to be zero on theconformally related cylinder. However, using the actual metric, thecontribution from the cocycle function is non-zero and must be included.Subtleties with any zero modes are also discussed.
