The classical black hole background of two-dimensional string theory isexamined after including the effect of the tachyon field. Keeping all termsupto $O(T^2)$, and making no other approximations, the only consistentclassical solution to the resulting dilaton-graviton theory is found to be flatspacetime with a nontrivial dilaton.
