Title: Liouville Field Theory and Dark Matter

Comments: 11 pages, LaTeX

One of the most intriguing unsolved problems in modern cosmology involves thenature of the observed dark matter in the universe. Various hypotheticalparticles have been postulated as the source of the dark matter, but as of yetnone of these particles have been observed. In this paper I present analternative view. The observations indicate the presence of a new force that ismuch weaker than gravity on small scales and stronger than gravity on largescales. This new force is described by a Liouville field that consists of ascalar field with an exponential potential. The solutions have a Newtonianbehavior on small scales and produce forces that are weak compared to gravity.On large scales the field has a logarithmic behavior and will therefore produceflat rotation curves. The Liouville field may therefore be able to account forthe observations that are usually taken to imply the existence of dark matter.
