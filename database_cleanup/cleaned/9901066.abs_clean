Sweden, August 20-22, 1998We study anti-de Sitter black holes in 2+1 dimensions in terms of ChernSimons gauge theory of the anti-de Sitter group coupled to a Source. Taking thesource to be an anti-de Sitter state specified by its Casimir invariants, weshow how all the relevant features of the black hole are accounted for.Enlarging the gauge symmetry to super AdS group, we obtain a supermultiplet ofAdS black holes. We give explicit expressions for the masses and the angularmomenta of the members of the multiplet.
