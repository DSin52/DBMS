We deal with the problem of diffeomorphism anomaly in theories with branes.In particular we thoroughly analyze the problem of the residual chiral anomalyof a five-brane immersed in M-theory, paying attention to its globalformulation in the five-brane world-volume. We conclude that the anomaly can becanceled by a {\it local} counterterm in the five-brane world-volume.
