As argued by Witten on the basis of M-theory, QCD strings can end on domainwalls. We present an explanation of this effect in the framework of effectivefield theories for the Polyakov loop and the gluino condensate in N=1supersymmetric QCD. The domain walls separating confined phases with differentvalues of the gluino condensate are completely wet by a layer of deconfinedphase at the high-temperature phase transition. As a consequence, even at lowtemperatures, the Polyakov loop has a non-vanishing expectation value on thedomain wall. Thus, close to the wall, the free energy of a static quark isfinite and the string emanating from it can end on the wall.
