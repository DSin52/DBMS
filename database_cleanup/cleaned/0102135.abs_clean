We consider the collision in 2+1 dimensions of a black hole and a negativetension brane on an orbifold. Because there is no gravitational radiation in2+1 dimensions, the horizon area shrinks when part of the brane falls through.This provides a potential violation of the generalized second law ofthermodynamics. However, tracing the details of the dynamical evolution onefinds that it does not proceed from equilibrium configuration to equilibriumconfiguration. Instead, a catastrophic space-time singularity develops similarto the `big crunch' of $\Omega >1$ FRW space-times. In the context of classicalgeneral relativity, our result demonstrates a new instability of constructionswith negative tension branes.
