The theory of magnetohydrodynamics is extended to the cases of a plasma ofseparate magnetic and electric charges, as well as to a plasma of dyonsrespectively. In both these cases the system possesses electric-magneticduality symmetry. In the former case we find that because of the existence oftwo independent generalized Ohm's law equations, the limit of infinite electricand magnetic conductivity results in the vanishing of both electric andmagnetic fields, as well as the corresponding currents. In the dyonic case, wefind that the resulting duality-invariant system of equations are equivalent tothose of ordinary MHD, after suitable field redefinitions.
