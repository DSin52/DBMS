We first obtain the analogue of Vaidya's solution on the brane for studyingthe collapse of null fluid onto a flat Minkowski cavity on the brane. Since theback-reaction of the bulk onto the brane is supposed to strengthen gravity onthe brane, it would favour formation of black hole as against nakedsingularity. That is the parameter window in the initial data set giving riseto naked singularity in the 4D Vaidya case would now get partially covered.
