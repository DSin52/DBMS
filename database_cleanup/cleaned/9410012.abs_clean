The supersymmetric collective field theory with the potential $v'(x)=\omegax-{\eta\over x}$ is studied, motivated by the matrix model proposed by Jevickiand Yoneya to describe two dimensional string theory in a black holebackground. Consistency with supersymmetry enforces a two band solution. Asupersymmetric classical configuration is found, and interpreted in terms ofthe density of zeros of certain Laguerre polynomials. The spectrum of the modelis then studied and is seen to correspond to a massless scalar and a majoranafermion. The $x$ space eigenfunctions are constructed and expressed in terms ofChebyshev polynomials. Higher order interactions are also discussed.
