The determination of the critical exponents by means of the ExactRenormalizion Group approach is still a topic of debate. The general flowequation is by construction scheme independent, but the use of the truncatedderivative expansion generates a model dependence in the determination of theuniversal quantities. We derive new nonperturbative flow equations for theone-component, $Z_2$ symmetric scalar field to the next-to-leading order of thederivative expansion by means of a class of proper time regulators. Thecritical exponents $\eta$, $\nu$ and $\omega$ for the Wilson-Fisher fixed pointare computed by numerical integration of the flow equations, without resortingto polynomial truncations. We show that by reducing the width of the cut-offemployed, the critical exponents become rapidly insensitive to the cut-offwidth and their values are in good agreement with the results of entirelydifferent approaches.
