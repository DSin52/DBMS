The static gauge potential between heavy sources is computed from a recentlyintroduced non-critical bosonic string background. When the sources are locatedat the infinity of the holographic coordinate, the linear dilaton behavior isrecovered, which means that the potential is exactly linear in the separationbetween the sources. When the sources are moved towards the origin, a competingoverconfining cubic branch appears, which is however disfavored energetically.
