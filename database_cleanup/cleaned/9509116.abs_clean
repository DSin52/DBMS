al. (eds.) pp. 443-457 (1997).First, we show that in the $(1,0)\oplus(0,1)$ representation space thereexist not one but two theories for charged particles. In the Weinbergconstruct, the boson and its antiboson carry {\it same} relative intrinsicparity, whereas in our construct the relative intrinsic parities of the bosonand its antiboson are {\it opposite}. These results originate from thecommutativity of the operations of Charge conjugation and Parity in Weinberg'stheory, and from the anti-commutativity of the operations of Charge conjugationand Parity in our theory. We thus claim that we have constructed a firstnon-trivial quantum theory of fields for the Wigner-type particles. Second, themassless limit of both theories seems formally identical and suggests afundamental modification of Maxwell equations. At its simplest level, themodification to Maxwell equations enters via additional boundary condition(s).
