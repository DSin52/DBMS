MPI-Ph/93-42, UW-IFT-10/93An elementary method of determination of the character of the hot phasetransition in 4d four-fermion NJL-type models is applied to non-supersymmetricand supersymmetric versions of simple NJL model. We find that in the non-susycase the transition is usually of the second order. It is weakly first orderonly in the region of parameters which correspond to fermion masses comparableto the cut-off. In the supersymmetric case both kinds of phase transitions arepossible. For sufficiently strong coupling and sufficiently large susy-breakingscale the transition is always of the first order.
