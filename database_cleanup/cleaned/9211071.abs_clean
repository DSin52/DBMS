The low-lying excitations of a quantum Hall state on a disk geometry are edgeexcitations. Their dynamics is governed by a conformal field theory on thecylinder defined by the disk boundary and the time variable. We give a simpleand detailed derivation of this conformal field theory for integer filling,starting from the microscopic dynamics of $(2+1)$-dimensional non-relativisticelectrons in Landau levels. This construction can be generalized to describeLaughlin's fractional Hall states via chiral bosonization, thereby makingcontact with the effective Chern-Simons theory approach. The conformal fieldtheory dictates the finite-size effects in the energy spectrum. An experimentalor numerical verification of these universal effects would provide a furtherconfirmation of Laughlin's theory of incompressible quantum fluids.
