Using the renormalization group (RG) approach and the equivalency between theclass of gauge-Higgs-Yukawa models and the gauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL)model, we study the gauged NJL model in curved space-time. The behaviour of thescalar-gravitational coupling constant $\xi(t)$ in both theories is discussed.The RG improved effective potential of gauged NJL model in curved spacetime isfound. The curvature at which chiral symmetry in the gauged NJL model is brokenis obtained explicitly in a remarkably simple form. The powerful RG improvedeffective potential formalizm leads to the same results as ladderSchwinger-Dyson equations which have not been formulated yet in curvedspacetime what opens new possibilities in the study of GUTs and NJL-like modelsin curved spacetime.
