Recently we showed that the postulated diffeomorphic equivalence of statesimplies quantum mechanics. This approach takes the canonical variables to bedependent by the relation p=\partial_q S_0 and exploits a basicGL(2,C)-symmetry which underlies the canonical formalism. In particular, welooked for the special transformations leading to the free system withvanishing energy. Furthermore, we saw that while on the one hand theequivalence principle cannot be consistently implemented in classicalmechanics, on the other it naturally led to the quantum analogue of theHamilton-Jacobi equation, thus implying the Schroedinger equation. In thisletter we show that actually the principle uniquely leads to this solution.Furthermore, we find the map reducing any system to the free one with vanishingenergy and derive the transformations on S_0 leaving the wave functioninvariant. We also express the canonical and Schroedinger equations by means ofthe brackets recently introduced in the framework of N=2 SYM. These bracketsare the analogue of the Poisson brackets with the canonical variables taken asdependent.
