We consider classical Teichmuller theory and the geodesic flow on thecotangent bundle of the Teichmuller space. We show that the correspondingorbits provide a canonical description of certain (2+1) gravity systems inwhich a set of point-like particles evolve in universes with topology S_g x Rwhere S_g is a Riemann surface of genus g >1. We construct an explicit York'sslicing presentation of the associated spacetimes, we give an interpretation ofthe asymptotic states in terms of measured foliations and discuss the structureof the phase spaces.
