We present a finite dimensional matrix model associated to the noncommutativeChern-Simons theory, obtained by inserting a Wilson line. For a specific choiceof the representation of the Wilson line the model is equivalent to the minimalmodification of the matrix model which is compatible with finite dimensionalmatrices, and was introduced previously to study droplets of quantum Hallfluid. For other representations we obtain generalizations corresponding toregularized U(n) Chern-Simons theoris, representing multilayered quantum Hallfluids.
