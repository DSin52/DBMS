Six-dimensional Nielsen-Olesen vortices are analyzed in the context of aquadratic gravity theory containing Euler-Gauss-Bonnet self-interactions. Therelations among the string tensions can be tuned in such a way that theobtained solutions lead to warped compactification on the vortex. New regularsolutions are possible in comparison with the case where the gravity actiononly consists of the Einstein-Hilbert term. The parameter space of the model isdiscussed
