Title: RG study of a non local sine-Gordon model

Authors: Carlos M. Na\'on and Mariano J. Salvay

Comments: 14 pages, 3 figures

We study a non local version of the sine-Gordon model connected to amany-body system with backward and umklapp scattering processes. Usingrenormalization group methods we derive the flow equations for the couplingsand show how non locality affects the gap in the spectrum of charge-densityexcitations. We compare our results with previous predictions obtained throughthe self-consistent harmonic approximation.
