The purpose of this paper is to apply the framework of non- commutativedifferential geometry to quantum deformations of a class of Kahler manifolds.For the examples of the Cartan domains of type I and flat space, we constructFredholm modules over the quantized manifolds using the supercharges whicharise in the quantization of supersymmetric generalizations of the manifolds.We compute the explicit formula for the Chern character on generators of theToeplitz C^* -algebra.
