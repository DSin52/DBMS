We show that the supersymmetric Wilson loops in IIB matrix model give atransition operator from reduced supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory tosupersymmetric space-time theory. In comparison with Green-Schwarz superstringwe identify the supersymmetric Wilson loops with the asymptotic states of IIBsuperstring. It is pointed out that the supersymmetry transformation law of theWilson loops is the inverse of that for the vertex operators of massless modesin the U(N) open superstring with Dirichlet boundary condition.
