A unified and fully relativistic treatment of the interaction of the electricand magnetic dipole moments of a particle with the electromagnetic field isgiven. New forces on the particle due to the combined effect of electric andmagnetic dipoles are obtained. Four new experiments are proposed, three ofwhich would observe topological phase shifts.
