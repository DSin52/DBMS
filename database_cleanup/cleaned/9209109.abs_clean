Title: Maslov indices for periodic orbits

Authors: E.Meinrenken

Comments: 5 pages, THEP 92/21

It is shown that there is a generalization of the Conley-Zehnder index forperiodic trajectories of a classical Hamiltonian system $(Q, \omega, H)$ fromthe case $Q = T^*R^n$ to arbitrary symplectic manifolds. As it turns out, it isprecisely this index which appears as a Maslov phase in the trace formulas byGutzwiller and Duistermaat-Guillemin. Contribution presented at the XIX ICGTMPSalamanca June 92.
