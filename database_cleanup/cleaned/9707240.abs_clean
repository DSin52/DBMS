We propose a simple method for constructing representations of(super)conformal and nonlinear W-type algebras in terms of their subalgebrasand corresponding Nambu-Goldstone fields. We apply it to N=2 and N=1superconformal algebras and describe in this way various embeddings of stringsand superstrings for which these algebras and their subalgebras defineworld-sheet symmetries. Besides reproducing the known examples, we present somenew ones, in particular an embedding of the bosonic string with additional U(1)affine symmetry into N=2 superstring. We also apply our method to the nonlinear$W_3^{(2)}$ algebra and demonstrate that the linearization procedure worked outfor it some time ago gets a natural interpretation as a kind of stringembedding. All these embeddings include the critical ones as particular cases.
