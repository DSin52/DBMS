We explicitly construct soliton operators in $D<2$ (or $c<1$) string theory,and show that the Schwinger-Dyson equations allow solutions with these solitonsas backgrounds. The dominant contributions from 1-soliton background areexplicitly evaluated in the weak coupling limit, and shown to agree with thenonperturbative analysis of string equations. We suggest that fermions shouldbe treated as fundamental dynamical variables since both macroscopic loops andsolitons are constructed in their bilinear forms.
