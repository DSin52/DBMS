We consider compact four-dimensional ${\bf Z_N}\times {\bf Z_M}$ type IIBorientifolds, for certain values of $N$ and $M$. We allow the additionalfeature of discrete torsion and discuss the modification of the consistencyconditions arising from tadpole cancellation. We point out the differencesbetween the cases with and without discrete torsion.
