We study some of the novel properties of conformal field theories withnoncompact target spaces as applied to string theory. Standard CFT results getcorrected by boundary terms in the target space in a way consistent with theexpected spacetime physics. For instance, one-point functions of generaloperators on the sphere and boundary operators on the disk need not vanish; weshow that they are instead equal to boundary terms in spacetime. By applyingthis result to vertex operators for spacetime gauge transformations withsupport at infinity, we derive formulas for conserved gauge charges in stringtheory. This approach provides a direct CFT definition of ADM energy-momentumin string theory.
