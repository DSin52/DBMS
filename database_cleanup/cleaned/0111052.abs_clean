Authors: I. Pappa (National Technical University of Athens)

Comments: Extended version of a poster presented at the 10th Tohwa

International Symposium on String Theory in Fukuoka, Japan, to be publishedby the American Institute of Physics. 13 pages, 2 figuresWe study the cosmological evolution of a D3-brane Universe in a type 0 stringbackground. We follow the brane universe along the radial coordinate of thebackground and we calculate the energy density which is induced on the branebecause of its motion in the bulk. For constant values of tachyon and dilatonan inflationary phase is appearing. For non constant values of tachyon anddilaton and for a particular range of values of the scale factor of thebrane-universe, the effective energy density is dominated by a termproportional to $\frac{1}{(\log\alpha)^{4}}$ indicating a slowly varyinginflationary phase.
