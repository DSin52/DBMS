We consider the evolution of circular string loops in power law expandinguniverses represented by a spatially flat Friedman-Robertson-Walker metric withscale factor $a(t)\propto t^p$ where $t$ is the cosmic time and $p\geq 0$. Ourmain result is the existence of a "magic" power $p_m=3+2\sqrt{2}$. Inspacetimes with $p<p_m$ a circular string expands either forever or to amaximal radius and then contracts until it collapses into a point (black hole).For $p>p_m$, however, we find additional types of solutions. They includeconfigurations which contract from a positive initial radius to a minimal oneand then expand forever. Their existence we interpret as an indication for thepresence of a finite potential barrier. Equivalently the new solutions signalstring nucleation and tunneling, phenomena recently shown to occur in de Sitterspace.
