We show that string theory with Dirichlet boundaries is equivalent to stringtheory containing surfaces with certain singular points. Surface curvature issingular at these points. A singular point is resolved in conformal coordinatesto a circle with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We also show that moduliparameters of singular surfaces coincide with those of smooth surfaces withboundaries. Singular surfaces with saddle points indeed arise in the strongcoupling expansion in lattice QCD. The kind of saddle point, which may be theorigin of a singular point we need, is of infinite order.
