We investigate possible existence of duality symmetries which exchange theKaluza-Klein modes with the wrapping modes of a BPS saturated $p$-brane on atorus. Assuming the validity of the conjectured $U$-duality symmetries of typeII and heterotic string theories and $M$-theory, we show that for a BPSsaturated $p$-brane there is an SL(2,Z) symmetry that mixes the Kaluza-Kleinmodes on a $(p+1)$ dimensional torus $T^{(p+1)}$ with the wrapping modes of the$p$-brane on $T^{(p+1)}$. The field that transforms as a modular parameterunder this SL(2,Z) transformation has as its real part the component of the$(p+1)$-form gauge field on $T^{(p+1)}$, and as its imaginary part the volumeof $T^{(p+1)}$, measured in the metric that couples naturally to the $p$-brane.
