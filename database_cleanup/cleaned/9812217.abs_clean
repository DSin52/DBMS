Title: Canonical Quantization for the Light-Front Weyl Gauge

Comments: 18 pages, no figures

The canonical quantization on a single light front is performed for theAbelian gauge fields with the Weyl gauge coupled with fermion field currents.The analysis is carried separately for 1+1 dimensions and for higherdimensions. The Gauss law, implemented weakly as the condition on states,selects physical subspace with the Poincare covariance recovered. Theperturbative gauge field propagators are found with the ML prescription fortheir spurious poles. The LF Feynman rules are found and their equivalence withthe usual equal-time perturbation for the S-matrix elements is studied for allorders.
