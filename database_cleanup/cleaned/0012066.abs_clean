We consider the physical implications of various choices of thethree-momentum basis in the kappa-deformed Poincare algebra. In particular, wefind that the energy dependence of the velocity of a kappa-particle leads tounexpected features in kappa-deformed kinematics. We also discuss the notion ofkappa-deformed dynamics, and as a tool example we investigate the motion of akappa-deformed particle under the action of a constant force.
