Title: New Modular Hopf Algebras related to rational $k$ $\widehat {sl(2)}$

Comments: 30 pages (minor typos corrected, refs added)

We show that the Hopf link invariants for an appropriate set of finitedimensional representations of $ U_q SL(2)$ are identical, up to overallnormalisation, to the modular S matrix of Kac and Wakimoto for rational $k$$\widehat {sl(2)}$ representations. We use this observation to construct newmodular Hopf algebras, for any root of unity $q=e^{-i\pi m/r}$, obtained bytaking appropriate quotients of $U_q SL(2)$, that give rise to 3-manifoldinvariants according to the approach of Reshetikin and Turaev. The phase factorcorrecting for the `framing anomaly' in these invariants is equal to $ e^{- {{i\pi} \over 4} ({ {3k} \over {k+2}})}$, an analytic continuation of the anomalyat integer $k$. As expected, the Verlinde formula gives fusion rulemultiplicities in agreement with the modular Hopf algebras. This leads to aproposal, for $(k+2)=r/m$ rational with an odd denominator, for a set of$\widehat {sl(2)}$ representations obtained by dropping some of the highestweight representations in the Kac-Wakimoto set and replacing them with lowestweight representations. For this set of representations the Verlinde formulagives non-negative integer fusion rule multiplicities. We discuss theconsistency of the truncation to highest and lowest weight representations inconformal field theory.
