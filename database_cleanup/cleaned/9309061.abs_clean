The quantization of the superclassical system used in the proof of the indextheorem results in a factor of $\hbar^{2}R/8 $ in the Hamiltonian. The pathintegral expression of the kernel is analyzed up to and including 2-loop order.The existence of the scalar curvature term is confirmed by comparing the linearterm in the heat kernel expansion with the 2-loop order terms in the loopexpansion.
