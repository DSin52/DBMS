We obtain effective potential of $O(N)$-symmetric $\phi^4$ theory for large$N$ starting with a finite lattice system and taking the thermodynamic limitwith great care. In the thermodynamic limit, it is globally real-valued andconvex in both the symmetric and the broken phases. In particular, it has aflat bottom in the broken phase. Taking the continuum limit, we discussrenormalization effects to the flat bottom and exhibit the effective potentialof the continuum theory in three and four dimensions.On the other hand theeffective potential is nonconvex in a finite lattice system. Our numericalstudy shows that the barrier height of the effective potential flattens as alinear size of the system becomes large. It decreases obeying power law and theexponent is about $-2$. The result is clearly understood from dominance ofconfigurations with slowly-rotating field in one direction.
