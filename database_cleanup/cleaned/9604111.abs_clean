In this paper, we probe the validity of the tunnelling interpretation that isusually called forth in literature to explain the phenomenon of particleproduction by time independent classical electromagnetic backgrounds. We showthat the imaginary part of the effective lagrangian is zero for a complexscalar field quantized in a time independent, but otherwise arbitrary, magneticfield. This result implies that no pair creation takes place in such abackground. But we find that when the quantum field is decomposed into itsnormal modes in the presence of a spatially confined and time independentmagnetic field, there exists a non-zero tunnelling probability for theeffective Schr{\" o}dinger equation. According to the tunnellinginterpretation, this result would imply that spatially confined magnetic fieldscan produce particles, thereby contradicting the result obtained from theeffective lagrangian. This lack of consistency between these two approachescalls into question the validity of attributing a non-zero tunnellingprobability for the effective Schr{\" o}dinger equation to the production ofparticles by the time independent electromagnetic backgrounds. The implicationsof our analysis are discussed.
