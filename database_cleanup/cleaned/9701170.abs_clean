We use the microscopic instanton calculus to determine the one-instantoncontribution to the quantum modulus u_3=<Tr(\phi^3)> in N=2 SU(N_c)supersymmetric QCD with N_f<2N_c fundamental flavors. This is compared with thecorresponding prediction of the hyperelliptic curves which are expected to giveexact solutions in this theory. The results agree up to certain regular termswhich appear when N_f\geq 2N_c-3. The curve prediction for these terms dependsupon the curve parameterization which is generically ambiguous when N_f\geqN_c. In SU(3) theory our instanton calculation of the regular terms is found todisagree with the predictions of all of the suggested curves. For this theorywe employ our results as input to improve the curve parameterization forN_f=3,4,5.
