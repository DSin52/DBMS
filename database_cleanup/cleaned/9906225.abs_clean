We develop a general framework for quantum field theory on noncommutativespaces, i.e., spaces with quantum group symmetry. We use the path integralapproach to obtain expressions for $n$-point functions. Perturbation theoryleads us to generalised Feynman diagrams which are braided, i.e., they havenon-trivial over- and under-crossings. We demonstrate the power of our approachby applying it to $\phi^4$-theory on the quantum 2-sphere. We find that thebasic divergent diagram of the theory is regularised.
