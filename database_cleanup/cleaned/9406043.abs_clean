The dual resonance model, which was a precursor of string theory was basedupon the idea that two-particle scattering amplitudes should be expressibleequivalently as a sum of contributions of an infinite number of $s$ channelpoles each corresponding to a finite number of particles with definite spin, oras a similar sum of $t$ channel poles. The famous example of Veneziano\cite{ven} satisfies all these requirements, and is additionally ghost free.Werecall other trajectories which provide solutions to the duality constraints,e.g. the general Mobi\"us trajectories and the logarithmic trajectories, whichwere thought to be lacking this last feature. We however demonstrate, partlyempirically, the existence of a regime within a particular deformation of theVeneziano amplitude for logarithmic trajectories for which the amplituderemains ghost free.
