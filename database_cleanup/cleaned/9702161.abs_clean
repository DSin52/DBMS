The construction of new hyper-Kaehler manifolds by taking the infinitemonopole mass limit of certain Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield monopole modulispaces is considered. The one-parameter family of hyperkaehler manifolds due toDancer is shown to be an example of such manifolds. A new family of fixedmonopole spaces is constructed. They are the moduli spaces of four SU(4)monopoles, in the infinite mass limit of two of the monopoles. These manifoldsare shown to be nonsingular when the fixed monopole positions are distinct.
