Generalized quons interpolating between Bose, Fermi, para-Bose, para-Fermi,and anyonic statistics are proposed. They follow from the R-matrix approach todeformed associative algebras. It is proved that generalized quons have thesame main properties as quons. A new result for the number operator ispresented and some physical features of generalized quons are discussed in thelimit $|q_{ij}^{2}| \rightarrow 1$.
