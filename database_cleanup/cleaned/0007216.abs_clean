We study the symmetry behavior of the Gross-Neveu model in three and twodimensions with random chemical potential. This is equivalent to a four-fermionmodel with charge conjugation symmetry as well as Z_2 chiral symmetry. At hightemperature the Z_2 chiral symmetry is always restored. In three dimensions theinitially broken charge conjugation symmetry is not restored at hightemperature, irrespective of the value of the disorder strength. In twodimensions and at zero temperature the charge conjugation symmetry undergoes aquantum phase transition from a symmetric state (for weak disorder) to a brokenstate (for strong disorder) as the disorder strength is varied. For any givenvalue of disorder strength, the high-temperature behavior of the chargeconjugation symmetry is the same as its zero-temperature behavior. Therefore,in two dimensions and for strong disorder strength the charge conjugationsymmetry is not restored at high temperature.
