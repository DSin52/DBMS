We consider a brane moving close to a large number of coincident branes. Wecompare the calculation of the effective action using the gauge theory livingon the brane and the calculation using the supergravity approximation. Wediscuss some general features about the correspondence between large N gaugetheories and black holes. Then we do a one loop calculation which applies forextremal and near extremal black holes. We comment on the expected results forhigher loop calculations. We make some comments on the Matrix theoryinterpretation of these results.
