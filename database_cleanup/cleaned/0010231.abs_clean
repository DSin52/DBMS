on the text correctedThe canonical formalism in classical theory of QCD is constructed on aspace-like hypersurface. The Poisson bracket on the space-like hypersurface isdefined and it plays an important role to describe every algebraic relation inthe canonical formalism into Lorentz covariant form. Surface integrals areintroduced as alternatives of field equations for quarks, gluons, andFaddeev-Popov ghosts. It is shown that deformations of the space-likehypersurface for surface integrals are generated by the interaction term of QCDHamiltonian density. By converting the Poisson bracket on the space-likehypersurface to four-dimensional commutator, we can pass over to QCD in theHeisenberg picture without spoiling the explicit Lorentz covariance.
