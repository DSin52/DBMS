Title: On the effects of the vanishing of the non-metricity to the effective

string field equationsAuthors: Suayyip Salim Ozkurt

Comments: 2 pages

Effective string field equations with zero-constrained torsion have beenstudied extensively in the literature. But, one may think that the effects ofvanishing of the non-metricity have not been explained in detail and also inaccording to some recent literature [4],[5], the action density in my previouspaper [3] is not complete. For these reasons, in this erratum, in according tothe effects of vanishing of the non-metricity to the field equations, theaction density of my previous paper [3] will be completed in a variationalsetting. Furthermore, up to now, an unambiguous derivation of the dilatonpotential has not been given. If one thinks that vanishing of the non-metricitygives a spontaneous breakdown of local Weyl invariance then a dilaton potentialis obtained unambiguously in this framework.
