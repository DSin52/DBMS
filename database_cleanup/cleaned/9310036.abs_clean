The effective action is derived for a self-interacting theory with a finitefixed $O(2)$ charge at finite temperature in curved spacetime. We obtain thehigh temperature expansion of the effective action in the weak coupling limit.In the relativistic temperature, we discuss about the phase transition in ahomogeneous spacetime.
