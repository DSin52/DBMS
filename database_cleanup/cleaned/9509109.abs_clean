The mechanism of dimensional transmutation is discussed in the context ofMaxwell-Chern-Simons scalar QED. The method used is non-perturbative. Theeffective potential describes a broken symmetry state. It is found that thesymmetry breaking vacuum is more stable when the Chern-Simons mass is differentfrom zero.
