We consider the reduction of supersymmetry in N-extended four dimensionalsupergravity via the super Higgs mechanism in theories without cosmologicalconstant. We provide an analysis largely based on the properties of long andshort multiplets of Poincare' supersymmetry. Examples of the super Higgsphenomenon are realized in spontaneously broken N=8 supergravity through theScherk-Schwarz mechanism and in superstring compactification in presence ofbrane fluxes. In many models the massive vectors count the difference in numberof the translation isometries of the scalar sigma-model geometries in thebroken and unbroken phase.
