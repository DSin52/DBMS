Critical systems are described by conformal field theories, whose dynamicscan be exactly solved in two dimensions. In the presence of a boundary, withthe so-called method of images it is possible to study the surface criticalbehaviour of these systems, and the conformal boundary conditions can berelated to the bulk operator content of the theory. After an overview of thebasic concepts of bulk and boundary conformal field theory, we present anexplicit calculation of some two-point correlation functions in Virasorominimal models with boundary. In the second part of the thesis, we summarizethe known results about perturbed conformal field theories, which describe thedynamics of systems away from the critical point. We concentrate on cases inwhich the off-critical massive field theory is integrable, with a correspondingpurely elastic and factorized scattering theory, focusing our attention on thebootstrap approach. We also present the basic properties of affine Toda fieldtheories, whose S-matrices are closely related to the ones of some perturbedminimal models. In the presence of a boundary, assuming that the boundaryconditions are compatible with integrability, the scattering theory is stillelastic and factorized. The analytic structure of the reflection matrix encodesthe boundary spectrum of the theory, in the light of a bootstrap approachanalogous to the bulk one. Starting from two kinds of known reflectionamplitudes, we have performed a detailed study of the boundary bound statesstructure for the three E_{n} affine Toda field theories and for thecorresponding perturbed minimal models.
