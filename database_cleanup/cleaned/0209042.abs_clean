The algebraic and geometric structures of deformations are analyzedconcerning topological field theories of Schwarz type by means of theBatalin-Vilkovisky formalism. Deformations of the Chern-Simons-BF theory inthree dimensions induces the Courant algebroid structure on the target space asa sigma model. Deformations of BF theories in $n$ dimensions are also analyzed.Two dimensional deformed BF theory induces the Poisson structure and threedimensional deformed BF theory induces the Courant algebroid structure on thetarget space as a sigma model. The deformations of BF theories in $n$dimensions induce the structures of Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras on the targetspace.
