Using the conformal compensator superfields of N=2 D=4 supergravity, the TypeIIB S-duality transformations are expressed as a linear rotation which mixesthe compensator and matter superfields. The classical superspace action for D=4compactifications of Type IIB supergravity is manifestly invariant under thistransformation. Furthermore, the introduction of conformal compensators allowsa Fradkin-Tseytlin term to be added to the manifestly SL(2,Z)-covariant sigmamodel action of Townsend and Cederwall.
