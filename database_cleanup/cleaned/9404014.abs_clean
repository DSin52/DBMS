The behavior of finite temperature planar electrodynamics is investigated. Wecalculate the static as well as dynamic characteristic functions using realtime formalism. The temperature and density dependence of dielectric andpermeability functions, plasmon frequencies and their relation to the screeninglength is determined. The radiative correction to the fermion mass is alsocalculated. We also calculate the temperature dependence of the electron(anyon) magnetic moment. Our results for the gyromagnetic ratio go smoothly tothe known result at zero temperature, $g=2$, in accordance with the generalexpectation.
