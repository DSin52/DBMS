We consider the coupling of nonminimal scalar multiplets to supersymmetricYang-Mills in four dimensions and compute the one-loop contribution to thelow-energy effective action in the abelian sector. We show that the resultingtheory realizes the dual version of the corresponding one from N=2supersymmetric Yang-Mills.
