A gas of $N$ Bogomol'nyi vortices in the Abelian Higgs model is studied on acompact Riemann surface of genus $g$ and area $A$. The volume of the modulispace is computed and found to depend on $N, g$ and $A$, but not on otherdetails of the shape of the surface. The volume is then used to find thethermodynamic partition function and it is shown that the thermodynamicalproperties of such a gas do not depend on the genus of the Riemann surface.
