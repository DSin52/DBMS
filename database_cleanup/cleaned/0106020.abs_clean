We show that for a large class of d=4 N=2 conformal field theories the 1/Ncorrection to the chiral anomaly of the U(1) R-current can be shown to arisefrom the D7-branes present in the dual orientifolded orbifold string theories,generalizing a result in the literature for the simplest case. We also studythe U(1)_R anomaly for d=4 N=1 conformal field theories that arise fromorientifolds of the conifold. We find agreement between the field- andstring-theoretic calculations, confirming a prediction of the AdS/CFTcorrespondence at order 1/N for string theories on AdS_5 x T^{11}/Z_2.
