The method of construction of auxiliary representations for a given Liealgebra is discussed in the framework of the BRST approach. The correspondingBRST charge turns out to be non -- hermitian. This problem is solved by theintroduction of the additional kernel operator in the definition of the scalarproduct in the Fock space. The existence of the kernel operator is proven forany Lie algebra.
