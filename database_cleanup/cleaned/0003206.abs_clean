In an induced-gravity model, the stability condition of an inflationaryslow-rollover solution is shown to be $\phi_0\partial_{\phi_0}V(\phi_0)=4V(\phi_0)$. The presence of higher derivative termswill, however, act against the stability of this expanding solution unlessfurther constraints on the field parameters are imposed. We find that thesemodels will acquire a non-vanishing cosmological constant at the end ofinflation. Some models are analyzed for their implication to the earlyuniverse.
