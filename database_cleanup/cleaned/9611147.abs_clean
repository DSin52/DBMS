Asymptotic states in field theories containing non-local kinetic terms areanalyzed using the canonical method, naturally defined in Minkowski space. Weapply our results to study the asymptotic states of a non-localMaxwell-Chern-Simons theory coming from bosonization in 2+1 dimensions. Weshow that in this case the only asymptotic state of the theory, in the trivial(non-topological) sector, is the vacuum.
