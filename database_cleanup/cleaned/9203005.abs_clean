We review the Symmetric Unitary One Matrix Models. In particular we discussthe string equation in the operator formalism, the mKdV flows and the VirasoroConstraints. We focus on the $\t$-function formalism for the flows and wedescribe its connection to the (big cell of the) Sato Grassmannian $\Gr$ viathe Plucker embedding of $\Gr$ into a fermionic Fock space. Then the space ofsolutions to the string equation is an explicitly computable subspace of$\Gr\times\Gr$ which is invariant under the flows.
