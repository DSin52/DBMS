We examine the system where a string stretches between pair of D-branes, andstudy the bending of the D-brane caused by the tension of the string. If thedistance between the pair of D-branes is sent to infinity, the tension of thestring stretching between them is strong enough to pull the spike all the wayto infinity. We study the shape of these spikes when the branes are finitedistance apart using two different methods. First, we consider a stringstretched between a pair of D2-branes in type IIA theory by going to theM-theory limit in which all of these branes are M-theory 2-branes embeddedalong a holomorphic curve. Second, we consider a D-string stretched between apair of D3-branes in type IIB theory and infer the geometry of the D3-braneembeddings from the configuration of the adjoint scalar field in the magneticmonopole solution of Prasad and Sommerfield. The case of fundamental stringstretching between a pair of D3-branes follows from S-duality. The energy ofthese configurations matches the expected value based on fundamental string andD-string tensions.
