We study the replacement of SU(3) by SU_q(3) in standard gauge theories. Atthe level of a global theory there is a physically sensible SU_q(3) formalismwith measurable differences from the SU(3) theory. In contrast to the SU_q(2)case, where it is possible to construct a q-electroweak theory, there is nolocal (Yang-Mills) formalism for SU_q(3).
