Title: Diffeomorphisms of the Klein Bottle and Projective Plane

Authors: J. S. Apps and J. S. Dowker

Comments: 18 pages, LATEX

We calculate the Riemann curvature tensor and sectional curvature for the Liegroup of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the Klein bottle and projectiveplane. In particular, we investigate the sign of the sectional curvature, andfind a possible disagreement with a theorem of Lukatskii. We suggest anamendment to this theorem.
