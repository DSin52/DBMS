We consider models with N U(1) gauge fields A_{\mu}^n, N Kalb-Ramond fieldsB_{\mu \nu}^n, an arbitrary bare action and a fixed UV cutoff \Lambda. Undermild assumptions these can be obtained as effective low energy theories ofSU(N+1) Yang Mills theories in the maximal abelian gauge. For a large class ofbare actions they can be solved in the large N limit and exhibit confinement.The confining phase is characterized by an approximate ``low energy'' vectorgauge symmetry under which the Kalb-Ramond fields B_{\mu\nu}^n transform. Thesame symmetry allows for a duality transformation showing that magneticmonopoles have condensed. The models allow for various mechanisms ofconfinement, depending on which sources for A_{\mu}^n or B_{\mu \nu}^n areswitched on, but the area law for the Wilson loop is obtained in any case.
