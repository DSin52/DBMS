Title: Linear Stability of Dilatonic Black Holes

Comments: Latex2e, 11 pages, 3 postscript figures included, Talk presented at

the "International Workshop on Recent Developments in High Energy Physics"organized by the Hellenic Society for the Study of High Energy Physics atDemocritos NRC, Athens, Greece, April 9-11, 1998In this talk, we recall the most important features of the Dilatonic BlackHoles which arise in the framework of the Einstein-Dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet theoryand which are dressed with a classical long range dilaton field incontradiction with the existing "no-hair" theorems of the Theory of GeneralRelativity. We demonstrate linear stability of these black hole solutions undersmall spacetime-dependent perturbations by making use of a semi-analytic methodbased on the Fubini-Sturm's theorem. As a result, the Dilatonic Black Holesconstitute one of the very few examples of stable black hole solutions withnon-trivial "hair" that arise in the framework of a more generalised theory ofgravity.
