We show that the Ashtekar-Isham extension of the classical configurationspace of Yang-Mills theories (i.e. the moduli space of connections) is(topologically and measure-theoretically) the projective limit of a family offinite dimensional spaces associated with arbitrary finite lattices. Theseresults are then used to prove that the classical configuration space iscontained in a zero measure subset of this extension with respect to thediffeomorphism invariant Ashtekar-Lewandowski measure.Much as in scalar field theory, this implies that states in the quantumtheory associated with this measure can be realized as functions on the``extended" configuration space.
