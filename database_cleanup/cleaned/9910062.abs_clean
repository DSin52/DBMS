By adding gauge fields to the D-string classical solution, which havenon-zero contribution to commutators in continuum limit (extreme large $N$), weintroduced $(m,n)$-strings in IIB matrix model. It is found that the size ofmatrices depends on the value of the electric field. The tension of thesestrings appears in $SL(2,Z)$ invariant form. The interaction for parallel andangled strings are found in agreement with the string theory for small electricfields.
