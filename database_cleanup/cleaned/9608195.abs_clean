We study cosmological solutions of type II string theory with a metric of theKaluza--Klein type and nontrivial Ramond--Ramond forms. It is shown that modelswith only one form excited can be integrated in general. Moreover, someinteresting cases with two nontrivial forms can be solved completely since theycorrespond to Toda models. We find two types of solutions corresponding to anegative time superinflating phase and a positive time subluminal expandingphase. The two branches are separated by a curvature singularity. Within eachbranch the effect of the forms is to interpolate between different solutions ofpure Kaluza--Klein theory.
