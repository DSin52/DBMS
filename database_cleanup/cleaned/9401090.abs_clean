Effect of Landau Level MixingAuthors: Rashmi Ray and Gil Gat

Comments: 15 pages, plain tex

We obtain expressions for the current operator in the lowest Landau level(L.L.L.) field theory, where higher Landau level mixing due to various externaland interparticle interactions is sytematically taken into account. We considerthe current operators in the presence of electromagnetic interactions, bothCoulomb and time-dependent, as well as local four-fermi interactions. Theimportance of Landau level mixing for long-range interactions is especiallyemphasized. We also calculate the edge-current for a finite sample.
