We give the full list of types of static (homogeneous)solutions within a widefamily of exactly solvable 2D dilaton gravities with backreaction of conformalfields. It includes previously known solutions as particular cases. Severalconcrete examples are considered for illustration. They contain a black holeand cosmological horizon in thermal equilibrium, extremal and ultraextremalhorizons, etc. In particular, we demonstrate that adS and dS geometries can be\QTR{it}{exact} solutions of semiclassical field equations for a\QTR{it}{nonconstant} dilaton field.
