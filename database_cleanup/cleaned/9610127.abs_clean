correctedWe study the large N limit in the presence of magnetic monopoles in theYang-Mills/Higgs model in three dimensions. The physics in the limit dependsstrongly on the distribution of eigenvalues of the Higgs field in the vacuum,and we propose a particular, nondegenerate configuration. It minimizes the freeenergy at the moment of symmetry breaking. Given this, the magnetic monopolesshow a wide hierarchy of masses, and some are vanishing as 1/N. The dilute gaspicture, then, provides an interesting structure in the large N limit.
