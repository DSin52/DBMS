We consider an eight-dimensional local octonionic theory with theseven-sphere playing the role of the gauge group. Duality conditions for two-and four-forms in eight dimensions are related. Dual fields--octonionicinstantons--solve an 8D generalization of the Yang-Mills equation. Modifyingthe ADHM construction of 4D instantons, we find general $k$-instanton 8Dsolutions which depends on $16k-7$ effective parameters.
