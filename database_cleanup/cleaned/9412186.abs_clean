Instanton effects in a family of completely massive Higgs models with N=1supersymmetry are investigated. The models have $N_c=2$ and $N_f\ge 2$. In eachmodel, we show that a certain gauge invariant correlation function depends in anon-trivial way on its coordinates, in spite of the fact that supersymmetryrequires its constancy. This means that non-perturbative effects breaksupersymmetry explicitly in the one instanton sector. We also show thatcondensates arising in the point-like limit of the above correlation functionscan in principle be used to induce the Electro-Weak scale.
