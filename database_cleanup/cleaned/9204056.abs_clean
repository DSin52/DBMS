The two-dimensional self-dual Chern--Simons equations are equivalent to theconditions for static, zero-energy solutions of the $(2+1)$-dimensional gaugednonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with Chern--Simons matter-gauge dynamics. Inthis paper we classify all finite charge $SU(N)$ solutions by firsttransforming the self-dual Chern--Simons equations into the two-dimensionalchiral model (or harmonic map) equations, and then using the Uhlenbeck--Woodclassification of harmonic maps into the unitary groups. This construction alsoleads to a new relationship between the $SU(N)$ Toda and $SU(N)$ chiral modelsolutions.
