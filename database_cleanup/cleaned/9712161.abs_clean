We show that the nonlinear Born-Infeld field equations supplemented by the"dynamical condition" (certain boundary condition for the field along theparticle's trajectory) define perfectly deterministic theory, i.e. particle'strajectory is determined without any equations of motion. It is a first steptowards constructing the consistent theory of point particles interacting withnonlinear electromagnetism.
