Proceedings of XXI International colloquium "Group theoretical methods inphysics", Goslar-1996Analytical harmonic superfields are the basic variables of a standardharmonic formalism of SYM^2_4-theory. We consider superfield actions foralternative formulations of this theory using the unconstrained harmonicprepotentials. The corresponding equations of motion are equivalent to thecomponent field equations of SYM^2_4-theory. The analyticity conditionappears only on-shell as the zero-curvature equation in the alternativeformulations.
