I study the hypothetical thermodynamic system which saturates the so-calledHubble entropy bound and show that it is invariant under the S- and T-dualitiesof string theory as well as the interchanges of the eleventh dimension ofM-theory. I also discuss how unique the entropy bound is under the dualitiesand some related issues.
