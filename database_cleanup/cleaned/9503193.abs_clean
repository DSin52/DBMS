We clarify the physical origin of the difference between gauge properties ofconserved currents in abelian and nonabelian theories. In the latter, but notin the former, such currents can always be written on shell as gauge invariantsmodulo identically conserved, superpotential, terms. For the ``isotopic" vectorand the stress tensor currents of spins 1 and 2 respectively, we explain thisdifference by the fact that the non-abelian theories are just the self-coupledversions of the abelian ones using these currents as sources. More precisely,we indicate how the self-coupling turns the non-invariantizable abelianconserved currents into (on-shell) superpotentials. The fate of other conservedcurrents is also discussed.
