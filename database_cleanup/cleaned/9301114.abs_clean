A new proof of perturbative renormalizability and infrared finiteness for ascalar massless theory is obtained from a formulation of renormalized fieldtheory based on the Wilson renormalization group. The loop expansion of therenormalized Green functions is deduced from the Polchinski equation ofrenormalization group. The resulting Feynman graphs are organized in such a waythat the loop momenta are ordered. It is then possible to analyse theirultraviolet and infrared behaviours by iterative methods. The necessarysubtractions and the corresponding counterterms are automatically generated inthe process of fixing the physical conditions for the ``relevant'' vertices atthe normalization point. The proof of perturbative renormalizability andinfrared finiteness is simply based on dimensional arguments and does notrequire the usual analysis of topological properties of Feynman graphs.
