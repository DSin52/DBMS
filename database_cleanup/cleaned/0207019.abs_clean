temperatureAuthors: David J. Toms

zeta-function methods are used to study the properties of thenon-relativistic interacting Bose gas at finite temperature and density.Results for the ground state energy and pressure are obtained at both zero andfinite temperature. The method used does not restrict the form of theinteraction, which can be completely general. A similar procedure is thenapplied to evaluate the ground state energy of a binary mixture consisting ofdifferent bosons. Analytical results are obtained in the case where the twospecies have the same mass.
