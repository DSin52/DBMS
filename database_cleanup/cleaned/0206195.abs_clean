Title: Supergravity pp-wave solutions with 28 and 24 supercharges

Authors: Iosif Bena and Radu Roiban

We conduct an exhaustive search for solutions of IIA and IIB supergravitywith augmented supersymmetry. We find a two-parameter family of IIB solutionspreserving 28 supercharges, as well as several other IIA and IIB families ofsolutions with 24 supercharges. Given the simplicity of the pp-wave solution,the algorithm described here represents a systematic way of classifying allsuch solutions with augmented supersymmetry. By T-dualizing some of thesesolutions we obtain exact non-pp wave supergravity solutions (with 8 or 16supercharges), which can be interpreted as perturbations of the AdS-CFTcorrespondence with irrelevant operators.
