We consider a model for tensionless (null) p-branes with N=1 globalsupersymmetry in 10-dimensional Minkowski space-time. We give an action for themodel and show that it is reparametrization and kappa-invariant. We also findsome solutions of the classical equations of motion. In the case of nullsuperstring (p=1), we obtain the general solution in arbitrary gauge.
