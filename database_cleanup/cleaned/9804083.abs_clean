We consider the role of N=4 conformal supergravity in the relation betweenN=4 SYM theory and D=5 gauged supergravity expanded near the Anti de Sitterbackground. We discuss the structure of the SYM effective action in conformalsupergravity background, in particular, terms related to conformal anomaly.Solving the leading-order Dirichlet problem for the metric perturbation in AdSbackground we explicitly compute the bilinear graviton term in the D=5 Einsteinaction, demonstrating its equivalence to the linearized Weyl tensor squaredpart of the gravitational effective action induced by SYM theory. We alsocompute the graviton-dilaton-dilaton 3-point function which is found to havethe form consistent with conformal invariance of the boundary theory.
