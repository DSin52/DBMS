We consider 2-dimensional QCD on a cylinder, where space is a circle. We findthe ground state of the system in case of massless quarks in a $1/N$ expansion.We find that coupling to fermions nontrivially modifies the large $N$ saddlepoint of the gauge theory due to the phenomenon of `decompactification' ofeigenvalues of the gauge field. We calculate the vacuum energy and the vacuumexpectation value of the Wilson loop operator both of which show a nontrivialdependence on the number of quarks flavours at the leading order in $1/N$.
