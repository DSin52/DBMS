Authors: Elso Drigo Filho and Regina Maria Ricotta

Comments: Latex, 9 pages

A new exact analytically solvable Eckart-type potential is presented, ageneralisation of the Hulthen potential. The study through SupersymmetricQuantum Mechanics is presented together with the hierarchy of Hamiltonians andthe shape invariance property.
