In the example of $R^2+T^2$ gravity on the unit two dimensional disk wedemonstrate that in the presence of an independent spin connection it ispossible to define local gauge invariant boundary conditions even on boundarieswhich are not totally geodesic. One-loop partition function and thecorresponding heat kernel are calculated.
