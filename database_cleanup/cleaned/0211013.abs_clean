modifications to match the PRD accepted versionIn Einstein gravity there is a simple procedure to build D-dimensionalspacetimes starting from (D-1)-dimensional ones, by stacking any(D-1)-dimensional Ricci-flat metric into the extra-dimension. We analyze thisprocedure in the context of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, and find that it canonly be applied to metrics with a constant Krestschmann scalar. For instance,we show that solutions of the black-string type are not allowed in thisframework.
