We couple n copies of N=(2,0) scalar multiplets to a gauged N=(2,0)supergravity in 2+1 dimensions which admits AdS_3 as a vacuum. The scalarfields are charged under the gauged R-symmetry group U(1) and parametrizecertain Kahler manifolds with compact or non-compact isometries. The radii ofthese manifolds are quantized in the compact case, but arbitrary otherwise. Inthe compact case, we find half-supersymmetry preserving and asymptoticallyMinkowskian black string solutions. For a particular value of the scalarmanifold radius, the solution coincides with that of Horne and Horowitz foundin the context of a string theory in 2+1 dimensions. In the non-compact case,we find half-supersymmetry preserving and asymptotically AdS_3 string solutionswhich have naked singularities. We also obtain two distinct AdS_3supergravities coupled to n copies of N=(1,0) scalar multiplets either by thetruncation of the (2,0) model or by a direct construction.
