Comments: 13 pages. Submitted as contribution to the Proccedings of the XXIIth

International Conference on Differential Geometric Methods in TheoreticalPhysics, Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo, M\'exico. Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1993We investigate invertible elements and gradings in braided tensor categories.This leads us to the definition of theta-, product-, subgrading andorbitcategories in order to construct new families of BTC's from given ones. Weuse the representation theory of Hecke algebras in order to relate thefusionring of a BTC generated by an object $X$ with a two componentdecomposition of its tensorsquare to the fusionring of quantum groups of type$A$ at roots of unity. We find the condition of `local isomorphie' on a specialfusionring morphism implying that a BTC is obtained from the aboveconstructions applied to the semisimplified representation category of aquantum group. This family of BTC's contains new series of twisted categoriesthat do not stem from known Hopf algebras. Using the language of incidencegraphs and the balancing structure on a BTC we also find strong constraints onthe fusionring morphism. For Temperley Lieb type categories these aresufficient to show local isomorphie. Thus we obtain a classification for thesubclass of Temperley Lieb type categories.
