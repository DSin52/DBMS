We investigate the convergence properties of the cluster expansion ofequal-time Green functions in scalar theories with quartic self-coupling in(0+1), (1+1), and (2+1) space-time dimensions. The computations are carried outwithin the equal-time correlation dynamics approach. We find that the clusterexpansion shows good convergence as long as the system is in a single phaseconfiguration and that it breaks down in a two phase configuration, as onewould naively expect. In the case of dynamical calculations with a timedependent Hamiltonian we find two timescales determining the adiabaticity ofthe propagation; these are the time required for adiabaticity in the singlephase region and the time required for tunneling into the non-localized lowestenergy state in the two phase region.
