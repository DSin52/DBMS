Title: Melvin Matrix Models

Authors: Lubos Motl

Comments: 9 pages, JHEP LaTeX

In this short note we construct the DLCQ description of the flux seven-branesin type IIA string theory and discuss its basic properties. The matrix modelinvolves dipole fields. We explain the relation of this nonlocal matrix modelto various orbifolds. We also give a spacetime interpretation of theSeiberg-Witten-like map, proposed in a different context first by Bergman andGanor, that converts this matrix model to a local, highly nonlinear theory.
