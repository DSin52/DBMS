The S-matrix is invariant with respect to the variation of any (global)parameter involved in the gauge fixing conditions, if that variation isaccompanied by a certain redefinition of the basis of polarization vectors.Renormalizability of the underlying gauge theory is not required. The proof isnonperturbative and, using the `extended' BRS transformation, quite simple.
