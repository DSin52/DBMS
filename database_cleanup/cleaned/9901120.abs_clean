Gorsky et al. presented an explicit construction of Whitham deformations ofthe Seiberg-Witten curve for the $SU(N+1)$ $\calN = 2$ SUSY Yang-Mills theory.We extend their result to all classical gauge groups and some other cases suchas the spectral curve of the $A^{(2)}_{2N}$ affine Toda Toda system. Ourconstruction, too, uses fractional powers of the superpotential $W(x)$ thatcharacterizes the curve. We also consider the $u$-plane integral oftopologically twisted theories on four-dimensional manifolds $X$ with$b_2^{+}(X) = 1$ in the language of these explicitly constructed Whithamdeformations and an integrable hierarchy of the KdV type hidden behind.
