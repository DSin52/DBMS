A very general class of Lagrangians which couple scalar fields to gravitationand matter in two spacetime dimensions is investigated. It is shown that avector field exists along whose flow lines the stress-energy tensor isconserved, regardless of whether or not the equations of motion are satisfiedor if any Killing vectors exist. Conditions necessary for the existence ofKilling vectors are derived. A new set of 2D black hole solutions is obtainedfor one particular member within this class of Lagrangians. One such solutionbears an interesting resemblance to the 2D string-theoretic black hole, yetcontains markedly different thermodynamic properties.
