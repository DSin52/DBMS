Title: Quantization of the space-time based on a formless finite fundamental

elementComments: LaTex

The concept of the space (space-time) of the formless finite fundamentalelements (FFFE) is suggested. This space can be defined as a set of coveringsof the continual space by non-overlapping simply connected regions of any formand arbitrary sizes with some probability measure. The average sizes of eachfundamental element are equal to the fundamental length. This definitionenables to describe correctly the passage from the space of the formless finitefundamental elements to the continual space in the limit of zero value of thefundamental length. FFFE space-time functional integral construction issuggested. A wave function of a separate FFFE and the overall wave function ofa manifold are introduced. It is shown that many other constructions of thediscrete space-time (the Regge coverings, the lattice space-time etc.) are thespecial cases of this space-time. A vacuum action problem is analyzed. One termof this action is proportional to the volume of a fundamental element. It ispossible to direct the way for this term to yield the Nambu-Goto action inconsideration the string as one-dimensional excitation of a number of FFFEs.Fermionic and bosonic fields in the space-time of FFFEs are excited states ofelements. Space-time supersymmetry leads to supposition that the maximalpossible number of fermionic excitations at one FFFE is equal to the number ofelements in all space-time. The compactification in this space-time means thecondition of the neighbour elements absence in compactificated dimensions.
