Starting from a $D=3$, $N=4$ supersymmetric theory for matter fields, a twistwith a Grassmann parity change is defined which maps the theory into a gaugefixed, abelian $BF$ theory on curved 3-manifolds. After adding surface terms tothis theory, the twist is seen to map the resulting supersymmetric action totwo uncoupled copies of the gauge fixed Chern-Simons action. In addition, wegive a map which takes the $BF$ and Chern-Simons theories into Donaldson-WittenTQFT's. A similar construction, but with $N=2$ supersymmetry, is given in twodimensions.
