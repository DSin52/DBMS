In this paper we use a non-covariant gauge which makes some of the YMfeatures manifest which otherwise do not appear explicitly in the Landau gaugeused by Nielsen and Olesen.We show, in fact, that the unstable mode which makesa large contribution to the vacuum energy is non-perturbative even classically.
