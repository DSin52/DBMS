The models of triangulated random surfaces embedded in (extended) Dynkindiagrams are formulated as a gauge-invariant matrix model of Weingarten type.The double scaling limit of this model is described by a collective fieldtheory with nonpolynomial interaction.The propagator in this field theory is essentially two-loop correlator in thecorresponding string theory.
