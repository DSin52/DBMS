Title: Non-Linear Electrodynamics

MechanicsComments: 25 pages LaTeX, no figures

The Zeroth and First Laws of Black Hole Mechanics are derived in the contextof non-linear electrodynamics coupled to gravity. The Zeroth Law is shown tohold quite generally even if the Dominant Energy Condition is violated. Thederivation of the First Law is discussed in detail for general matter fieldscoupled to gravity. The general mass variation formula obtained includes a termpreviously omitted in some of the literature. This is then applied to the caseof non-linear electrodynamics and the usual First Law is found to hold true. Asan example, Born-Infeld theory is discussed. The results are extended toinclude scalar fields in a very general way, including additional terms arisingfrom the variation of the asymptotic values of the scalars.
