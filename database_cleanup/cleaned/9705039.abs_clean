It is demonstrated that several series of conformal field theories, whilesatisfying braid group statistics, can still be described in the conventionalsetting of the DHR theory, i.e. their superselection structure can beunderstood in terms of a compact DHR gauge group. Besides theories with onlysimple sectors, these include (the untwisted part of) c=1 orbifold theories andlevel two so(N) WZW theories. We also analyze the relation between these modelsand theories of complex free fermions.
