We study the Hawking-Turok (HT) instanton solutions which have been employedto describe the creation of an open inflationary universe, in the context ofhigher derivative theories. We consider the effects of adding quadratic andcubic terms of the forms $\alpha R^{2}$ and $\beta R^{3}$ to the gravitationalaction. Using a conformal transformation to convert the higher derivativetheories into theories of self interacting scalar fields minimally coupled toEinstein gravity, we argue that the cubic term represents a genericperturbation of the polynomial type to the action and obtain the conditions onthe parameters of these theories for the existence of singular and non-singularinstanton solutions. We find that, relative to the quadratic case, there aresignificant changes in the nature of the constraints on the parameters for theexistence of these instantons, once cubic (and higher order perturbations) areadded to the action.
