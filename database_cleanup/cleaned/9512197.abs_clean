The order dependent mapping method, its convergence has recently been provenfor the energy eigenvalue of the anharmonic oscillator, is applied to re-sumthe standard perturbation series for Stark effect of the hydrogen atom. Weperform a numerical experiment up to the fiftieth order of the perturbationexpansion. A simple mapping suggested by the analytic structure and the strongfield behavior gives an excellent agreement with the exact value for anintermediate range of the electric field, $0.03\leq E\leq0.25$. The imaginarypart of the energy (the decay width) as well as the real part of the energy isreproduced from the standard perturbation series.
