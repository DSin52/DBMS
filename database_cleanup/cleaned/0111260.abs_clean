Authors: Matthias R Gaberdiel

Comments: 55 pages, LaTeX, 2 figures; notes of lectures delivered at the school

on Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory and its Applications, IPM Tehran,September 2001A comprehensive introduction to logarithmic conformal field theory, using analgebraic point of view, is given. A number of examples are explained indetail, including the c=-2 triplet theory and the k=-4/3 affine su(2) theory.We also give some brief introduction to the work of Zhu.
