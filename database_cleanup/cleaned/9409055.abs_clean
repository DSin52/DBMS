Title: Towards a Classification of Knots

Comments: 7 pages, Talk given at the 28th International Symposium on the Theory

of Elementary Particles, Wendisch-Rietz, August 30-September 3, 1994We discuss the possibility of the existence of finite algorithms that maygive distinct knot classes. In particular we present two attempts for suchalgorithms which seem promising, one based on knot projections on a plane, theother on placing knots on a cubic lattice.
