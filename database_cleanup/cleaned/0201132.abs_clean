resultsWe consider condensation of localized closed string tachyons by examining therecent proposal of Harvey, Kutasov, Martinec, and Moore. We first observe thatthe $g_{\rm cl}$ defined by HKMM does not reflect the space-time supersymmetrywhen the model has the SUSY. Especially for ${\bf C}^2/{\bf Z}_N$ models,$g_{\rm cl}$ defined by them is highly peaked along the supersymmetric pointsin the space of orbifolds, which is unsatisfactory property of the "potential"of the RG-flow. We give the modified definition of the $g_{\rm cl}$ in type IIcases such that it has a valley along the supersymmetric points in the orbifoldmoduli space. New definition predicts that the processes suggested by Adams,Polchinski and Silverstein and was argued to be forbidden by HKMM are in factallowed.
