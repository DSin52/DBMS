In the M(atrix) theory by making the expansions of the matrices around themembrane and four-brane solutions we derive the three- and five-dimensionalgauge theories on the dual tori. The explicit forms of solutions yield the dualcoordinates and each expansion is related to a toroidal compactification of theM(atrix) theory. From the derived Lorentz and gauge invariant actions the gaugecoupling constants are shown to be characterized by the volume of the dualtori.
