We analyze in detail a specific 5-dimensional realization of a"brane-universe" scenario where the visible and hidden sectors are localized onspatially separated 3-branes coupled only by supergravity, with supersymmetrybreaking originating in the hidden sector. Although general power countingallows order 1/M_{Planck}^2 contact terms between the two sectors in the4-dimensional theory from exchange of supergravity Kaluza-Klein modes, we showthat they are not present by carefully matching to the 5-dimensional theory. Wealso find that the radius modulus corresponding to the size of the compactifieddimension must be stabilized by additional dynamics in order to avoid run-awaybehavior after supersymmetry breaking and to understand the communication ofsupersymmetry breaking. We stabilize the radius by adding two pure Yang--Millssectors, one in the bulk and the other localized on a brane. Gauginocondensation in the 4-dimensional effective theory generates a superpotentialthat can naturally fix the radius at a sufficiently large value thatsupersymmetry breaking is communicated dominantly by the recently-discoveredmechanism of anomaly mediation. The mass of the radius modulus is largecompared to m_{3/2}. The stabilization mechanism requires only parameters oforder one at the fundamental scale, with no fine-tuning except for thecosmological constant.
