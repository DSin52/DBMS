In the space-dependent gauge, each mode of the Klein-Gordon equation in astrong electric field takes the form of a time-independent Schr\"{o}dingerequation with a potential barrier. We propose that the single- andmulti-instantons of quantum tunneling may be related with the single- andmulti-pair production of bosons and the relative probability for the no-pairproduction is determined by the total tunneling probability via instantons. Inthe case of a uniform electric field, the instanton interpretation recoversexactly the well-known pair production rate for bosons and when the Pauliblocking is taken into account, it gives the correct fermion production rate.The instanton is used to calculate the pair production rate even in aninhomogeneous electric field. Furthermore, the instanton interpretationconfirms the fact that bosons and fermions can not be produced by a staticmagnetic field only.
