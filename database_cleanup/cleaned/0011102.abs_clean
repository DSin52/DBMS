We elaborate further on a recently proposed scenario for generating a masshierarchy through quantum fluctuations of a single D3 brane, which representsour world embedded in a bulk five-dimensional space time. In this scenario, thequantum fluctuations of the D3-brane world in the bulk direction, quantified toleading order via a `recoil' world-sheet logarithmic conformal field theoryapproach, result in the dynamical appearance of a supersymmetry breaking(obstruction) scale alpha. This may be naturally taken to be at the TeV range,in order to provide a solution to the conventional gauge-hierarchy problem. Thebulk spatial direction is characterized by the dynamical appearance of anhorizon located at +- 1/alpha, inside which the positive energy conditions forthe existence of stable matter are satisfied. To ensure the correct value ofthe four-dimensional Planck mass, the bulk string scale M_s is naturally foundto lie at an intermediate energy scale of 10^{14} GeV. As an exclusive featureof the D3-brane quantum fluctuations (`recoil') we find that, for any givenM_5, there is a discrete mass spectrum for four-dimensional Kaluza-Klein (KK)modes of bulk graviton and/or scalar fields. KK modes with masses 0 <= m <sqrt{2}alpha << M_s are found to have wavefunctions peaked, and hencelocalized, on the D3 brane at z=0.
