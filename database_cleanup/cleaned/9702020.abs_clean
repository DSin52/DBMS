Title: Yangian Gelfand-Zetlin Bases, gl(N)-Jack Polynomials and computation of

Dynamical Correlation Functions in the Spin Calogero-Sutherland ModelComments: 26 pages, AMSLatex

Quantum AlgebraWe consider the gl(N)-invariant Calogero-Sutherland Models with N=1,2,3,...in a unified framework, which is the framework of Symmetric Polynomials. By theframework we mean an isomorphism between the space of states of thegl(N)-invariant Calogero-Sutherland Model and the space of Symmetric LaurentPolynomials. In this framework it becomes apparent that all gl(N)-invariantCalogero-Sutherland Models are manifestations of the same entity, which is thecommuting family of Macdonald Operators. Macdonald Operators depend on twoparameters $q$ and $t$. The Hamiltonian of gl(N)-invariant Calogero-SutherlandModel belongs to a degeneration of this family in the limit when both $q$ and$t$ approach the N-th elementary root of unity. This is a generalization of thewell-known situation in the case of Scalar Calogero-Sutherland Model (N=1). Inthe limit the commuting family of Macdonald Operators is identified with themaximal commutative sub-algebra in the Yangian action on the space of states ofthe gl(N)-invariant Calogero-Sutherland Model. The limits of MacdonaldPolynomials which we call gl(N)-Jack Polynomials are eigenvectors of thissub-algebra and form Yangian Gelfand-Zetlin bases in irreducible components ofthe Yangian action. The gl(N)-Jack Polynomials describe the orthogonaleigenbasis of gl(N)-invariant Calogero-Sutherland Model in exactly the same wayas Jack Polynomials describe the orthogonal eigenbasis of the Scalar Model(N=1). For each known property of Macdonald Polynomials there is acorresponding property of gl(N)-Jack Polynomials. As a simplest application ofthese properties we compute two-point Dynamical Spin-Density and DensityCorrelation Functions in the gl(2)-invariant Calogero-Sutherland Model atinteger values of the coupling constant.
