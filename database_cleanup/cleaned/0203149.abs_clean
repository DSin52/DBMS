We describe the set of generalized Poincare and conformal superalgebras inD=4,5 and 7 dimensions as two sequences of superalgebraic structures, takingvalues in the division algebras R, C and H. The generalized conformalsuperalgebras are described for D=4 by OSp(1;8| R), for D=5 by SU(4,4;1) andfor D=7 by U_\alpha U(8;1|H). The relation with other schemes, in particularthe framework of conformal spin (super)algebras and Jordan (super)algebras isdiscussed. By extending the division-algebra-valued superalgebras to octonionswe get in D=11 an octonionic generalized Poincare superalgebra, which we calloctonionic M-algebra, describing the octonionic M-theory. It contains 32 realsupercharges but, due to the octonionic structure, only 52 real bosonicgenerators remain independent in place of the 528 bosonic charges of standardM-algebra. In octonionic M-theory there is a sort of equivalence between theoctonionic M2 (supermembrane) and the octonionic M5 (super-5-brane) sectors. Wealso define the octonionic generalized conformal M-superalgebra, with 239bosonic generators.
