A universal integrable hierarchy underlying topological Landau-Ginzburgmodels of D-tye is presented. Like the dispersionless Toda hierarchy, the newhierarchy has two distinct (``positive" and ``negative") set of flows. Specialsolutions corresponding to topological Landau-Ginzburg models of D-type arecharacterized by a Riemann-Hilbert problem, which can be converted into ageneralized hodograph transformation. This construction gives an embedding ofthe finite dimensional small phase space of these models into the full space offlows of this hierarchy. One of flat coordinates in the small phase space turnsout to be identical to the first ``negative" time variable of the hierarchy,whereas the others belong to the ``positive" flows.
