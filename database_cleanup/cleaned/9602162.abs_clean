The account of the Poisson-Lie T-duality is presented for the case when theaction of the duality group on a target is not free. At the same time ageneralization of the picture is given when the duality group does not even acton $\si$-model targets but only on their phase spaces. The outcome is a hugeclass of dualizable targets generically having no local isometries orPoisson-Lie symmetries whatsoever.
