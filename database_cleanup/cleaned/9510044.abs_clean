A complete analysis of the consequences of introducing a set of holonomicgauge fixing constraints (to fix the dynamics) into a singular Lagrangian isperformed. It is shown in general that the dynamical system originated from thereduced Lagrangian erases all the information regarding the first classconstraints of the original theory, but retains its second class. It is provedthat even though the reduced Lagrangian can be singular, it never possesses anygauge freedom. As an application, the example of $n \cdot A = 0$ gauges inelectromagnetism is treated in full detail.
