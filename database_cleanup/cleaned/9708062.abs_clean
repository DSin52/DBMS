We compute and analyse a variety of four-derivative gravitational terms inthe effective action of six- and four-dimensional type II string ground stateswith N=4 supersymmetry. In six dimensions, we compute the relevant perturbativecorrections for the type II string compactified on K3. In four dimensions we doanalogous computations for several models with (4,0) and (2,2) supersymmetry.Such ground states are related by heterotic-type II duality or type II-type IIU-duality. Perturbative computations in one member of a dual pair give anon-perturbative result in the other member. In particular, the exact CP-evenR^2 coupling on the (2,2) side reproduces the tree-level term plus NS 5-braneinstanton contributions on the (4,0) side. On the other hand, the exact CP-oddcoupling yields the one-loop axionic interaction a.R\wedge R together with asimilar instanton sum. In a subset of models, the expected breaking of theSL(2,Z)_S S-duality symmetry to a \Gamma(2)_S subgroup is observed on thenon-perturbative thresholds. Moreover, we present a duality chain that providesevidence for the existence of heterotic N=4 models in which N=8 supersymmetryappears at strong coupling.
