We evaluate exactly both the non-relativistic and relativistic fermiondeterminant in 2+1 dimensions in a constant background field at finitetemperature. The effect of finite chemical potential is also considered. Inboth cases, the systems are decoupled into an infinite number of 1+1 fermionsby Fourier transformation in the $\beta$-variable. The total effective actionsdemonstrate non-extensiveness in the $\beta$ dimension.
