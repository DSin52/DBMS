We propose a Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) for G_k x G_l / G_{k+l}conformal coset models (G any simply-laced Lie algebra) perturbed by theiroperator \phi_{1,1,Adj}. An interesting adjacency structure appears and can bedepicted in a sort of ``product'' of Dynkin diagrams of G and A_{k+l-1}. UV andIR limits are computed and reproduce the expected values for the centralcharges. For k->\infty, l fixed we obtain the TBA of the G_l WZW modelperturbed by J_a\bar{J}_a, and for k,l->\infty, k-l fixed, that of PrincipalChiral model with WZ term at level k-l.
