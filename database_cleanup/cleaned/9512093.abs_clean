We consider Diagram algebras, $\Dg(G)$ (generalized Temperley-Lieb algebras)defined for a large class of graphs $G$, including those of relevance for cubiclattice Potts models, and study their structure for generic $Q$. We find thatthese algebras are too large to play the precisely analogous role in threedimensions to that played by the Temperley-Lieb algebras for generic $Q$ in theplanar case. We outline measures to extract the quotient algebra that wouldilluminate the physics of three dimensional Potts models.
