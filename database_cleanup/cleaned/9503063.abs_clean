We find a new class of (2,0)-supersymmetric two-dimensional sigma models withtorsion and target spaces almost complex manifolds extending similar resultsfor models with (2,2) supersymmetry. These models are invariant under a newsymmetry which is generated by a Noether charge of Lorentz weight one and it isassociated to the Nijenhuis tensor of the almost complex structure of the sigmamodel target manifold. We compute the Poisson bracket algebra of charges of theabove (2,0)-and (2,2)-supersymmetric sigma models and show that it closes butit is not isomorphic to the standard (2,0) and (2,2) supersymmetry algebra,respectively. Examples of such (2,0)- and (2,2)-supersymmetric sigma modelswith target spaces group manifolds are also given. In addition, we study thequantisation of the (2,0)-supersymmetric sigma models, compute the anomalies oftheir classical symmetries and examine their cancellation. Furthermore, weexamine the massive extension of (2,0)-supersymmetric sigma models with targetspaces almost complex manifolds, and study the topological twist of the newsupersymmetry algebras.
