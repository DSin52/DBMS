Conference on Math. Phys, Vth Wigner Symposium and 3rd Bologna Workshop onCFT and IMFor a large class of finite W algebras, the defining relations of a Yangianare proved to be satisfied. Therefore such finite W algebras appear asrealisations of Yangians. This result is useful to determine properties of suchW algebra representations.
