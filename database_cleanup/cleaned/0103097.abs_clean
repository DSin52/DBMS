In assumption,that string model is the integrable model for particular kindof the background fields, the closed string model in the background gravityfield and the antisymmetric B-field is considered as the bihamiltonian system.It is shown, that bihamiltonity is origin of T-duality of the string models.The new Poisson brackets, depending of the background fields and of theirderivatives, are obtained. The integrability condition is obtained as thecompactability of the bihamoltonity condition and the Jacobi identity of thenew Poisson bracket. The B-chiral string model is dual to the chiral stringmodel for the constant background fields.
