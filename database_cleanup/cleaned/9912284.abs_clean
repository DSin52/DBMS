We explore all the possible ways of fixing the kappa symmetry for both branesand strings by means of a constant projector. We find that they can beclassified according to their behaviour under Dirac conjugation andconjugation. This latter controls the maximum power of the fermionic variablesin which the (super)vielbein can be expanded while the former determines whichstates cannot be described in the gauge. In particular there exists aninteresting class of projectors for which vielbein are at most quadratic in thefermionic variables. As an example we compute the action for the type IIb on aAdS_{5} X S_{5} background with a lightcone-like projector; this action reducesto the usual lightcone GS string action in the flat limit.
