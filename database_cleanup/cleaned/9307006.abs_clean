We extend the bosonization of $2+1$ - dimensional QED with one fermionicflavor performed previously to the case of QED with an induced Chern - SimonsThe fermion operators are constructed in terms of the bosonic fields $A_i$ and$E_i$. The construction is similar to that in the $n=0$ case. The resultingbosonic theory is Lorentz invariant in the continuum limit and has Maxwell'sequations as its equations of motion. The algebra of bilinears exhibitsnontrivial operatorial mixing with lower dimensional operators, which is absentfor $n=0$.
