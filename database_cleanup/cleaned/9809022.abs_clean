We point out that two distinct distance--energy relations have been discussedin the AdS/CFT correspondence. In conformal backgrounds they differ only innormalization, but in nonconformal backgrounds they differ in functional form.We discuss the relation to probe processes, the holographic principle, andblack hole entropies.
