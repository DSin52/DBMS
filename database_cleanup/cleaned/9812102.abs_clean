Several issues concerning the self-dual solutions of the Chern-Simons-Higgsmodel are addressed. The topology of the configuration space of the model isanalysed when the space manifold is either the plane or an infinite cylinder.We study the local structure of the moduli space of self-dual solitons in thesecond case by means of an index computation. It is shown how to manage thenon-integer contribution to the heat-kernel supertrace due to thenon-compactness of the base space. A physical picture of the local coordinatesparametrizing the non-topological soliton moduli space arises .
