A general method of obtaining linear differential equations having polynomialsolutions is proposed. The method is based on an equivalence of the spectralproblem for an element of the universal enveloping algebra of some Lie algebrain the "projectivized" representation possessing an invariant subspace and thespectral problem for a certain linear differential operator with variablecoefficients. It is shown in general that polynomial solutions of partialdifferential equations occur; in the case of Lie superalgebras there arepolynomial solutions of some matrix differential equations, quantum algebrasgive rise to polynomial solutions of finite--difference equations.Particularly, known classical orthogonal polynomials will appear whenconsidering $SL(2,{\bf R})$ acting on ${\bf RP_1}$. As examples, somepolynomials connected to projectivized representations of $sl_2 ({\bf R})$,$sl_2 ({\bf R})_q$, $osp(2,2)$ and $so_3$ are briefly discussed.
