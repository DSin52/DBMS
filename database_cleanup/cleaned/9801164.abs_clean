We study constraints among coupling constants of the standard model obtainedin the noncommutative geometry (NCG) method. First, we analyze the evolution ofthe Higgs boson mass under the renormalization group by adopting the idea of\'Alvarez et al. For this analysis we derive two certain constraints bymodifying Connes's way of constructing the standard model. Next, we findrenormalization group invariant (RGI) constraints in the NCG method. We alsoconsider the relation between the condition that a constraint among couplingconstants of a model becomes RGI and the condition that the model becomesmultiplicative renormalizable by using a simple example.
