Title: Third Quantization and Black Holes

Authors: Michael McGuigan

Comments: 14 pages

Recent results on the quantum mechanics of black holes indicate that thespacetime singularity can be avoided if the space of fields is extended in itsdomain as well as the vanishing of beta functions required as an equation intarget space. Such an approach seems to inevitably lead to the quantization inthis space that is the so-called third quantization. We discuss some of theimplications of third quantization for the physics of blackholes in twodimensions. By discretizing the transverse dimensions describing the horizon itmay also be possible to describe regulated four dimensional gravity in thismanner and perhaps shed some light on the meaning of black hole entropy.
