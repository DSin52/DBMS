It is shown that an extended q-deformed $su(2)$ algebra with an extra(``Schwinger '') term can describe Bloch electrons in a uniform magnetic fieldwith an additional periodic potential. This is a generalization of the analysisof Bloch electrons by Wiegmann and Zabrodin. By using a representation theoryof this q-deformed algebra, we obtain functional Bethe ansatz equations whosesolutions should be functions of finite degree. It is also shown that the zeroenergy solution is expressed in terms of an Askey Wilson polynomial.
