We investigate the anomalous creation of fundamental strings using theboundary state formalism of fractional D-branes on ALE spaces in the orbifoldlimit. The open string Witten index plays a crucial role in this calculationand so the result remains unchanged even if we blow up the orbifoldgeometrically, matching the anomaly inflow argument. Further we consider thequiver gauge theories on such fractional D3-branes and see that the stringcreation mechanism determines 1-loop logarithmic monodromy of these gaugetheories. Also we comment on the relation of D(-1)-D3 amplitude to the 1-loopbeta function.
