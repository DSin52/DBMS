The question whether it is necessary to decompactify the gauge eigenvaluedegrees of freedom in QCD$_{1+1} $ is addressed. A careful consideration of thedynamics governing these degrees of freedom leads to the conclusion thateigenvalue decompactification is not necessary due to the curvature on thespace of eigenvalues.
