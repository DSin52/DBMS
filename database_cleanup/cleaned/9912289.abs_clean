Title: Gauge Fixing in the Chain by Chain Method

Authors: A Shirzad and F Loran

Comments: To appear in Int. J. Mod. Phys. A

In a recent work we showed that for a Hamiltonian system with constraints,the set of constraints can be investigated in first and second class constraintchains. We show here that using this "chain by chain" method for an arbitrarysystem one can fix the gauges in the most economical and consistent way. Weshow that it is enough to assume some gauge fixing conditions conjugate to lastelements of first class chains. The remaining necessary conditions would emergefrom consistency conditions.
