In a series of papers, we investigate the reformulation of Epstein-Glaserrenormalization in coordinate space, both in analytic and Hopf algebraic terms.This first article deals with analytical aspects. Some of the historically goodreasons for the divorces of the Epstein-Glaser method, both from mainstreamquantum field theory and the mathematical literature on distributions, are madeplain; and overcome.
