We present the coset structure of the untwisted moduli space of heterotic$(0,2) \; Z_N$ orbifold compactifications with continuous Wilson lines. For thecases where the internal 6-torus $T_6$ is given by the direct sum $T_4 \oplusT_2$, we explicitly construct the K\"{a}hler potentials associated with theunderlying 2-torus $T_2$. We then discuss the transformation properties ofthese K\"{a}hler potentials under target space modular symmetries. For the casewhere the $Z_N$ twist possesses eigenvalues of $-1$, we find that holomorphicterms occur in the K\"{a}hler potential describing the mixing of complex Wilsonmoduli. As a consequence, the associated $T$ and $U$ moduli are also shown tomix under target space modular transformations.
