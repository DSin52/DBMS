We discuss the role of the trace part of metric fluctuations $h_{MN}$ in theRandall-Sundrum scenario of gravity. Without the matter, this field($h=\eta^{MN}h_{MN}$) is a gauge-dependent term, and thus it can be gaugedaway. But, including the uniform source $\tilde{T}_{MN}$, this field satisfiesthe linearized equation $\Box_4 h =16\pi G_5 T^{\mu}_{\mu}$. This maycorrespond to the scalar $\xi^5$ in the bending of the brane due to thelocalized source. Considering the case of longitudinal perturbations ($h_{5\mu}=h_{55}=0$), one finds the source relation$\tilde{T}^{\mu}_{\mu}=2\tilde{T}_{55}$, which leads to the ghost states in themassive modes. In addition, if one requires $T_{44}=2(T_{22}+T_{33})$, it isfound that in the limit of $m^2_h \to 0$ we have the massless spin-2propagation without the ghost state. This exactly corresponds to the samesituation as in the intermediate scales of Gregory-Rubakov-Sibiryakov (GRS)model.
