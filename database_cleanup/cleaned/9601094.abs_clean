We examine QED(3+1) quantised in the `front form' with finite `volume'regularisation, namely in Discretised Light-Cone Quantisation. Instead of thelight-cone or Coulomb gauges, we impose the light-front Weyl gauge $A^-=0$. TheDirac method is used to arrive at the quantum commutation relations for theindependent variables. We apply `quantum mechanical gauge fixing' to implementGau{\ss}' law, and derive the physical Hamiltonian in terms of unconstrainedvariables. As in the instant form, this Hamiltonian is invariant under globalresidual gauge transformations, namely displacements. On the light-cone thesymmetry manifests itself quite differently.
