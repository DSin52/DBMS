Two of the important unresolved issues concerning fractional superstringshave been the appearance of new massive sectors whose spacetime statisticsproperties are unclear, and the appearance of new types of ``internalprojections'' which alter or deform the worldsheet conformal field theory in ahighly non-trivial manner. In this paper we provide a systematic analysis ofthese two connected issues, and explicitly map out the effectivepost-projection worldsheet theories for each of the fractional-superstringsectors. In this way we determine their central charges, highest weights,fusion rules, and characters, and find that these theories are isomorphic tothose of free worldsheet bosons and fermions.We also analyze the recently-discovered parafermionic ``twist current'' whichhas been shown to play an important role in reorganizing thefractional-superstring Fock space, and find that this current can be expresseddirectly in terms of the primary fields of the post-projection theory. Thisthereby enables us to deduce some of the spacetime statistics properties of thesurviving states.
