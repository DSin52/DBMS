Sigma models in which the integer coefficient of the Wess-Zumino termvanishes are easy to construct. This is the case if all flavor symmetries arevectorlike. We show that there is a subset of SU(N)XSU(N) vectorlike sigmamodels in which the Wess-Zumino term vanishes for reasons of symmetry as well.However, there is no chiral sigma model in which the Wess-Zumino term vanishesfor reasons of symmetry. This can be understood in the sigma model basis as aconsequence of an index theorem for the axialvector coupling matrix. We provethis index theorem directly from the SU(N)XSU(N) algebra.
