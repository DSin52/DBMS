Utilizing the previously established general formalism for quantum symmetryreduction in the framework of loop quantum gravity the spectrum of the areaoperator acting on spherically symmetric states in 4 dimensional pure gravityis investigated. The analysis requires a careful treatment of partial gaugefixing in the classical symmetry reduction and of the reinforcement ofSU(2)-gauge invariance for the quantization of the area operator. Theeigenvalues of that operator applied to spherically symmetric spin networkstates have the form A_n propor. sqrt{n(n+2)}, n=0,1,2..., giving A_n propor. nfor large n. The result clarifies (and reconciles!) the relationship betweenthe more complicated spectrum of the general (non-symmetric) area operator inloop quantum gravity and the old Bekenstein proposal that A_n propor. n.
