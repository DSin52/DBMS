We construct an explicit covariant Majorana formulation of Maxwellelectromagnetism which does not make use of vector 4-potential. This allows towrite a ``Dirac'' equation for the photon containing all the known propertiesof it. In particular, the spin and (intrinsic) boost matrices are derived andthe helicity properties of the photon are studied.
