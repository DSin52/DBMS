Covariant quantization of the Nambu-Goto spinning particle in 2+1-dimensionsis studied. The model is relevant in the context of recent activities innon-commutative space-time. From a technical point of view also covariantconstraints (in the Dirac classification scheme) is {\it reducible}. Theauxiliary variable method [bn] and (ii) the projection operator method [blm].Finally in the former scheme, a Batalin-Tyutin quantization has been done. Thisinduces a mapping between the non-commutative and the ordinary space-time. BRSTquantization programme in the latter scheme has also been discussed.
