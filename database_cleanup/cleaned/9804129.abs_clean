We computed the statistical entropy of nonextremal 4D and extremal 5DCalabi-Yau black holes and found exact agreement with the Bekenstein-Hawkingentropy. The computation is based on the fact that the near-horizon geometry ofequivalent representations contains as a factor theBa\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole and on subsequent use of Strominger'sproposal generalizing the statistical count of microstates of the BTZ blackhole due to Carlip.
