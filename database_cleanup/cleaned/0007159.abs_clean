Generalizing previous work, we study the collision of massless superstringplane waves in D space-time dimensions within an explicitlyO(D-2,D-2)-invariant set of field equations. We discuss some general propertiesof the solutions, showing in particular that they always lead to the formationof a singularity in the future. Using the above symmetry, we obtain entireclasses of new analytic solutions with non-trivial metric, dilaton andantisymmetric field, and discuss some of their properties of specific relevanceto string cosmology.
