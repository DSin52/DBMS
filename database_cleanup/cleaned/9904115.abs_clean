Title: N=1 Heterotic string vacua from mirror symmetry

Authors: P. Mayr

Comments: 19 pages, Lectures presented at the Winter School on Vector Bundles,

Mirror Symmetry, and Lagrangian Submanifolds, Harvard University, JanuaryWe review a systematic construction of $\cx N=1$ supersymmetric heteroticstring vacua using mirror symmetry. The method provides a large class ofexplicit solutions for stable, holomorphic vector bundles on Calabi-Yau n-foldsZ_n in terms of toric geometry. Phenomenologically interestingcompactifications as well as non-perturbative dynamics of the heterotic stringare discussed within this framework.
