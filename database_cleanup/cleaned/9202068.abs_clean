We investigate properties of two-dimensional asymptotically flat black holeswhich arise in both string theory and in scale invariant theories of gravity.By introducing matter sources in the field equations we show how such objectscan arise as the endpoint of gravitational collapse. We examine the motion oftest particles outside the horizons, and show that they fall through in afinite amount of proper time and an infinite amount of coordinate time. We alsoinvestigate the thermodynamic and quantum properties, which give rise to afundamental length scale. The 't Hooft prescription for cutting off eigenmodesof particle wave functions is shown to be source dependent, unlike thefour-dimensional case. The relationship between these black holes and thoseconsidered previously in $(1+1)$ dimensions is discussed.
