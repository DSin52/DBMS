Title: On the Yang-Mills Functional over Open Four-Manifolds

Comments: 15 pages, latex, no figures

In this paper we prove that for a large and physically relevant class ofsmooth complete metrics on open four-manifolds the set of L^2-norms of(anti)instantons is a discrete set for physically relevant Lie-groups. Theproof is based on the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer Index Theorem. To demonstrate ourresult we consider the Euclidean Schwarzschild manifold. This metric issignificantly non-cylindrical hence standard techniques are not applicable forstudying the moduli space of instantons in this physically relavant case. Inthis case the L^2-norm of an (anti)instanton is an integer similarly to theflat R^4-case.
