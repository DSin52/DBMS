Monopole-mediated baryon number violation, the Callan-Rubakov effect, isreexamined using boundary conformal field theory techniques. It is shown thatthe low-energy behaviour is described simply by free fermions with aconformally invariant boundary condition at the dyon location. When the numberof fermion flavours is greater than two, this boundary condition is of anon-trivial type which has not been elucidated previously.
