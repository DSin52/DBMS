We realize the two dimensional anti-de Sitter ($AdS_2$) space as aKaluza-Klein reduction of the $AdS_3$ space in the framework of the discretelight cone quantization (DLCQ). Introducing DLCQ coordinates which interpolatethe original (unboosted) coordinates and the light cone coordinates, we discussthat $AdS_2/CFT$ correspondence can be deduced from the $AdS_3/CFT$. Inparticular, we elaborate on the deformation of WZW model to obtain the boundarytheory for the $AdS_2$ black hole. This enables us to derive the entropy of the$AdS_2$ black hole from that of the $AdS_3$ black hole.
