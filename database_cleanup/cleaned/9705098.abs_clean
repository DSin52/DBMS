The fundamental assumptionfor the model is that every charged particle coupled to the magnetic field istransformed into a system of quasiparticles. It is also assumed for simplicitythat there is in average N fluxes per particle. If the number N of fluxes iseven, then the system can be identified as composite fermions. If N is odd,then we obtain composite bosons. Quantization is described as gradation bycertain abelian group G. Statistics is determined by a commutation factor onthe grading group G. It is schown that for N = 2 there is a state for which themagnetic field is completely compensatad by the system of quasiparticles andfor N = 3 the Landau levells are fractionally filled like in the fractionalquantum Hall effect.
