It is argued that the T-dual of a crosscap is a combination of an O+ and anO- orientifold plane. Various theories with crosscaps and D-branes areinterpreted as gauge-theories on tori obeying twisted boundary conditions.Their duals live on orientifolds where the various orientifold planes are ofdifferent types. We derive how to read off the holonomies from the positions ofD-branes in the orientifold background. As an application we reconstruct someresults from a paper by Borel, Friedman and Morgan for gauge theories withclassical groups, compactified on a 2-- or 3--torus with twisted boundaryconditions.
