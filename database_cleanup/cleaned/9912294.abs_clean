Schrodinger equation with two-component wave function which describes arelativistic spin 1/2 particle in a weak electromagnetic field is obtained. Inthe same approximation Schrodinger equation with traditional norm condition andone-component wave function for a spinless particle is obtained as well. Toconstruct it Foldy-Wouthuysen procedure with the electron charge value as thesmall parameter is used.
