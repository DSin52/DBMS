Can one make a Majorana field theory for fermions starting from the zero massWeyl theory, then adding a mass term as an interaction? The answer to thismassive field theory. In both cases one can start from the zero mass Weyltheory and then add a mass term as an interacting term of massless particleswith a constant (external) field. In both cases the interaction gives rise to afield theory for a free massive fermion field. We present the procedure for thecreation of a mass term in the case of the Dirac and the Majorana field and welook for a massive field as a superposition of massless fields.
