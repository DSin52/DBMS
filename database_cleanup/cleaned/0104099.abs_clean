We study quantum corrections at the one loop level in open superstringtachyon condensation using the boundary string field theory (BSFT) method. Wefind that the tachyon field action has the same form as at the disc level, butwith a renormalized effective coupling $\lambda' =g_s^{ren}e^{-T^2/4}$($g_s^{ren}$ is the renormalized dimensionless closed string coupling,$e^{-T^2/4}$ is the tachyonic field expectation value) and with an effectivestring tension. This result is in agreement with that based on general analysisof loop effects.
