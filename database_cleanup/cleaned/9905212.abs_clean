We here present, in modern notation, the classification of the discretefinite subgroups of SU(4) as well as the character tables for the exceptionalwill be useful to works on string orbifold theories, quiver theories, WZWmodular invariants, Gorenstein resolutions, nonlinear sigma-models as well assome recently proposed inter-connections among them.
