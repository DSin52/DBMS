Title: Supersymmetric quantization of Yang-Mills theory and possible

applicationsAuthors: F.G. Scholtz and S.V. Shabanov

Comments: to appear in the Proceedings of the 2nd Sakharov Conference on

Physics, Moscow, May, 1996We develop a new operator quantization scheme for gauge theories where nogauge fixing for gauge fields is needed. The scheme allows one to avoid theGribov problem and construct a manifestly Lorentz invariant path integral thatcan be used in the non-perturbative domain. We discuss briefly an applicationof the method to Abelian projections of QCD.
