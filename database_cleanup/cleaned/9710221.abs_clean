We calculate the one loop corrections to the Chern-Simons coefficient$\kappa$ in the Higgs phase of Yang-Mills Chern-Simons Higgs theories. When thegauge group is SU(N), we show, by taking into account the effect of the wouldbe Chern-Simons term, that the corrections are always integer multiples of${1\over 4\pi}$, as they should for the theories to be quantum-mechanicallyconsistent. In particular, the correction is vanishing for SU(2). The samemethod can also be applied to the case that the gauge group is SO(N). Theresult for SO(2) agrees with that found in the abelian Chern-Simons theories.Therefore, the calculation provides with us a unified understanding of thequantum correction to the Chern-Simons coefficient.
