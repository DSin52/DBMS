We examine the Cardy-Verlinde formula for finite temperature N=4 SuperYang-Mills theory on $R\times S^3$, and its AdS dual. We find that curvatureeffects introduce non-trivial corrections to thermodynamic quantities computedon both sides. We find a modified version of the Cardy-Verlinde formula for theSYM theory, incorporating these. On the gravity side, these corrections implythat the Cardy-Verlinde formula is exact.
