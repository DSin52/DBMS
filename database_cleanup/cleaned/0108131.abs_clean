We construct a one-parameter set of intersecting D4-brane models, with sixstacks, that yield the (non-supersymmetric) standard model plus extravector-like matter. Twisted tadpoles and gauge anomalies are cancelled, and themodel contains all of the Yukawa couplings to the tachyonic Higgs doublets thatare needed to generate mass terms for the fermions.A string scale in the range 1-10 TeV and a Higgs mass not much greater thanthe current bound is obtained for certain values of the parameters,consistently with the observed values of the gauge coupling constants.
