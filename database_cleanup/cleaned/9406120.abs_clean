Title: Superanalogs of symplectic and contact geometry and their applications

to quantum field theoryComments: 18 pages

The paper contains a short review of the theory of symplectic and contactmanifolds and of the generalization of this theory to the case ofsupermanifolds. It is shown that this generalization can be used to obtain someimportant results in quantum field theory. In particular, regarding$N$-superconformal geometry as particular case of contact complex geometry, onecan better understand $N=2$ superconformal field theory and its connection totopological conformal field theory. The odd symplectic geometry constitutes amathematical basis of Batalin-Vilkovisky procedure of quantization of gaugetheories.The exposition is based mostly on published papers. However, the papercontains also a review of some unpublished results (in the section devoted tothe axiomatics of $N=2$ superconformal theory and topological quantum fieldtheory). The paper will be published in Berezin memorial volume.
