We consider here renormalizable theories without relevant couplings andpresent an I.R. consistent technique to study corrections to short distancebehavior (Wilson O.P.E. coefficients) due to a relevant perturbation. Ourmethod is the result of a complete reformulation of recent works on the field,and is characterized by a more orthodox treatment of U.V. divergences thatallows for simpler formulae and consequently an explicit all order(regularization invariant) I.R. finitess proof. Underlying hypotheses arediscussed in detail and found to be satisfied in conformal theories thatconstitute a natural field of application of this approach.
