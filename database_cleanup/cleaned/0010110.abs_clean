and amssym.tex; final versionTopological integrals appear frequently in Lagrangian field theories. Onmanifolds without boundary, they can be treated in the framework of (absolute)(co)homology using the formalism of Cheeger--Simons differential characters.String and D--brane theory involve field theoretic models on worldvolumes withboundary. On manifolds with boundary, the proper treatment of topologicalintegrals requires a generalization of the usual differential topological setup and leads naturally to relative (co)homology and relative Cheeger--Simonsdifferential characters. In this paper, we present a construction of relativeCheeger--Simons differential characters which is computable in principle andwhich contains the ordinary Cheeger--Simons differential characters as aparticular case.
