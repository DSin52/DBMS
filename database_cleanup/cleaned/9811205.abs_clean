We calculate the Hausdorff dimension, $d_H$, and the correlation functionexponent, $\eta$, for polymerized two dimensional quantum gravity models. Ifthe non-polymerized model has correlation function exponent $\eta_0 >3$ then$d_H=\gamma^{-1}$ where $\gamma$ is the susceptibility exponent. This suggeststhat these models may be in the same universality class as certain non-genericbranched polymer models.
