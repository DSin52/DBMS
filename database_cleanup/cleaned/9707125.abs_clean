We describe eight-dimensional vacuum configurations with varying moduliconsistent with the U-duality group $SL(2,Z) \times SL(3,Z)$. Focusing on thelatter less-well understood SL(3,Z) properties, we construct a class offivebrane solutions living on lines on a three-dimensional base space. Theresulting U-manifolds, with five scalars transforming under SL(3), admit aRicci-flat Kahler metric. Based on the connection with special lagrangian $T^3$fibered Calabi-Yau 3-folds, this construction provides a simple framework forthe investigation of Calabi-Yau mirrors.
