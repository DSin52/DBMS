We discuss the possibility for the spectrum of topologically massive quantumelectrodynamics with spinor matter fields to contain unexpected and unusualstable particle excitations for certain values of the topological photon mass.The new field theoretical phenomena arising from this novel spectral structureare briefly discussed.
