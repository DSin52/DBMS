I present a set of theories which display non-trivial `t Hooft anomalymatching for QCD with $F$ flavors. The matching theories are non-Abelian gaugetheories with "dual" quarks and baryons, rather than the purely confiningtheories of baryons that `t Hooft originally searched for. The matching gaugegroups are required to have an $F\pm 6$ dimensional representation. Such acorrespondence is reminiscent of Seiberg's duality for supersymmetric (SUSY)QCD, and these theories are candidates for non-SUSY duality. However anomalymatching by itself is not sufficiently restrictive, and duality for QCD cannotbe established at present. At the very least, the existence of multiple anomalymatching solutions should provide a note of caution regarding conjecturednon-SUSY dualities.
