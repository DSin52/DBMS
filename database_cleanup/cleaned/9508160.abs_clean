The adiabatic motion of a charged, spinning, quantum particle in a two -dimensional magnetic field is studied. A suitable set of operators generalizingthe cinematical momenta and the guiding center operators of a particle movingin a homogeneous magnetic field is constructed. This allows us to separate thetwo degrees of freedom of the system into a {\sl fast} and a {\sl slow} one, inthe classical limit, the rapid rotation of the particle around the guidingcenter and the slow guiding center drift. In terms of these operators theHamiltonian of the system rewrites as a power series in the magnetic length$\lb=\sqrt{\hbar c\over eB}$ and the fast and slow dynamics separates. Theeffective guiding center Hamiltonian is obtained to the second order in theadiabatic parameter $\lb$ and reproduces correctly the classical limit.
