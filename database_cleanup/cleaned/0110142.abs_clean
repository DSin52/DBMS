Title: Higher dimensional formulation of counterterms

Authors: Marika Taylor-Robinson

Comments: 28 pages, LaTeX

It is by now well established that divergences of the on-shell action forasymptotically AdS solutions can be cancelled by adding covariant localboundary counterterms to the action. Here we show that although one can stillrenormalise the action for asymptotically $AdS_p \times S^q$ solutions usinglocal boundary counterterms the counterterm action is not covariant since theconformal boundary is degenerate. Any given counterterm action is defined withrespect to specific coordinate frame and gauge choices.
