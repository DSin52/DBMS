For a variety of diffeomorphism-invariant field theories describinghypersurface motions (such as relativistic M-branes in space-time dimensionM+2) we perform a Hamiltonian reduction ``at level 0'', showing that a simplealgebraic function of the normal velocity is canonically conjugate to the shape\Sigma of the hypersurface. The Hamiltonian dependence on \Sigma is solely viathe domain of integration, raising hope for a consistent,reparametrisation-invariant quantization.
