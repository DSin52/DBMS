Title: Radiative corrections to the Casimir effect for the massive scalar field

Authors: F. A. Barone, R. M. Cavalcanti, and C. Farina

Comments: 6 pages. Work presented at the XXIII Brazilian National Meeting on

Particles and Fields (Aguas de Lindoia, Brazil, 15-19 Oct 2002). AlsoWe compute the $O(\lambda)$ correction to the Casimir energy for the massive$\lambda\phi^4$ model confined between a pair of parallel plates. Thecalculations are made with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Thecorrection is shown to be sensitive to the boundary conditions, except in thezero mass limit, in which case our results agree with those found in theliterature.
