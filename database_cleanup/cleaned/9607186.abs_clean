In the final few years of his life, Julian Schwinger proposed that the``dynamical Casimir effect'' might provide the driving force behind thepuzzling phenomenon of sonoluminescence. Motivated by that exciting suggestion,we have computed the static Casimir energy of a spherical cavity in anotherwise uniform material. As expected the result is divergent; yet aplausible finite answer is extracted, in the leading uniform asymptoticapproximation. This result agrees with that found using zeta-functionregularization. Numerically, we find far too small an energy to account for thelarge burst of photons seen in sonoluminescence. If the divergent result isretained, it is of the wrong sign to drive the effect. Dispersion does notresolve this contradiction. In the static approximation, the Fresnel drag termis zero; on the mother hand, electrostriction could be comparable to theCasimir term. It is argued that this adiabatic approximation to the dynamicalCasimir effect should be quite accurate.
