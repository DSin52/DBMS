The problem of finding most general form of the classical integrablerelativistic models of many-body interaction of the $BC_{n}$ type isconsidered. In the simplest nontrivial case of $n=2$,the extra integral ofmotion is presented in explicit form within the ansatz similar to thenonrelativistic Calogero-Moser models. The resulting Hamiltonian has been foundby solving the set of two functional equations.
