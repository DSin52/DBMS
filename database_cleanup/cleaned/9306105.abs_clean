We solve the gauged Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model at leading order in the large$N$ expansion by computing the anomalous dimensions of all the fields of themodel and other gauge independent critical exponents by examining the scalingbehaviour of the Schwinger Dyson equation. We then restrict to the threedimensional model and include a Chern Simons term to discover the$\theta$-dependence of the same exponents where $\theta$ is the Chern Simonscoupling.
