The realistic free fermionic models have had remarkable success in providingplausible explanations for various properties of the Standard Model whichinclude the natural appearance of three generations, the explanation of theheavy top quark mass and the qualitative structure of the fermion mass spectrumin general, the stability of the proton and more. These intriguing achievementsmakes evident the need to understand the general space of these models. Whilethe number of possibilities is large, general patterns can be extracted. Inthis paper I present a detailed discussion on the construction of the realisticfree fermionic models with the aim of providing some insight into the basicstructures and building blocks that enter the construction. The role of freephases in the determination of the phenomenology of the models is discussed indetail. I discuss the connection between the free phases and mirror symmetry in(2,2) models and the corresponding symmetries in the case of the (2,0) models.The importance of the free phases in determining the effective low energyphenomenology is illustrated in several examples. The classification of themodels in terms of boundary condition selection rules, real world-sheet fermionpairings, exotic matter states and the hidden sector is discussed.
