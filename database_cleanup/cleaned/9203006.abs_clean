The action of general relativity proposed by Capovilla, Jacobson and Dell iswritten in terms of $SO(3)$ gauge fields and gives Ashtekar's constraints forEinstein gravity. However, it does not depend on the space-time metric nor itssignature explicitly. We discuss how the space-time metric is introduced fromalgebraic relations of the constraints and the Hamiltonian by focusing ourattention on the signature factor. The system describes both Euclidian andLorentzian metrics depending on reality assignments of the gauge connections.That is, Euclidian metrics arise from the real gauge fields. On the other hand,self-duality of the gauge fields, which is well known in the Ashtekar'sformalism, is also derived in this theory from consistency condition ofLorentzian metric. We also show that the metric so determined is equivalent tothat given by Urbantke, which is usually accepted as a definition of the metricfor this system.
