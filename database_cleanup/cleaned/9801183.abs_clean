We study spin interactions between two moving D-branes using theGreen-Schwarz formalism of boundary states. We focus our attention on theleading terms for small velocities v, of the form v^{4-n}/r^{7-p+n}(v^{2-n}/r^{3-p+n}) for p-p (p-p+4) systems, with 16 (8) supercharges. Inanalogy with standard G-S computations of massless four-point one-loopamplitudes in Type I theory, the above terms are governed purely by zero modes,massive states contributions cancelling as expected by the residualsupersymmetry. This implies the scale invariance of these leading spin-effects,supporting the relevant matrix model descriptions of supergravity interactions;in this context, we also discuss similar results for more general braneconfigurations. We then give a field theory interpretation of our results, thatallows in particular to deduce the gyromagnetic ratio g=1 and the presence of aquadrupole moment for D0-branes.
