Comments: revtex, 35 pages

GeometryIt is formulated a new 'anholonomic frame' method of constructing exactsolutions of Einstein equations with off--diagonal metrics in 4D and 5Dgravity. The previous approaches and results are summarized and generalized asthree theorems which state the conditions when two types of ansatz result inintegrable gravitational field equations. There are constructed and analyzeddifferent classes of anisotropic and/or warped vacuum 5D and 4D metricsdescribing ellipsoidal black holes with static anisotropic horizons andpossible anisotropic gravitational polarizations and/or running constants. Weconclude that warped metrics can be defined in 5D vacuum gravity withoutpostulating any brane configurations with specific energy momentum tensors.Finally, the 5D and 4D anisotropic Einstein spaces with cosmological constantare investigated.
