We study the mass and different RR charge distributions of the BPS(p,p-2)-brane bound states in the closed string brane-like $\sigma$-model. Weshow that such brane bound states can be realized by introducing a constant Bfield in the closed string theory. In addition we show that the worldvolumecoordinates of these brane bound states turn out to be noncommutative.
