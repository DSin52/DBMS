Motivated by Harish-Chandra theory, we construct, starting from a simpleCDD\--pole $S$\--matrix, a hierarchy of new $S$\--matrices involving ever``higher'' (in the sense of Barnes) gamma functions.These new $S$\--matricescorrespond to scattering of excitations in ever more complex integrablemodels.From each of these models, new ones are obtained either by``$q$\--deformation'', or by considering the Selberg-type Euler products ofwhich they represent the ``infinite place''. A hierarchic array of integrablemodels is thus obtained. A remarkable diagonal link in this array isestablished.Though many entries in this array correspond to familiar integrablemodels, the array also leads to new models. In setting up this array we wereled to new results on the $q$\--gamma function and on the $q$\--deformedBloch\--Wigner function.
