Momentum space Ward identities are derived for the amputated n-point Green'sfunctions in 3+1 dimensional non-relativistic conformal field theory. For n=4and 6 the implications for scattering amplitudes (i.e. on-shell amputatedGreen's functions) are considered. Any scale invariant 2-to-2 scatteringamplitude is also conformally invariant. However, conformal invariance imposesconstraints on off-shell Green's functions and the three particle scatteringamplitude which are not automatically satisfied if they are scale invariant. Asan explicit example of a conformally invariant theory we considernon-relativistic particles in the infinite scattering length limit.
