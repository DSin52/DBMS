We discuss of the conceptual difficulties connected with theanticommutativity of classical fermion fields, and we argue that the "space" ofall classical configurations of a model with such fields should be described asan infinite-dimensional supermanifold M.We discuss the two main approaches to supermanifolds, and we examine thereasons why many physicists tend to prefer the Rogers approach although theBerezin-Kostant-Leites approach is the more fundamental one. We develop theinfinite-dimensional variant of the latter, and we show that the functionals onclassical configurations considered in a previous paper are nothing butsuperfunctions on M. We present a programme for future mathematical work, whichapplies to any classical field model with fermion fields. This programme is(partially) implemented in successor papers.
