It is shown that the massless $j=1$ Weinberg-Tucker-Hammer equations reduceto the Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic field under the definite choiceof field functions and initial and boundary conditions. Thus, the former appearto be of use in a description of some physical processes for which that couldbe necessitated or be convenient. The possible consequences are discussed.
