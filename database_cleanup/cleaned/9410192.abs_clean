InstituteWe study an extension of the axial model where local gauge symmetries aretaken into account. The anomaly of the axial current is calculated by theFujikawa formalism and the model is also solved. Besides the well knownfeatures of the particular models (axial and Schwinger) it was obtained aneffective interaction of scalar and gauge fields via a topological current.
