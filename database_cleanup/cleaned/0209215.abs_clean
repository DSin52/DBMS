Authors: Diana Vaman and Herman Verlinde

Comments: 22 pages, 1 figure

We present an improvement of the interacting string bit theory proposed inhep-th/0206059, designed to reproduce the non-planar perturbative amplitudesbetween BMN operators in N=4 gauge theory. Our formalism incorporates theeffect of operator mixing and all non-planar corrections to the inner product.We use supersymmetry to construct the bosonic matrix elements of the light-coneHamiltonian to all orders in g_2, and make a detailed comparison with thenon-planar amplitudes obtained from gauge theory to order (g_2)^2. We find aprecise match.
