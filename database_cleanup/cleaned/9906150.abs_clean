proceeding of MRST '99 (10-12 May, 1999, Carleton University, Canada)To formulate two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with adjoint matter fields inthe large-N limit as classical mechanics, we derive a Poisson algebra for thecolor-invariant observables involving adjoint matter fields. We showedrigorously in J. Math. Phys. 40, 1870 (1999) that different quantum orderingsof the observables produce essentially the same Poisson algebra. Here weexplain, in a less precise but more pedagogical manner, the crucial topologicalgraphical observations underlying the formal proof.
