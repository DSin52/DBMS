Title: On the Algebra of Ghost Fields

Comments: Plain TeX, 16 pages

We study in detail the algebra of free ghost fields which we realize in aHilbert-Fock space with positive metric. The investigation of causalityclarifies the exact reason for the failure of the spin-statistics theorem andleads to the introduction of the Krein Operator. We study the charge algebra ofthe ghost fields which gives a representation of ${\rm gl}(2,{\cal C})$. Thesymmetries of the $S$-matrix in ghost space are pointed out.
