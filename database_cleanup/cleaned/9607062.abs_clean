We discuss the quantization of pure string--inspired dilaton--gravity in$(1+1)$--dimensions, and of the same theory coupled to scalar matter. Weperform the quantization using the functional Schroedinger and BRST formalisms.We find, both for pure gravity and the matter--coupled theory, that the twoquantization procedures give inequivalent ``physical'' results.
