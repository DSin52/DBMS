We show that integrable vertex and RSOS models with trigonometric Boltzmannweights and appropriate inhomogeneities provide a convenient latticeregularization for massive field theories and for the recently studied masslessfield theories that interpolate between two non trivial conformal fieldtheories. Massive and massless S matrices are computed from the lattice Betheansatz.
