Comments: Talk presented by O.L. at the 35th International Symposium Ahrenshoop

on the Theory of Elementary Particles, Berlin, Germany, 26-30 Aug 2002It is argued that the (NS-sector) superstring field equations are integrable,i. e. their solutions are obtainable from linear equations. We adapt the25-year-old solution-generating "dressing" method and reduce the constructionof nonperturbative superstring configurations to a specific cohomology problem.The application to vacuum superstring field theory is outlined.
