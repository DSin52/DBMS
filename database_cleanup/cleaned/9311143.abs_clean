Motivated by recent developments in the computation of periods for stringcompactifications with $c=9$, we develop a complementary method which alsoproduces a convenient basis for related calculations. The models are realizedas Calabi--Yau hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces of dimension four oras Landau-Ginzburg vacua. The calculation reproduces known results and alsoallows a treatment of Landau--Ginzburg orbifolds with more than five fields.
