In this article we present the complete massless and massive one-looptriangle diagram results using the negative dimensional integration methodtwo massive with the same mass m and three equal masses for the virtualparticles. Our results are given in terms of hypergeometric andhypergeometric-type functions of external momenta (and masses for the massivecases) where the propagators in the Feynman integrals are raised to arbitraryexponents and the dimension of the space-time D. Our approach reproduces theknown results as well as other solutions as yet unknown in the literature.These new solutions occur naturally in the context of NDIM revealing apromising technique to solve Feynman integrals in quantum field theories.
