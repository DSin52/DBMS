Title: Non-trivial Infrared Structure in (2+1)-Dimensional Quantum

Electrodynamics and Non-Fermi Liquid BehaviourComments: 7 pages LATEX, one figure included. Invited Talk at the `Strong

Coupling Gauge Theories 96' International Conference, Nagoya (Japan),November 12-17 1996, to appear in the Proceedings (World Sci.)I review recent work on the infrared structure of (2+1)-dimensional Abeliangauge theories and their application to condensed matter physics. Inparticular, within a large-N Schwinger-Dyson treatment, and including an`infrared momentum cut-off', I demonstrate the existence of a non-trivialinfrared fixed point of the renormalization group. I connect this property tonon-fermi liquid low-energy behaviour, and I attempt to draw some conclusionsabout the possible application of this approach to an understanding of thenormal and superconducting phases of planar high-temperature superconductingcuprates.
