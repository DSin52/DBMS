We present non-supersymmetric toroidal compactifications of type I stringtheory with both constant background NSNS two-form flux and non-trivialmagnetic flux on the various D9-branes. The non-vanishing B-flux admitsfour-dimensional models with three generations of chiral fermions in standardmodel like gauge groups. Additionally, we consider the orbifold T^4/Z_2, againwith both kinds of background flux present, leading to non-supersymmetric aswell as supersymmetric models in six dimensions. All models have T-dualdescriptions as intersecting brane worlds.
