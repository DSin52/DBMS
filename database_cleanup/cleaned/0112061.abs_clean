Geodetic evolution of a de-Sitter brane is exclusively driven by a Higgspotential, rather than by a plain cosmological constant. The deviation fromEinstein gravity, parameterized by the conserved bulk energy, is characterizedby a hairy horizon which serves as the locus of unbroken symmetry. The quarticstructure of the potential, singled out on finiteness grounds of the total(including the dark component) energy density, chooses the no-boundaryproposal.
