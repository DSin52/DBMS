We consider the entropy problem of AdS_3 black holes using the conformalfield theory at the horizon. We observe that the supersymmetry is enhanced atthe horizon of massless AdS_3 black hole. This allows us to determine thevacuum of the modular invariant conformal field theory to be the NS-groundstate (which corresponds to AdS_3 spacetime). This is smoothly related to theR-ground state (corresponding to massless black hole) by a spectral flow, whichcan be understood as a superconformal transformation.
