We argue that the BRST and the anti-BRST super symmetries in thefour-dimensional Yang-Mills theory can be spontaneously broken in a nonlinearpartial gauge due to ghost-anti-ghost condensation. However, we show that thespontaneous BRST symmetry breaking can be avoided if we adopt the modifiedMaximal Abelian gauge which is an orthosymplectic $OSp(4|2)$ invariantrenormalizable gauge proposed by the author to derive quark confinement. Wecompare the Maximal Abelian gauge with the conventional $OSp(4|2)$ invariantgauge proposed by Delbourgo-Jarvis and Baulieu-Thierry-Mieg. Finally, animplication to the Gribov problem is briefly mentioned.
