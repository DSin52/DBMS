Title: Soliton solutions of the classical lattice sine-Gordon system

We study the soliton-type solutions of the system introduced by B. Feigin andthe author in in [EF]. We show that it reduces to a top-like system, and westudy the behaviour of the solutions at the lattice infinity. We compute thescattering of the solitons and study some periodic solutions of the system.
