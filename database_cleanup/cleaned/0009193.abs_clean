We derive the vertex operators that are expected to govern the emission ofthe massless d=11 supermultiplet from the supermembrane in the light conegauge. Our results immediately imply the linear coupling of matrix theory to anarbitrary supergravity background to all orders in anticommuting coordinates.Finally we address the definition of n-point tree level and one-loop scatteringamplitudes. The resulting 3-point tree level amplitudes turn out to agree withd=11 supergravity and are completely fixed by supersymmetry and the existenceof a normalizable ground state.
