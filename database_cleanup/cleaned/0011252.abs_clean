The effective potentials for massless scalar and vector quantum fieldtheories on D dimensional manifolds with p compact noncommutative extradimensions are evaluated by means of dimensional regularization implemented byzeta function techniques. It is found that the zeta function associated withthe one-loop operator may not be regular at the origin. Thus, the relatedheat-kernel trace has a logarithmic term in the short t asymptotics expansion.Consequences of this fact are briefly discussed.
