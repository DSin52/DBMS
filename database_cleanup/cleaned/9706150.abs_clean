We solve for the exact atom-field eigenstates of a single atom in a threedimensional spherical cavity, by mapping the problem onto the anisotropic Kondomodel. The spectrum has a rich bound state structure in comparison with modelswhere the rotating wave approximation is made. It is shown how to obtain theJaynes-Cummings model states in the limit of weak coupling. Non-perturbativeLamb shifts and decay rates are computed. The massive Kondo model is introducedto model light localization in the form of photon-atom bound states in photoniccrystals.
