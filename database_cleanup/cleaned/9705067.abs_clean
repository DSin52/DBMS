We discuss classical composite p-brane solutions and their quantization usingthe conjecture that their fluctuations may be described via degrees of freedomof Dirichlet strings ended on these p-branes. We work with Dirichlet(super)strings in framework of string field theory for open (super)strings. Toelaborate in this scheme the eleventh dimension modes we take just a collectionof Dirichlet strings which in their middle points have jumps in eleventhdimension. This theory can be seen as string field theory in infinite momentumframe of an eleven dimensional object.
