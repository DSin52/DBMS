We consider whether current notions about superstring theory below the Planckscale are compatible with cosmology. We find that the anticipated form for thedilaton interaction creates a serious roadblock for inflation and makes itunlikely that the universe ever reaches a state with zero cosmological constantand time-independent gravitational constant.
