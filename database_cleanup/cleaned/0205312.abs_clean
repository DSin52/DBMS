Comments: 21 pages, no figures

We study the Euclidean effective action and the full fermion propagator for aDirac field in the presence of a scalar field with a domain wall defect, in 2+1dimensions. We include quantum effects due to both fermion and scalar fieldfluctuations, in a one-loop approximation. The results are interpreted in termsof the quantum stability of the zero mode solution. We also study, for thissystem, the induced `inertial' electric field for the fermions on the defect,due to the quantum fluctuations of the scalar field.
