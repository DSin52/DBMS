Explicit examples of quasi-exactly-solvable $N$-body problems on the line arepresented. These are related to the hidden algebra $sl_N$, and they are of twotypes -- containing up to $N$ (infinitely-many eigenstates are known, but notall) and up to 6 body interactions only (a finite number of eigenstates isknown). Both types degenerate to the Calogero model.
