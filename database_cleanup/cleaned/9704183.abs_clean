Gauge-invariant systems of a general form with higher order derivatives ofgauge parameters are investigated within the framework of the BFV formalism.Higher order terms of the BRST charge and BRST-invariant Hamiltonian areobtained. It is shown that the identification rules for Lagrangian andHamiltonian ghost variables depend on the choice of the extension ofconstraints from the primary constraint surface.
