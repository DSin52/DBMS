We analyze the algebraic structure of $\phi_{1,2}$ perturbed minimal modelsrelating them to graph-state models with an underlying Birman-Wenzl-Murakamialgebra. Using this approach one can clarify some physical properties andreformulate the bootstrap equations. These are used to calculate the $S$-matrixelements of higher kinks, and to determine the breather spectrum of the$\phi_{1,2}$ perturbations of the unitary minimal models $\M_{r,r+1}$.
