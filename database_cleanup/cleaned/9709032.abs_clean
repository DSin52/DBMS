Title: Universal Fluctuations in Dirac Spectra

Comments: 30 pages, 6 figures, Latex, Invited talk at the "Nato Advanced

Theory", Zakopane, 1997In these two lectures given at the 1997 Zakopane workshop on "NewDevelopments in Quantum Field Theory" we review recent results on universalfluctuations in QCD Dirac spectra. We start the first lecture with a review ofsome general properties of Dirac spectra. It will be argued that there is anintimate relation between chiral symmetry breaking and correlations of Diraceigenvalues. In particular, we will focus on the microscopic spectral densitydensity, i.e. the spectral density near zero virtuality on the scale of atypical level spacing. The relation with Leutwyler-Smilga sum-rules will bediscussed. Standard methods for the statistical analysis of quantum spectrawill be reviewed. Recent results on the application of Random Matrix Theory tospectra of 'complex' systems will be summarized. This leads to the introductionof a chiral Random Matrix Theory (chRMT) with the global symmetries of the QCDpartition function. In the second lecture the chiral random matrix model willbe compared to QCD and some of its properties will be discussed. Our centralconjecture is that correlations of QCD Dirac spectra are described by chRMT. Wewill review recent results showing that the microscopic spectral density andeigenvalue correlations near zero virtuality are strongly universal. LatticeQCD results for the microscopic spectral density and for correlations in thebulk of the spectrum will be presented. In all cases that have been considered,the correlations are in perfect agreement with chRMT. We will end the secondlecture with a review of chiral Random Matrix Theory at nonzero chemicalpotential. New features of spectral universality in nonhermitean matrices willbe discussed.
