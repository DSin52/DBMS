We construct the worldline superfield massive superparticle actions whichpreserve 1/4 portion of the underlying higher-dimensional supersymmetry. Therest of supersymmetry is spontaneously broken and realized by nonlineartransformations. We consider the cases of N=4 to N=1 and N=8 to N=2 partialbreaking. In the first case we present the corresponding Green-Schwarz typetarget superspace action with one $\kappa$-supersymmetry. It is related to thesuperfield action via a field redefinition. In the second case we find out twopossible models, one of which is a direct generalization of the N=4 to N=1case, while another is essentially different. For the first model we formulateGreen-Schwarz type action with two kappa supersymmetries. We elaborate on thebosonic part of the superfield action for the second model and find that onlyin two special limits it takes the standard Nambu-Goto form. In the generalcase it is determined by a fourth-order algebraic equation. The characteristiccommon feature of these new superparticle models is that the algebras of theirspontaneously broken supersymmetries are non-trivial truncations of the generalextensions of N=1 and N=2 Poincare D=4 superalgebras by tensorial centralcharges.
