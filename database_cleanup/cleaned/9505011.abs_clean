It is shown that from some solutions of generalized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikovequations one can construct eigenfunctions of the Calogero-Sutherland-MoserHamiltonians with exchange terms, which are characterized by any givenpermutational symmetry under particle exchange. This generalizes some resultspreviously derived by Matsuo and Cherednik for the ordinaryCalogero-Sutherland-Moser Hamiltonians.
