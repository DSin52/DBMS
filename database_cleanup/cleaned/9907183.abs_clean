Recently M. Kontsevich found a combinatorial formula defining a star-productof deformation quantization for any Poisson manifold. Kontsevich's formula hasbeen reinterpreted physically as quantum correlation functions of a topologicalsigma model for open strings as well as in the context of D-branes in flatbackgrounds with a Neveu-Schwarz B-field. Here the corresponding Kontsevich'sformula for the dual of a Lie algebra is derived in terms of the formalism ofD-branes on group manifolds. In particular we show that that formula is encodedat the two-point correlation functions of the Wess-Zumino-Witten effectivetheory with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The B-field entering in theformalism plays an important role in this derivation.
