We consider the motion of a particle described by an action that is afunctional of the Frenet-Serret [FS] curvatures associated with the embeddingof its worldline in Minkowski space. We develop a theory of deformationstailored to the FS frame. Both the Euler-Lagrange equations and the physicalinvariants of the motion associated with the Poincar\'e symmetry of Minkowskispace, the mass and the spin of the particle, are expressed in a simple way interms of these curvatures. The simplest non-trivial model of this form, withthe lagrangian depending on the first FS (or geodesic) curvature, isintegrable. We show how this integrability can be deduced from the Poincar\'einvariants of the motion. We go on to explore the structure of these invariantsin higher-order models. In particular, the integrability of the model describedby a lagrangian that is a function of the second FS curvature (or torsion) isestablished in a three dimensional ambient spacetime.
