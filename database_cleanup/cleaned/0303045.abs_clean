We have covariantized the Lagrangians of the U(1)_V * U(1)_A models, whichhave U(1)_V * U(1)_A gauge symmetry in two dimensions, and studied theirsymmetric structures. The special property of the U(1)_V * U(1)_A models is thefact that all these models have an extra time coordinate in the targetspace-time. The U(1)_V * U(1)_A models coupled to two-dimensional gravity arestring models in 26+2 dimensional target space-time for bosonic string and in10+2 dimensional target space-time for superstring. Both string models have twotime coordinates. In order to construct the covariant Lagrangians of the U(1)_V* U(1)_A models the generalized Chern-Simons term plays an important role. Thesupersymmetric generalized Chern-Simons action is also proposed. TheGreen-Schwarz type of U(1)_V * U(1)_A superstring model has another fermioniclocal symmetry as well as \kappa-symmetry. The supersymmetry of targetspace-time is different from the standard one.
