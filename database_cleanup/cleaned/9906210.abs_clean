The Type 0 string theory is considered as a dual model of anon-supersymmetric gauge theory. A background geometry with N electricD3-branes is calculated in UV/IR regions. In this paper, we study a D5-branearound N D3-branes from the D5-brane world volume action as in the Type IIBcase, and we obtain some baryon configurations at UV/IR regions.
