We show how a lattice approach can be used to derive Thermodynamic BetheAnsatz (TBA) equations describing all excitations for boundary flows. Themethod is illustrated for a prototypical flow of the tricritical Ising model byconsidering the continuum scaling limit of the A4 lattice model with integrableboundaries. Fixing the bulk weights to their critical values, the integrableboundary weights admit two boundary fields $\xi$ and $\eta$ which play the roleof the perturbing boundary fields $\phi_{1,3}$ and $\phi_{1,2}$ inducing therenormalization group flow between boundary fixed points. The excitations arecompletely classified in terms of (m,n) systems and quantum numbers but thestring content changes by certain mechanisms along the flow. For ourprototypical example, we identify these mechanisms and the induced map betweenthe relevant finitized Virasoro characters. We also solve the boundary TBAequations numerically to determine the flows for the leading excitations.
