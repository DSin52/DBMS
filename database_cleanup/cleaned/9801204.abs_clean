corrected, amplified discussion of a fine pointThe construction of effective field theories describing M-theory compactifiedon $S^1/{\bf Z}_2$ is revisited, and new insights into the parameters of thetheory are explained. Particularly, the web of constraints which follow fromsupersymmetry and anomaly cancelation is argued to be more rich than previouslyunderstood. In contradistinction to the lore on the subject, a consistentclassical theory describing the coupling of eleven dimensional supergravity tosuper Yang-Mills theory constrained to the orbifold fixed points is suggestedto exist.
