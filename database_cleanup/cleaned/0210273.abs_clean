In this paper, I explain how gauge symmetry can be broken in a geometric way,\`{a} la Kaluza-Klein. In higher dimensional gravitational theories, oneusually considers the extra dimensions to be ``frozen'' in time. However, theinternal manifold is actually a dynamic entity. For example, its metric canchange even if one expects its topological properties to be invariant. It isconceivable then, that at an earlier epoch the internal manifold made ageometric transition from say a maximally symmetric metric space to a lesssymmetric one. We know in a Kaluza-Klein reduction scheme, the massless gaugebosons are associated with the Killing vectors of the internal manifold. Afterthe transition of the internal manifold, the gauge bosons associated with thebroken Killing isometries will pick up a mass thereby breaking the gaugeinvariance partially. In this paper, I explore this idea, work out the mass ofbroken gauge bosons for some simple examples, and also point out how amechanism similar to that of Higgs may be at work.
