We derive sufficient conditions under which the ``second''Hamiltonian structure of a class of generalized KdV-hierarchies defines one ofthe classical $\cal W$-algebras obtained through Drinfel'd-Sokolov Hamiltonianreduction. These integrable hierarchies are associated to the Heisenbergsubalgebras of an untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebra. When the principalHeisenberg subalgebra is chosen, the well known connection between theHamiltonian structure of the generalized Drinfel'd-Sokolov hierarchies - theGel'fand-Dickey algebras - and the $\cal W$-algebras associated to the Casimirinvariants of a Lie algebra is recovered. After carefully discussing therelations between the embeddings of $A_1=sl(2,{\Bbb C})$ into a simple Liealgebra $g$ and the elements of the Heisenberg subalgebras of $g^{(1)}$, weidentify the class of $\cal W$-algebras that can be defined in this way. For$A_n$, this class only includes those associated to the embeddings labelled bypartitions of the form $n+1= k(m) + q(1)$ and $n+1= k(m+1) + k(m) + q(1)$.
