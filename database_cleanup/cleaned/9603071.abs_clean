Authors: H. Grosse, C. Klimcik, P. Presnajder

Comments: 11 pages, LaTeX, Based on a seminar presented by C. Klimcik at LXIV.

Les Houches session on `Quantum Symmetries', August 1995A construction of supersymmetric field-theoretical models in non-commutativegeometry is reviewed. The underlying superstructure of the models is encoded in$osp(2,2)$ superalgebra.
