The Skyrme model can be generalised to a situation where static fields aremaps from one Riemannian manifold to another. Here we study a Skyrme modelwhere physical space is two-dimensional euclidean space and the target space isthe two-sphere with its standard metric. The model has topological solitonsolutions which are exponentially localised. We describe a superpositionprocedure for solitons in our model and derive an expression for theinteraction potential of two solitons which only involves the solitons'asymptotic fields. If the solitons have topological degree 1 or 2 there aresimple formulae for their interaction potentials which we use to prove theexistence of solitons of higher degree. We explicitly compute the fields andenergy distributions for solitons of degrees between one and six and discusstheir geometrical shapes and binding energies.
