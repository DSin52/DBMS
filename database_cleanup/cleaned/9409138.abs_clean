We consider a general class of boundary terms of the open XYZ spin-1/2 chaincompatible with integrability. We have obtained the general elliptic solutionof $K$-matrix obeying the boundary Yang-Baxter equation using the $R$-matrix ofthe eight vertex model and derived the associated integrable spin-chainHamiltonian.
