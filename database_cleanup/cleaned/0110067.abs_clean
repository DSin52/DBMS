In this work are consider several topics in the Topological Membrane (TM)approach to string theory. The string dynamics is generated from the bulkphysics, namely from the 3D Topologically Massive Gauge Theory (TMGT) andTopologically Massive Gravity (TMG). Both (equivalent) path integral andcanonical methods of quantizing TMGT are studied. It is shown that Narainconstraints on toroidal compactification (integer, even, self-dual momentumlattice) have a natural interpretation in purely three dimensional terms. TheHeterotic string and the block structure of c=1 RCFT are derived from the pointof view of three dimensional field theory. Open and unoriented strings inTM(GT) theory are also studied through orbifolds of the bulk 3D space. This isachieved by gauging discrete symmetries of the theory. Open and unorientedstrings can be obtained from all possible realizations of C, P and Tsymmetries. The important role of C symmetry to distinguish between Dirichletand Neumann boundary conditions is discussed in detail. Future directions ofresearch in this field are also suggested and discussed.
