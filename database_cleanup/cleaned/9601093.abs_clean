A non--Abelian $SU(2)$ model is constructed for a five--dimensional boundsystem "charge--dyon" on the basis of the Hurwitz--transformedeight--dimensional isotropic quantum oscillator. The principle ofdyon--oscillator duality is formulated; the energy spectrum and wave functionsof the system "charge--dyon" are calculated.
