It is shown that there are logarithmic operators in D-brane backgrounds thatlead to infrared divergences in open string loop amplitudes. These divergencescan be cancelled by changing the closed string background by operators thatcorrespond to the D-brane moving with constant velocity after some instant intime, since it is precisely such operators that give rise to the appropriateultraviolet divergences in the closed string channel.
