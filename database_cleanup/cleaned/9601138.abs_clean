Hamiltonians whose symbols are not simply real valued, but matrix or, moregenerally, endomorphism valued functions appear in many places in physics,examples being the Dirac equation, multicomponent wave equations likeelectrodynamics in media, and Yang-Mills theories, and the Born-Oppenheimerapproximation in molecular physics. The aim of this paper is to give acompletely geometric approach to the WKB approximation od such systems, and toreduce the problem ``as far as possible'' to the scalar case. A star-productformulation of quantum mechanics proves to be particularly useful in thiscontext. As opposed to other approaches in the literature which restrictthemselves to the use of the Moyal product and thus to the study of trivialbundles (or local trivializations) over $\real^{2n}$, we will consider generalbundles over arbitrary symplectic manifolds. Here, Fedosov's construction\cite{fedosov} will be the adequate tool, since it gives an explicitconstruction for star products in this general setting.
