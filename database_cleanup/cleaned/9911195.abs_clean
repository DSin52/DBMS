Magnetic BPS string solutions preserving quarter of supersymmetry areobtained for all abelian gauged d=5 N=2 supergravity theories coupled to vectorsupermultiplets. Due to a ``generalised Dirac quantization'' conditionsatisfied by the minimized magnetic central charge, the string metric takes auniversal form for all five dimensional gauged theories.
