The self-tuning brane scenario is an attempt to solve the cosmologicalconstant problem in the context of extra dimensions. Rather than making thevacuum energy small, this approach proceeds by removing the gravitationaleffect of vacuum energy on the expansion of the universe. Such behavior is onlypossible through changing the Friedmann equation of conventional cosmology, andwe discuss difficulties in obtaining cosmological evolution compatible withobservation in this context. Specific models considered include a bulk scalarfield coupling to the brane via a conformal transformation of the brane metric,and via a rescaling of the brane volume element.
