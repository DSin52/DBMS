Two kinds of realizations of symmetry on classical domains or the Euclideanversion of AdS space are used to study AdS/CFT correspondence. Mass of freeparticles is defined as an AdS group invariant, the Klein-Gordon and Diracequations for relativistic particles in the AdS space are set up as a mimic inthe case of Minkowskian space. The bulk-boundary propagator on the AdS space isgiven by the Poisson kernel. Theorems on the Poisson kernel guarantee theexistence and sole of the bulk-boundary propagator. The propagator is used tocalculate correlators of the theories that live on the boundary of the AdSspace and show conformal invariance, which is desired by the AdS/CFTcorrespondence.
