In the microcanonical ensemble for string theory on $ AdS_m \times S^n$,there is a phase transition between a black hole solution extended over the$S^n$ and a solution localized on the $S^n$ if the $AdS_m$ has the topology$R^2 \times S^{m-2}$. The phase transition will not appear if the $AdS_m$ hasthe topology $R^2 \times T^{m-2}$, that is, when the $AdS_m\times S^n$ geometryis regarded as arising from the near-horizon limit of a black $m-2$ brane. Inthis paper, we argue that when the black branes are rotating, the localizationphase transition will occur between some rotating branes and corresponding Kerrblack holes when the angular momentum reaches its critical value.
