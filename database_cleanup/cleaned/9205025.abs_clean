We study the scattering of a massless and neutral test particle in thegravitational field of a body (the string star) made of a large number ofscalar states of the superstring. We consider two cases, the one in which thesestates are neutral string excitations massive already in ten dimensions and theone in which their masses (and charges) originate in the process ofcompactification on tori. A perturbative calculation based on superstringamplitudes gives us the deflection angle up to the second order in Newton'sconstant. A comparison with field theory explicitly shows which among thevarious massless fields of the superstring give a contribution to thescattering process. In both cases, the deflection angle is smaller than the onecomputed in general relativity. The perturbative series can be resummed byfinding the exact solution to the classical equations of motion of thecorresponding low-energy action. The space-time metric of our two examples ofstring stars has no horizon.
