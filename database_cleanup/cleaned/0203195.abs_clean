Title: An algebraic method for solving the SU(3) Gauss law

Authors: Antti Salmela

Comments: 19 pages, LaTex2e

A generalisation of existing SU(2) results is obtained. In particular, thesource-free Gauss law for SU(3)-valued gauge fields is solved using anon-Abelian analogue of the Poincare lemma. When sources are present, thecolour-electric field is divided into two parts in a way similar to the Hodgedecomposition. Singularities due to coinciding eigenvalues of thecolour-magnetic field are also analysed.
