Title: On the quantum Poincare' group

Authors: Leonardo Castellani

Comments: 16 pp., DFTT-57/92

The inhomogeneous quantum groups $IGL_q(n)$ are obtained by means of aparticular projection of $GL_q(n+1)$. The bicovariant differential calculus on$GL_q(n)$ is likewise projected into a consistent bicovariant calculus on$IGL_q(n)$. Applying the same method to $GL_q(n,\Cb)$ leads to a bicovariantcalculus for the complex inhomogeneous quantum groups $IGL_q(n,\Cb)$. Thequantum Poincare' group and its bicovariant geometry are recovered byspecializing our results to $ISL_q(2,\Cb)$.
