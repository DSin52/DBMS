The D-bound on the entropy of matter systems in de Sitter space is shown tobe closely related to the Bekenstein bound, which applies in a flat background.This holds in arbitrary dimensions if the Bekenstein bound is calibrated by aclassical Geroch process. We discuss the relation of these bounds to the moregeneral bound on the entropy to area ratio. We find that black holes do notsaturate the Bekenstein bound in dimensions greater than four.
