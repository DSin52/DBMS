Supersymmetric non-linear sigma-models are described by a field dependentKaehler metric determining the kinetic terms. In general it is not guaranteedthat this metric is always invertible. Our aim is to investigate the symmetrystructure of supersymmetric models in four dimensional space-time in whichmetric singularities occur. For this purpose we study a simple anomaly-freeextension of the supersymmetric CP^1 model from a classical point of view. Weshow that the metric singularities can be regularized by the addition of a softsupersymmetry-breaking mass parameter.
