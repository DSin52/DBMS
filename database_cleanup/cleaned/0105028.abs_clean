The non-renormalization theorem of chiral vertices and the generalizednon-renormalization theorem of the photon self energy are derived in SQED onthe basis of algebraic renormalization. For this purpose the gauge coupling isextended to an external superfield. This extension already provides detailedinsight into the divergence structure. Moreover, using the local supercouplingtogether with an additional external vector multiplet that couples to the axialcurrent, the model becomes complete in the sense of multiplicativerenormalization, with two important implications. First, a Slavnov--Tayloridentity describing supersymmetry, gauge symmetry, and axial symmetry includingthe axial anomaly can be established to all orders. Second, from thisSlavnov-Taylor identity we can infer a Callan-Symanzik equation expressing allaspects of the non-renormalization theorems. In particular, the gauge$\beta$-function appears explicitely in the closed form.
