The $SL(2,R)$ duality symmetric action for the Born-Infeld theory in terms oftwo potentials, coupled with non-trivial backgroud fields in four dimensions isestablished. This construction is carried out in detail by analysing thehamiltonian structure of the Born-Infeld theory. The equivalence with the usualBorn-Infeld theory is shown.
