We sketch a particularly simple and compelling version of D-brane cosmology.Inspired by the semi-phenomenological Randall--Sundrum models, and theircosmological generalizations, we develop a variant that contains a single(3+1)-dimensional D-brane which is located on the boundary of a single bulk(4+1)-dimensional region. The D-brane boundary is itself to be interpreted asour visible universe, with ordinary matter (planets, stars, galaxies) beingtrapped on this D-brane by string theory effects. The (4+1)-dimensional bulkis, in its simplest implementation, adS_{4+1}, anti-de Sitter space. Wedemonstrate that a k=+1 closed FLRW universe is the most natural option, thoughthe scale factor could quite easily be so large as to make it operationallyindistinguishable from a k=0 spatially flat universe. (With minor loss ofelegance, spatially flat and hyperbolic FLRW cosmologies can also beaccommodated.) We demonstrate how this model can be made consistent withstandard cosmology, and suggest some possible observational tests.
