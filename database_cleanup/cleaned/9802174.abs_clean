Using relations from random matrix theory, we derive exact expressions forall $n$-point spectral correlation functions of Dirac operator eigenvalues interms of finite-volume partition functions. This is done for both chiralsymplectic and chiral unitary random matrix ensembles, which correspond to$SU(N_c \geq 3)$ gauge theories with $N_f$ fermions in the adjoint andfundamental representations, respectively. In the latter case we infer fromthis an infinite sequence of consistency conditions that must be satisfied bythe corresponding finite-volume partition functions.
