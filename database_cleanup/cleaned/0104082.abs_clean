We study some wrapped configurations of branes in the near-horizon geometryof a stack of other branes. The common feature of all the cases analyzed is aquantization rule and the appearance of a finite number of staticconfigurations in which the branes are partially wrapped on spheres. The energyof these configurations can be given in closed form and the analysis of theirsmall oscillations shows that they are stable. The cases studied includeD(8-p)-branes in the type II supergravity background of Dp-branes (for p lessor equal than 5), M5-branes in the M5-brane geometry in M-theory and D3-branesin a (p,q) fivebrane background in the type IIB theory. The braneconfigurations found admit the interpretation of bound states of strings (orM2-branes in M-theory) which extend along the unwrapped directions. We checkthis fact directly in a particular case by using the Myers polarizationmechanism.
