We obtain the exact ground state for the Calogero-Sutherland problem inarbitrary dimensions. In the special case of two dimensions, we show that theproblem is connected to the random matrix problem for complex matrices,provided the strength of the inverse-square interaction $g = 2$. In thethermodynamic limit, we obtain the ground state energy and the pair-correlationfunction and show that in this case there is no long-range order.
