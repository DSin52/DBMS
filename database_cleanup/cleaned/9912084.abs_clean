We apply the new orbifold duality transformations to discuss the special caseof cyclic coset orbifolds in further detail. We focus in particular on the caseof the interacting cyclic coset orbifolds, whose untwisted sectors areZ_\lambda(permutation)-invariant g/h coset constructions which are not \lambdacopies of coset constructions. Because \lambda copies are not involved, theaction of Z_\lambda(permutation) in the interacting cyclic coset orbifolds canbe quite intricate. The stress tensors and ground state conformal weights ofall the sectors of a large class of these orbifolds are given explicitly andspecial emphasis is placed on the twisted h subalgebras which are generated bythe twisted (0,0) operators of these orbifolds. We also discuss the systematicsof twisted (0,0) operators in general coset orbifolds.
