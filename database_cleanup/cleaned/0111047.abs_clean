Hawking radiation is computed in different coordinate systems using themethod of complex paths. In this procedure the event horizon of the 2DSchwarzschild stringy black hole is treated as a singularity for thesemiclassical action functional. After the regularization of the eventhorizon's singularity the emission/absorption probabilities and the Hawkingtemperature in the different coordinate representations are derived. Theidentical results obtained indicate the covariance of the Hawking radiation.
