We evaluate the 4-point function of the auxiliary field in the critical O(N)sigma model at O(1/N) and show that it describes the exchange of tensorcurrents of arbitrary even rank l>0. These are dual to tensor gauge fields ofthe same rank in the AdS theory, which supports the recent hypothesis ofKlebanov and Polyakov. Their couplings to two auxiliary fields are alsoderived.
