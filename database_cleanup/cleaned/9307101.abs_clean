We show how to obtain the ultraviolet central charge from the exact S-matrixfor a wide variety of models with a $U(1)$ symmetry. This is done by couplingthe $U(1)$ current $J$ to a background field. In an $N$=2 superconformal theorywith $J$ the fermion number current, the OPE of $J$ with itself and hence thefree energy are proportional to $c$. By deforming the supersymmetry into affine$\widehat SU(2)_q$ quantum-group symmetry, this result can be generalized tomany $U(1)$-invariant theories, including the N=0 and N=1 sine-Gordon modelsand the $SU(2)_k$ WZW models. This provides a consistency check on aconjectured S-matrix completely independent of the finite-size effectsexpressed in terms of dilogarithms resulting from the thermodynamic Betheansatz.
