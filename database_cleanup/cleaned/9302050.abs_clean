Starting from the requirement that a Lagrangian field theory be invariantunder both Schwinger-Dyson BRST and Schwinger-Dyson anti-BRST symmetry, wederive the BRST--anti-BRST analogue of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. Thisis done through standard Lagrangian gauge fixing respecting the extended BRSTsymmetry. The solutions of the resulting Master Equation and the gauge-fixingprocedure for the quantum action can be brought into forms that coincide withthose obtained earlier on algebraic grounds by Batalin, Lavrov and Tyutin.
