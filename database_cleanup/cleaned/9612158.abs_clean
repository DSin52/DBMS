Title: Weyl-Invariant Quantization of Liouville Field Theory

Comments: 11 pages, latex

Liouville field theory is quantized by means of a Wilsonian effective actionand its associated exact renormalization group equation. For $c<1$, anapproximate solution of this equation is obtained by truncating the space ofall action functionals. The Ward identities resulting from the Weyl invarianceof the theory are used in order to select a specific universality class for therenormalization group trajectory. It is found to connect two conformal fieldtheories with central charges $25-c$ and $26-c$, respectively.
