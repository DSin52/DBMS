We propose a new formulation of gauge theories as a quantum theory which hasthe gauge theory action $S$ as its dynamical variable. This system is describedby a simple actional $I(S)$ (that is, an action for the action $S$) whoseequation of motion gives the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) master equation for $S$.Upon quantization we find that our new formulation is reduced to something likea topological field theory having a BRST exact gauge-fixed actional. Thereforethe present formulation can reproduce ordinary gauge theories since thepath-integral over $S$ is dominated by the classical configuration whichsatisfies the BV master equation. This ``theory of theories'' formulation isintended to be applied to closed string field theory.
