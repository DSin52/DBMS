Title: Space-time discretization

determined formComments: LaTex, 6 pages

The concept of the random discretization of the space-time is suggested. Itis the way to consistent compatible synthesis of quantum and relativisticprinciples and principle of geometrization. The basic idea of this concept isphysical reality of the finite sizes fundamental element of the quantizedspace-time. The flat space-time with random discretization is described as theprobability measure space with the set of all possible discretizations of theflat continual space-time as the set of points. The probability measure candepend on the geometric parameters of discretizations (a number of regions of adiscretization, their volumes, areas etc.). In this concept the fundamentallength can be defined as the average value of the linear size of a fundamentalelement. In this concept the "particle" quantum and the space-time quantum areidentical.
