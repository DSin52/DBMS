The charged black hole is considered from the viewpoint of D0-brane in theMatrix theory. It can be obtained from the Kaluza-Klein mechanism by boostingthe Schwarzschild black hole in a circle, which is the compactified onedimensional space. Especially, how the extremal limit is realized by theBoltzmann gas of D0-brane, has been shown. In the course of our discussion, theVirial theorem for the statistical average plays an important role.
