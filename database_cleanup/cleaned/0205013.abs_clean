We study the Wess-Zumino model with the coupling extended to a chiralsuperfield. In order to incorporate the renormalization effects a furtherexternal real field has to be introduced. It is then possible to derive aCallan-Symanzik equation and to prove renormalizability. By constructing thesupercurrent in this context the whole machinery for describing thesuperconformal symmetries becomes available. The presence of the externalfields allows also to define multiple insertions of all relevant compositeoperators. Interesting relations to the curved superspace treatment show up.
