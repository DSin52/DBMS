We use string duality to describe instanton induced spontaneous supersymmetrybreaking in string compactifications with additional background fields.Dynamical supersymmetry breaking by space-time instantons in the heteroticstring theory is mapped to a tree level breaking in the type II string whichcan be explicitly calculated by geometric methods. It is argued that theinstanton corrections resurrect the no-go theorem on partial supersymmetrybreaking. The point particle limit describes the non-perturbative scalarpotential of a SYM theory localized on a hypersurface of space-time. The N=0vacuum displays condensation of magnetic monopoles and confinement. Thesupersymmetry breaking scale is determined by $M_{str}$, which can be in theTeV range, and the geometry transverse to the gauge theory.
