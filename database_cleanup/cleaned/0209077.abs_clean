In this paper we describe the heterotic dual of the type IIB theorycompactified to four dimensions on a toroidal orientifold in the presence offluxes. The type IIB background is most easily described in terms of anM-theory compactification on a four-fold. The heterotic dual is obtained byperforming a series of U-dualities. We argue that these dualities preservesupersymmetry and that the supergravity description is valid after performingthem. The heterotic string is compactified on a manifold that is no longerKahler and has torsion. These manifolds have to satisfy a number ofconstraints, for example, existence of an holomorphic three-form, size limits,torsional equations etc. We give an explicit form of the background and studythe constraints associated to them.
