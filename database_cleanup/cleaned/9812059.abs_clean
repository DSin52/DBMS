A simple method is proposed to construct the spectral zeta functions requiredfor calculating the electromagnetic vacuum energy with boundary conditionsgiven on a sphere or on an infinite cylinder. When calculating the Casimirenergy in this approach no exact divergencies appear and no renormalization isneeded. The starting point of the consideration is the representation of thezeta functions in terms of contour integral, further the uniform asymptoticexpansion of the Bessel function is essentially used. After the analyticcontinuation, needed for calculating the Casimir energy, the zeta functions arepresented as infinite series containing the Riemann zeta function with rapidlyfalling down terms. The spectral zeta functions are constructed exactly for amaterial ball and infinite cylinder placed in an uniform endless medium underthe condition that the velocity of light does not change when crossing theinterface. As a special case, perfectly conducting spherical and cylindricalshells are also considered in the same line. In this approach one succeeds,specifically, in justifying, in mathematically rigorous way, the appearance ofthe contribution to the Casimir energy for cylinder which is proportional to$\ln (2\pi)$.
