We study cosmological solutions to the low-energy effective action ofheterotic string theory including possible leading order $\alpha'$ correctionsand a potential for the dilaton. We consider the possibility that includingsuch stringy corrections can resolve the initial cosmological singularity.Since the exact form of these corrections is not known the higher-derivativeterms are constructed so that they vanish only when the metric is de Sitterspacetime. The constructed terms are compatible with known restrictions fromscattering amplitude and string worldsheet beta-function calculations. Analyticand numerical techniques are used to construct a singularity-free cosmologicalsolution. At late times and low-curvatures the metric is asymptoticallyMinkowski and the dilaton is frozen. In the high-curvature regime the universeenters a de Sitter phase.
