We suggest that the boundary cosmological constant \zeta in c<1 unitarystring theory be regarded as the one-dimensional complex coordinate of thetarget space on which the boundaries of world-sheets can live. From thisviewpoint we explicitly construct analogues of D-instantons which satisfyPolchinski's ``combinatorics of boundaries.'' We further show that our operatorformalism developed in the preceding articles is powerful in evaluatingD-instanton effects, and also demonstrate for simple cases that these effectsexactly coincide with the stringy nonperturbative effects found in the exactsolutions of string equations.
