Extending recent work on SU gauge theory, we engineer local string modelsfor N=1 four-dimensional SO and USp gauge theories coupled to matter inthe fundamental. The local models are type IIB orientifolds with D7 branes on acurved orientifold 7-plane, and matter realized by adding D3 branes on theorientifold plane. The Higgs branches of the SO and USp theories can bematched with the moduli spaces of SO and USp instantons on the compactfour-dimensional part of the D7 branes worldvolume. The R-charge of the gaugetheories is identified with a U(1) symmetry on the worldvolume of anEuclidean D3 brane instanton. We argue that the quantum field theory dualitiesof these gauge theories arise from T-dualities of type IIB strings exchangingD7 and D3 charges. A crucial role is played by the induced D3 charge of D7branes and an orientifold 7-plane, both partially compactified on a $Z_2$orbifold of K3.
