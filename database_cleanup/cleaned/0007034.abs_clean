We consider the parity invariant (2+1)-dimensional QED where the matter isrepresented as a mixture of fermions with opposite spins. It is argued that theperturbative ground state of the system is unstable with respect to theformation of magnetized ground state. Carrying out the finite temperatureanalysis we show that the magnetic instability disappears in the hightemperature regime.
