The O(3) sigma model and abelian Higgs model in two space dimensions admittopological (Bogomol'nyi) lower bounds on their energy. This paper proposeslattice versions of these systems which maintain the Bogomol'nyi bounds. Oneconsequence is that instantons/solitons/vortices on the lattice then have ahigh degree of stability.
