We study the problem of vortex solutions in the background of rotating blackholes in both asymptotically flat and asymptoticlly anti de Sitter spacetimes.We demonstrate the Abelian Higgs field equations in the background of fourdimensional Kerr, Kerr-AdS and Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black holes have vortexline solutions. These solutions, which have axial symmetry, are generalizationof the Nielsen-Olesen string. By numerically solving the field equations ineach case, we find that these black holes can support an Abelian Higgs field ashair. This situation holds even in the extremal case, and no flux-expulsionoccurs. We also compute the effect of the self gravity of the Abelian Higgsfield show that the the vortex induces a deficit angle in the correspondingblack hole metrics.
