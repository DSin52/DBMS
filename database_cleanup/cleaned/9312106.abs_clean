The multimode even and odd coherent states (multimode Schroedinger catstates) are constructed for polymode parametric oscillators of theelectromagnetic field. The evolution of the photon distribution function isevaluated explicitly. The distribution function is expressed in terms of themultivariable Hermite polynomials, its means and dispersions are calculated.The conditions for the existence of squeezing are formulated. The correlationsamong the different modes of Schroedinger cat states are studied.
