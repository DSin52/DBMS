We show that the translational subgroup of Wigner's little group for masslessparticles in 3+1 dimensions generate gauge transformation in linearizedEinstein gravity. Similarly a suitable representation of the 1-dimensionaltranslational group T(1) is shown to generate gauge transformation in thelinearized Einstein-Chern-Simons theory in 2+1 dimensions. Theserepresentations are derived systematically from appropriate representations oftranslational groups which generate gauge transformations in gauge theoriesliving in spacetime of one higher dimension by the technique of dimensionaldescent. The unified picture thus obtained is compared with a similar pictureavailable for vector gauge theories in 3+1 and 2+1 dimensions. Finally, thepolarization tensor of Einstein-Pauli-Fierz theory in 2+1 dimensions is shownto split into the polarization tensors of a pair of Einstein-Chern-Simonstheories with opposite helicities suggesting a doublet structure forEinstein-Pauli-Fierz theory.
