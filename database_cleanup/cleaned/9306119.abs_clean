By studying the geometric properties of correlation functions on the theoryspace, we are naturally led to a connection for the infinite dimensional vectorbundle of composite fields over the theory space. We show how the shortdistance singularities of the theory are determined by the geometry of thetheory space, i.e., the connection, beta functions, and anomalous dimensions.(This is a summary of the talk given at Strings '93 in Berkeley.
