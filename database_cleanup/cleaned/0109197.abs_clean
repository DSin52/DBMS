We argue that there are two distinct classes of type I compactification tofour dimensions on any space. These two classes are distinguished in amysterious way by the presence (or absence) of a discrete 6-form potential. Insimple examples, duality suggests that the new class of compactifications havereduced numbers of moduli. We also point out analogous discrete choices in M, Fand type II compactifications, including some with $G_2$ holonomy. Thesechoices often result in spaces with frozen singularities.
