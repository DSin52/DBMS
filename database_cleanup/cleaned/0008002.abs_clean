Noncommutative \phi^3 field theory in six dimensions exhibits the logarithmicUV/IR mixing at the two-loop order. We show that open string theory in thepresence of constant background NS-NS two-form field yields the same amplitudeupon taking a decoupling limit. The stretched string picture proposed on thebasis of one-loop analysis naturally generalizes to the two-loop amplitudes inconsideration. Our string theory formulation can incorporate the closed stringinsertions as well as open string insertions. Furthermore, the analysis of theworld-sheet partition function and propagators can be straightforwardlygeneralized to Riemann surfaces with genus zero but with an arbitrary number ofboundaries.
