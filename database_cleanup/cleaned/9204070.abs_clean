We describe the most general treatment of all anomalies both for chiral andmassless Dirac fermions, in two-dimensional gravity. It is shown that for thispurpose two regularization dependent parameters are present in the effectiveaction. Analogy to the \sc\ model is displayed corresponding to a specificchoice of the second parameter, thus showing that the gravitational modelcontains \a\ relations having no analogy in the \sc\ model.
