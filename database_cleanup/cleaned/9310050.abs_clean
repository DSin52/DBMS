We study the scattering of Skyrmions at low energy and large separation usingthe method proposed by Manton of truncation to a finite number of degreefreedom. We calculate the induced metric on the manifold of the union ofgradient flow curves, which for large separation, to first non-trivial order isparametrised by the variables of the product ansatz.
