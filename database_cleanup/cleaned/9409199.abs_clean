In this paper, using a model of N=2 supergravity - vector multipletsinteraction with the scalar field geometry $SU(1,m)/SU(m)\otimes U(1)$ as anexample, we show that even when the geometry is fixed one can have a wholefamily of the Lagrangians that differ by the vector field dualitytransformations. As a byproduct, for this geometry we have constructed a modelof (m-1) vector multiplets interacting with the hidden sector admittingspontaneous supersymmetry breaking with two arbitrary scales and without acosmological term.
