A class of two-dimensional globally scale-invariant, but not conformallyinvariant, theories is obtained. These systems are identified in the process ofdiscussing global and local scaling properties of models related by dualitytransformations, based on non-semisimple isometry groups. The construction ofthe dual partner of a given model is followed through; non-local as well aslocal versions of the former are discussed.
