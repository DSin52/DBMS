By imposing on the most general renormalizable quantum field theory therequirement of the absence of ultraviolet-divergent renormalizations of thephysical parameters (masses and coupling constants) of the theory, finitequantum field theories in four space-time dimensions may be constructed. Famousprototypes of these form certain well-known classes of supersymmetric finitequantum field theories. Within a perturbative evaluation of the quantum fieldtheories under consideration, the starting point of all such investigations isrepresented by the conditions for one- and two-loop finiteness of the gaugecouplings as well as for one-loop finiteness of the Yukawa couplings.Particularly attractive solutions of the one-loop Yukawa finiteness conditioninvolve Yukawa couplings which are equivalent to generators of Cliffordalgebras with identity element. However, a closer inspection shows, at leastfor all simple gauge groups up to and including rank 8, that theseClifford-like solutions prove to be inconsistent with the requirements of one-and two-loop finiteness of the gauge coupling and of absence of gaugeanomalies.
