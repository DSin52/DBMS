In odd-dimensional spaces, gauge invariance permits a Chern-Simons mass termfor the gauge fields in addition to the usual Maxwell-Yang-Mills kinetic energyterm. We study the Casimir effect in such a (2+1)-dimensional Abelian theory.For the case of parallel conducting lines the result is the same as for ascalar field. For the case of circular boundary conditions the results arecompletely different, with even the sign of the effect being opposite forMaxwell-Chern-Simons fields and scalar fields. We further examine the effect offinite temperature. The Casimir stress is found to be attractive at both lowand high temperature. Possibilities of observing this effect in the laboratoryare discussed.
