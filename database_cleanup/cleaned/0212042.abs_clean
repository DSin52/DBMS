Phys.Lett.BWe briefly review the construction of N=2 WZW models in terms of Manintriples. We analyse the restrictions which should be imposed on the gluingconditions of the affine currents in order to preserve half of the bulksupersymmetry. In analogy with the Kahler case there are two types of D-branes,A- and B-types which have a nice algebraic interpretation in terms of the Manintriple.
