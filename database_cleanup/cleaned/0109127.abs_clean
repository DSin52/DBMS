We examine a family of BPS solutions of ten-dimensional type IIbsupergravity. These solutions asymptotically approach AdS_5 X S^5 and carryinternal `angular' momentum on the five-sphere. While a naked singularityappears at the center of the anti-de Sitter space, we show that it has anatural physical interpretation in terms of a collection of giant gravitons. Wecalculate the distribution of giant gravitons from the dipole field induced inthe Ramond-Ramond five-form, and show that these sources account for the entireinternal momentum carried by the BPS solutions.
