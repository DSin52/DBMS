Arguing that the equation for the gonihedric string should have a generalizedDirac form, we found a new equation which corresponds to a symmetric solutionof the Majorana commutation relations and has non-Jacobian form. Thecorresponding generalized gamma-matrices are anticommuting. Explicit formulasfor the mass spectrum lead to nonzero string tension $M^{2}_{j} \geqM^{2}(j+1)^{2}$. We discuss also new dual transformation of the Dirac equationand of the proposed generalizations.
