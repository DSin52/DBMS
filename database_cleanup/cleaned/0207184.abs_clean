Group theory indicates the existence of a $SO(8) X SO(7) \subset SO(16)$invariant self-duality equation for a 3-form in 16 dimensions. It is a signalfor interesting topological field theories, especially on 8-dimensionalmanifolds with holonomy group smaller than or equal to Spin(7), with a gaugesymmetry that is SO(8) or SO(7). Dimensional reduction also provides newsupersymmetric theories in 4 and lower dimensions, as well as a model withgravitational interactions in 8 dimensions, which relies on the octonionicgravitational self-duality equation.
