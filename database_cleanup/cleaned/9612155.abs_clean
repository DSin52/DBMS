pages, RevTeX, in spanishFunctional determinants for Dirac operators on manifolds with boundary areconsidered. Ellipticity of boundary value problems is discussed in terms of theCalderon projector.The functional determinant for a Dirac operator on a bidimensional disk, inthe presence of an Abelian gauge field, subject to global boundary conditionsof the type introduced by Atiyah-Patodi-Singer, is evaluated. The relationshipwith the index theorem is also commented.
