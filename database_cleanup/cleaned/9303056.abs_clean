Title: Symmetry and Observables in Induced QCD

Authors: Gordon W. Semenoff and Nathan Weiss

Comments: 20 pages, UBC-TP93-004

We review some of the basic features of the Kazakov-Migdal model of inducedQCD. We emphasize the role of $Z_N$ symmetry in determining the observableproperties of the model and also argue that it can be broken explicitly withoutruining the solvability of induced QCD in the infinite $N$ limit. We outlinethe sort of critical behavior which the master field must have in order thatthe model is still solvable. We also review some aspects of the $D=1$ versionof the model where the partition function can be obtained analytically.
