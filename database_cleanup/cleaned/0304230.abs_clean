Title: BRST Quantization of String Theory in AdS(3)

Authors: Ari Pakman

Comments: JHEP style, 24 pages; v2

We study the BRST quantization of bosonic and NSR strings propagating inAdS(3) x N backgrounds. The no-ghost theorem is proved using theFrenkel-Garland-Zuckerman method. Regular and spectrally-flowed representationsof affine SL(2,R) appear on an equal footing. Possible generalizations torelated curved backgrounds are discussed.
