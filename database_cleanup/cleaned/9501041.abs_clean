We show the existence of self-dual semilocal nontopological vortices in a$\Phi^2$ Chern-Simons (C-S) theory. The model of scalar and gauge fields with a$SU(2)_{global} \times U(1)_{local}$ symmetry includes both the C-S term and ananomalous magnetic contribution. It is demonstrated here, that the vortices arestable or unstable according to whether the vector topological mass $\kappa$ isless than or greater than the mass $m$ of the scalar field. At the boundary,$\kappa = m$, there is a two-parameter family of solutions all saturating theself-dual limit. The vortex solutions continuously interpolates between a ringshaped structure and a flux tube configuration.
