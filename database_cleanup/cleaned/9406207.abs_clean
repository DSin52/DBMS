We construct the string field Hamiltonian for $c=1-\frac{6}{m(m+1)}$ stringtheory in the temporal gauge. In order to do so, we first examine theSchwinger-Dyson equations of the matrix chain models and propose the continuumversion of them. Results of boundary conformal field theory are useful inmaking a connection between the discrete and continuum pictures. The $W$constraints are derived from the continuum Schwinger-Dyson equations. We alsocheck that these equations are consistent with other known results aboutnoncritical string theory. The string field Hamiltonian is easily obtained fromthe continuum Schwinger-Dyson equations. It looks similar to Kaku-Kikkawa'sHamiltonian and may readily be generalized to $c>1$ cases.
