A general action is proposed for the fields of $q$-dimensional differentialform over the compact Riemannian manifold of arbitrary dimensions. Mathematicaltools come from the well-known de Rham-Kodaira decomposing theorem on theharmonic integral. We have a field-theoretic action suitable for strings and$p$-branes with or without spin degrees of freedom. In a completely-kinematicalway is derived the generalized Maxwell theory with a magnetic monopole over acurved space-time, where we have a new type of gauge transformations.
