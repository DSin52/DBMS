We study the thermodynamics of the D1-D5 system on a five-torus, focussing onthe roles of different scales. One can take a decoupling limit such that thetension of the `little string' inside the fivebrane remains finite and thephysics is 5+1 dimensional. The dual black geometry exhibits a boosted Hagedornphase, as well as a phase describing a boosted fivebrane gas. The dependence onthe boost yields information about the nature of the fivebrane modes and theirinteractions. In particular, the form of the equations of state suggests adescription in terms of $k=Q_1 Q_5$ degrees of freedom, which may lead to anexplanation of the $(Q_5)^3$ growth in the fivebrane density of states belowthe Hagedorn transition.
