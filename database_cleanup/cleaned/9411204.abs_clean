Motivated by a possible relativistic string description of hadrons we use adiscretised light-cone quantisation and Lanczos algorithm to investigate thephase structure of phi^3 matrix field theory in the large N limit. In 1+1dimensions we confirm the existence of Polyakov's non-critical string theory atthe boundary between parton-like and string-like phases, finding criticalexponents for longitudinal oscillations equal to or consistent with those givenby a mean field argument. The excitation spectrum is finite, possibly discrete.We calculate light-cone structure functions and find evidence that theprobability Q(x) of a parton in the string carrying longitudinal momentumfraction between x and x+dx has support on all 0<x<1, despite the averagenumber of partons being infinite.
