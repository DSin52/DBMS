Title: Picture changing operators in supergeometry and superstring theory

Authors: Alexander Belopolsky

Comments: 26 pages AMS LaTeX, Minor corrections

GeometryGeometrical meaning of superstring pictures is discussed in details. Anoff-shell generalization of the picture changing operation and its inverse areconstructed. It is demonstrated that the generalised operations are inverse toeach other on-shell while off-shell their product is a projection operator.
