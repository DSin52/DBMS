Negative dimensional integration method (NDIM) is revealing itself as a veryuseful technique for computing Feynman integrals, massless and/or massive,covariant and non-covariant alike. Up to now, however, the illustrativecalculations done using such method are mostly covariant scalar integrals,without numerator factors. Here we show how those integrals with tensorialstructures can also be handled with easiness and in a straightforward manner.However, contrary to the absence of significant features in the usual approach,here the NDIM also allows us to come across surprising unsuspected bonuses. Inthis line, we present two alternative ways of working out the integrals andillustrate them by taking the easiest Feynman integrals in this category thatemerges in the computation of a standard one-loop self-energy diagram. One ofthe novel and as yet unsuspected bonus is that there are degeneracies in theway one can express the final result for the referred Feynman integral.
