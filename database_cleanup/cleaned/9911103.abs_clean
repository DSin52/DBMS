We consider the (2+1)-dimensional gauged Thirring model in the Heisenbergpicture. In this context we evaluate the vacuum polarization tensor as well asthe corrected gauge boson propagator and address the issues of generation ofmass and dynamics for the gauge boson (in the limits of QED$_3$ and Thirringmodel as a gauge theory, respectively) due to the radiative corrections.
