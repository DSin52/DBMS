We study supersymmetric quantum mechanics on RP_{n},SO(n),G_{2} and U(2) toexamine Witten's Morse theory concretely. We confirm the simple instantonpicture of the de Rham cohomology that has been given in a previous paper. Weuse a reflection symmetry of each theory to select the true vacuums. The numberof selected vacuums agrees with the de Rham cohomology for each of the abovemanifolds.
