The form of the Seiberg-Witten differential is derived from the M-theoryapproach to N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories by directly imposing the BPScondition for twobranes ending on fivebranes. The BPS condition also impliesthat the pullback of the Kahler form onto the space part of the twobraneworld-volume vanishes.
