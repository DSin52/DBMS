Title: Lectures on Strings and Dualities

Authors: Cumrun Vafa

Comments: 53 pages

In this set of lectures I review recent developments in string theoryemphasizing their non-perturbative aspects and their recently discoveredduality symmetries. The goal of the lectures is to make the recent excitingdevelopments in string theory accessible to those with no previous backgroundin string theory who wish to join the research effort in this area. Topicscovered include a brief review of string theory, its compactifications,solitons and D-branes, black hole entropy and web of string dualities.(Lectures presented at ICTP summer school, June 1996)
