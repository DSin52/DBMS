Comments: Latex 22 pages, 63628 bytes. No figures

In this paper the classical limit of relativistic transport theories for spin1/2 fermions is examined through a comparison with the classical kinetic theoryderived from N=1 supersymmetric classical mechanics. The conclusion is that inthe classical limit spindensities, i.e. the axial-vector contribution to therelativistic Wigner-function, vanishes and dipole-densities, i.e. thespin-tensor contributions to the relativistic Wigner function, may survive.
