This is the first of two articles devoted to a comprehensive exposition ofthe generating-function method for computing fusion rules in affine Liealgebras. The present paper is entirely devoted to the study of thetensor-product (infinite-level) limit of fusions rules. We consider thus indetail the problem of constructing tensor-product generating functions infinite Lie algebras. From the beginning, the problem is recast in terms of theconcept of a model, which is an algebra whose Poincar\'e series is thegenerating function under study. We start by reviewing Sharp's charactermethod. Simple examples are worked out in detail, illustrating thereby itsintrinsic limitations. An alternative approach is then presented; it is basedon the reformulation of the problem of calculating tensor products in terms ofthe solution of a set of linear and homogeneous Diophantine equations whoseelementary solutions represent ``elementary couplings''. Grobner bases providea tool for generating the complete set of relations between elementarycouplings and, most importantly, as an algorithm for specifying a complete,compatible set of ``forbidden couplings''. This machinery is then applied tothe construction of various tensor-product generating functions.
