In the physical interpretation of states in non-perturbative loop quantumgravity the so-called weave states play an important role. Until now onlyweaves representing flat geometries have been introduced explicitly. In thispaper the construction of weaves for non-flat geometries is described; inparticular, weaves representing the Schwarzschild solution are constructed.
