The Casimir energy of a dilute homogeneous nonmagnetic dielectric ball atzero temperature is derived analytically for the first time for an arbitraryphysically possible frequency dispersion of dielectric permittivity$\epsilon(i\omega)$. A microscopic model of dielectrics is considered,divergences are absent in calculations because an average interatomic distance$\lambda$ is a {\it physical} cut-off in the theory. This fact has beenoverlooked before, which led to divergences in various macroscopic approachesto the Casimir energy of connected dielectrics.
