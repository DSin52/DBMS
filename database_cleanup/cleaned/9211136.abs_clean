Comments: 9 pages, ROM2F-92/60

The discovery of black-hole evaporation represented in many respects arevolutionary event in scientific world; as such, in giving answers to openquestions, it gave rise to new problems part of which are still not resolved.Here we want to make a brief review of such problems and examine some possiblesolutions.
