We formulate the Rindler space description of rotating black holes in stringtheories. We argue that the comoving frame is the natural frame for studyingthermodynamics of rotating black holes and statistical analysis of rotatingblack holes gets simplified in this frame. We also calculate statisticalentropies of general class of rotating black holes in heterotic strings on toriby applying D-brane description and the correspondence principle. We find atleast qualitative agreement between the Bekenstein-Hawking entropies and thestatistical entropies of these black hole solutions.
