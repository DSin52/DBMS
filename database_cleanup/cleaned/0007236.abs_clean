We generalize the spectral-curve construction of moduli spaces of instantonson $\MT{4}$ and $K_3$ to noncommutative geometry. We argue that thespectral-curves should be constructed inside a twisted $\MT{4}$ or $K_3$ thatis an elliptic fibration without a section. We demonstrate this explicitly for$T^4$ and to first order in the noncommutativity, for $K_3$. Physically, modulispaces of noncommutative instantons appear as moduli spaces of theories with$\SUSY{4}$ supersymmetry in 2+1D. The spectral curves are related toSeiberg-Witten curves of theories with $\SUSY{2}$ in 3+1D. In particular, weargue that the moduli space of instantons of $U(q)$ Yang-Mills theories on anoncommutative $K_3$ is equivalent to the Coulomb branch of certain 2+1Dtheories with ${\cal N} = 4$ supersymmetry. The theories are obtained bycompactifying the heterotic little-string theory on $T^3$ with global twists.This extends a previous result for noncommutative instantons on $\MT{4}$. Wealso briefly discuss the instanton equation on generic curved spaces.
