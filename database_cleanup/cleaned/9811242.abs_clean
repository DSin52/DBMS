under the influence of External Conditions"We study the problem of a Dirac field in the background of an Aharonov-Bohmflux string. We exclude the origin by imposing spectral boundary conditions ata finite radius then shrinked to zero. Thus, we obtain a behaviour of theeigenfunctions which is compatible with the self-adjointness of the radialHamiltonian and the invariance under integer translations of the reduced flux.After confining the theory to a finite region, we check the consistency withthe index theorem, and discuss the vacuum fermionic number and Casimir energy.
