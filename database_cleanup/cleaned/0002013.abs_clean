Workshop "Supersymmetries and Quantum Symmetries - 1999", Dubna, Russia;minor correctionsThe effective action in general chiral superfield model with arbitraryk\"{a}hlerian potential $K(\bar{\Phi},\Phi)$ and chiral (holomorphic) potential$W(\Phi)$ is considered. The one-loop and two-loop contributions tok\"{a}hlerian effective potential and two-loop (first non-zero) contribution tochiral effective potential are found for arbitrary form of functions$K(\bar{\Phi},\Phi)$ and $W(\Phi)$. It is found that despite the theory isnon-renormalizable in general case two-loop contribution to holomorphiceffective potential is always finite.
