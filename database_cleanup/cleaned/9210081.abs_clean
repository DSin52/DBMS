Quantization of two dimensional chiral matter coupled to gravity induces aneffective action for the zweibein field which is both Weyl and Lorentzanomalous. Recently, the quantization of this induced action has been analyzedin the light-cone gauge as well as in the conformal gauge. An apparent mismatchbetween the results obtained in the two gauges is analyzed and resolved byproperly treating the Lorentz field as a chiral boson.
