We present the results of further analysis of the integrability properties ofthe $N=4$ supersymmetric KdV equation deduced earlier by two of us (F.D. \&E.I.) as a hamiltonian flow on $N=4$ $SU(2)$ superconformal algebra in theharmonic $N=4$ superspace. To make this equation and the relevant hamiltonianstructures more tractable, we reformulate it in the ordinary $N=4$ and furtherin $N=2$ superspaces. In $N=2$ superspace it is given by a coupled system ofevolution equations for a general $N=2$ superfield and two chiral andantichiral superfields, and involves two independent real parameters, $a$ and$b$. We construct a few first bosonic conserved charges in involution, ofdimensions from 1 to 6, and show that they exist only for the following choices6$. The same values are needed for the relevant evolution equations to bebi-hamiltonian. We demonstrate that these three options are related via $SU(2)$transformations and actually amount to the $SU(2)$ covariant integrabilitycondition found in the harmonic superspace approach. Our results provide astrong evidence that the unique $N=4$ $SU(2)$ super KdV hierarchy exists. Uponreduction to $N=2$ KdV, the above three possibilities cease to be equivalent.They give rise to the $a=4$ and $a=-2$ $N=2$ KdV hierarchies, which thus proveto be different truncations of the single $N=4$ $SU(2)$ KdV one.
