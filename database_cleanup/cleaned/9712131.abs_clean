Title: Quantum Field Theory on Fock Projective Space

Authors: Peter Leifer

Comments: 10 pages, LaTeX

It is shown that some analog of the ``second quantization'' exists in theframework of CP(N) theory. I analyse conditions under that ``geometricalbosons'' may be identified with real physical fields. The compact character ofa state manifold should preserve the quantities of dynamical variables fromdivergences.
