A general method of constructing canonical gauge invariant actions is used toestablish the equivalence between 2D induced gravity and a WZNW system, definedby a difference of two simple WZNW actions fo the SL(2,R) group. Thediffeomorphism invariance of the induced gravity is generated by the SL(2,R)Kac-Moody structure of the WZNW system.
