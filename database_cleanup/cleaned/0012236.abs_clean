Starting from nonlinear realizations of the partially broken central-chargeextended N=4 and N=8 Poincar\'e supersymmetries in D=4, we derive thesuperfield equations of N=2 and N=4 Born-Infeld theories. The basic objects arethe bosonic Goldstone N=2 and N=4 superfields associated with the centralcharge generators. By construction, the equations are manifestly N=2 and N=4supersymmetric and enjoy covariance under another nonlinearly realized half ofthe original supersymmetries. They provide a manifestly worldvolumesupersymmetric static-gauge description of D3-branes in D=6 and D=10. For theN=2 case we find, to lowest orders, the equivalence transformation to thestandard N=2 Maxwell superfield strength and restore, up to the sixth order,the off-shell N=2 Born-Infeld action with the second hidden N=2 supersymmetry.
