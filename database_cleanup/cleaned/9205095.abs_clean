Some exact static solutions for Einstein gravity in 2+1 dimensions coupled toabelian gauge field are discussed. Some of these solutions arethree-dimensional analogs of the Schwarzschild black holes. The metrics in theregions inside and outside the horison are connected by the changing of thePlanck mass sign.
