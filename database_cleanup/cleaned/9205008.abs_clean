In bosonic field theories the low-energy scattering of solitons that saturateBogomol'nyi-type bounds can be approximated as geodesic motion on the modulispace of static solutions. In this paper we consider the analogous issue withinthe context of supersymmetric field theories. We focus our study on a class of$N=2$ non-linear sigma models in $d=2+1$ based on an arbitrary K\"ahler targetmanifold and their associated soliton or ``lump" solutions. Using a collectiveco-ordinate expansion, we construct an effective action which, uponquantisation, describes the low-energy dynamics of the lumps. The effectiveaction is an $N=2$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics action with the targetmanifold being the moduli space of static charge $N$ lump solutions of thesigma model. The Hilbert space of states of the effective theory consists ofanti-holomorphic forms on the moduli space. The normalisable elements of thedolbeault cohomology classes $H^{(0,p)}$ of the moduli space correspond to zeroenergy bound states and we argue that such states correpond to bound states inthe full quantum field theory of the sigma model.
