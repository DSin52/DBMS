Figures.We briefly review a hamiltonian path integral formalism developed earlier byone of us. An important feature of this formalism is that the path integralquantization in arbitrary co-ordinates is set up making use of only classicalhamiltonian without addition of adhoc $\hbar^2$ terms. In this paper we usethis hamiltonian formalism and show how exact path integration may be done forseveral potentials.
