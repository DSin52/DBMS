The scattering of pointlike particles at very large center of mass energiesand fixed low momentum transfers, occurring due to both their electromagneticand gravitational interactions is re-examined in the particular case when oneof the particles carries magnetic charge. At Planckian center-of-mass energies,when gravitational dominance is normally expected, the presence of magneticcharge is shown to produce dramatic modifications to the scattering crosssection as well as to the holomorphic structure of the scattering amplitude.
