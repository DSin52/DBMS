Title: Dynamical Symmetry Breaking in Light-Front Gross-Neveu Model

Comments: 12 pages, Latex, no figures

We investigate dynamical symmetry breaking of the Gross-Neveu model in thelight-front formalism without introducing auxiliary fields. While this systemcannot have zero-mode constraints, we find that a nontrivial solution to theconstraint on nondynamical spinor fields is responsible for symmetry breaking.The fermionic constraint is solved by systematic 1/$N$ expansion using theboson expansion method as a technique. Carefully treating the infrareddivergence, we obtain a nonzero vacuum expectation value for fermion condensatein the leading order. We derive the 't Hooft equation including the effect ofcondensation, and determine the Hamiltonian consistently with the equation ofmotion.
