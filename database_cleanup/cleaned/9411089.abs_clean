Title: Five Lectures on the Jet Methods in Field Theory

Comments: total 113 pp, LaTeX file

The fibre bundle formulation of gauge theory is generally accepted. The jetmanifold machinery completes this formulation and provides the adequatemathematical description of dynamics of fields represented by sections of fibrebundles. Theory of differential operators, Lagrangian and Hamiltonianformalisms on bundles have utilized widely the language of jet manifolds.Moreover, when not restricted to principal connections, differential geometryalso is phrased in jet terms. However, this powerful tool remains almostunknown to physicists. These Lectures give introduction to jet manifolds,Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms in jet manifolds and their application toa number of fundamental field models.
