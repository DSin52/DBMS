This paper discusses the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking in theSchr\"odinger representation formulation of quantum field theory. The analysisis presented for three-dimensional space-time abelian gauge theories witheither Maxwell, Maxwell-Chern-Simons, or pure Chern-Simons terms as the gaugefield contribution to the action, each of which leads to a different form ofmass generation for the gauge fields.
