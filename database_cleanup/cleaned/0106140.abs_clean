We consider ``brane world sum rules'' for compactifications involving anarbitrary number of spacetime dimensions. One of the most striking resultsderived from such consistency conditions is the necessity for negative tensionbranes to appear in five--dimensional scenarios. We show how this result iseasily evaded for brane world models with more than five dimensions. As anexample, we consider a novel realization of the Randall--Sundrum scenario insix dimensions involving only positive tension branes.
