Applying a technique developed recently [1,2] for an harmonic oscillatorcoupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators, we present an exact solution for thetunneling problem in an Ohmic dissipative system with inverted harmonicpotential. The result shows that while the dissipation tends to suppress thetunneling, the Brownian motion tends to enhance the tunneling. Whether thetunneling rate increases or not would then depend on the initial conditions. Wegive a specific formula to calculate the tunneling probability determined byvarious parameters and the initial conditions.
