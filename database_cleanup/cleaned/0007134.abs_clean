Title: Ricci-Parallelizable Spaces in the NS-NS Sector

Authors: Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas

Comments: 8 pages, latex. v2

addedWe provide a class of nondilatonic solutions to the NS-NS sector of stringtheory. The solutions consist of products of Ricci-parallelizable spaces withadjusted radii. A representative of this class, AdS_3 x S^7, is presented indetail. Some comments on possible brane connections are made.
