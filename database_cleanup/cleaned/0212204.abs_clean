We propose a simple conformal mechanics model which is classically equivalentto a charged massive particle propagating near the AdS_2\times S^2 horizon ofan extreme Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. The equivalence holds for anyfinite value of the black hole mass and with both the radial and angulardegrees of freedom of the particle taken into account. It is ensured by theexistence of a canonical transformation in the Hamiltonian formalism. Usingthis transformation, we construct the Hamiltonian of a N=4 superparticle onAdS_2\times S^2 background.
