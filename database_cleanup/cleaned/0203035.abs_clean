An iterative construction of higher order Einstein tensors for a maximallyGauss-Bonnet extended gravitational Lagrangian was introduced in a previouspaper. Here the formalism is extended to non-factorisable metrics in arbitrary($d+1$) dimensions in the presence of superposed Gauss-Bonnet terms. Such ageneralisation turns out to be remarkably convenient and elegant. Having thusobtained the variational equations we first construct bulk solutions, withnonzero and zero cosmological constant. It is also pointed out that in theabsence of Gauss-Bonnet terms a Schwarzschild type solution can be obtained inthe non-factorisable case. Two positive tension branes are then inserted andtheir tensions are obtained in terms of parameters in the warp factor.Relations to recent studies of several authors are pointed out.
