Title: Non-critical $d=2$ Gravities and Integrable Models

Comments: 20 pages, Plain TeX

We review the origin of anomaly-induced dynamics in theories of $d=2$ gravityfrom a BRST viewpoint and show how quantum canonical transformations may beused to solve the resulting Liouville or Toda models for the anomalous modes.
