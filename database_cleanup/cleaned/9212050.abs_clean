The solvable $sl(n)$-chiral Potts model can be interpreted as athree-dimensional lattice model with local interactions. To within a minormodification of the boundary conditions it is an Ising type model on the bodycentered cubic lattice with two- and three-spin interactions. The correspondinglocal Boltzmann weights obey a number of simple relations, including arestricted star-triangle relation, which is a modified version of thewell-known star-triangle relation appearing in two-dimensional models. We showthat these relations lead to remarkable symmetry properties of the Boltzmannweight function of an elementary cube of the lattice, related to spatialsymmetry group of the cubic lattice. These symmetry properties allow one toprove the commutativity of the row-to-row transfer matrices, bypassing thetetrahedron relation. The partition function per site for the infinite latticeis calculated exactly.
