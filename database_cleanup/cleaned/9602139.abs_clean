The exact parity model (EPM) is a simple extension of the Standard Modelwhich reinstates parity invariance as an unbroken symmetry of nature. Themirror matter sector of the model can interact with ordinary matter throughgauge boson mixing, Higgs boson mixing and, if neutrinos are massive, throughneutrino mixing. The last effect has experimental support through the observedsolar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies. In this paper we show that the exactparity model can be formulated in a quaternionic framework. This suggests thatthe idea of mirror matter and exact parity may have profound implications forthe mathematical formulation of quantum theory.
