It is shown that all four superintegrable quantum systems on the Euclideanplane possess the same underlying hidden algebra $sl(3)$. The gauge-rotatedHamiltonians, as well as their integrals of motion, once rewritten inappropriate coordinates, preserve a flag of polynomials. This flag correspondsto highest-weight finite-dimensional representations of the $sl(3)$-algebra,realized by first order differential operators.
