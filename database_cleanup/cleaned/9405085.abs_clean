The relation between solutions to Helmholtz's equation on the sphere$S^{n-1}$ and the $[{\gr sl}(2)]^n$ Gaudin spin chain is clarified. The jointeigenfuctions of the Laplacian and a complete set of commuting second orderoperators suggested by the $R$--matrix approach to integrable systems, based onthe loop algebra $\wt{sl}(2)_R$, are found in terms of homogeneous polynomialsin the ambient space. The relation of this method of determining a basis ofharmonic functions on $S^{n-1}$ to the Bethe ansatz approach to integrablesystems is explained.
