For the so-called source-probe configuration in Matrix theory, we prove thea quantum-corrected effective SUSY transformation operator expandable in powersof the coupling constant $g$ as $\delta = \sum_{n\ge 0} g^{2n} \delta^{(n)}$,where $\delta^{(0)}$ is of the tree-level form. Then, apart from an overallconstant, the SUSY Ward identity $\delta \Gamma=0$ determines the off-shelleffective action $\Gamma$ uniquely to arbitrary order of perturbation theory,provided that the $ SO(9)$ symmetry is preserved. Our proof depends only on theproperties of the tree-level SUSY transformation laws and does not require thedetailed knowledge of quantum corrections.
