The perturbative renormalization group(RG) equation is applied to resumdivergent series of perturbative wave functions of quantum anharmonicoscillator. It is found that the resummed series gives the cumulant of thenaive perturbation series. It is shown that a reorganization of the resummedseries reproduce the correct asymptotic form of the wave function at $x\to\infty$ when the perturbation expansion is stopped at the fourth order. A briefcomment is given on the relation between the present method and thedelta-expansion method, which is based on a kind of a nonperturbative RGequation.
