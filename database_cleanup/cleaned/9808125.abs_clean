Using a six-orientifold, fourbranes and four fivebranes in type IIA stringtheory we construct $\mathcal{N}$=1 supersymmetric gauge theories in fourdimensions with product group $SU(M)\times SO(N)$ or $SU(M)\times Sp(2N)$, abifundamental flavor and quarks. We obtain the Seiberg dual for these theoriesand rederive it via branes. To obtain the complete dual group via branes wehave to add semi-infinite fourbranes. We propose that the theory derived frombranes has a meson deformation switched on. This deformation implies higgsingin the dual theory. The addition of the semi-infinite fourbranes compensatesthis effect.
