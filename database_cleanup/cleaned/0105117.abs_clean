Higher derivative bulk gravity (without Riemann tensor square term) admitsAdS-Schwarzschild black hole as exact solution. It is shown that induced branegeometry on such background is open, flat or closed FRW radiation dominatedUniverse. Higher derivative terms contributions appear in the Hawkingtemperature, entropy and Hubble parameter via the redefinition of 5-dimensionalgravitational constant and AdS scale parameter. These higher derivative termsdo not destroy the AdS-dual description of radiation represented bystrongly-coupled CFT. Cardy-Verlinde formula which expresses cosmologicalentropy as square root from other parameters and entropies is derived in $R^2$gravity. The corresponding cosmological entropy bounds are briefly discussed.
