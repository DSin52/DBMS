We discuss the cosmology of a 3-brane embedded in a 5D bulk space-time with acosmological constant when an intrinsic curvature Ricci scalar is included inthe brane action. After deriving the `brane-Friedmann' equations for a Z_2symmetrical metric, we focus on the case of a Minkowski bulk. We show thatthere exist two classes of solutions, close to the usualFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmology for small enough Hubble radii.When the Hubble radius gets larger one either has a transition to a fully 5Dregime or to a self-inflationary solution which produces a late acceleratedexpansion. We also compare our results with a perturbative approach andeventually discuss the embedding of the brane into the Minkowski space-time.This latter part of our discussion also applies when no intrinsic curvatureterm is included.
