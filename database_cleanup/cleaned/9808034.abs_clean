The elucidation of the properties of the instantons in the topologicallytrivial sector has been a long-standing puzzle. Here we claim that theproperties can be summarized in terms of the geometrical structure in theconfiguration space, the valley. The evidence for this claim is presented invarious ways. The conventional perturbation theory and the non-perturbativecalculation are unified, and the ambiguity of the Borel transform of theperturbation series is removed. A `proof' of Bogomolny's ``trick'' ispresented, which enables us to go beyond the dilute-gas approximation. Theprediction of the large order behavior of the perturbation theory is confirmedby explicit calculations, in some cases to the 478-th order. A new type ofsupersymmetry is found as a by-product, and our result is shown to beconsistent with the non-renormalization theorem. The prediction of the energylevels is confirmed with numerical solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation.
