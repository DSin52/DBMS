The one-loop effective potential for a scalar field defined on an ultrastaticspace-time whose spatial part is a compact hyperbolic manifold, is studiedusing zeta-function regularization for the one-loop effective action. Otherpossible regularizations are discussed in detail. The renormalization groupequations are derived and their connection with the conformal anomaly ispointed out. The symmetry breaking and the topological mass generation are alsodiscussed.
