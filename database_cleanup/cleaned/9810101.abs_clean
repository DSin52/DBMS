Title: Comment on "The relativistic particle with curvature and torsion of

world trajectory"Comments: 5 pages, LaTeX

Gogilidze and Surovtsev have claimed recently (hep-th/9809191) that thetachyonic sector can be removed from the spectrum of the relativistic particlewith curvature and torsion by a proper gauge choice. We show that the mass-spindependence obtained by them is incorrect and point out that their gauge surfacedoes not cross all the gauge orbits. We discuss the nature of the tachyonicsector of the model and argue why it cannot be removed by any gauge fixingprocedure.
