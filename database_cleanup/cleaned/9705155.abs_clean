After a summary of a recently proposed new type of instant form of dynamics(the Wigner-covariant rest-frame instant form), the reduced Hamilton equationsin the covariant rest-frame Coulomb gauge for the isolated system of N scalarparticles with pseudoclassical Grassmann-valued electric charges plus theelectromagnetic field are studied. The Lienard-Wiechert potentials of theparticles are evaluated and it is shown how the causality problems of theAbraham-Lorentz-Dirac equation are solved at the pseudoclassical level. Then,the covariant rest-frame description of scalar electrodynamics is given.Applying to it the Feshbach-Villars formalism, the connection with the particleplus electromagnetic field system is found.
