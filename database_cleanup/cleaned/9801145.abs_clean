It is shown that the five-dimensional anti-de Sitter black hole is asupersymmetric solution of the low-energy field equations of type IIB stringtheory compactified on an Einstein space. A statistical interpretation of themass dependence of the entropy can be obtained from considerations of thethree-dimensional BTZ black hole.
