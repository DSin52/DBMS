We investigate the equivalence between Thirring model and sine-Gordon modelin the chirally broken phase of the Thirring model. This is unlike all otheravailable approaches where the fermion fields of the Thirring model werequantized in the chiral symmetric phase. In the path integral approach we showthat the bosonized version of the massless Thirring model is described by aquantum field theory of a massless scalar field and exactly solvable, and themassive Thirring model bosonizes to the sine-Gordon model with a new relationbetween coupling constants. We show that the non-perturbative vacuum of thechirally broken phase in the massless Thirring model can be described incomplete analogy with the BCS ground state of superconductivity. TheMermin-Wagner theorem and Coleman's statement concerning the absence ofGoldstone bosons in the 1+1-dimensional quantum field theories are discussed.We investigate the current algebra in the massless Thirring model and give anew value of the Schwinger term. We show that the topological current in thesine-Gordon model coincides with the Noether current responsible for theconservation of the fermion number in the Thirring model. This allows toidentify the topological charge in the sine-Gordon model with the fermionnumber.
