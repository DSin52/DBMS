We investigate non-abelian gaugings of WZNW models. When the gauged group issemisimple we are able to present exact formulae for the dual conformal fieldtheory, for all values of the level $k$. The results are then applied tonon-abelian target space duality in string theory, showing that the standardformulae are quantum mechanically well defined in the low energy limit if thegauged group is semisimple.
