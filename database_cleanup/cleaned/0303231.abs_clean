Title: D-branes in lens spaces

Authors: P. Bordalo and A. Wurtz

Comments: 13 pages

We realize the CFT with target a lens space SU(2)/Z_l as a simple currentconstruction. This allows us to compute the boundary states and the annulicoefficients, and in particular to study the B-type branes, in purely algebraicterms. Several issues, like the appearance of fractional branes and symmetrybreaking boundary conditions, can be addressed more directly in this approachthan in a more geometric treatment.
