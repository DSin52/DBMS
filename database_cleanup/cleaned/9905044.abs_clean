aspect is discussed. some terminology chage, and some references addedBy a toroidal compactification with a vortex like configuration of tachyonfields, the unoriented bosonic string in 26 dimensions becomes equivalent to 10dimensional string theory with gauge group $SO(32)\times G$ where $G$ has rank16. The reduction from SO(8192) to SO(32) is induced by the action ofnon-abelian Wilson lines which twists the tachyon. The additional enhancedgauge symmetry $G$ appears from closed string sector by Frenkel-Kacconstruction. We also examine the consistency of the tachyon condensation.
