We study the conditions under which a symmetry is spontaneously broken in theWilson renormalization group formulation. Both for a global and local symmetry,the result is that in perturbation theory one has to perform a fine tuning ofthe boundary conditions for the flow of the relevant couplings. We consider indetail the discrete $Z_2$ case and the Abelian Higgs model.
