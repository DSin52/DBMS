Title: On Gauge Invariant Wilsonian Flows

Authors: Daniel F. Litim, Jan M. Pawlowski

Comments: 18 pages, to be published in the proceedings of the Faro workshop on

the Exact Renormalisation Group, September 1998We investigate non-Abelian gauge theories within a Wilsonian Renormalisationinvariant flow, despite the fact that a Wilsonian coarse-graining seems to beincompatible with gauge invariance? We discuss the possible options in the caseof quantum fluctuations, and argue that for thermal fluctuations a fully gaugeinvariant implementation can be obtained.
