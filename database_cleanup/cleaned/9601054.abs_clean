Over the last two years, the canonical approach to quantum gravity based onconnections and triads has been put on a firm mathematical footing through thedevelopment and application of a new functional calculus on the space of gaugeequivalent connections. This calculus does not use any background fields (suchas a metric) and is thus well-suited to a fully non-perturbative treatment ofquantum gravity. Using this framework, quantum geometry is examined.Fundamental excitations turn out to be one-dimensional, rather like polymers.Geometrical observables such as areas of surfaces and volumes of regions havepurely discrete spectra. Continuum picture arises only upon coarse graining ofsuitable semi-classical states. Next, regulated quantum diffeomorphismconstraints can be imposed in an anomaly-free fashion and the space ofsolutions can be given a natural Hilbert space structure. Progress has alsobeen made on the quantum Hamiltonian constraint in a number of directions. Inparticular, there is a recent approach based on a generalized Wicktransformation which maps solutions to the Euclidean quantum constraints tothose of the Lorentzian theory. These developments are summarized. Emphasis ison conveying the underlying ideas and overall pictures rather than technicaldetails.
