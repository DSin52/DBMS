We present a formulation of the stationary 5-dimensional Einstein-Kalb-Ramondtheory as a double Ernst system, apply the so-called normalized Harrisontransformation on a generic solution of this double system and compute thefield content of the generated charged configuration for the special case whenthe starting Ernst potentials correspond to a pair of interacting Kerr blackholes.
