In this paper we reconsider, for N=8 supergravity, the problem of gauging themost general electric subgroup.We show that admissible theories are fully characterized by a singlealgebraic equation to be satisfied by the embedding of the gauge group G withinthe electric subalgebra SL(8,\IR) of E_{7(7)}. The complete set of solutions tothis equation contains 36 parameters. Modding by the action of SL(8,\IR)conjugations that yield equivalent theories all continuous parameters areeliminated except for an overall coupling constant and we obtain a discrete setof orbits. This set is in one--to--one correspondence with 36 Lie subalgebrasof SL(8,\IR), corresponding to all possible real forms of the SO(8) Lie algebraplus a set of contractions thereof. By means of our analysis we establish thetheorem that the N=8 gaugings constructed by Hull in the middle eightiesconstitute the exhaustive set of models. As a corollary we show that thereexists a unique 7--dimensional abelian gauging. The corresponding abelianalgebra is not contained in the maximal abelian ideal of the solvable Liealgebra generating the scalar manifold E_{7(7)}/SU(8).
