We discuss dilatonic gravity (bulk theory) from the point of view of(generalized) AdS/CFT correspondence. Self-consistent dilatonic background isconsidered. It may be understood as two boundaries space where AdS boundaryappears as infinite boundary and new (singular) boundary occurs at shortdistances. The two-point correlation function and conformal dimension forminimal and dilaton coupled scalar are found. Even for minimal scalar, theconformal dimension is found to be different on above two boundaries. Hence,new CFT appears in AdS/CFT correspondence at short distances. AdS/CFTcorrespondence may be understood as interpolating bulk theory between twodifferent CFTs.
