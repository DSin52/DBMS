Different aspects of the Verlinde and Verlinde relation between high-energyeffective scattering in QCD and a two-dimensional sigma-model are discussed.Starting from a lattice version of the truncated 4-dimensional Yang-Millsaction we derive an effective theory with non-trivial longitudinal dynamicswhich has a form of the lattice two-dimensional chiral field model withnon-trivial boundary conditions. To get quantum corrections coming fromnon-trivial longitudinal dynamics to transversal high-energy effective actionone has to solve the two-dimensional chiral field model with non-trivialboundary conditions. We do this within an approximation scheme which takes intoaccount one-dimensional excitations. Contributions of the one-dimensionalexcitations to quantum corrections for the high-energy effective action arecalculated in the large N limit using the character expansion method.
