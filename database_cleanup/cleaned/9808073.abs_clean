As shown in hep-th/9709081, non-BPS saturated solitons play an important rolein the duality transformations of N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories. Inparticular, a massive spinor in an SO(N) gauge theory with massless matter inthe vector representation appears in the dual description as a magneticmonopole with a Z_2 charge. This claim is supported by numerous tests,including detailed matching of flavor quantum numbers. This fact makes itpossible to test the phase of an SO(N) gauge theory using massive spinors as aprobe. It is thereby shown explicitly that the free magnetic phase whichappears in supersymmetric theories is a non-confining phase. A fullynon-abelian version of the Dual Meissner effect is also exhibited, in which themonopoles are confined by non-BPS string solitons with Z_2 charges.
