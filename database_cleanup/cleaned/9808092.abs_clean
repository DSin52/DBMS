The asymptotic behaviour of the vacuum energy density, ${\bar E}(\theta)$, at$\theta \ra \pm i \infty$ is found out. A new interpretation and a qualitativediscussion of the ${\bar E}(\theta)$ behaviour are presented. It is emphasizedthat the vacuum is doubly degenerate at $\theta=\pi$, and the quark electricstring can terminate on the domain wall interpolating between these two vacua.The potential of the monopole field condensing in the Yang-Mills vacuum isobtained.
