A non supersymmetric string background, directly derived from the string softdilaton theorem, is used to compute, in the semiclassical approximation, theexpectation value of Wilson loops in static gauge. The resulting potentialshares common features with the one obtained through Schwarzschild-anti deSitter spacetime metrics. In particular a linear confining potential appearsnaturally.
