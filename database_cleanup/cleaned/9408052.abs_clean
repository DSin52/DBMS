The Hamiltonians of $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ gauge theories in 3+1 dimensions canbe expressed in terms of gauge invariant spatial geometric variables, i.e.,metrics, connections and curvature tensors which are simple local functions ofthe non-Abelian electric field. The transformed Hamiltonians are local. Newresults from the same procedure applied to the $SU(2)$ gauge theory in 2+1dimensions are also given.
