We propose descriptions of interacting (1,0) supersymmetric theories withoutgravity in six dimensions in the infinite momentum frame. They are based on thelarge N limit of quantum mechanics or 1+1 dimensional field theories with SO(N)gauge group and four supercharges. We argue that this formulation allows for aconcrete description of the chirality-changing phase transitions which connect(1,0) theories with different numbers of tensor multiplets.
