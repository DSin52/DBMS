The formalism of integrable mappings is applied to the problem ofconstructing hierarchies of $(1+2)$ dimensional integrable systems in the$(2|2)$ superspace. We find new supersymmetric integrable mappings andcorresponding to them new hierarchies of integrable systems which, at thereduction to the $(1|2)$ superspace, possess $N=2$ supersymmetry. The generalformulae obtained for the hierarchies are used to explicitly derive their firstnontrivial equations possessing a manifest $N=2$ supersymmetry. New bosonicsubstitutions and hierarchies are obtained from the supersymmetric counterpartsin the bosonic limit.
