We study the vacuum polarization of supersymmetric toroidal D-brane placed inthe constant electromagnetic field. Explicit calculation of the one-loopeffective potential is performed for membrane with constant magnetic orelectric background. We find the one-loop potentials vanish as the effect ofsupersymmetry,
