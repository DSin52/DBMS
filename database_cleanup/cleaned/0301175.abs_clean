SystemsAuthors: Min-Young Choi, Choonkyu Lee

Comments: 13 pages, 4 figures

For a quantum mechanical system with broken supersymmetry, it is demonstratedthat reformulation of the problem as that of a (1+1)-D Dirac equation allows aneasy determination of the ground state if the corresponding energy eigenvalueis sufficiently small. A simple expression is derived for the approximateground state energy in an associated, well-separated, asymmetricdouble-well-type potential. Our discussion is also relevant for the analysis ofthe fermion bound state in the kink-antikink scalar background.
