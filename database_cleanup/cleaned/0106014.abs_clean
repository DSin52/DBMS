We consider configurations of D7-branes and whole and fractional D3-braneswith N=2 supersymmetry. On the supergravity side these have a warp factor,three-form flux and a nonconstant dilaton. We discuss general IIB solutions ofthis type and then obtain the specific solutions for the D7/D3 system. On thegauge side the D7-branes add matter in the fundamental representation of theD3-brane gauge theory. We find that the gauge and supergravity metrics onmoduli space agree. However, in many cases the supergravity curvature is largeeven when the gauge theory is strongly coupled. In these cases we argue thatthe useful supergravity dual must be a IIA configuration.
