sentence comment on a reference was amendedThis is the written version of lectures presented at Cargese 95. A newformulation for a ``restricted'' type of target space duality in classical twodimensional nonlinear sigma models is presented. The main idea is summarized byspace duality is to ``restricted'' target space duality. The target space isnot required to possess symmetry. These lectures only discuss the local theory.The restricted target space duality problem is identified with an interestingproblem in classical differential geometry.
