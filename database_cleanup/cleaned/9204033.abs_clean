We study the Quantum Field Theory of nonrelativistic bosons coupled to aChern--Simons gauge field at nonzero particle density. This field theory isrelevant to the study of anyon superconductors in which the anyons aredescribed as {\bf bosons} with a statistical interaction. We show that it ispossible to find a mean field solution to the equations of motion for thissystem which has some of the features of bose condensation. The mean fieldsolution consists of a lattice of vortices each carrying a single quantum ofstatistical magnetic flux. We speculate on the effects of the quantumcorrections to this mean field solution. We argue that the mean field solutionis only stable under quantum corrections if the Chern--Simons coefficient$N=2\pi\theta/g^2$ is an integer. Consequences for anyon superconductivity arepresented. A simple explanation for the Meissner effect in this system isdiscussed.
