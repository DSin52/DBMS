We study the three-pronged strings (three string junctions) from the point ofview of D-string worldsheet gauge theory. We justify interpreting kinksolutions in the 2-dimensional gauge theory as pronged strings by examining BPSenergy bounds obtained from this theory. When the ends of the pronged stringare on D3-branes, the configuration preserves 1/4 supersymmetry with BPSconditions including the Nahm equation. Using solutions of the Nahm equationexplicitly, we treat string junction configuration ending on the D3-branes fromthe viewpoint of the D-string. In particular, when two separated prongedstrings end on the same D3-branes, they interact with each other through theD3-branes and the resultant trajectories of three-pronged strings are found tobe curved non-trivially.
