We find the inconsistency of dimensional reduction and naive dimensionalregularization in their applications to Chern-Simons type gauge theories.Further we adopt a consistent dimensional regularization to investigate thequantum correction to non-Abelian Chern-Simons term coupled with fermionicmatter. Contrary to previous results, we find that not only the Chern-Simonscoefficient receives quantum correction from spinor fields, but the spinorfield also gets a finite quantum correction.
