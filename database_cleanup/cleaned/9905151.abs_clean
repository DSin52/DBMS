The general static solutions of the scalar field equation for the potential$V(\phi)= -1/2 M^2\phi^2 + \lambda/4 \phi^4$ are determined for a finite domainin $(1+1)$ dimensional space-time. A family of real solutions is described interms of Jacobi Elliptic Functions. We show that the vacuum-vacuum boundaryconditions can be reached by elliptic cn-type solutions in a finite domain,such as of the Kink, for which they are imposed at infinity. We proveduniqueness for elliptic sn-type solutions satisfying Dirichlet boundaryconditions in a finite interval (box) as well the existence of a minimal masscorresponding to these solutions in a box. We define expressions for the``topological charge'', ``total energy'' (or classical mass) and ``energydensity'' for elliptic sn-type solutions in a finite domain. For large lengthof the box the conserved charge, classical mass and energy density of the Kinkare recovered. Also, we have shown that using periodic boundary conditions theresults are the same as in the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions. In thecase of anti-periodic boundary conditions all elliptic sn-type solutions areallowed.
