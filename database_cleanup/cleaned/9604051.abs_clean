We discuss the $N=2$ $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory coupled with a massive matterin the weak coupling. In particular, we obtain the instanton expansion of itsprepotential. Instanton contributions in the mass-less limit are completelyreproduced. We study also the double scaling limit of this massive theory andfind that the prepotential with instanton corrections in the double scalinglimit coincides with that of $N=2$ $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory without matter.
