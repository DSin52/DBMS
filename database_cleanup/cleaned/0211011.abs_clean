We systematically investigate open strings in the plane wave background oftype IIB string theory. We carefully analyze possible boundary conditions foropen strings and find static as well as time-dependent branes. The branes fallinto equivalence classes depending on whether they are related by the action oftarget space isometries. In particular static branes localized at the origin oftransverse space and certain time-dependent branes fall into the sameequivalence class. We analyze thoroughly the symmetries of all branes wediscuss. Apart from symmetries descending from target space isometries, theworldsheet action being free admits a countably infinite number of other globalworldsheet symmetries. We find that one can use such worldsheet symmetries torestore seemingly broken target space symmetries. In particular, we show thatD-branes localized at arbitrary constant positions which were thought to be 1/4supersymmetric in fact have sixteen supercharges whilst D-branes which werethought to be non-supersymmetric have eight supercharges. We discuss in detailthe quantization in all cases.
