Making use of inverse Mellin transform techniques for analyticalcontinuation, an elegant proof and an extension of the zeta functionregularization theorem is obtained. No series commutations are involved in theprocedure; nevertheless the result is naturally split into the same threecontributions of very different nature, i.e. the series of Riemann zetafunctions and the power and negative exponentially behaved functions,respectively, well known from the original proof. The new theorem deals equallywell with elliptic differential operators whose spectrum is not explicitlyknown. Rigorous results on the asymptoticity of the outcoming series are given,together with some specific examples. Exact analytical formulas, simplifyingapproximations and numerical estimates for the last of the three contributions(the most difficult to handle) are obtained. As an application of the method,the summation of the series which appear in the analytic computation (fordifferent ranges of temperature) of the partition function of the stringPERFORMED.
