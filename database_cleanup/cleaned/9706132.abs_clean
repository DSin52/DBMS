This is an expanded version of the notes to a course taught by the firstauthor at the 1995 Les Houches Summer School. Constraints on a tentativereconciliation of quantum theory and general relativity are reviewed. It isexplained what supersymmetric quantum theory teaches us about differentialtopology and geometry. Non-commutative differential topology and geometry aredeveloped in some detail. As an example, the non-commutative torus is studied.An introduction to string theory and $M$(atrix) models is provided, and it isoutlined how tools of non-commutative geometry can be used to explore thegeometry of string theory and conformal field theory.
