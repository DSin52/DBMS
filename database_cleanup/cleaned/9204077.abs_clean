The signatures of the inner product matrices on a Lie algebra's highestweight representation are encoded in the representation's signature character.We show that the signature characters of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra'shighest weight representations obey simple difference equations that have aunique solution once appropriate boundary conditions are imposed. We use theseresults to derive the signature characters of all $A_2$ and $B_2$ highestweight representations. Our results extend, and explain, signature patternsanalogous to those observed by Friedan, Qiu and Shenker in the Virasoroalgebra's representation theory.
