The implications of gauging the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten (WZNW) model usingthe Gauss decomposition of the group elements are explored. We show that,contrary to standard gauging of WZNW models, this gauging is carried out byminimally coupling the gauge fields. We find that this gauging, in the case ofgauging an abelian vector subgroup, differs from the standard one by termsproportional to the field strength of the gauge fields. We prove that gaugingan abelian vector subgroup does not have a nonlinear sigma modelinterpretation. This is because the target-space metric resulting from theintegration over the gauge fields is degenerate. We demonstrate, however, thatthis kind of gauging has a natural interpretation in terms of Wakimotovariables.
