Title: Essential and inessential features of Hawking radiation

Authors: Matt Visser (Washington University in Saint Louis)

Comments: JHEP style; 17 pages

There are numerous derivations of the Hawking effect available in theliterature. They emphasise different features of the process, and sometimesmake markedly different physical assumptions. This article presents a``minimalist'' argument, and strips the derivation of as much excess baggage aspossible. All that is really necessary is quantum physics plus a slowlyevolving future apparent horizon (*not* an event horizon). In particular,neither the Einstein equations nor Bekenstein entropy are necessary (nor evenuseful) in deriving Hawking radiation.
