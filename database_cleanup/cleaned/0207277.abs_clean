Contemporary Problems in Mathematical Physics, Cotonou, Republic of Benin, 15pagesBased on the physical projector approach, a nonpertubative quantization ofthe massless Schwinger model is considered which does not require any gaugefixing. The spectrum of physical states, readily identified following adiagonalization of the operator algebra, is that of a massive pseudoscalarfield, namely the electric field having acquired a mass proportional to thegauge coupling constant. The physical spectrum need not be identified withconfined bound fermion-antifermion pairs, an interpretation which one isotherwise led to given whatever gauge fixing procedure but which is not void ofgauge fixing artefacts.
