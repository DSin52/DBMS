Title: The Low-Energy Dynamics of N=1 SUSY Gauge Theories with Small Matter

ContentComments: Talk presented at the XXXIIIrd Rencontres de Moriond

Interactions and Unified Theories, Les Arcs, France, March 14-21 1998; 6pagesWe describe the low-energy dynamics of N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories withthe Dynkin index of matter fields less than or equal to the Dynkin index of theadjoint plus two. We explain what kinds of nonperturbative phenomena take placein this class of supersymmetric gauge theories.
