We recalculate the amplitude for photon splitting in a strong magnetic fieldbelow the pair production threshold, using the worldline path integral variantof the Bern--Kosower formalism. Numerical comparison (using programs that wehave made available for public access on the Internet) shows that the resultsof the recalculation are identical to the earlier calculations of Adler andlater of Stoneham, and to the recent recalculation by Baier, Milstein, andShaisultanov.
