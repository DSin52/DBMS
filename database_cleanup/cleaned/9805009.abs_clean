130-139The Hamiltonian formulation for the mechanical systems withreparametrization-invariant Lagrangians, depending on the worldline externalcurvatures is given, which is based on the use of moving frame.A complete sets of constraints are found for the Lagrangians with quadraticdependence on curvatures, for the lagrangians, proportional to an arbitrarycurvature, and for the Lagrangians, linear on the first and second curvatures.
