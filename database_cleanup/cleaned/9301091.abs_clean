% A new, formal, non-combinatorial approach to invariants of %three-dimensional manifolds of Reshetikhin, Turaev and % Witten in theframework of non-perturbative topological % quantum Chern-Simons theory,corresponding to an arbitrary % compact simple Lie group, is presented. Adirect % implementation of surgery instructions in the context of % quantumfield theory is proposed. An explicit form of the % specialization of theinvariant to the group SU(2) is % derived, and shown to agree with the result81T13.
