The analysis of D-branes in coset models G/H provides a natural extension ofrecent studies on branes in WZW-theory and it has various interestingapplications to physically relevant models. In this work we develop a reductionprocedure that allows to construct the non-commutative gauge theories whichgovern the dynamics of branes in G/H. We obtain a large class of solutions andinterprete the associated condensation processes geometrically. The latter areused to propose conservation laws for the dynamics of branes in coset models atlarge level k. In super-symmetric theories, conserved charges are argued totake their values in the representation ring of the denominator theory.Finally, we apply the general results to study boundary fixed points in twoexamples, namely for parafermions and minimal models.
