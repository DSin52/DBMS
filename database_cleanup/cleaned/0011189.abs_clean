By making use of current-algebra Ward identities we study renormalization ofgeneral anisotropic current-current interactions in 2D. We obtain a set ofalgebraic conditions that ensure the renormalizability of the theory to allorders. In a certain minimal prescription we compute the beta function to allorders.
