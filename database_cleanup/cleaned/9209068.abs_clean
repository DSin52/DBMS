It is shown that the asymmetric chiral gauging of the WZW models give rise toconsistent string backgrounds. The target space structure of the ${[{SL(2,\Re)/{SO(1,1)}}]}_L \bigotimes {[{SL(2,\Re)/U(1)}]}_R$ model is analyzed and thepresence of a hidden isometry in this background is demonstrated. A nonlinearcoordinate transformation is obtained which transforms the asymmetric model tothe symmetric one, analyzed recently by two of the present authors.
