Representations by means of path integrals are used to find spinor andisospinor structure of relativistic particle propagators in external fields.For Dirac propagator in an external electromagnetic field all grassmannianintegrations are performed and a general result is presented via a bosonic pathintegral. The spinor structure of the integrand is given explicitly by itsdecomposition in the independent $\gamma$-matrix structures. Similar techniqueis used to get the isospinor structure of the scalar particle propagator in anexternal non-Abelian field.
