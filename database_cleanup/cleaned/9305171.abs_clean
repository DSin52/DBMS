SystemsWe consider the N to infinity limits of the N-state chiral Potts model. Wefind new weights that satisfy the star-triangle relations with spin variableseither taking all the integer values or having values from a continousinterval. The models provide chiral generalizations of Zamolodchikov's FishnetModel.
