We introduce the notion of a topological symmetry as a quantum mechanicalsymmetry involving a certain topological invariant. We obtain the underlyingalgebraic structure of the Z_2-graded uniform topological symmetries of type(1,1) and (2,1). This leads to a novel derivation of the algebras ofsupersymmetry and $p=2$ parasupersummetry.
