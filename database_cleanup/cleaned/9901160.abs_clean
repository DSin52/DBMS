We consider a model for tensionless (null) super p-branes with N chiralsupersymmetries in ten dimensional flat space-time. After establishing thesymmetries of the action, we give the general solution of the classicalequations of motion in a particular gauge. In the case of a null superstring(p=1) we find the general solution in an arbitrary gauge. Then, using aharmonic superspace approach, the initial algebra of first and second classconstraints is converted into an algebra of Lorentz-covariant, BFV-irreducible,first class constraints only. The corresponding BRST charge is as for a firstrank dynamical system.
