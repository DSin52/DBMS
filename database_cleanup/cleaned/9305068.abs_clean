It is argued that the low-energy dynamics of $k$ monopoles in N=2supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory are determined by an N=4 supersymmetricquantum mechanics based on the moduli space of $k$ static monople solutions.This generalises Manton's ``geodesic approximation" for studying the low-energydynamics of (bosonic) BPS monopoles. We discuss some aspects of thequantisation and in particular argue that dolbeault cohomology classes of themoduli space are related to bound states of the full quantum field theory.
