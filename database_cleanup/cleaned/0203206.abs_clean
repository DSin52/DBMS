We show that N=8 spontaneously broken supergravity in four dimensionsobtained by Scherk-Schwarz generalized dimensional reduction can be obtainedfrom a pure four dimensional perspective by gauging a suitable electricsubgroup of E_{7,7}. Owing to the fact that there are non isomorphic choices ofmaximal electric subgroups of the U-duality group their gaugings give rise toinequivalent theories. This in particular shows that the Scherk-Schwarzgaugings do not fall in previous classifications of possible gauged N=8supergravities. Gauging of flat groups appear in many examples of stringcompactifications in presence of brane fluxes.
