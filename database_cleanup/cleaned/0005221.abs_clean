We apply the ADHM instanton construction to SU(2) gauge theory on T^n xR^(4-n)for n=1,2,3,4. To do this we regard instantons on T^n x R^(4-n) asperiodic (modulo gauge transformations) instantons on R^4. Since the R^4topological charge of such instantons is infinite the ADHM algebra takes placeon an infinite dimensional linear space. The ADHM matrix M is related to a Weyloperator (with a self-dual background) on the dual torus tilde T^n. Weconstruct the Weyl operator corresponding to the one-instantons on T^n xR^(4-n). In order to derive the self-dual potential on T^n x R^(4-n) it isnecessary to solve a specific Weyl equation. This is a variant of the Nahmtransformation. In the case n=2 (i.e. T^2 x R^2) we essentially have anAharonov Bohm problem on tilde T^2. In the one-instanton sector we find thatthe scale parameter, lambda, is bounded above, (lambda)^2 tv<4 pi, tv being thevolume of the dual torus tilde T^2.
