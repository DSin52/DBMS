We consider Standard Model fields living inside a thick four dimensional flatbrane embedded in a (possibly warped) five dimensional space-time and estimatethe electromagnetic corrections to the anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) of theelectron and muon by including virtual massive fermion and gauge boson states.Constraints on the mass of the ``excited'' states (or thickness of thebrane-world) are obtained.
