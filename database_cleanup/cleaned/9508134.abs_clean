Recently, it has been observed that a certain class of classical theorieswith constraints can be quantized by a mathematical procedure known as Rieffelinduction. After a short exposition of this idea, we apply the new quantizationtheory to the Stueckelberg-Kibble model. We explicitly construct the physicalstate space ${\cal H}_{phys}$, which carries a massive representation of thePoincar\'e group. The longitudinal one-particle component arises from aparticular Bogoliubov transformation of the five (unphysical) degrees offreedom one has started with. Our discussion exhibits the particular featuresof the proposed constrained quantization theory in great clarity.
