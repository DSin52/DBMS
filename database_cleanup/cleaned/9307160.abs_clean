We investigate two dimensional supergravity theories, which can be built froma topological and gauge invariant action defined on an ordinary surface. Weconcentrate on four models. The first model is the $N=1$ supersymmetricextension of Jackiw-Teiltelboim model presented by Chamseddine in a superspaceformalism. We complement the proof of Montano, Aoaki, and Sonnenschein thatthis extension is topological and gauge invariant, based on the graded deSitter algebra. Not only do the equation of motions correspond to thesupergravity ones and gauge transformations encompass local supersymmetries,but also we identify the $\int \langle \eta, F\rangle$-theory with thesuperfield formalism action written by Chamseddine. Next, we show that the$N=1$ supersymmetric extension of string inspired two dimensional dilatongravity put forward by Park and Strominger is a theory that satisfies anon-vanishing curvature condition and cannot be written as a $\int\langle\eta,F\rangle$-theory. As an alternative, we propose two examples oftopological and gauge invariant theories that are based on graded extension ofthe extended Poincar\'e algebra and satisfy a vanishing curvature condition.Both models are interpreted as supersymmetric extensions of the string inspireddilaton gravity.
