We give an Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theory construction of the bundle offermionic Fock spaces parametrized by vector potentials in odd space dimensionsand prove that this leads in a simple manner to the known Schwinger terms(Faddeev-Mickelsson cocycle) for the gauge group action. We relate the APSconstruction to the bundle gerbe approach discussed recently by Carey andMurray, including an explicit computation of the Dixmier-Douady class. Anadvantage of our method is that it can be applied whenever one has a form ofthe APS theorem at hand, as in the case of fermions in an externalgravitational field.
