Title: Colored Vertex Models, Colored IRF Models and Invariants of Trivalent

Colored GraphsAuthors: Tetsuo Deguchi and Yasuhiro Akutsu

Comments: 39 pages, January 1992

We present formulas for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and the Racahcoefficients for the root of unity representations ($N$-dimensionalrepresentations with $q^{2N}=1$) of $U_q(sl(2))$. We discuss colored vertexmodels and colored IRF (Interaction Round a Face) models from the colorrepresentations of $U_q(sl(2))$. We construct invariants of trivalent coloredoriented framed graphs from color representations of $U_q(sl(2))$.
