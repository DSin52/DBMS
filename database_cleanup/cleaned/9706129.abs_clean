We calculate the heat-kernel coefficients, up to $a_2$, for a U(1) bundle onthe 4-Ball for boundary conditions which are such that the normal derivative ofthe field at the boundary is related to a first-order operator in boundaryderivatives acting on the field. The results are used to place restrictions onthe general forms of the coefficients. In the specific case considered, therecan be a breakdown of ellipticity.
