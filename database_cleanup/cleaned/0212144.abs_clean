Compactifying a higher-dimensional theory defined in R^{1,3+n} on ann-dimensional manifold {\cal M} results in a spectrum of four-dimensional(bosonic) fields with masses m^2_i = \lambda_i, where - \lambda_i are theeigenvalues of the Laplacian on the compact manifold. The question we addressfour dimensions, what can we say about the size and shape (i.e. the topologyand the metric) of the compact manifold? We present some examples ofisospectral manifolds (i.e., different manifolds which give rise to the sameKaluza-Klein mass spectrum). Some of these examples are Ricci-flat, complex andK\"{a}hler and so they are isospectral backgrounds for string theory. Utilizingresults from finite spectral geometry, we also discuss the accuracy ofreconstructing the properties of the compact manifold (e.g., its dimension,volume, and curvature etc) from measuring the masses of only a finite number ofKaluza-Klein modes.
