In this paper we investigate the form of calibrated M5-branes in the presenceof a nonvanishing 3-form field H. We discuss the influence of the H-field onthe deformation of supersymmetric n-cycles (in particular SLAG submanifolds inR^n). In addition we argue for a construction which relates calibratedM5-branes of different curved dimensions to each other.
