Seiberg-Witten maps and a recently proposed construction of noncommutativeYang-Mills theories (with matter fields) for arbitrary gauge groups arereformulated so that their existence to all orders is manifest. The ambiguitiesof the construction which originate from the freedom in the Seiberg-Witten mapare discussed with regard to the question whether they can lead to inequivalentmodels, i.e., models not related by field redefinitions.
