We investigate various aspects of the plane wave geometries obtained fromD1/D5-brane system. We study the effect of Hopf-duality on the supersymmetriespreserved by the Penrose limit of $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ geometry. Intype-IIB case, we first show that the Penrose limit makes the size of the`would-be' internal torus comparable to that of the other directions. Based onthis observation, we consider, in taking the Penrose limit, the generalizationof the null geodesic to incorporate the tilted direction between the equator of$S^3$ and one of the torus directions. For generic values of the tilting angle,supersymmetries are not preserved. When the limit is taken along the torusdirection, 16 supersymmetries are preserved. For the ordinary Penrose limit, 16generic and 8 `supernumerary' supersymmetries are observed. In the Penroselimit of Hopf-dualized type-IIA geometry, only 4 supersymmetries are preserved.We classify all the Killing spinors according to their periodic propertiesalong some relevant coordinates.
