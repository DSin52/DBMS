Abelian potentials of pointlike moving sources are obtained from thenonstandard theory of Yang--Mills field. They are used for the construction ofthe time-symmetric and time-asymmetric Fokker-type action integrals describingthe dynamics of two-particle system with confinement interaction. Thetime-asymmetric model is reformulated in the framework of the Hamiltonianformalism. The corresponding two-body problem is reduced to quadratures. Thebehaviour of Regge trajectories is estimated within the semiclassicalconsideration.
