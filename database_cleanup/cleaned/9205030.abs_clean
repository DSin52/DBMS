We study the BRST quantization of the 1+1 dimensional gravity model proposedby Jackiw and Teitelboim and also the topological gauge model which isequivalent to the gravity model at least classically. The gravity modelquantized in the light-cone gauge is found to be a free theory with a nilpotentBRST charge. We show also that there exist twisted N=2 superconformal algebrasin the Jackiw-Teitelboim's model as well as in the topological gauge model. Wediscuss the quantum equivalence between the gravity theory and the topologicalgauge theory. It is shown that these theories are indeed equivalent to eachother in the light-cone gauge.
