Title: Irregular Hamiltonian Systems

Authors: Olivera Miskovic and Jorge Zanelli

Comments: To appear in Proceedings of the XIII Chilean Symposium of Physics,

Concepcion, Chile, November 13-15 2002. LaTeX; 5 pages; no figuresHamiltonian systems with linearly dependent constraints (irregular systems),are classified according to their behavior in the vicinity of the constraintsurface. For these systems, the standard Dirac procedure is not directlyapplicable. However, Dirac's treatment can be slightly modified to obtain, insome cases, a Hamiltonian description completely equivalent to the Lagrangianone. A recipe to deal with the different cases is provided, along with a fewpedagogical examples.
