although logarithmic correlators do not appear in the minimal models butmodels which have nearly equal conformal dimensions can mimic logarithmicbehaviour, provided the Reynold number is large enough, a relationshipbetween the reynolds number and conformal dimensions is derivedJournal-ref: Nuovo Cim.

Noting that two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics can be modeled by conformalfield theory, we argue that when the Alf'ven effect is also taken into accountone is naturally lead to consider conformal field theories, which havelogarithmic terms in their correlation functions. We discuss the implicationsof such logarithmic terms in the context of magnetohydrodynamics, and derive arelationship between conformal dimensions of the velocity stream function, themagnetic flux function and the Reynolds number.
