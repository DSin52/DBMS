The standard model of electroweak interactions is minimally coupled togravity and the response of the spherically symmetric solutions -the sphaleronand the bisphaleron- to gravity is emphasized. For a given value of the Higgsmass $M_H$, several branches of solutions exist which terminate intocusp-catastrophy at some ($M_H$-depending) critical value of the parameter$\alpha$ defined by the ratio of the vector-boson mass to the Planck mass. Agiven branch either bifurcates from another one at an intermediate value of$\alpha$ or persists in the limit $\alpha \to 0$ where it terminates into aflat sphaleron or bisphaleron or into a Bartnik-McKinnon solution. Thesebifurcation patterns are studied in some details.
