We propose a picture, within the pre-big-bang approach, in which the universeemerges from a bath of plane gravitational and dilatonic waves. The wavesinteract gravitationally breaking the exact plane symmetry and lead genericallyto gravitational collapse resulting in a singularity with the Kasner-likestructure. The analytic relations between the Kasner exponents and the initialdata are explicitly evaluated and it is shown that pre-big-bang inflation mayoccur within a dense set of initial data. Finally, we argue that plane wavescarry zero gravitational entropy and thus are, from a thermodynamical point ofview, good candidates for the universe to emerge from.
