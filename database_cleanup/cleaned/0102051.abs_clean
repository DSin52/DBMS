The near-horizon properties of a black hole are studied within an algebraicframework, using a scalar field as a simple probe to analyze the geometry. Theoperator H governing the near-horizon dynamics of the scalar field contains aninverse square interaction term. It is shown that the operators appearing inthe corresponding algebraic description belong to the representation space ofthe Virasoro algebra. The operator H is studied using the representation theoryof the Virasoro algebra. We observe that the wave functions exhibit scalingbehaviour in a band-like region near the horizon of the black hole.
