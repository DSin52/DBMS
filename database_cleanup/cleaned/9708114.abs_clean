Gauhati (India, Dec.26'96-Jan.1'97))SystemsAn overview of the quantum integrable systems (QIS) is presented. Basicconcepts of the theory are highlighted stressing on the unifying algebraicproperties, which not only helps to generate systematically the representativeLax operators of different models, but also solves the related eigenvalueproblem in an almost model independent way. Difference between the approachesin the integrable ultralocal and nonultralocal quantum models are explained andthe interrelation between the QIS and other subjects are focussed on.
