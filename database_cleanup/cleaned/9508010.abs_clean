We develop a relativistic free wave equation on the complexified quaternions,linear in the derivatives. Even if the wave functions are only one-component,we show that four independent solutions, corresponding to those of the Diracequation, exist. A partial set of translations between complex and complexifiedquaternionic quantum mechanics may be defined.
