We obtain a new explicit expression for the noncommutative (star) product onthe fuzzy two-sphere which yields a unitary representation. This is done byconstructing a star product, $\star_{\lambda}$, for an arbitrary representationof SU(2) which depends on a continuous parameter $\lambda$ and searching forthe values of $\lambda$ which give unitary representations. We will find two$\lambda=\lambda^{(B)}_j =-1/(2j+2)$, where j is the spin of the representationof SU(2). At $\lambda = \lambda^{(A)}_j$ the new star product $\star_{\lambda}$has poles. To avoid the singularity the functions on the sphere must bespherical harmonics of order $\ell \leq 2j$ and then $\star_{\lambda}$ reducesto the star product $\star$ obtained by Preusnajder. The star product at$\lambda=\lambda^{(B)}_j$, to be denoted by $\bullet$, is new. In this case thefunctions on the fuzzy sphere do not need to be spherical harmonics of order$\ell \leq 2j$. Because in this case there is no cutoff on the order ofspherical harmonics, the degrees of freedom of the gauge fields on the fuzzysphere coincide with those on the commutative sphere. Therefore, although thefield theory on the fuzzy sphere is a system with finite degrees of freedom, wecan expect the existence of the Seiberg-Witten map between the noncommutativeand commutative descriptions of the gauge theory on the sphere. We will derivethe first few terms of the Seiberg-Witten map for the U(1) gauge theory on thefuzzy sphere by using power expansion around the commutative point $\lambda=0$.
