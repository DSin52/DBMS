In recent work, Dabholkar {\it et al.} constructed static ``cosmic string"solutions of the low-energy supergravity equations of the heterotic string, andconjectured that these solitons are actually exterior solutions for infinitelylong fundamental strings. In this paper we provide compelling dynamicalevidence to support this conjecture by computing the dynamical force exerted bya solitonic string on an identical test-string limit, the Veneziano amplitudefor the scattering of macroscopic winding states and the metric on moduli spacefor the scattering of two string solitons. All three methods yield trivialscattering in the low-energy limit.
