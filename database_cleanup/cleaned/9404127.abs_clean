Title: The Quantum Mechanics of a "Spinor-twin" Type II Superparticle

Comments: 8 pages. TeX-file

Ten dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory may be described, in thelight-cone gauge, in terms of either a vector or spinor superfield satisfyingcertain projection conditions (type I or II). These have been presented in a $SO(9,1) $ form, and used to construct spinning superparticle theories inextended spaces. This letter presents the covariant quantisation of a"spinor-twin" type II superparticle theory by using the standard techniques ofBatalin and Vilkovisky. The quantum action defines a quadratic field theory,whose ghost-independent BRST cohomology class gives the spectrum of N=1 superYang-Mills.
