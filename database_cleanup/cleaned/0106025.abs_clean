We demonstrate how nonlocal regularization is applied to gauge invariantmodels with spontaneous symmetry breaking. Motivated by the ability to find anonlocal BRST invariance that leads to the decoupling of longitudinal gaugebosons from physical amplitudes, we show that the original formulation of themethod leads to a nontrivial relationship between the nonlocal form factorsthat can appear in the model.
