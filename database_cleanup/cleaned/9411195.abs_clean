We consider the effects of abelian duality transformations on static,spherically-symmetric, asymptotically flat string spacetimes in fourdimensions, where the dilaton, axion, metric, and gauge fields are allowed tobe nonzero. Independent of the alpha' expansion, there is a six-parameterfamily of such configurations, labelled by the charges characterizing theaxion charge, electric charge, magnetic charge, and Taub-NUT parameter. We showthat duality, based on time-translation invariance, maps these solutionsamongst themselves, with the effect of interchanging two pairs of these sixthe Taub-NUT parameter. We consider in detail the special case of the purelySchwarzschild black hole, for which the mass of the dual configuration vanishesto leading order in alpha'. Working to next-to-leading order in alpha' for thebosonic and heterotic strings, we find that duality takes a black hole of massM to a (singular) solution having mass - 1/(alpha' M). Finally, we argue thattwo solutions which are related by duality based on a noncompact symmetry are{\it not} always physically equivalent.
