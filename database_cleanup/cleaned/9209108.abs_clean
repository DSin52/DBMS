Non linear sigma models on Riemannian symmetric spaces constitute the mostgeneral class of classical non-linear sigma models which are known to beintegrable. Using the current algebra structure of these models their canonicalstructure is analysed and it is shown that their non ultralocal fundamentalPoisson bracket relation is governed by a field dependent non antisymmetricr-matrix obeying a dynamical Yang Baxter equation.
