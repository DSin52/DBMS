Title: Chiral Reductions of the M-Algebra

Comments: Contribution to the Proceedings of the Trieste Summer School on High

Energy Physics and Cosmology, June 10-July 26, 1996. Dedicated to the memoryof Abdus Salam. 11 pages, requires sprocl.sty (World Scientific)We present the chiral truncation of the eleven dimensional M-algebra down toten and six dimensions. In ten dimensions, we obtain a topological extension ofthe $(1,0)$ Poincar\'e superalgebra that includes super one-form and superfive-form charges. Closed super three- and seven-forms associated with thisalgebra are constructed. In six dimensions, we obtain a topological extensionof the $(2,0)$ and $(1,0)$ Poincar\'e superalgebras. The former includes aquintet of super one-form charges, and a decuplet of super three-form charges,while the latter includes a triplet of super three-form charges.
