ApproachAuthors: Dan Radu Grigore

Comments: 29 pages, LATEX 2e, essentially rewritten paper

We consider the gauge invariance of the standard Yang-Mills model in theframework of the causal approach of Epstein-Glaser and Scharf and determine thegeneric form of the anomalies. The method used is based Epstein-Glaser approachto renormalization theory. In the case of quantum electrodynamics we obtainquite easily the absence of anomalies in all orders.
