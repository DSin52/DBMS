A series of sigma models with torsion are analysed which generate their massdynamically but whose ultra-violet fixed points are non-trivial conformal fieldtheories -- in fact SU(2) WZW models at level $k$. In contrast to the morefamiliar situation of asymptotically free theories in which the fixed pointsare trivial, the sigma models considered here may be termed ``asymptoticallyCFT''. These theories have previously been conjectured to be quantumintegrable; this is confirmed by postulating a factorizable S-matrix todescribe their infra-red behaviour and then carrying out a stringent test ofthis proposal. The test involves coupling the theory to a conserved charge andevaluating the response of the free-energy both in perturbation theory to oneloop and directly from the S-matrix via the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz with achemical potential at zero temperature. Comparison of these results providesconvincing evidence in favour of the proposed S-matrix; it also yields theuniversal coefficients of the beta-function and allows for an evaluation of themass gap (the ratio of the physical mass to the $\Lambda$-parameter) to leadingorder in $1/k$.
