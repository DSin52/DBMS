We propose the 4D, N=1 supergravitational analogues (avatars) of the 4D, N=1supersymmetric Born-Infeld action in four dimensions for the first time, byusing superspace. In particular, a new Born-Infeld type generalization of theWeyl supergravity action is given. A natural new Born-Infeld typegeneralization of the Einstein supergravity is found as well. We also brielfydiscuss a construction of the four-dimensional Born-Infeld-Einsteinsupergravity from the AdS supergravity in five dimensions, which seems to bevery natural in our approach.
