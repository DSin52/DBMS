BPS monopoles in N=2 SUSY theories may lead to monopole condensation andconfinement. We have found that supersymmetric black holes with non-vanishingarea of the horizon may stabilize the moduli in theories where the potential isproportional to the square of the graviphoton central charge. In particular, inknown models of spontaneous breaking of N=2 to N=1 SUSY theories, theparameters of the electric and magnetic Fayet--Iliopoulos terms can beconsidered proportional to electric and magnetic charges of the dyonic blackholes. Upon such identification the potential is found to be proportional tothe square of the black hole mass. The fixed values of the moduli near theblack hole horizon correspond exactly to the minimum of this potential. Thevalue of the potential at the minimum is proportional to the black holeentropy.
