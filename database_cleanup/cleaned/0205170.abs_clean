We use the process of quantum hamiltonian reduction of SU(2)_k, at rationallevel k, to study explicitly the correlators of the h_{1,s} fields in thec_{p,q} models. We find from direct calculation of the correlators that we havethe possibility of extra, chiral and non-chiral, multiplet structure in theh_{1,s} operators beyond the `minimal' sector. At the level of the vacuum nullvector h_{1,2p-1}=(p-1)(q-1) we find that there can be two extra non-chiralfermionic fields. The extra indicial structure present here permeatesthroughout the entire theory. In particular we find we have a chiral triplet offields at h_{1,4p-1}=(2p-1)(2q-1). We conjecture that this triplet algebra mayproduce a rational extended c_{p,q} model. We also find a doublet of fields ath_{1,3p-1}=(\f{3p}{2}-1)(\f{3q}{2}-1). These are chiral fermionic operators ifp and q are not both odd and otherwise parafermionic.
