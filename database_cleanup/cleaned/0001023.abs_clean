Title: The String Uncertainty Relations follow from the New Relativity

PrincipleComments: Revised Tex file. 5 pages. Important change of notation for the

polymomenta coordinates has been made instead of using misleading wedgeproducts. The Cosmological constant term is includedJournal-ref: Found.Phys. 30 (2000) 1301-1316

The String Uncertainty Relations have been known for some time as the stringycorrections to the original Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle. In this letterthe Stringy Uncertainty relations, and corrections thereof, are explicitlyderived from the New Relativity Principle that treats all dimensions andsignatures on the same footing and which is based on the postulate that thePlanck scale is the minimal length in Nature in the same vein that the speed oflight was taken as the maximum velocity in Einstein's theory of SpecialRelativity. The Regge behaviour of the string's spectrum is also a naturalconsequence of this New Relativity Principle.
