The phenomenon of creation of strings, occurring when particles pass througha domain wall and related to the Hanany-Witten effect via dualities, isdiscussed in ten and nine dimensions. We consider both the particle actions inmassive backgrounds as well as the 1/4-supersymmetric particle-string-domainwall supergravity solutions and discuss their physical interpretation. In 10Dwe discuss the D0-F1-D8 system in massive IIA theory while in 9D theSL(2,R)-generalisation is constructed. It consists of (p,q)-particles,(r,s)-strings and the double domain wall solution of the three different 9Dgauged supergravities where a subgroup of SL(2,R) is gauged.
