We start with the observation that the quantum group SL_q(2), described interms of its algebra of functions has a quantum subgroup, which is just a usualCartan group.Based on this observation we develop a general method of constructingquantum groups with similar property. We also describe this method in thelanguage of quantized universal enveloping algebras, which is another commonmethod of studying quantum groups.We carry our method in detail for root systems of type SL(2); as a byproductwe find a new series of quantum groups - metaplectic groups of SL(2)-type.Representations of these groups can provide interesting examples of bimodulecategories over monoidal category of representations of SL_q(2).
