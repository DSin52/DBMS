on-shell BRSTWe discuss within the weak-field approximation and the derivative expansionhow the area law of the Wilson loop follows directly from the vacuum condensateof mass dimension 2, i.e., simultaneous Bose-Einstein condensation of gluonpair and ghost-antighost pair. Such a novel vacuum condensate was recentlyclaimed to exist as the non-vanishing vacuum expectation value of aBRST-invariant composite operator of mass dimension 2. First of all, we use aversion of the non-Abelian Stokes theorem to rewrite the Wilson loop lineintegral to a surface integral. Then we convert the Yang-Mills theory with aninsertion of the Wilson loop operator into a bosonic string theory with arigidity term by way of an equivalent antisymmetric tensor gauge theory whichcouples to the surface spanned by the Wilson loop. This result suggests anintimate relationship between quark confinement and mass gap in Yang-Millstheory. In fact, the dual Ginzburg-Landau theory describing the dualsuperconductivity is also derivable by making use of duality transformationswithout using the naive Abelian projection and without breaking the globalcolor invariance of the original Yang-Mills theory. This feature is desirablefrom the viewpoint of color confinement preserving color symmetry.
