We consider Chern-Simons gauged nonlinear sigma model with boundary which hasa manifest bulk diffeomorphism invariance. We find that the Gauss's law can besolved explicitly when the nonlinear sigma model is defined on the Hermitiansymmetric space, and the original bulk theory completely reduces to a boundarynonlinear sigma model with the target space of Hermitian symmetric space. Wealso study the symplectic structure, compute the diffeomorphism algebra on theboundary, and find an (enlarged) Virasoro algebra with classical central term.
