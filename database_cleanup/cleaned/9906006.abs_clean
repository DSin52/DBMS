We consider cosmological solutions of string and M-theory compactified tofour dimensions by giving a general prescription to construct four-dimensionalmodular cosmologies with two commuting Killing vectors from vacuum solutions.By lifting these solutions to higher dimensions we analyze the existence ofcosmological singularities and find that, in the case of non-closedFriedmann-Robertson-Walker universes, singularities can be removed from thehigher-dimensional model when only one of the extra dimensions is time-varying.By studying the moduli space of compactifications of M-theory resulting inhomogeneous cosmologies in four dimensions we show that U-dualitytransformations map singular cosmologies into non-singular ones.
