Title: Decay Modes of Intersecting Fluxbranes

Authors: D. Brecher and P. M. Saffin

Comments: 19 pages, 6 figures

Just as the single fluxbrane is quantum mechanically unstable to thenucleation of a locally charged spherical brane, so intersecting fluxbranes areunstable to various decay modes. Each individual element of the intersectioncan decay via the nucleation of a spherical brane, but uncharged spheres canalso be nucleated in the region of intersection. For special values of thefluxes, however, intersecting fluxbranes are supersymmetric, and so areexpected to be stable. We explicitly consider the instanton describing thedecay modes of the two--element intersection (an F5-brane in the string theorycontext), and show that in dimensions greater than four the action for thedecay mode of the supersymmetric intersection diverges. This observation allowsus to show that stable intersecting fluxbranes should also exist in type 0Astring theory.
