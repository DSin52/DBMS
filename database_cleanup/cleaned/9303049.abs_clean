The two dimensional dilaton gravity with the cosmological term and with aneven number of matter fields minimally coupled to the gravity is considered.The exact solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation are obtained in an explicitfunctional form, which contain an arbitrary holomorphic function of the matterfields.
