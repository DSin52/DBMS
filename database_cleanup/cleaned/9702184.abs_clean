We investigate duality properties of N-form fields, provide a symmetric wayof coupling them to electric/magnetic sources, and check that these chargesobey the appropriate quantization requirements. First, we contrast the D=4kcase, in which duality is a well-defined SO(2) rotation generated by aChern-Simons form leaving the action invariant, and D=4k+2 where thecorresponding ostensibly SO(1,1) rotation is not only not an invariance butdoes not even have a generator. When charged sources are included we showexplicitly in the Maxwell case how the usual Dirac quantization arises in afully symmetric approach attaching strings to both types of charges. Finally,for D=4k+2 systems, we show how charges can be introduced for self-dual(2k)-forms, and obtain the D=4k models with sources by dimensional reduction,tracing their duality invariance to a partial invariance in the higherdimensions.
