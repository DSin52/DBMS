We show that regularization of gauge theories by higher covariant derivativesand gauge invariant Pauli-Villars regulators is a consistent method if thePauli-Villars vector fields are considered in a covariant in the regulatingPauli-Villars fields is pathological and the original Slavnov proposal incovariant Landau gauge is not correct because of the appearance of masslessmodes in the regulators which do not decouple when the ultraviolet regulator isremoved. In such a case the method does not correspond to the regularization ofa pure gauge theory but that of a gauge theory in interaction with masslessghost fields. This explains the problems pointed out by Martin and Ruiz incovariant Landau gauge. However, a minor modification of Slavnov methodprovides a consistent regularization even for such a case. The regularizationthat we introduce also solves the problem of overlapping divergences in a waysimilar to geometric regularization and yields the standard values of the$\beta$ and $\gamma$ functions of the renormalization group equations.
