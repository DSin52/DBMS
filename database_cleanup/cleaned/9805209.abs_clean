We derive the spacetime superalgebras explicitly from ``test'' p-braneactions in a D-8-brane (i.e. a massive IIA) background to the lowest order in$\theta$ via canonical formalism, and show that the forms of the superalgebrasare the same as those in all the other D-brane (i.e. massless IIA) backgrounds,that is, they are indifferent to the presence of the Chern-Simons terms whichare proportional to the mass and added to the D-brane actions in the case ofmassive IIA backgrounds. Thus, we can say that all the D-brane backgroundsolutions including a D-8-brane are on equal footing from the viewpoint of thesuperalgebras via brane probes. We also deduce from the algebra all thepreviously known 1/4 supersymmetric intersections of a p-brane or a fundamentalstring with a D-8-brane, as the supersymmetric ``gauge fixings'' of the testbranes in the D-8-brane background.
