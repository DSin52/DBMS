I argue that, in the chaotic version of string cosmology proposed recently,classical and quantum effects generate, at the time of exit to radiation, thecorrect amount of entropy to saturate a Hubble (or holography) entropy bound(HEB) and to identify, within our own Universe, the arrow of time. Demandingthat the HEB be fulfilled at all times forces a crucial "branch change" tooccur, and the so-called string phase to end at a critical value of theeffective Planck mass, in agreement with previous conjectures.
