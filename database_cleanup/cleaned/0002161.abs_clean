We examine the behaviour of gravity in brane theories with extra dimensionsin a non-factorizable geometry. We find that for metrics which areasymptotically flat far from the brane there is a resonant graviton mode atzero energy. The presence of this resonance ensures quasi-localization ofgravity, whereby at intermediate scales the gravitational laws on the brane areapproximately four dimensional. However, for scales larger than the lifetime ofthe graviton resonance the five dimensional laws of gravity will be reproduceddue to the decay of the four dimensional graviton. We also present a simpleclassification of the possible types of effective gravity theories on the branethat can appear for general non-factorizable background theories.
