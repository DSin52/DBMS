We construct D-branes in the Nappi-Witten (NW) andGuadagnini-Martellini-Mintchev (GMM) gauged WZW models. For the $SL(2,R)\timesSU(2)/U(1)\times U(1)$ NW and $SU(2)\times SU(2)/U(1)$ GMM models we presentthe explicit equations describing the D-brane hypersurfaces in their targetspaces. In the latter case we show that the D-branes are classified accordingto the Cardy theorem. We also present the semiclassical mass computation andfind its agreement with the CFT predictions.
