In light of the AdS/CFT correspondence, it is natural to try to define aconformal field theory in a large N, strong coupling limit via a supergravitycompactification on the product of an Einstein manifold and anti-de Sitterspace. We consider the five-dimensional manifolds T^{pq} which are coset spaces(SU(2) x SU(2))/U(1). The central charge and a part of the chiral spectrum arecalculated, respectively, from the volume of T^{pq} and the spectrum of thescalar laplacian. Of the manifolds considered, only T^{11} admits anysolution corresponding to a large number of D3-branes at a conifoldsingularity, discussed recently in hep-th/9807080. Through a field theoryanalysis of anomalous three point functions we are able to reproduce thethe central charge of the N=2 Z_2 orbifold theory from which it descends via anRG flow.
