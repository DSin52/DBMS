Bousso's entropy bound for two-dimensional gravity is investigated in thelightcone gauge. It is shown that due to the Weyl anomaly, the null componentof the energy-momentum tensor takes a nonvanishing value, and thus, combinedwith the conditions that were recently proposed by Bousso, Flanagan and Marolf,a holographic entropy bound similar to Bousso's is expected to hold in twodimensions. A connection of our result to that of Strominger and Thompson isalso discussed.
