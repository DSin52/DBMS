String configurations with nonzero winding number describe soliton stringstates. We compute the Veneziano amplitude for the scattering of arbitrarywinding states and show that in the large radius limit the strings alwaysscatter trivially and with no change in the individual winding numbers of thestrings. In this limit, then, these states scatter as true solitons.
