It is shown that the problem of calculating form factors in ADE affine Todafield theories can be reduced to the nonperturbative recursive calculation ofpolynomials symmetric in each sort of variables. We determine these recursionequations explicitly for the ADE series and characterize the polynomialsolutions by an interplay between the weight space of the underlying Liealgebra and representations of the symmetric group.
