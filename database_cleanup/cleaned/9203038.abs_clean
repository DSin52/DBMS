We present an invariant regularisation scheme to compute two dimensionalinduced gauge theory actions, that is local in Polyakov's variables, butnonlocal in the original gauge potentials. Our method sheds light on thelocality of this induced action, and leads to a straightforward proof that the$\varepsilon$-anomaly in $W_3$-gravity is completely given by the one loopterm.
