The computation of mode sums of the types encountered in basic quantum fieldtheoretic applications is addressed with an emphasis on their expansions intofunctions of distance that can be interpreted as potentials. We show how toregularize and calculate the Casimir energy for the continuum Nambu-Goto stringwith massive ends as well as for the discrete Isgur-Paton non-relativisticstring with massive ends. As an additional example, we examine the effect onthe interquark potential of a constant Kalb-Ramond field strength interactingwith a QCD string.
