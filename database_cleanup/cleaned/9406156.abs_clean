We demonstrate that a supersymmetric theory twisted on a K\"ahler fourmanifold $M=\Sigma_1 \times \Sigma_2 ,$ where $\Sigma_{1,2}$ are 2D Riemannsurfaces, possesses a "left-moving" conformal stress tensor on $\Sigma_1$($\Sigma_2$) in the BRST cohomology. The central charge of the Virasoro algebrahas a purely geometric origin and is proportional to the Euler characteristicof the $\Sigma_2$ ($\Sigma_1$) surface. This structure is shown to be invariantunder renormalization group. We also give a representation of the algebra$W_{1+\infty}$ in terms of a free chiral supermultiplet.
