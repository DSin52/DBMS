Figures available from the authorsRecent progress on string theory in curved spacetimes is reviewed. The stringdynamics in cosmological and black hole spacetimes is investigated.The methodsto solve the string equations of motion in curved spacetimes are described.Thatis, the perturbation approach, the null approach, the $\tau$-expansion, and theconstruction of global solutions.The behaviour of strings in FRW and inflatio-nary spacetimes is obtained from the various types of string solutions. Threestable}.For the unstable strings, the energy and size grow proportional to $R$for large scale factors $R \to \infty$. For the dual to unstable strings, theenergy and size blow up for R\to 0 as 1/R. For stable strings, the energy andsize are bounded. (In Minkowski, all solutions are of the stable type). Theself-consistent solution to the Einstein equations for string dominateduniverses is reviewed. The energy-momentum tensor for a gas of strings is takenas source and from the above behaviours the string equation of state is {\bfderived}. The self-consistent string solution exhibits realistic matterdominated behaviour for large times and radiation dominated behaviour for earlytimes. We report on the {\bf exact integrability} of the string dynamics in deSitter spacetime that allows to systematically find {\bf exact} stringsolutions by soliton methods. {\bf Multistring solutions} are a new feature incurved spacetimes. That is, a single world-sheet simultaneously describes manydifferent and independent strings. This phenomenon has no analogue in flatspacetime and follows from the coupling of the strings with the geometry.Finally, the string dynamics next and inside a Schwarzschild black hole isanalyzed and their physical properties discussed.
