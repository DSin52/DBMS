We discuss the generic definition of the $\tau$ function for the arbitraryHamiltonian system. The different approaches concerning the deformations of thecurves and surfaces are compared. It is shown that the Baker-Akhiezer functionfor the secondary integrable system of the Toda lattice type can be identifiedwith the coherent wave function of the initial dynamical system. The $\tau$function appears to be related to the filling of the interior of the classicaltrajectory by coherent states. Transition from dispersionless to dispersionfulToda lattice corresponds to the quantization of the initial dynamical system.
