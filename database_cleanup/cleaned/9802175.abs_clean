We obtain electrically charged vortex solutions for the Born-Infeld Higgssystem with a Chern Simons term. We analyse numerically these solutions,comparing their properties with those of ``normal'' Nielsen-Olesen vortices andalso show that no charged vortex solutions exist in Born-Infeld theory when theChern Simons term is absent.
