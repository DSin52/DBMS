N-fold supersymmetry is an extension of the ordinary supersymmetry inone-dimensional quantum mechanics. One of its major property isquasi-solvability, which means that energy eigenvalues can be obtained for aportion of the spectra. We show that recently found Type A N-fold supersymmetrycan be constructed by using sl(2) algebra, which provides a basis for thequasi-solvability. By this construction we find a condition for the Type AN-fold supersymmetry, which is less restrictive than the condition knownpreviously. Several explicitly known models are also examined in the light ofthis construction.
