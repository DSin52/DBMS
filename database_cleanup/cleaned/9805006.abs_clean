We find exact D-brane configurations in the Nappi-Witten background using theboundary state approach and describe how they are related by T-dualitytransformations. We also show that the classical boundary conditions of theassociated sigma model correspond to a field dependent automorphism relatingthe chiral currents and discuss the correspondence between the boundary stateapproach and the sigma model approach.
