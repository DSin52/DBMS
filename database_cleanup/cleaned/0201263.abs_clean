high-dimensional curved spacetimeComments: 10pages, Latex

which contains an electric as well as magnetic current, and ii) the othercontains (generalized) Chern-Simons terms. All these fields are defined on acurved spacetime of arbitrary (odd) dimensions. A new form of gaugetransformations is introduced and plays an essential role in defining theinteraction with a magnetic monopole or in defining the generalizedChern-Simons terms.
