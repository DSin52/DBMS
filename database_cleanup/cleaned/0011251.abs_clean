In this note we analyse the dynamical potential of a system of four$Dp$-branes at arbitrary angles. The equilibrium configurations for variousvalues of the relative angles and distances among branes are discussed. Theknown configurations of parallel branes and brane-antibranes are obtained atextrema of the dynamical potential.
