In this paper the quantum integrals of the Hamiltonian of the quantummany-body problem with the interaction potential K/sinh^2(x) (Sutherlandoperator) are constructed as images of higher Casimirs of the Lie algebra gl(N)under a certain homomorphism from the center of U(gl(N)) to the algebra ofdifferential operators in N variables. A similar construction applied to theaffine gl(N) at the critical level k=-N defines a correspondence between higherSugawara operators and quantum integrals of the Hamiltonian of the quantummany-body problem with the potential equal to constant times the Weierstrassfunction. This allows one to give a new proof of the Olshanetsky-Perelomovtheorem stating that this Hamiltonian defines a completely integrable quantumsystem. We also give a new expression for eigenfunctions of the quantumintegrals of the Sutherland operator as traces of intertwining operatorsbetween certain representations of gl(N).
