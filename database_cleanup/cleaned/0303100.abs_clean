The `Landau--Ginzburg' theory of Girvin and MacDonald, modified by adding thenatural magnetic term, is shown to admit stable topological as well asnon-topological vortex solutions. The system is the commun $\lambda\to0$ limitof two slightly different non-relativistic Maxwell--Chern--Simons models of thetype introduced recently by Manton. The equivalence with the model of Zhang,Hansson and Kivelson is demonstrated.
