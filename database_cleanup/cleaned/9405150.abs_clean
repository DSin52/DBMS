We construct representations $\hat\pi_{\br}$ of the quantum algebra$U_q(sl(n))$ labelled by $n-1$ complex numbers $r_i$ and acting in the space offormal power series of $n(n-1)/2$ non-commuting variables. These variablesgenerate a flag manifold of the matrix quantum group $SL_q(n)$ which is dual to$U_q(sl(n))$. The conditions for reducibility of $\hat\pi_{\br}$ and theprocedure for the construction of the $q$ - difference intertwining operatorsare given. The representations and $q$ - difference intertwining operators aregiven in the most explicit form for $n=3$.
