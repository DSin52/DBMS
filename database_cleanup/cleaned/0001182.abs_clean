Authors: Harald Grosse, Thomas Krajewski and Raimar Wulkenhaar

Comments: 11 pages, LaTeX 2e, 6 figures

We prove by explicit calculation that Feynman graphs in noncommutativeYang-Mills theory made of repeated insertions into itself of arbitrarily manyone-loop ghost propagator corrections are renormalizable by local counterterms.This provides a strong support for the renormalizability conjecture of thatmodel.
