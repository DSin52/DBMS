We show how all known N=2, d=4,5,6 maximally supersymmetric vacua (Hpp-wavesand aDSxS solutions) are related through dimensional reduction/oxidationpreserving all the unbroken supersymmetries. In particular we show how the N=2,d=5 family of vacua (which are the near-horizon geometry of supersymmetricrotating black holes) interpolates between aDS_2xS^3 and aDS_3xS^2 in parameterspace and how it can be dimensionally reduced to an N=2, d=4 dyonicRobinson-Bertotti solution with geometry aDS_2xS^2 and oxidized to an N=2, d=6solution with aDS_3xS^3 geometry (which is the near-horizon of the self-dualstring).
