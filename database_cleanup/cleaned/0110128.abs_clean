Title: The particle invariance in particle physics

Authors: H. Y. Cui

Comments: LaTeX, 16 pages, 4 figures

Since the particles such as molecules, atoms and nuclei are compositeparticles, it is important to recognize that physics must be invariant for thecomposite particles and their constituent particles, this requirement is calledparticle invariance in this paper. But difficulties arise immediately becausefor fermion we use Dirac equation, for meson we use Klein-Gordon equation andfor classical particle we use Newtonian mechanics, while the connectionsbetween these equations are quite indirect. Thus if the particle invariance isheld in physics, i.e., only one physical formalism exists for any particle, wecan expect to find out the differences between these equations by employing theparticle invariance. As the results, several new relationships between them arefound, the most important result is that the obstacles that cluttered the pathfrom classical mechanics to quantum mechanics are found, it becomes possible toderive the quantum wave equations from relativistic mechanics after theobstacles are removed. An improved model is proposed to gain a betterunderstanding on elementary particle interactions. This approach offersenormous advantages, not only for giving the first physically reasonableinterpretation of quantum mechanics, but also for improving quark model.
