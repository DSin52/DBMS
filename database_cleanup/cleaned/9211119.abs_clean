We discuss the toplogical sigma model on an orbifold target space. Wedescribe the moduli space of classical minima for computing correlationfunctions involving twisted operators, and show, through a detailed computationof an orbifold of ${\bf CP}^1$ by the dihedral group $D_{4},$ how to computethe complete ring of observables. Through this procedure, we compute all therings from dihedral ${\bf CP}^1$ orbifolds; we note a similarity with ringsderived from perturbed $D-$series superpotentials of the $A-D-E$ classificationof $N = 2$ minimal models. We then consider ${\bf CP}^2/D_4,$ and show how thetechniques of topological-anti-topological fusion might be used to computetwist field correlation functions for nonabelian orbifolds.
