Finite Euler hierarchies of field theory Lagrangians leading to universalequations of motion for new types of string and membrane theories and for {\itclassical} topological field theories are constructed. The analysis uses twomain ingredients. On the one hand, there exists a generic finite Eulerhierarchy for one field leading to a universal equation which generalises thePlebanski equation of self-dual four dimensional gravity. On the other hand,specific maps are introduced between field theories which provide a``triangular duality'' between certain classes of arbitrary field theories,classical topological field theories and generalised string and membranetheories. The universal equations, which derive from an infinity ofinequivalent Lagrangians, are generalisations of certain reductions of thePlebanski and KdV equations, and could possibly define new integrable systems,thus in particular integrable membrane theories. Some classes of solutions areconstructed in the general case. The general solution to some of the universalequations is given in the simplest cases.
