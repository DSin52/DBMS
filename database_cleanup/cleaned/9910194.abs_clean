The D1/D5 system is considered in the presence of the NS B field. An explicitsupergravity solution in the asymptotically flat and near horizon limits ispresented. Explicit mass formulae are presented in both cases. This solutionhas no D3 source branes and represents a true bound state of the D1/D5 system.We study the motion of a separated D1-brane in the background geometrydescribed above and reproduce the Liouville potential that binds the D1 brane.A gauge theory analysis is also presented in the presence of Fayet-Iliopoulos(FI) parameters which can be identified with the self-dual part of the NS Bfield. In the case of a single D5-brane and an arbitrary number of D1 branes wecan demonstrate the existence of a bound state in the Higgs branch. We alsopoint out the connection of the SCFT on the resolved Sym$_{Q_1Q_5}(\tilde T^4)$with recent developments in non-commutative Yang-Mills theory.
