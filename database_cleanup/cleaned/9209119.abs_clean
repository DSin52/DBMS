Comments: 20 pages, September 1992

We propose a new method for numerical calculation of link plynomials forknots given in 3 dimensions. We calculate derivatives of the Jones polynomialin a computational time proportional to $N^{\alpha}$ with respect to the systemsize $N$ . This method gives a new tool for determining topology of knottedclosed loops in three dimensions using computers.
