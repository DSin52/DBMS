Analysing a 3+1 dimensional model with four-Fermi interactions, we show thattopological $\BF$ terms (both abelian and non-abelian) can be inducedradiatively by massive fermions at the one-loop level. It is further pointedout that a mechanism of photon (or non-abelian gauge field) mass generationdistinct from the usual Higgs mechanism, through the $\BF$ term, is alsoimplemented in the long-distance effective action of this model, provided a gapequation is satisfied.
