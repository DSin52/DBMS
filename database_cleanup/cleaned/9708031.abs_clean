Reviewing the cancellation of local anomalies of M-theory on R^10 x S^1/Z_2the Yang-Mills coupling constant on the boundaries is rederived. The result islambda^2 = 2^(1/3) (2 pi) (4 pi kappa^2)^(2/3) corresponding to eta =lambda^6/kappa^4 = 256 pi^5 in the `upstairs' units used by Horava and Wittenand differs from their calculation. It is shown that these values arecompatible with the standard membrane and fivebrane tensions derived from theM-theory bulk action. In view of these results it is argued that the naturalunits for M-theory on R^10 x S^1/Z_2 are the `downstairs' units where the branetensions take their standard form and the Yang-Mills coupling constant islambda^2 = 4 pi (4 pi kappa^2)^(2/3).
