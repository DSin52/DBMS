Journal-ref: Lett.Math.Phys. 26 (1992) 67-78

We introduce a large class of bicovariant differential calculi on any quantumgroup $A$, associated to $Ad$-invariant elements. For example, the deformedtrace element on $SL_q(2)$ recovers Woronowicz' $4D_\pm$ calculus. Moregenerally, we obtain a sequence of differential calculi on each quantum group$A(R)$, based on the theory of the corresponding braided groups $B(R)$. Here$R$ is any regular solution of the QYBE.
