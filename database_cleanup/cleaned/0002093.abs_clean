$QCD_2$ with fermions in the adjoint representation is invariant under$SU(N)/Z_N$ and thereby is endowed with a non-trivial vacuum structure(k-sectors). The static potential between adjoint charges, in the limit ofinfinite mass, can be therefore obtained by computing Wilson loops in the pureYang-Mills theory with the same non-trivial structure. When the (Euclidean)space-time is compactified on a sphere $S^2$, Wilson loops can be exactlyexpressed in terms of an infinite series of topological excitations(instantons). The presence of k-sectors modifies the energy spectrum of thetheory and its instanton content. For the exact solution, in the limit in whichthe sphere is decompactified, a k-sector can be mimicked by the presence ofk-fundamental charges at $\infty$, according to a Witten's suggestion. Howeverthis property neither holds before decompactification nor for the genuineperturbative solution which corresponds to the zero-instanton contribution on$S^2$.
