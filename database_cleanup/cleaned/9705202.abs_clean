We construct a reparametrization invariant two-point function for c=-2conformal matter coupled to two-dimensional quantum gravity. From the two-pointfunction we extract the critical indices \nu and \eta. The results support thequantum gravity version of Fisher's scaling relation. Our approach is based onthe transfer matrix formalism and exploits the formulation of the c=-2 stringas an O(n) model on a random lattice.
