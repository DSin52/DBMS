We formulate matrix models for strings in ten dimensional pp-wave backgroundsand for particles in eleven dimensional ones. This is done by firstcharacterizing the deformations of ten dimensional {\cal N}=1 SYM which areinduced by a constant bispinorial coupling $\int \bar\Psi H\Psi$ plus a minimalpurely bosonic completition and then by the appropriate dimensional reduction.We find a whole class of new models for the matrix strings and a generalizationof the supernumerary supersymmetric models as far as the matrix theory forparticles is concerned. A companion deformation of the IKKT matrix model isalso discussed.
