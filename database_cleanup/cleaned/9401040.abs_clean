We study the scattering of two Skyrmions at low energy and large separation.We use the method proposed by Manton for truncating the degrees of freedom ofthe system from infinite to a manageable finite number. This corresponds toidentifying the manifold consisting of the union of the low energy criticalpoints of the potential along with the gradient flow curves joining thesetogether and by positing that the dynamics is restricted here. The kineticenergy provides an induced metric on this manifold while restricting the fullpotential energy to the manifold defines a potential. The low energy dynamicsis now constrained to these finite number of degrees of freedom. For largeseparation of the two Skyrmions the manifold is parametrised by the variablesof the product ansatz. We find the interaction between two Skyrmions comingfrom the induced metric, which was independently found by Schroers. We findthat the static potential is actually negligible in comparison to thisinteraction. Thus to lowest order, at large separation, the dynamics reduces togeodesic motion on the manifold. We consider the scattering to first order inthe interaction using the perturbative method of Lagrange and find that thedynamics in the no spin or charge exchange sector reduces to the Keplerproblem.
