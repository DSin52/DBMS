A survey is given of the formulation of a $\sigma$-model describing an openstring moving in general target space background fields and coupling to both amatrix-valued D-brane position and a matrix-valued gauge field on the D-brane.The equations of motion for the D-brane and the gauge field are derived fromthe conformal invariance condition on the string world sheet in lowest order of$\ap$. The ordering problem of the involved matrices is solved. In addition toour previous work we discuss a conflict between the classical T-duality rulesand renormalization. The calculation of the RG $\beta$-functions does not yieldthe mass term obtained by formal application of these rules in the case oftarget space separated D-brane copies.
