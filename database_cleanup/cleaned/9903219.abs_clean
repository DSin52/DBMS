We clarify a number of issues regarding the worldsheet and spacetimedescriptions of string propagation on AdS_3. We construct the vertex operatorsof spacetime current algebra and spacetime (super) Virasoro generators in thefull interacting SL(2) WZW theory and study their Ward identities. We alsoexplain the relation between the analysis in this note and some recent work onthis subject.
