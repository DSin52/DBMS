Using the notion of a gauge connection on a flat superspace, we construct ageneral class of noncommutative ($D=2,$ $\mathcal{N}=1$) supertranslationalgebras generalizing the ordinary algebra by inclusion of some new bosonic andfermionic operators. We interpret the new operators entering into the algebraas the generators of a U(1) (super) gauge symmery of the underlying theory onsuperspace. These superalgebras are gauge invariant, though not closed ingeneral. We then show that these type of superalgebras are naturally realizedin a supersymmetric field theory possessing a super U(1) gauge symmetry. As thenon-linearly realized symmetries of this theory, the generalized noncommutative(super)translations and super gauge transformations are found to form a closedalgebra.
