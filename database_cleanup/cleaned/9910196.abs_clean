We study the structure of the monopole configuration in U(2) non-commutativeequation and then the eigenvalue equation in the non-commutative space.Calculation to the first non-trivial order in the non-commutativity parametertheta shows that the monopole exhibits a certain non-locality. This structureis precisely the one expected from the recent predictions by thebrane-configuration technique.
