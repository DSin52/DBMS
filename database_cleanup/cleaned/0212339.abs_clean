Conference on Supersymmetry and Unification of Fundamental Interactions(SUSY'02), Hamburg, Germany, 17-23 Jun 2002 and RTN Workshop on the QuantumStructure of Spacetime, Leuven, Belgium, 13-19 Sep 2002We review a recent proposal towards a microscopic understanding of theentropy of non-supersymmetric spacetimes -- with emphasis on the Schwarzschildblack hole. The approach is based at an intermediate step on the description ofthe non-supersymmetric spacetime in terms of dual Euclidean brane pairs oftype-II string-theory or M-theory. By counting specific chain structures on thebrane-complex, it is shown that one can reproduce the exact Schwarzschild blackhole entropy plus its logarithmic correction.
