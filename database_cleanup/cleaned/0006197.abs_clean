We consider the case of an integrable quantum spin chain with "solitonnon-peserving" boundary conditions. This is the first time that such boundaryconditions have been considered in the spin chain framework. We construct thetransfer matrix of the model, we study its symmetry and we find explicitexpressions for its eigenvalues. Moreover, we derive a new set of Bethe ansatzequations by means of the analytical Bethe ansatz method.
