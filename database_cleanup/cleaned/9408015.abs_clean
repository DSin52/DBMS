Title: Finite-size Analysis of $O(N)$ Nonlinear $\sigma$ Model on Semi-compact

SpacesComments: 7 pages

Fisher's phenomenological renormalization method is used to calculate themass gap and the correlation length of the $O(N)$ nonlinear $\sigma$ model on asemi-compact space $S^{1}\times {\bf R}^{2}$. This shows that the ultravioletmomentum cut-off does not conflict with the infrared cut-off along the $S^{1}$direction. The mass gap on $S^{2}\times {\bf R}$ is also discussed.
