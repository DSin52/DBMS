In this paper we study the regular self-gravitating 't Hooft-Polyakovmagnetic monopole in a global monopole spacetime. We show that for the largedistance, the structure of the manifold corresponds to theReissner-Nordstr\"{o}m spacetime with a solid angle deficit factor. Although weanalyze static and spherically symmetric solutions, it is not possible to solveanalytically the system of coupled differential equations and only numericalevaluations can provide detailed information about the behavior of this systemat the neighborhood of the defect's core. So, for this reason we solvenumerically the set of differential equations for the metric tensor and for thematter fields for different values of the Higgs field vacuum expectation value,$\eta$, and the self-coupling constant, $\lambda$.
