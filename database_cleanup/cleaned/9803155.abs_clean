We study the graviton self-energy function in a general gauge, using a hardthermal loop expansion which includes terms proportional to T^4, T^2 andlog(T). We verify explicitly the gauge independence of the leading T^4 term andobtain a compact expression for the sub-leading T^2 contribution. It is shownthat the logarithmic term has the same structure as the ultraviolet pole partof the T=0 self-energy function. We argue that the gauge-dependent part of theT^2 contribution is effectively canceled in the dispersion relations of thegraviton plasma, and present the solutions of these equations.
