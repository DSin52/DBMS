It is shown that only the infinite angular momentum quantum states contributeto the incident wave in Aharonov-Bohm (AB) scattering. This result is clearlyshown by recalculating the AB calculation with arbitrary decomposition ofsummation over the angular momentum quantum numbers in wave function. It ismotivated from the fact that the pole contribution in the integralrepresentation used by Jackiw is given by only the infinite angular momentumstates, in which the closed contour integration involving this pole gives justthe incident wave.
