We study the ultraviolet asymptotics in non-simply laced affine Toda theoriesconsidering them as perturbed non-affine Toda theories, which possess theextended conformal symmetry. We calculate the reflection amplitudes, innon-affine Toda theories and use them to derive the quantization condition forthe vacuum wave function, describing zero-mode dynamics. The solution of thisquantization conditions for the ground state energy determines the UVasymptotics of the effective central charge. These asymptotics are in a goodagreement with Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz(TBA) results. To make the comparisonwith TBA possible, we give the exact relations between parameters of the actionand masses of particles as well as the bulk free energies for non-simply lacedaffine Toda theories.
