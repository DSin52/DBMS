International Symposium ``Generalized Symmetries in Physics'', ASI Clausthal1993There is a deformation of the ordinary differential calculus which leads fromthe continuum to a lattice (and induces a corresponding deformation of physicaltheories). We recall some of its features and relate it to a general frameworkof differential calculus on discrete sets. This framework generalizes the usual(lattice) discretization.
