It is shown, that the geometrical objects of Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism--odd symplectic structure and nilpotent operator $\Delta$ can be naturallyuncorporated in Duistermaat--Heckman localization procedure. The presence ofthe supersymmetric bi-Hamiltonian dynamics with even and odd symplecticstructure in this procedure is established. These constructions can bestraightly generalized for the path-integral case.
