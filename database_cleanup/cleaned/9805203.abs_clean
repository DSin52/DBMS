Lagrangians for gauge fields and matter fields can be constructed from theinfinite dimensional Kac-Moody algebra and group. A continuum regularization isused to obtain such generic lagrangians, which contain new nonlinear andasymmetric interactions not present in gauge theories based on compact Liegroups. This technique is applied to deriving the Yang-Mills and Chern-Simonslagrangians for the Kac-Moody case. The extension of this method to D=4,N=(1/2,0) supersymmetric Kac-Moody gauge fields is also made.
