It is argued that degrees of freedom responsible for the Bekenstein-Hawkingentropy of a black hole in induced gravity are described by two dimensionalquantum field theory defined on the bifurcation surface of the horizon. Thisresult is proved for a class of induced gravity models with scalar, spinor andvector heavy constituents.
