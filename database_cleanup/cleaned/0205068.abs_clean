We consider a natural generalisation of the class of hyperbolic Kac-Moodyalgebras. We describe in detail the conditions under which these algebras areLorentzian. We also construct their fundamental weights, and analyse whetherthey possess a real principal so(1,2) subalgebra. Our class of algebras includethe Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras that have recently been proposed assymmetries of M-theory and the closed bosonic string.
