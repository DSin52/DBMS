We use the M theory approach in the presence of an orientifold O6 plane tounderstand some aspects of the moduli space of vacua for N=1 supersymmetric$SO(N_c)/Sp(N_c)$ gauge theories in four dimensions. By exploiting some generalproperties of the O6 orientifold, we reproduce some results obtained previouslywith an orientifold O4 plane when the flavor group arises from the worldvolumedynamics of D6 branes. By using semi-infinite D4 branes instead of D6 branes,we derive the most general form of the rotated curve describing the modulispace of vacua for N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory with massive matter.
