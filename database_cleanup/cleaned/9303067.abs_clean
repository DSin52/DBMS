A recent proposal for a background independent open string field theory isstudied in detail for a class of backgrounds that correspond to generalquadratic boundary interactions on the world-sheet. A short-distance cut-off isintroduced to formulate the theory with a finite number of local andpotentially unrenormalizable boundary couplings. It is shown thatrenormalization of the boundary couplings makes both the world-sheet partitionfunction and the string field action finite and cut-off independent, althoughthe resulting string field action has an unpalatable dependence on the leadingunrenormalizable coupling.
