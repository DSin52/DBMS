Dirac operatorThis paper belongs to the series devoted to the calculation of particlemasses in p-adic conformal field theory limit of TGD. The concept oftopological condensate generalizes the concept of 3-space. Varioushierarchically ordered levels of the condensate obey effective p-adic topologyand fractal considerations motivate the hypothesis that physically interestingvalues of p correspond to primes near prime powers of two, in particularMersenne primes. This hypothesis relates succesfully the fundamental elementarypar- ticle mass scales to Planck mass scale. The fundamental description ofHiggs mechanism is in terms of p-adic thermodynamics for the Virasoro generator$L^0$ (mass squared). Massivation follows from the small thermal mixing ofmassless ground state with Planck mass excitations. The quantization oftemperature at low temperature limit gives earlier length scale hypothesis as aprediction. In this paper the general theory of Higgs mechanism is describedand calculation of elementary fermion and boson masses is left to the thirdpaper of the series.
