We evaluate the exact ${\rm QED}_{2+1}$ effective energy for charged spinzero and spin half fields in the presence of a family of static magnetic fieldprofiles localized in a strip of width $\lambda$. The exact result yields aninfinite set of relations between the terms in the derivative expansion of theeffective energy for a general magnetic field. Upon addition of the standardMaxwell magneto-static energy, the minimum energy configuration at fixed fluxcorresponds to a uniform magnetic field.
