We construct a Goulian-Li-type continuation in the number of insertions ofthe cosmological constant operator which is no longer restricted to onedimensional target space. The method is applied to the calculation of thethree-point and a special four-point correlation function. Various aspects ofthe emerging analytical structure are discussed.
