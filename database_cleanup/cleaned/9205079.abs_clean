We initiate a program to study the relationship between the target space, thespectrum and the scattering amplitudes in string theory. We consider scatteringamplitudes following from string theory and quantum field theory on a curvedtarget space, which is taken to be the $SU(2)$ group manifold, with specialattention given to the duality between contributions from different channels.We give a simple example of the equivalence between amplitudes coming fromstring theory and quantum field theory, and compute the general form of afour-scalar field theoretical amplitude. The corresponding string theorycalculation is performed for a special case, and we discuss how more generalstring theory amplitudes could be evaluated.
