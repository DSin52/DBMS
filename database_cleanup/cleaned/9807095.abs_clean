We study the rigid limit of type IIB string theory, compactified on a K3fibration, which, near its conifold limit, contains the Seiberg-Witten curvefor N=2 SU(2) Super-Yang-Mills with a massive hypermultiplet in the fundamentalrepresentation. Instead of working with an ALE approximation, we treat the K3fibration globally. The periods we get in this way, allow for an embedding ofthe field theory into a supergravity model.
