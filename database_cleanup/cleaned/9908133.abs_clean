A non-local classical duality between the three-block truncated 11Dsupergravity and the 8D vacuum gravity with two commuting Killing symmetries isestablished. The supergravity four-form field is generated via an inversedualisation of the corresponding Killing two-forms in six dimensions. 11Dsupersymmetry condition is shown to be equivalent to existence of covariantlyconstant spinors in eight dimensions. Thus any solution to the vacuum Einsteinequations in eight dimensions depending on six coordinates and admittingKilling spinors have supersymmetric 11D-supergravity counterparts. Using thisduality we derive some new brane solutions to 11D-supergravity including 1/4supersymmetric intersecting M-branes with a NUT parameter and a dyon solutionjoining the M2 and M5-branes intersecting at a point.
