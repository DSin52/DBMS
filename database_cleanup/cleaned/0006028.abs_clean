We discuss the restructuring of the BPS spectrum which occurs on certainsubmanifolds of the moduli/parameter space -- the curves of the marginalstability (CMS) -- using quasiclassical methods. We argue that in general a`composite' BPS soliton swells in coordinate space as one approaches the CMSand that, as a bound state of two `primary' solitons, its dynamics in thisregion is determined by non-relativistic supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Nearthe CMS the bound state has a wave function which is highly spread out.Precisely on the CMS the bound state level reaches the continuum, the compositestate delocalizes in coordinate space, and restructuring of the spectrum canoccur. We present a detailed analysis of this behavior in a two-dimensional N=2Wess-Zumino model with two chiral fields, and then discuss how it arises in thecontext of `composite' dyons near weak coupling CMS curves in N=2supersymmetric gauge theories. We also consider cases where some states becomemassless on the CMS.
