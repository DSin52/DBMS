Extreme 4-dimensional dilaton black holes embedded into 10-dimensionalgeometry are shown to be dual to the gravitational waves in string theory. Thecorresponding gravitational waves are the generalization of pp-fronted waves,called supersymmetric string waves. They are given by Brinkmann metric and thetwo-form field, without a dilaton. The non-diagonal part of the metric of thedual partner of the wave together with the two-form field correspond to thevector field in 4-dimensional geometry of the charged extreme black holes.
