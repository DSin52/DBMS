We consider the properties of an ensemble of universes as function of size,where size is defined in terms of the asymptotic value of the Hubble constant(or, equivalently, the value of the cosmological constant). We assume thatstandard model parameters depend upon size in a manner that we have previouslysuggested, and provide additional motivation for that choice. Given theseassumptions, it follows that universes with different sizes will have differentphysical properties, and we estimate, very roughly, that only if a universe hasa size within a factor of a square root of two or so of our own will it supportlife as we know it. We discuss implications of this picture for some of thebasic problems of cosmology and particle physics, as well as the difficultiesthis point of view creates.
