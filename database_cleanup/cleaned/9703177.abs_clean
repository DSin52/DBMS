We consider the loop quantization of Maxwell theory. A quantization of thistype leads to a quantum theory in which the fundamental excitations areloop-like rather than particle-like. Each such loop plays the role of aquantized Faraday's line of electric flux. We find that the quantizationdepends on an arbitrary choice of a parameter e that carries the dimension ofelectric charge. For each value of e an electric charge that can be containedinside a bounded spatial region is automatically quantized in units ofhbar/4*pi*e. The requirement of consistency with the quantization of electriccharge observed in our Universe fixes a value of the, so far arbitrary,parameter e of the theory. Finally, we compare the ambiguity in the choice ofparameter e with the beta-ambiguity that, as pointed by Immirzi, arises in theloop quantization of general relativity, and comment on a possible way thisambiguity can be fixed.
