The analog of the principal SO(3) subalgebra of a finite dimensional simpleLie algebra can be defined for any hyperbolic Kac Moody algebra g(A) associatedwith a symmetrizable Cartan matrix A, and coincides with the non-compact groupSO(1,2). We exhibit the decomposition of g(A) into representations of SO(1,2);with the exception of the adjoint SO(1,2) algebra itself, all of theserepresentations are unitary. We compute the Casimir eigenvalues; the associated``exponents'' are complex and non-integer.
