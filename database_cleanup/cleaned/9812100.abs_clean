We explore the superstring theory on AdS_3 x S^3 x T^4 in the framework givenin hep-th/9806194. We argue on the Hilbert space of "space-time CFT", andespecially construct a suitable vacuum of this CFT from the physical degrees offreedom of the superstring theory in bulk. We first construct it explicitly inthe case of p=1, and then present a proposal for the general cases of p>1.After giving some completion of the GKS's constructions of the higher modeoperators (in particular, of those including spin fields), we also make somecomparison between the space-time CFT and T^{4kp}/S_{kp} SCFT, namely, withrespect to the physical spectrum of chiral primaries and some algebraicstructures of bosonic and fermionic oscillators in both theories. We alsoobserve how our proposal about the Hilbert space of space-time CFT leads to asatisfactory correspondence between the spectrum of chiral primaries of boththeories in the cases of p>1.
