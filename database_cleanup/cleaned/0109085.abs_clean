Title: Division Algebras and Extended SuperKdVs

Comments: 6 pages, LaTex; Talk given at the XXXVII Karpacz Winter School in

Theoretical Physics (February 2001). To appear in the proceedingsThe division algebras R, C, H, O are used to construct and analyze theN=1,2,4,8 supersymmetric extensions of the KdV hamiltonian equation. Inparticular a global N=8 super-KdV system is introduced and shown to admit aPoisson bracket structure given by the "Non-Associative N=8 SuperconformalAlgebra".
