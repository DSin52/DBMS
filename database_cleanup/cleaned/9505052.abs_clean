We review explicitly known exact $D=4$ solutions with Minkowski signature inclosed bosonic string theory. Classical string solutions with space-timeinterpretation are represented by conformal sigma models. Two large(intersecting) classes of solutions are described by gauged WZW models and`chiral null models' (models with conserved chiral null current). The latterclass includes plane-wave type backgrounds (admitting a covariantly constantnull Killing vector) and backgrounds with two null Killing vectors (e.g.,fundamental string solution). $D>4$ chiral null models describe some exact$D=4$ solutions with electromagnetic fields, for example, extreme electricblack holes, charged fundamental strings and their generalisations. Inaddition, there exists a class of conformal models representing axiallysymmetric stationary magnetic flux tube backgrounds (including, in particular,the dilatonic Melvin solution). In contrast to spherically symmetric chiralnull models for which the corresponding conformal field theory is not knownexplicitly, the magnetic flux tube models (together with some non-semisimpleWZW models) are among the first examples of solvable unitary conformal stringmodels with non-trivial $D=4$ curved space-time interpretation. For thesemodels one is able to express the quantum hamiltonian in terms of free fieldsand to find explicitly the physical spectrum and string partition function.
