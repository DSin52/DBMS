The conception of the conformal phase transiton (CPT), which is relevant forthe description of non-perturbative dynamics in gauge theories, is introducedand elaborated. The main features of such a phase transition are established.In particular, it is shown that in the CPT there is an abrupt change of thespectrum of light excitations at the critical point, though the phasetransition is continuous. The structure of the effective action describing theCPT is elaborated and its connection with the dynamics of the partiallyconserved dilatation current is pointed out. The applications of these resultsto QCD, models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking, and to thedescription of the phase diagram in (3+1)-dimensional $ SU(N_c)$ gauge theoriesare considered.
