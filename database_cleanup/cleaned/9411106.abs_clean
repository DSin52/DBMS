Representations of $SO(5)_{q}$ can be constructed on bases such that eitherthe Chevalley triplet $(e_{1},\;f_{1},\;h_{1})$ or $(e_{2},\;f_{2},\;h_{2})$has the standard $SU(2)_{q}$ matrix elements. The other triplet in each caseshas a more complicated action. The $q$-deformation of such representationspresent striking differences. In one case a {\bf non-minimal} deformation isfound to be essential. This is explained and illustrated below. Broaderinterests of a parallel use of the two bases are pointed out.
