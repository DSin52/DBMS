We apply supersymmetric discrete light-cone quantization (SDLCQ) to the studyof supersymmetric Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons (SYM-CS) theory on R x S^1 x S^1. Oneof the compact directions is chosen to be light-like and the other to bespace-like. Since the SDLCQ regularization explicitly preserves supersymmetry,this theory is totally finite, and thus we can solve for bound-state wavefunctions and masses numerically without renormalizing. The Chern-Simons termis introduced here to provide masses for the particles while remaining totallywithin a supersymmetric context. We examine the free, weak and strong-couplingspectrum. The transverse direction is discussed as a model for universal extradimensions in the gauge sector. The wave functions are used to calculate thestructure functions of the lowest mass states. We discuss the properties ofKaluza-Klein states and focus on how they appear at strong coupling. We alsodiscuss a set of anomalously light states which are reflections of the exactBogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield states of the underlying SYM theory.
