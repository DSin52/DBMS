Journal-ref: J.Math.Phys. 36 (1995) 4436-4449

$*$-structures on quantum and braided spaces of the type defined via anR-matrix are studied. These include $q$-Minkowski and $q$-Euclidean spaces asadditive braided groups. The duality between the $*$-braided groups of vectorsand covectors is proved and some first applications to braided geometry aremade.
