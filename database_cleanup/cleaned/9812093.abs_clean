If the fundamental type-I string scale is of the order of few TeV, theproblem of the gauge hierarchy is that of understanding why some dimensionstransverse to our brane-world are so large. The technical aspect of thisproblem, as usually formulated, is `why quantum corrections do not modifydrastically the masses and other parameters of the Standard Model'. We arguethat within type-I perturbation theory, the technical hierarchy problem issolved (a) if all massless tadpoles cancel locally over distances of order thestring length in the transverse space, or (b) if the massless fields withuncancelled local tadpoles propagate `effectively' in $d_\perp \ge 2$ largetransverse dimensions. These restrictions ensure that loop corrections to theStandard Model parameters decouple from the four-dimensional Planck scale,except when there are uncancelled tadpoles in $d_\perp =2$ in which case thedependence on $M_P$ is logarithmic. This latter case is thus singled out as theonly one in which the origin of the hierarchy would not be attributed entirelyto `out of this world' bulk physics. The role of the renormalization groupequations in summing the leading large logs is replaced by the classical 2dsupergravity equations in the transverse space.
