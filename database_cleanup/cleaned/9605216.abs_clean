In four dimensions there are 4 different types of extremal Maxwell/scalarblack holes characterized by a scalar coupling parameter $a$ with$a=0,1/\sqrt{3} , 1 , \sqrt{3}$. These black holes can be described asintersections of ten--dimensional non-singular Ramond-Ramond objects,i.e.~$D$-branes, waves and Taub-NUT solitons. Using this description it can beshown that the four--dimensional black holes decompactify near the core tohigher--dimensional {\em non-singular} solutions. In terms of thesehigher--dimensional non-singular solutions we define a non-vanishing entropyfor all four black hole types from a four--dimensional point of view.
