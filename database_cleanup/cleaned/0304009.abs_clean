We discuss realizations of the SL(2,R) current algebra in the hyperbolicbasis using free scalar fields. It has been previously shown by Satoh how sucha realization can be used to describe the principal continuous representationsof SL(2,R). We extend this work by introducing another realization thatcorresponds to the principal discrete representations of SL(2,R). We show thatin these realizations spectral flow can be interpreted as twisting of a freescalar field. Finally, we discuss how these realizations can be obtained fromthe BTZ Lagrangian.
