CaseAuthors: U. Bruzzo and J.A. Dominguez Perez

Comments: 16 pages, AmSTeX. Requires a style with automatic numbering that is

available from the first author. Report # 182/1991A relative Picard theory in the context of graded manifolds is introduced. ABerezinian calculus and a theory of connections over SUSY-curves aresystematically developed, and used to prove a Gauss-Bonnet theorem for linebundles in that setting and to discuss the validity of a flatness theorem
