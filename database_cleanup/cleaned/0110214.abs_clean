We search for Ricci flat, K\"{a}hler geometries which are asymptotic to thecone whose base is the space T^{11} by working out covariantly constant spinorequations. The metrics we find are singular in the interior and introducingparallel D3-branes does not form regular event horizons cloaking the nakedsingularities. We also work out a supersymmetric ansatz involving only themetric and the 5-form field corresponding to D3-branes wrapping over thenon-trivial 2-cycle of T^{11}. We find a system of first-order equations andargue that the solution has an event horizon and the ADM mass per unit volumediverges logarithmically.
