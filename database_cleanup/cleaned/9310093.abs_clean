We analyze a possibility of experimental detection of the contribution of theKaluza-Klein tower of heavy particles to scattering cross-section in asix-dimensional scalar model with two dimensions being compactified to thetorus with the radii $R$. It is shown that there is a noticeable effect evenfor the energies of colliding particles below $R^{-1}$ which may be observed infuture collider experiments if $R^{-1}$ is of the order of $1 TeV$.
