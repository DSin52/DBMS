Comments: LaTeX, 8 pages, Talk presented at the XXXIII Karpacz Winter School

This is a short review of the results on the associativity algebras and WDVVequations found recently for the Seiberg-Witten solutions of N=2 4d SUSY gaugetheories. The presentation is mostly based on the integrable treatment of thesesolutions.
