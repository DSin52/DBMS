We present a new bound for the worldvolume actions of branes with aWess-Zumino term. For this we introduce a generalization of calibrations forwhich the calibration form is not closed. We then apply our construction tofind the M-5-brane worldvolume solitons in an AdS background that saturate thisbound. We show that these worldvolume solitons are supersymmetric and that theysatisfy differential equations which generalize those of standard calibrations.
