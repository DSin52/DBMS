The path integral of a gauge theory is studied in Coulomb-like gauges. TheChrist-Lee terms of operator ordering are reproduced {\it{within}} the pathintegration framework. In the presence of fermions, a new operator term, inaddition to that of Christ-Lee, is discovered. Such kind of terms is found tobe instrumental in restoring the invariance of the effective Lagrangian under afield dependent gauge transformation, which underlies the BRST symmetry. Aunitary regularization scheme which maintains manifest BRST symmetry and isfree from energy divergences is proposed for a nonabelian gauge field.
