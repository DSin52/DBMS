The so-called ``brick-wall model'' is a semi-classical approach that has beenused to explain black hole entropy in terms of thermal matter fields. Here, weapply the brick-wall formalism to thermal bulk fields in a Randall-Sundrumbrane world scenario. In this case, the black hole entity is really astring-like object in the anti-de Sitter bulk, while appearing as aSchwarzchild black hole to observers living on the brane. In spite of theseexotic circumstances, we establish that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy law ispreserved. Although a similar calculation was recently considered in theliterature, this prior work invoked a simplifying assumption (which we avoid)that can not be adequately justified.
