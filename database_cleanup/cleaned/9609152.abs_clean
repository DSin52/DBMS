A geometrical approach in the non-symmetric connection framework is employedto examine the issue of higher order $\alpha'$ corrections to D=10 typeIIB superstring backgrounds with a covariantly constant null Killing isometryand non-zero Ramond-Ramond field content. These describe generalizedsupersymmetric string waves and were obtained recently by us through theS-duality transformation of purely NS-NS plane wave backgrounds. We find thatthe backgrounds are exact subject to the existence of certain fieldredefinitions and provided certain restrictive conditions are satisfied.
