Comments: posters presented on the workshop "Confinement, duality and

non-perturbative aspects of QCD", 23 June-4 July, Cambridge, England; 9pages, Latex, 4 eps-figures loaded, using special package with command"\usepackage{epsfig}"Modified similarity renormalization of Hamiltonians is proposed, thatperformes by means of flow equations the similarity transformation ofHamiltonian in the particle number space. This enables to renormalize in theenergy space the field theoretical Hamiltonian and makes possible to work in asevere trancated Fock space for the renormalized Hamiltonian.
