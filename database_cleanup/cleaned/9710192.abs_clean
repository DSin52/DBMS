M(atrix) theory description is investigated for M-theory compactified onnon-orientable manifolds. Relevant M(atrix) theory is obtained by Fouriertransformation in a way consistent with T-duality. For nine-dimensionalcompactification on Klein bottle and M\"obius strip, we show that M(atrix)theory is (2+1)-dimensional ${\cal N} = 8$ supersymmetric U(N) gauge theorydefined on dual Klein bottle and dual Moebius strip parameter spacerespectively. The latter requires a twisted sector consisting of sixteen chiralfermions localized parallel to the boundary of dual Moebius strip and definesNarain moduli space of Chaudhuri-Hockney-Lykken heterotic string. Forsix-dimensional CHL compactification on S1/Z2*T4 we show that low-energydynamics of M(atrix) theory is described by (5+1)-dimensional ${\cal N} = 8$supersymmetric U(N)$\times$U(N) gauge theory defined on dual orbifold parameterspace of S1*K3/Z2. Spacetime spectrum is deduced from BPS gauge fieldconfigurations consistent with respective involutions and is shown to agreewith results from M-theory analysis.
