Comments: 39 pages, 13 figures

We analyze the classical stability of string cosmologies driven by thedynamics of orientifold planes. These models are related to time-dependentorbifolds, and resolve the orbifold singularities which are otherwiseproblematic by introducing orientifold planes. In particular, we show that theinstability discussed by Horowitz and Polchinski for pure orbifold models isresolved by the presence of the orientifolds. Moreover, we discuss the issue ofstability of the cosmological Cauchy horizon, and we show that it is stable tosmall perturbations due to in-falling matter.
