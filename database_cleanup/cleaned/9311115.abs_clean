We study the Regge regime of QCD as a special regime of lattice gauge theoryon an asymmetric lattice. This lattice has a spacing $a_0 $ in the longitudinaldirection and a spacing $a_t $ in the transversal direction. The limit$\frac{a_{0}}{a_{t}} \to 0$ corresponds to correlation functions with smalllongitudinal and large transversal coordinates, i.e. large $s$ and small $t$.On this lattice the longitudinal dynamics is described by the usualtwo-dimensional chiral field in finite volume and the transversal dynamics isemerged through an effective interaction of boundary terms of the longitudinaldynamics. The effective interaction depends crucially on the spectrum of thetwo-dimensional chiral field. Massless exitations produce an effective2-dimensional action which is different from the action recently proposed byH.Verlinde and E.Verlinde. Massive exitations give raise to an effective actionlocated on the contour in the longitudinal plane.
