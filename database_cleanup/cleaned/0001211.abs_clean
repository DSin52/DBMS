In the dilatonic domain wall model, we study the Schwarzschild black hole asa solution to the Kaluza-Klein (KK) zero mode effective action which isequivalent to the Brans-Dicke (BD) model with a potential. This can describethe large Randall-Sundrum (RS) black hole whose horizon is to be theintersection of the black cigar with the brane.The black cigar located far from the AdS$_5$-horizon is known to be stable,but any explicit calculation for stability of the RS black hole at $z=0$ is notyet performed. Here its stability is investigated against the $z$-independentperturbations composed of odd, even parities of graviton ($h_{\mu\nu}$) and BDscalar($h_{44} = 2\phi $). It seems that the RS black hole is classicallyunstable because it has a potential instability at wavelength with $\lambda >1/(2k)$. However, this is not allowed inside an AdS$_5$-box of the size with$1/(2k)$. Thus the RS black hole becomes stable. The RS black hole can beconsidered as a stable remnant at $z=0 $ of the black cigar.
