Using N=2 Landau-Ginzburg theories, we examine the recent conjecturesrelating the SU(3) WZW modular invariants, finite subgroups of SU(3) andGorenstein singularities. All isolated three-dimensional Gorensteinsingularities do not appear to be related to any known Landau-Ginzburgtheories, but we present some curious observations which suggest that theSU(3)_n/SU(2)xU(1) Kazama-Suzuki model may be related to a deformed geometry ofC^3/Z_{n+3}xZ_{n+3}. The toric resolution diagrams of those particularsingularities are also seen to be classifying the diagonal modular invariantsof the SU(3)_n as well as the SU(2)_{n+1} WZW models.
