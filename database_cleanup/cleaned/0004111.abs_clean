We give the full lagrangean and supersymmetry transformation rules for D=5,N=2 supergravity interacting with an arbitrary number of vector, tensor andhyper-multiplets, with gauging of the R-symmetry group SU(2)_R as well as asubgroup K of the isometries of the scalar manifold. Among the many possibleapplications, this theory provides the setting where a supersymmetricbrane-world scenario could occur. We comment on the presence of AdS vacua andBPS solutions that would be relevant towards a supersymmetric smoothrealization of the Randall-Sundrum "alternative to compactification". We alsoadd some remarks on the connection between this most general 5D fully coupledsupergravity model and type IIB theory on the T^{11} manifold.
