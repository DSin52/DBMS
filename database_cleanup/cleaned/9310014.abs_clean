Title: The WZNW model by a perturbation of Witten's conformal solution

Authors: Oleg A. Soloviev

Comments: 5 pages, LaTex file, QMW-93-25. (The value of the second conformal

point of the perturbed WZNW model is presented. Please note that a title ischanged.)The WZNW model at the Witten conformal point is perturbed by the sigma modelterm. It is shown that in the large level k limit the perturbed WZNW systemwith negative k arrives at the WZNW model with positive k.
