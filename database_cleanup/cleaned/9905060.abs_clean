The infinite dimensional generalization of the quantum mechanics of extendedobjects, namely, the quantum field theory of extended objects is employed toaddress the hitherto nonrenormalizable gravitational interaction followingwhich the cosmological constant problem is addressed. The response of anelectron to a weak gravitational field (linear approximation) is studied andthe order $\alpha$ correction to the magnetic gravitational moment is computed.
