We study cosmological backgrounds from the point of view of the dS/CFTcorrespondence and its renormalization group flow extension. We focus on thecase where gravity is coupled to a single scalar with a potential. Depending onthe latter, the scalar can drive both inflation and the accelerated expansion(dS) phase in the far future. We also comment on quintessence scenarios, andflows familiar from the AdS/CFT correspondence. We finally make a tentativeembedding of this discussion in string theory where the scalar is the dilatonand the potential is generated at the perturbative level.
