We propose a new constraint on the structure of strongly coupled fieldtheories. The constraint takes the form of an inequality limiting the number ofdegrees of freedom in the infrared description of a theory relative to thenumber of underlying, ultraviolet degrees of freedom. We apply the inequalityto a variety of theories (both supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric), where itagrees with all known results and leads to interesting new constraints on lowenergy spectra. We discuss the relation of this constraint to RenormalizationGroup c-theorems.
