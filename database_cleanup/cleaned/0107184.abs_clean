In this article we study the noncommutative description of the DBI Lagrangianand its T-dual counterpart. We restrict the freedoms of the noncommutativityparameters of these Lagrangians. Therefore the noncommutativity parameter, theeffective metric, the effective coupling constant of the string and the extramodulus ${\tilde \Phi}$ of the effective T-dual theory, can be expressed interms of the closed string variables $g$, $B$, $g_s$ and the noncommutativityparameter of the effective theory of open string.
