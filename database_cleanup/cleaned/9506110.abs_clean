Title: Aspects of Duality in N=2 String Vacua

Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B357 (1995) 71-75

We collect further evidence for the proposed duality between $N=2$ heteroticand type II string vacua in a specific model suggested by Kachru and Vafa. Inthe gauge sector the previous analysis is extended; it is further shown thatthe duality also holds for the one--loop gravitational couplings to the vectormultiplets.
