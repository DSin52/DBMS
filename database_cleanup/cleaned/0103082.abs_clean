The behavior of the divergent part of the bulk AdS/CFT effective action isconsidered with respect to the special finite diffeomorphism transformationsacting on the boundary as a Weyl transformation of the boundary metric. Theresulting 1-cocycle of the Weyl group is in full agreement with the 1-cocycleof the Weyl group obtained from the cohomological consideration of theeffective action of the corresponding CFT.
