In this paper a class of conformal field theories with nonabelian anddiscrete group of symmetry is investigated. These theories are realized interms of free scalar fields starting from the simple $b-c$ systems and scalarfields on algebraic curves. The Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations for theconformal blocks can be explicitly solved. Besides of the fact that one obtainsin this way an entire class of theories in which the operators obey anonstandard statistics, these systems are interesting in exploring theconnection between statistics and curved space-times, at least in the twodimensional case.
