Authors: Dmitri V. Fursaev

Comments: 5 pages, latex, no figures, corrected some typos

It is pointed out that the entanglement entropy of quantum fields near thehorizon of a two-dimensional black hole can be derived by means of theconformal field theory. This can be done in a way analogous to the computationof the entropy of BTZ black holes. The important feature of the considered caseis that the degrees of freedom of the conformal theory are states localized inthe physical space-time.
