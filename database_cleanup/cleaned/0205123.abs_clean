In this work we propose new non-commutative gauge theories that describe thedynamics of branes localized along twisted conjugacy classes on groupmanifolds. Our proposal is based on a careful analysis of the exact microscopicsolution and it generalizes the matrix models (`fuzzy gauge theories') that areused to study e.g. the bound state formation of point-like branes in a curvedbackground. We also construct a large number of classical solutions andinterpret them in terms of condensation processes on branes localized alongtwisted conjugacy classes.
