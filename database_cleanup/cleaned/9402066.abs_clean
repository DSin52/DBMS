We show that $QCD_2$ with adjoint fermions involves instantons due tonontrivial $\pi_1[SU(N)/Z_N]~=~Z_N$. At high temperatures, quasiclassicalapproximation works and the action and the form of effective (with account ofquantum corrections) instanton solution can be evaluated. Instanton presents alocalized configuration with the size $\propto g^{-1}$. At $N=2$, it involvesexactly 2 zero fermion modes and gives rise to fermion condensate$<\bar{\lambda}^a \lambda^a>_T$ which falls off $\propto \exp\{-\pi^{3/2}T/g\}$ at high $T$ but remains finite.At low temperatures, both instanton and bosonization arguments also exhibitthe appearance of fermion condensate $<\bar{\lambda}^a \lambda^a>_{T=0} ~\sim~g$. For $N>2$, the situation is paradoxical. There are $2(N-1)$ fermion zeromodes in the instanton background which implies the absence of the condensatein the massless limit. From the other hand, bosonization arguments suggest theappearance of the condensate for any $N$. Possible ways to resolve this paradox(which occurs also in some 4-dim gauge theories) are discussed.
