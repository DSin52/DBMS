We carry out a general analysis of the representations of the superconformalalgebras SU(2,2/N), OSp(8/4,R) and OSp(8^*/4) and give their realization insuperspace. We present a construction of their UIR's by multiplication of thedifferent types of massless superfields ("supersingletons"). Particularattention is paid to the so-called "short multiplets". Representationsundergoing shortening have "protected dimension" and correspond to BPS statesin the dual supergravity theory in anti-de Sitter space. These results arerelevant for the classification of multitrace operators in boundary conformallyinvariant theories as well as for the classification of AdS black holespreserving different fractions of supersymmetry.
