In the framework of started in Ref.[1] construction procedure of the generalsuperfield quantization method for gauge theories in Lagrangian formalism therules for Hamiltonian formulation of general superfield theory of fields (GSTF)are introduced and are on the whole considered.Mathematical means developed in [1] for Lagrangian formulation of GSTF areextended to use in Hamiltonian one. Hamiltonization for Lagrangian formulationof GSTF via Legendre transform of superfunction $S_{L}\bigl({\calA}(\theta),{\stackrel{\circ}{\cal A}}(\theta),\theta\bigr)$ with respect to${\stackrel{\circ}{{\cal A}^{\imath}}}(\theta)$ is considered. As result on thespace $T^{\ast}_{odd}{\cal M}_{cl}\times \{\theta\}$ parametrized bysupervariables ${\cal A}^{\imath}(\theta)$, ${\cal A}^{\ast}_{\imath}(\theta)$,$\theta$ the superfunction $S_{H}({\cal A}(\theta),{\calA}^{\ast}(\theta),\theta)$ is defined. Being equivalent to different types ofEuler-Lagrange equations the distinct Hamiltonian systems are investigated.Translations along $\theta$ for superfunctions on $T^{\ast}_{odd}{\calM}_{cl}\times \{\theta\}$ being associated with these systems are studied.Various types of antibrackets and differential operators acting on$C^{k}\bigl(T^{\ast}_{odd}{\cal M}_{cl} \times \{\theta\} \bigr)$ areconsidered.Component (on $\theta$)formulation for GSTF quantities and operations isproduced. Realization of the GSTF general scheme is demonstrated on 6 models.
