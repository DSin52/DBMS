These are expository lectures reviewing(1) recent developments in two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, and(2) the construction of topological field theory Lagrangians. Topologicalfield theory is discussed from the point of view of infinite-dimensionaldifferential geometry. We emphasize the unifying role of equivariant cohomologyboth as the underlying principle in the formulation of BRST transformation lawsand as a central concept in the geometrical interpretation of topological fieldtheory path integrals.
