In AdS5, the coupling for bulk gauge bosons runs logarithmically, not as apower law. For this reason, one can preserve perturbative unification ofcouplings. Depending on the cutoff, this can occur at a high scale. We discusssubtleties in the calculation and present a regularization scheme motivated bythe holographic correspondence. We find that generically, as in the standardmodel, the couplings almost unify. For specific choices of the cutoff andnumber of scalar multiplets, there is good agreement between the measuredcouplings and the assumption of high scale unification.
