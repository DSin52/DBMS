Title: Quasifinite highest weight modules over the Lie algebra of differential

operators on the circleJournal-ref: Commun.Math.Phys. 157 (1993) 429-457

We classify positive energy representations with finite degeneracies ofthe Lie algebra $W_{1+\infty}\/$ and construct them in terms ofrepresentation theory of the Lie algebra $\hatgl ( \infty R_m )\/$ ofinfinite matrices with finite number of non-zero diagonals over the algebra$R_m = \C [ t ] / ( t^{m + 1} )\/$.  The unitary ones are classified as well.Similar results are obtained for the sin-algebras.
