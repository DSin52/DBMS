Title: Holography for degenerate boundaries

Comments: 24 pages, ReVTeX, typos corrected

We discuss the AdS/CFT correspondence for negative curvature Einsteinmanifolds whose conformal boundary is degenerate in the sense that it is ofcodimension greater than one. In such manifolds, hypersurfaces of constantradius do not blow up uniformly as one increases the radius; examples includeproducts of hyperbolic spaces and the Bergman metric. We find that there is awell-defined correspondence between the IR regulated bulk theory and conformalfield theory defined in a background whose degenerate geometry is regulated bythe same parameter. We are hence able to make sense of supergravity inbackgrounds such as $AdS_{3} \times H^{2}$.
