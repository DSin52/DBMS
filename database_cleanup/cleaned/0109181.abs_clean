Title: A discrete leading symbol and spectral asymptotics for natural

differential operatorsAuthors: Ivan Avramidi and Thomas Branson

Comments: 37 pages, LaTeX

We initiate a systematic study of natural differential operators inRiemannian geometry whose leading symbols are not of Laplace type. Inparticular, we define a discrete leading symbol for such operators which may becomputed pointwise, or from spectral asymptotics. We indicate how this can beapplied to the computation of another kind of spectral asymptotics, namelyasymptotic expansions of fundamental solutions, and to the computation ofconformally covariant operators.
