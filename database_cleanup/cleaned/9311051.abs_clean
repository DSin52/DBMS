Title: Universality of the universal R-matrix and applications to quantum

integrable systemsComments: 5 pages. Presented at 'Generalised Symmetries in Physics' (July

26-29,1993,ASI,Clausthal,Germany)SystemsResults obtained by us are overviewed from a general set up. The universal$R$-matrix is exploited to obtain various important relations and structuresinvolved in quantum group algebra, which are used subsequently for generatingdifferent classes of quantum integrable systems through a systematic scheme.This recovers known models as well as discovers a series of new ones.
