We discuss the relationship between geometry, the renormalization group (RG)and gravity. We begin by reviewing our recent work on crossover problems infield theory. By crossover we mean the interpolation between differentrepresentations of the conformal group by the action of relevant operators. Atthe level of the RG this crossover is manifest in the flow between differentfixed points induced by these operators. The description of such flows requiresa RG which is capable of interpolating between qualitatively different degreesof freedom. Using the conceptual notion of course graining we construct somesimple examples of such a group introducing the concept of a ``floating'' fixedpoint around which one constructs a perturbation theory. Our consideration ofcrossovers indicates that one should consider classes of field theories,described by a set of parameters, rather than focus on a particular one. Thespace of parameters has a natural metric structure. We examine the geometry ofthis space in some simple models and draw some analogies between this space,superspace and minisuperspace.
