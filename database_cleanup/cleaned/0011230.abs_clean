We study gravitational aspects of Brane-World scenarios. We show that thebulk Einstein equations together with the junction condition imply that theinduced metric on the brane satisfies the full non-linear Einstein equationswith a specific effective stress energy tensor. This result holds for any valueof the bulk cosmological constant. The analysis is done by either placing thebrane close to infinity or by considering the local geometry near the brane. Inthe case that the bulk spacetime is asymptotically AdS, we show that theeffective stress energy tensor is equal to the sum of the stress energy tensorof matter localized on the brane and of the holographic stress energy tensorappearing in the AdS/CFT duality. In addition, there are specifichigher-curvature corrections to Einstein's equations. We analyze in detail thecase of asymptotically flat spacetime. We obtain asymptotic solutions ofEinstein's equations and show that the effective Newton's constant on the branedepends on the position of the brane.
