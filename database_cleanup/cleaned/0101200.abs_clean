Recently a boundary string field theory that had been proposed some time ago,was used to calculate correctly the ratios of D-brane (both BPS and non-BPS)tensions. We discuss how this work is related to the boundary state formalismand open string closed string duality, and argue that the latter clarifies whythe correct tension ratios are obtained in these recent calculations.
