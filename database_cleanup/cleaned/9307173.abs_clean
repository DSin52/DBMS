We find the exact matrix model description of two dimensional Yang-Millstheories on a cylinder or on a torus and with an arbitrary compact gauge group.This matrix model is the singlet sector of a $c =1$ matrix model where thematrix field is in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. We alsoprove that the basic constituents of the theory are Sutherland fermions in thezero coupling limit, and this leads to an interesting connection between twodimensional gauge theories and one dimensional integrable systems. Inparticular we derive for all the classical groups the exact grand canonicalpartition function of the free fermion system corresponding to a twodimensional gauge theory on a torus.
