We explicitly construct N=1 worldvolume supersymmetric minimal off-shellGoldstone superfield actions for two options of 1/2 partial spontaneousbreaking of AdS5 supersymmetry SU(2,2|1) corresponding to its nonlinearrealizations in the supercosets with the AdS5 and AdS5 X S1 bosonic parts. Therelevant Goldstone supermultiplets are comprised, respectively, by improvedtensor and chiral N=1 superfields. The second action is obtained from the firstone by duality transformation. In the bosonic sectors they yield static-gaugeNambu-Goto actions for L3-brane on AdS5 and scalar 3-brane on AdS5 X S1.
