Title: A generating formulation for free higher spin massless fields

Authors: Arkady Yu. Segal

Comments: 12 pages

An action describing the dynamics of an infinite collection of masslessinteger spin fields with spin s=0,1,2,3, ...$\infty$ corresponding to totallysymmetric Young tableaux representations of Poincare and anti-de Sitter groupsis constructed, in any dimension d, in terms of two functions on a2d-dimensional manifold. The action is represented by an integral localized ona 2d-1-dimensional hypersurface.
