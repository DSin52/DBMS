In the first part of this paper we investigate the operator aspect ofhigher-rank supersymmetric model which is introduced as a Lie theoreticextension of the $N=2$ minimal model with the simplest case $su(2)$corresponding to the $N=2$ minimal model.In particular we identify the analogs of chirality conditions and chiralring. In the second part we construct a class of topological conformal fieldtheories starting with this higher-rank supersymmetric model. We show theBRST-exactness of the twisted stress-energy tensor, find out physicalobservables and discuss how to make their correlation functions. It isemphasized that in the case of $su(2)$ the topological field theory constructedin this paper is distinct from the one obtained by twisting the $N=2$ minimalmodel through the usual procedure.
