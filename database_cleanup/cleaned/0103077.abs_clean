We examine the lowest order quantum corrections to the effective actionarising from a quantized real scalar field in the Randall-Sundrum backgroundspacetime. The leading term is the familiar vacuum, or Casimir, energy density.The next term represents an induced gravity term that can renormalize the4-dimensional Newtonian gravitational constant. The calculations are performedfor an arbitrary spacetime dimension. Two inequivalent boundary conditions,corresponding to twisted and untwisted field configurations, are considered. Acareful discussion of the regularization and renormalization of the effectiveaction is given, with the relevant counterterms found. It is shown that therequirement of self-consistency of the Randall-Sundrum solution is not simply amatter of minimizing the Casimir energy density. The massless, conformallycoupled scalar field results are obtained as a special limiting case of ourresults. We clarify a number of differences with previous work.
