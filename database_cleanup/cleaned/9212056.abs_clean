The posibility of quantizing the anomalous $SU(N)$ Yang--Mills modelpreserving the symmetry under the orthogonal subgroup is indicated. Thecorresponding Wess--Zumino action (1-cocycle) possesses the additional $SO(N)$symmetry and can be expressed in terms of chiral fields taking values in thehomogeneous space $SU(N)/SO(N)$. The modified anomaly and the constraintscommutator (2-cocycle) are calculated.
