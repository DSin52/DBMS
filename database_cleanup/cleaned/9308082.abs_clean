Title: Path Integral Discussion of Two and- Three-Dimensional $\delta$-Function

PerturbationsAuthors: Christian Grosche

Comments: 32 pages, AmSTeX

The incorporation of two- and three-dimensional $\delta$-functionperturbations into the path-integral formalism is discussed. In contrast to theone-dimensional case, a regularization procedure is needed due to thedivergence of the Green-function $G^{(V)}(\vec x,\vec y;E)$, ($\vec x,\vecy\in\bbbr^2,\bbbr^3$) for $\vec x=\vec y$, corresponding to a potential problem$V(\vec x)$. The known procedure to define proper self-adjoint extensions forHamiltonians with deficiency indices can be used to regularize the pathintegral, giving a perturbative approach for $\delta$-function perturbations intwo and three dimensions in the context of path integrals. Several examplesillustrate the formalism.
