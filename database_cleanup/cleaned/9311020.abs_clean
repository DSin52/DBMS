In this paper we present a new series of 3-dimensional integrable latticemodels with $N$ colors. The case $N=2$ generalizes the elliptic model of ourprevious paper. The weight functions of the models satisfy modified tetrahedronequations with $N$ states and give a commuting family of two-layertransfer-matrices. The dependence on the spectral parameters corresponds to thestatic limit of the modified tetrahedron equations and weights areparameterized in terms of elliptic functions. The models contain two freediscuss symmetry properties of weight functions of the models.
