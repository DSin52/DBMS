The previous discussion \cite{ezawa} on reducing the phase space of the firstorder Einstein gravity in 2+1 dimensions is reconsidered. We construct a \lq\lqcorrect" physical phase space in the case of positive cosmological constant,taking into account the geometrical feature of SO(3,1) connections. Aparametrization which unifies the two sectors of the physical phase space isalso given.
