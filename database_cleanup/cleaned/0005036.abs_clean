It has been conjectured that the tachyonic lump solution of the open bosonicstring field theory describing a D-brane represents a D-brane of one lowerdimension. We place the lump on a circle of finite radius and develop a variantof the level expansion scheme that allows systematic account of all higherderivative terms in the string field theory action, and gives a calculationalscheme that can be carried to arbitrary accuracy. Using this approach we obtainlump masses that agree with expected D-brane masses to an accuracy of about 1%.We find convincing evidence that in string field theory the lump representing aD-brane is an extended object with a definite profile. A gaussian fit to thelump gives a 6-sigma size of 9.3 \sqrt{\alpha'}. The level truncation schemedeveloped here naturally gives rise to an infrared and ultraviolet cut-off, andmay be useful in the study of quantum string field theory.
