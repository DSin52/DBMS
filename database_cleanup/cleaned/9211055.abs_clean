Title: Dynamics of the conformal factor in 4D gravity

Authors: I. Antoniadis

Comments: Invited talk at the Spring Workshop on String Theory, Trieste, April

8-10, 1992, 16 pages, Ecole Polytechnique preprint CPTH-C207.1192We argue that 4D gravity is drastically modified at distances larger than thehorizon scale, due to the large infrared quantum fluctuations of the conformalpart of the metric. The infrared dynamics of the conformal factor is generatedby an effective action, induced by the trace anomaly of matter in curved space,analogous to the Polyakov action in two dimensions. The resulting effectivescalar theory is renormalizable, and possesses a non-trivial, infrared stablefixed point, characterized by an anomalous scaling dimension of the conformalfactor. We argue that this theory describes a large distance scale invariantphase of 4D gravity and provides a framework for a dynamical solution of thecosmological constant problem.
