We consider domain walls obtained by embedding the 1+1-dimensional$\phi^4$-kink in higher dimensions. We show that a suitably adapted dimensionalregularization method avoids the intricacies found in other regularizationschemes in both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric theories. This methodallows us to calculate the one-loop quantum mass of kinks and surface tensionsof kink domain walls in a very simple manner, yielding a compact d-dimensionalformula which reproduces many of the previous results in the literature. Amongthe new results is the nontrivial one-loop correction to the surface tension ofa 2+1 dimensional N=1 supersymmetric kink domain wall with chiral domain-wallfermions.
