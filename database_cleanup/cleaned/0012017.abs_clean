evaporating near-extremal black holesAuthors: Alessandro Fabbri, Diego J. Navarro and Jose Navarro-Salas

In this paper we investigate the effects of gravitational backreaction forthe late time Hawking radiation of evaporating near-extremal black holes. Thisproblem can be studied within the framework of an effective one-loop solvablemodel on AdS_2. We find that the Hawking flux goes down exponentially and it isproportional to a parameter which depends on details of the collapsing matter.This result seems to suggest that the information of the initial state is notlost and that the boundary of AdS_2 acts, at least at late times, as a sort ofstretched horizon in the Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime.
