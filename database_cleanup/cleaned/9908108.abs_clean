It is found that the 2-index potential in nonabelian theories does not behavegeometrically as a connection but that, considered as an element of the secondde Rham cohomology group twisted by a flat connection, it fits well with allthe properties assigned to it in various physical contexts. We also prove someresults on the Euler characteristic of the twisted de Rham complex. Finally,provided that some conditions are satisfied, we propose a non-Abeliangeneralisation of S-duality.
