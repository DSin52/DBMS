We present a systematic study of a new type of consistent ``Brane-worldKaluza-Klein Reduction,'' which describe fully non-linear deformations ofco-dimension one objects that arise as solutions of a large class of gaugedsupergravity theories in diverse dimensions, and whose world-volume theoriesare described by ungauged supergravities with one half of the originalsupersymmetry. In addition, we provide oxidations of these Ansatze which are ingeneral related to sphere compactified higher dimensional string theory orM-theory. Within each class we also provide explicit solutions of braneconfigurations localised on the world-brane. We show that at the Cauchy horizon(in the transverse dimension of the consistently Kaluza-Klein reducedworld-brane) there is a curvature singularity for any configuration with anon-null Riemann curvature or a non-vanishing Ricci scalar that lives in theworld-brane. Since the massive Kaluza-Klein modes can be consistentlydecoupled, they cannot participate in regulating these singularities.
