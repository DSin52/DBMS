We show that the specific operators V^a appearing in the triplectic formalismcan be viewed as the anti-Hamiltonian vector fields generated by a second rankirreducible Sp(2) tensor. This allows for an explicit realization of thetriplectic algebra being constructed from an arbitrary Poisson bracket on thespace of the fields only, equipped by the flat Poisson connection. We show thatthe whole space of fields and antifields can be equipped with an evensupersymplectic structure when this Poisson bracket is non-degenerate. Thisobservation opens the possibility to provide the BRST/antiBRST path integral bya well-defined integration measure, as well as to establish a direct linkbetween the Sp(2) symmetric Lagrangian and Hamiltonian BRST quantizationschemes.
