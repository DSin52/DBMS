We provide a systematic construction for all n-particle form factors of theSU(N)_2/U(1)^{N-1}-homogeneous Sine-Gordon model in terms of generaldeterminant formulae for a huge class of local operators. The ultraviolet limitis carried out and the corresponding Virasoro central charge together with theconformal dimensions of various operators are identified. The renormalizationgroup flow is studied and we find a precise rule, depending on the relativeorder of magnitude of the resonance parameters, according to which the theorydecouples into new cosets along the flow.
