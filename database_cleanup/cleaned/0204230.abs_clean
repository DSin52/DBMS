The assignment of local observables in the vacuum sector, fulfilling thestandard axioms of local quantum theory, is known to determine uniquely acompact group G of gauge transformations of the first kind together with acentral involutive element k of G, and a complete normal algebra of fieldscarrying the localizable charges, on which k defines the Bose/Fermi grading.We show here that any such pair {G,k}, where G is compact metrizable, doesactually appear. The corresponding model can be chosen to fulfill also thesplit property.a model where the local algebras of observables are a suitable subnet of localalgebras of a possibly infinite product of free field theories.
