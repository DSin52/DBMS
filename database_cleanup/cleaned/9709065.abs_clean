An explicit solution in super Yang-Mills theory, which after T-dualitydescribes two sets of D4-branes at angles, is constructed. The gaugeconfiguration possesses 3/16 unbroken supersymmetry for the equal magnitudes offield strengths, and can be considered as the counterpart of the solution ofD=11 supergravity with the same amount of supersymmetry in the solutions givenby Gauntlett et al. The energy of the Born-Infeld action of the gaugeconfiguration gives further evidence for the geometrical interpretation as twosets of D4-branes at angles. The energy of super Yang-Mills theory is shown tocoincide with that of M(atrix) theory. This fact shows that the configurationwith 3/16 supersymmetry can be realized in M(atrix) theory, which describes twosets of longitudinal M5-branes (with common string direction) at angles.
