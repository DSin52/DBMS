It is shown that the quarks and leptons of the standard model, including aright-handed neutrino, can be obtained by gauging the holonomy groups ofcomplex projective spaces of complex dimensions two and three. The spectrumemerges as chiral zero modes of the Dirac operator coupled to gauge fields andthe demonstration involves an index theorem analysis on a general complexprojective space in the presence of topologically non-trivial SU(n)xU(1) gaugefields. The construction may have applications in type IIA string theory andnon-commutative geometry.
