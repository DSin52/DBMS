We discuss massive scalar field with conformal coupling inFriedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe of special type with constantelectromagnetic field. Treating an external gravitational-electromagneticbackground exactly, at first time the proper-time representations for out-in,in-in, and out-out scalar Green functions are explicitly constructed asproper-time integrals over the corresponding (complex) contours. Thevacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitudes and number of created particles arefound and vacuum instability is discussed. The mean values of the current andenergy-momentum tensor are evaluated, and different approximations for them areinvestigated. The back reaction of the particles created to the electromagneticfield is estimated in different regimes. The connection between proper-timemethod and effective action is outlined. The effective action in scalar QED inweakly-curved FRW Universe (De Sitter space) with weak constant electromagneticfield is found as derivative expansion over curvature and electromagnetic fieldstrength. Possible further applications of the results are briefly mentioned.
