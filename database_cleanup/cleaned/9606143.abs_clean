When Alf`ven effect is peresent in magnetohydrodynamics one is naturally leadto consider conformal field theories, which have logarithmic terms in theircorrelation functions. We discuss the implications of such logarithmic termsand find a unique conformal field theory with centeral charge$c=-\frac{209}{7}$, within the border of the minimal series, which satisfiesall the constraints. The energy espectrum is found to be \newline $E(k)\simk^{-\frac{13}{7}} \log{k}$.
