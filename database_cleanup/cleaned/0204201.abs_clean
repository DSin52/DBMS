Five-brane distributions with no strong coupling problems and high symmetryare studied. The simplest configuration corresponds to a spherical shell ofbranes with S^3 geometry and symmetry. The equations of motions withdelta-function sources are carefully solved in such backgrounds. Various otherbrane distributions with sixteen unbroken supercharges are described. They areassociated to exact world-sheet superconformal field theories with domain-wallsin space-time. We study the equations of gravitational fluctuations, findnormalizable modes of bulk 6-d gravitons and confirm the existence of a massgap. We also study the moduli of the configurations and derive their(normalizable) wave-functions. We use our results to calculate in acontrollable fashion using holography, the two-point function of the stresstensor of little string theory in these vacua.
