the first occasion where NCSYM appears in string theoryJournal-ref: Phys.Rev.Lett. 84 (2000) 2084-2087

In this note a lately proposed gravity dual of noncommutative Yang-Millstheory is derived from the relations, recently suggested by Seiberg and Witten,between closed string moduli and open string moduli. The only new input oneneeds is a simple form of the running string tension as a function of energy.This derivation provides convincing evidence that string theory integrates withthe holographical principle, and demonstrates a direct link betweennoncommutative Yang-Mills theory and holography.
