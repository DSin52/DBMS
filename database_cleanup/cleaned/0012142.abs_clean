This is a short review of the newly discovered ODp-theories that arenon-gravitational six-dimensional theories defined as the decoupling limit ofNS5-branes in the presence of a near-critical (p+1)-form RR fields. We discussthe motivation for these new theories, their definitions and properties, andtheir relation to NCOS theory, OM theory and Little String Theory, focusing onthe cases p=1,2.
