Title: Gauged WZNW models and coset constructions in relation to string

theoriesAuthors: Henric Rhedin

Comments: 105 pages, plain latex, Ph.D. Thesis

We start by giving a brief introduction to string theory with emphasis on theexample of the bosonic string. In order to fully appreciate string theory it isnecessary to study the dynamics of the surface that the string traces out whenmoving in space-time. This is described by what is known as conformal fieldtheory, which is the subject of chapter two. After this digression we return tostring theory to give some insight into how the results of the articlescontained in this thesis could provide with interesting ingredients forconstructions of realistic string theories. This is also continued on to someextent in chapter seven and eight. The articles in this thesis are discussingmainly two subjects, gauged WZNW models and affine branching functions. Thebackground for those issues is given in chapter seven and eight. In thearticles contained in this thesis we use two major tools. First affine Liealgebras and its representation theory, and secondly BRST quantization. Inchapter four and five we deal with affine Lie algebras, and in chapter six wetry to illuminate some issues on BRST quantization.
