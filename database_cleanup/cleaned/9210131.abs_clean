We study the statistics of vortices which appear in (2+1)--dimensionalspontaneously broken gauge theories, where a compact group G breaks to a finitenonabelian subgroup H. Two simple models are presented. In the first, a quantumstate which is symmetric under the interchange of a pair of indistinguishablevortices can be transformed into an antisymmetric state after the passagethrough the system of a third vortex with an appropriate $H$-flux element.Further, there exist states containing two indistinguishable spinless vorticeswhich obey Fermi statistics. These results generalize to loops of nonabeliancosmic string in 3+1 dimensions. In the second model, fractional analogues ofthe above behaviors occur. Also, composites of vortices in this theory maypossess fractional ``Cheshire spin'' which can be changed by passing anadditional vortex through the system.
