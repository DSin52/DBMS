We study quantum gravity on $dS_{3}$ using the Chern-Simons formulation ofthree -dimensional gravity. We derive an exact expression for the partitionfunction for quantum gravity on $dS_{3}$ in a Euclidean path integral approach.We show that the topology of the space relevant for studying de Sitter entropyis a solid torus. The quantum fluctuations of de Sitter space are sectors ofconfigurations of point masses taking a {\em discrete} set of values. Thepartition function gives the correct semi-classical entropy. The sub-leadingcorrection to the entropy is logarithmic in horizon area, with a coefficientcorrection to the entropy from the dS/CFT correspondence agrees with ourresult. A comparison with the corresponding results for the $AdS_{3}$ BTZ blackhole is also presented.
