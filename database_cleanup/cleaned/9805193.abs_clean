Title: Massive Gauge Field Theory Without Higgs Mechanism III. Proofs of

Unitarity and RenormalizabilityComments: 25 pages, latex, no figures

It is proved that the quantum massive gauge field theory established in theformer papers is renormalizable. This conclusion is achieved with the aid ofthe Ward-Takahashi identities satisfied by the generating functionals whichwere derived in the preceding paper based on the BRST-symmetry of the theory.By the use of the Ward-Takahashi identity, it is shown that the S-matrixevaluated by the massive gauge field theory is gauge-independent and henceunitary. This fact allows us to prove the renormalizability of the theroyfirstly in the physical Landau gauge and then extend the proof to the othergauges. As a result of the proof, it is found that the renormalizationconstants for the massive gauge field theory comply with the same identity asthat for the massless gauge field theory.
