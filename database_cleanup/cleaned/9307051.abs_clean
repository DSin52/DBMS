The Hilbert bundle for the massless fermions of the Schwinger model on acircle, over the space of gauge field configurations, is topologicallynon-trivial (twisted). The corresponding bundle for massive fermions istopologically trivial (periodic). Since the structure of the fermionic Hilbertbundle changes discontinuously the possibility of perturbing in the mass isthrown into doubt. In this article, we show that a direct application of theanti-adiabatic theorem of Low, allows the structure of the massless theory tobe dynamically preserved in the strong coupling limit, ${e\over m}>>1$. Thisjustifies the use of perturbation theory in the bosonized version of the model,in this limit.
