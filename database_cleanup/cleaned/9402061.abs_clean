We present a new class of 2d integrable models obtained as perturbations ofminimal CFT with W-symmetry by fundamental weight primaries. These models aregeneralisations of well known $(1,2)$-perturbed Virasoro minimal models. In thelarge $p$ (number of minimal model) limit they coincide with scalarperturbations of WZW theories. The algebra of conserved charges is discussed inthis limit. We prove that it is noncommutative and coincides with twistedaffine algebra $G$ represented in a space of asymptotic states. We conjecturethat scattering in these models for generic $p$ is described by $S$-matrix ofthe $q$-deformed $G$ - algebra with $q$ being root of unity.
