The role of instantons in three dimensional N=2 supersymmetric SU(2)Yang-Mills theory is studied, especially in relation to the issue ofconfinement. The instanton-induced low energy effective action is derived byextending the dilute gas approximation to the super-moduli space of instantons.Following Polyakov's description of confinement in compact U(1) gauge theory,it is argued that there is no confinement in N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Millstheory.
