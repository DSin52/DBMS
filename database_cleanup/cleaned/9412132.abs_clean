We consider the theory of open bosonic string in massive background fields.The general structure of renormalization is investigated. A general covariantaction for a string in background fields of the first massive level issuggested and its symmetries are described. Equations of motion for thebackground fields are obtained by demanding that the renormalized operator ofthe energy-momentum tensor trace vanishes.
