Recently we have proposed a set of variables for describing the physicalparameters of SU(N) Yang--Mills field. Here we propose an off-shellgeneralization of our Ansatz. For this we envoke the Darboux theorem todecompose arbitrary one-form with respect to some basis of one-forms. After apartial gauge fixing we identify these forms with the preimages of holomorphicand antiholomorphic forms on the coset space $ SU(N)/U(1)^{N-1}$, identified asa particular coadjoint orbit. This yields an off-shell gauge fixeddecomposition of the Yang-Mills connection that contains our original variablesin a natural fashion.
