We construct transformations that decouple fermionic fields in interactionwith a gauge field, in the path integral representation of the generatingfunctional. Those transformations express the original fermionic fields interms of non-interacting ones, through non-local functionals depending on thegauge field. This procedure, holding true in any number of spacetime dimensionsboth in the Abelian and non-Abelian cases, is then applied to the path integralbosonization of the Thirring model in 3 dimensions. Knowledge of the decouplingtransformations allows us, contrarily to previous bosonizations, to obtain thebosonization with an explicit expression of the fermion fields in terms ofbosonic ones and free fermionic fields. We also explain the relation betweenour technique, in the two dimensional case, and the usual decoupling in 2dimensions.
