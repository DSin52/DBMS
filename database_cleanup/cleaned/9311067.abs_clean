The non-isospectral symmetries of a general class of integrable hierarchiesare found, generalizing the Galilean and scaling symmetries of the Korteweg--deVries equation and its hierarchy. The symmetries arise in a very natural wayfrom the semi-direct product structure of the Virasoro algebra and the affineKac--Moody algebra underlying the construction of the hierarchy. In particular,the generators of the symmetries are shown to satisfy a subalgebra of theVirasoro algebra. When a tau-function formalism is available, the infinitesimalsymmetries act directly on the tau-functions as moments of Virasoro currents.Some comments are made regarding the r\^ole of the non-isospectral symmetriesand the form of the string equations in matrix-model formulations of quantumgravity in two-dimensions and related systems.
