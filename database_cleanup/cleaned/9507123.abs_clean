Title: Simple Construction of Elliptic Boundary K-Matrix

Authors: Kazuhiro Hikami

Comments: 10 pages, Latex2e with AMS

We give the infinite-dimensional representation for the elliptic $ K$-operator satisfying the boundary Yang-Baxter equation. By restricting thefunctional space to finite-dimensional space, we construct the elliptic $ K$-matrix associated to Belavin's completely $ \mathbb{Z} $-symmetric $ R$-matrix.
