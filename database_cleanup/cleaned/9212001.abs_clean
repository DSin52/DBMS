The main aim of this work is to present the interpretation of the Ising typemodels as a kind of field theory in the framework of noncommutative geometry.We present the method and construct sample models of field theory on discretespaces using the introduced tools of discrete geometry. We write the action forfew models, then we compare them with various models of statistical physics. Weconstruct also the gauge theory with a discrete gauge group.
