We investigate the behavior of softly broken $N=2$ SQCD at non-zero baretheta angle $\theta_0$, using superfield spurions to implement the SUSYbreaking. We find a first-order phase transition as $\theta_0$ is varied fromzero to $2 \pi$, in agreement with a prediction of `t Hooft. The low-energytheta angle $\theta_{eff}$, which determines the effective charges of dyonicexcitations, has a complicated dependence on $\theta_0$ and breakingparameters.
