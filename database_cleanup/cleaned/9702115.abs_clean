We review in detail the recently discovered phenomenon of partial spontaneousbreaking of supersymmetry in the case of a N=2 pure gauge U(1) theory, andrecall how the standard lore no-go theorem is evaded. We discuss the extensionof this mechanism to theories with charged matter, and surprisingly find thatthe gauging forbids the existence of a magnetic Fayet-Iliopoulos term.
