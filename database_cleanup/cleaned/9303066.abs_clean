Title: Quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations and holomorphic vector bundles

Comments: 23 pages, no figures

The paper introduces a new geometric interpretation of the quantumKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations introduced in 1991 by I.Frenkel andN.Reshetikhin. It turns out that these equations can be linked to certainholomorphic vector bundles on the N-th Cartesian power of an elliptic curve.These bundles are naturally constructed by a gluing procedure from a system oftrigonometric quantum affine $R$-matrices. Meromorphic solutions of the quantumKZ equations are interpreted as sections of such a bundle. This interpretationis an analogue of the interpretation of solutions of the classical KZ equationsas sections of a flat vector bundle. Matrix elements of intertwiners betweenrepresentations of the quantum affine algebra correspond to regular(holomorphic) sections. The vector bundle obtained from the quantum KZ systemis topologically nontrivial. Its topology can be completely described in termsof crystal bases, using the crystal limit ``q goes to 0''. In the case N=2,this bundle is is essentially a bundle on an elliptic curve which is shown tobe semistable (for the case of quantum sl(2)) if the parameters take genericvalues. The proof makes use of the crystal limit ``q goes to 0''. Finally, wegive a vector bundle interpretation of the generalized quantum KZ equations forarbitrary affine root systems defined recently by Cherednik.
