We show that for a system containing a set of general second classconstraints which are linear in the phase space variables, the Abelianconversion can be obtained in a closed form and that the first classconstraints generate a generalized shift symmetry. We study in detail theexample of a general first order Lagrangian and show how the shift symmetrynoted in the context of BV quantization arises.
