Mesoscopic effects associated with wave propagation in spacetime with metricstochasticity are studied. We show that the scalar and spinor waves in astochastic spacetime behave similarly to the electrons in a disordered system.Viewing this as the quantum transport problem, mesoscopic fluctuations in sucha spacetime are discussed. The conductance and its fluctuations are expressedin terms of a nonlinear sigma model in the closed time path formalism. We showthat the conductance fluctuations are universal, independent of the volume ofthe stochastic region and the amount of stochasticity.
