We address the question whether a graviton could have a small nonzero mass.the lowest tree-level approximation, and, moreover, the nonlinearfour-dimensional theory of a massive graviton is not defined unambiguously.First, we reiterate the old argument that for the vanishing graviton mass thelowest tree-level approximation breaks down since the higher order correctionsare singular in the graviton mass. However, there exist nonperturbativesolutions which correspond to the summation of the singular terms and thesesolutions are continuous in the graviton mass. Furthermore, we study acompletely nonlinear and generally covariant five-dimensional model whichmimics the properties of the four-dimensional theory of massive gravity. Weshow that the exact solutions of the model are continuous in the mass, yet theperturbative expansion exhibits the discontinuity in the leading order and thesingularities in higher orders as in the four-dimensional case. Based on exactcosmological solutions of the model we argue that the helicity-zero gravitonstate which is responsible for the perturbative discontinuity decouples fromthe matter in the limit of vanishing graviton mass in the full classicaltheory.
