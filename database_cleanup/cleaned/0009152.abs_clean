We show that the QCD vacuum (without dynamical quarks) is a dualsuperconductor at least in the low-energy region in the sense that monopolecondensation does really occur. In fact, we derive the dual Ginzburg-Landautheory (i.e., dual Abelian Higgs model) directly from the SU(2) Yang-Millstheory by adopting the maximal Abelian gauge. The dual superconductor can be onthe border between type II and type I, excluding the London limit. The massesof the dual Abelian gauge field is expressed by the Yang-Mills gauge couplingconstant and the mass of the off-diagonal gluon of the original Yang-Millstheory. Moreover, we can rewrite the Yang-Mills theory into an theory writtenin terms of the Abelian magnetic monopole alone at least in the low-energyregion. Magnetic monopole condensation originates in the non-zero mass ofoff-diagonal gluons. Finally, we derive the confining string theory describingthe low-energy Gluodynamics. Then the area law of the large Wilson loop is animmediate consequence of these constructions. Three low-energy effectivetheories give the same string tension.
