Title: Planckian Energy Scattering and Surface Terms in the Gravitational

ActionAuthors: M. Fabbrichesi, R. Pettorini, G. Veneziano and G.A. Vilkovisky

Comments: preprint CERN-TH.6904/93/rev (Latex file, 46 pages, 2 figures not

included)This is a revised version of our previous paper by the same name and preprintnumber. It contains various changes, two figures and new results in sect.5. Wepropose a new approach to four-dimensional Planckian-energy scattering in whichthe phase of the ${\cal S}$-matrix is written---to leading order in $\hbar$ andto all orders in $R/b =Gs/J$---in terms of the surface term of the gravityaction and of a boundary term for the colliding quanta. The proposal is checkedat the leading order in $R/b$ and also against some known examples ofscattering in strong gravitational fields.
