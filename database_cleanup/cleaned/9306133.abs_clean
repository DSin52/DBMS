Title: Regularization of current algebra

Authors: Jouko Mickelsson

Comments: 10pp, talk at the conference "Constraint theory and quantization",

Montepulciano, June 1993, written in AMSTEX formatIn this talk I want to explain the operator substractions needed toregularize gauge currents in a second quantized theory. The case of space-timedimension $3+1$ is considered in detail. In presence of chiral fermions theregularization effects a modification of the local commutation relations of thecurrents by local Schwinger terms. In $1+1$ dimensions one gets the usualcentral extension (Schwinger term does not depend on background gauge field)whereas in $3+1$ dimensions one gets an anomaly linear in the backgroundpotential.
