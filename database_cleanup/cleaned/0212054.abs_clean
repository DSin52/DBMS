fixedOn promoting the type IIA side of the N=1 Heterotic/type IIA dual pairs of[1] to M-theory on a `barely $G_2$ Manifold' of [2], by spectrum-matching weshow a possible triality between Heterotic on a self-mirror Calabi-Yau,M-theory on the above `barely G_2-Manifold' constructed from the Calabi-Yau onthe type IIA side and F-theory on an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau 4-foldfibered over a trivially rationally ruled CP^1xE base, E being the Enriquessurface. There are some interesting properties of the antiholomorphicinvolution used in [1] for constructing the type IIA orientifold and us inconstructing the 'barely G_2 manifold', that we also study.
