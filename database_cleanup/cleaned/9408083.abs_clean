Following an old result of Marcus and Schwarz we argue that in the heteroticstring theory compactified on a seven dimensional torus, the target spaceduality group O(7,23;Z) and the strong-weak coupling duality transformationscombine into the group O(8,24;Z). We discuss symmetry of the combined spectrumof elementary particles and solitons in the theory, and also show that theexistence of this symmetry predicts the number of harmonic forms on the modulispace of periodic arrays of BPS monopoles in (3+1) dimensions. Finally, we showthat the O(8,24;Z) transformations relate the soliton solutions of Dabholkaret. al. representing the fundamental string to the soliton solutions of Greeneet. al. representing `stringy cosmic strings'.
