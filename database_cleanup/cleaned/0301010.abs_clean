Title: Of Bounces, Branes and Bounds

Comments: 15 pages, Revtex; references added and very minor changes

Some recent studies have considered a Randall-Sundrum-like brane worldevolving in the background of an anti-de Sitter Reissner-Nordstrom black hole.For this scenario, it has been shown that, when the bulk charge isnon-vanishing, a singularity-free ``bounce'' universe will always be obtained.However, for the physically relevant case of a de Sitter brane world, we haverecently argued that, from a holographic (c-theorem) perspective, such braneworlds may not be physically viable. In the current paper, we reconsider thevalidity of such models by appealing to the so-called ``causal entropy bound''.indeed holographically viable, provided that the bulk charge is not too small.We go on to argue that this new finding is likely the more reliable one.
