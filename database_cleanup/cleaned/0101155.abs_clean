The Casimir effect for general Robin conditions on the surface of a cylinderin $D$-spacetime dimensions is studied for massive scalar field with generalcurvature coupling. The energy distribution and vacuum stress are investigated.We separate volumic and superficial energy contributions, for both interior andexterior space regions. The possibility that some special conditions may beenergetically singled out is indicated.
