Gauge invariant conservation laws for the linear and angular momenta arestudied in a certain 2+1 dimensional first order dynamical model of vortices insuperconductivity. In analogy with fluid vortices it is possible to express thelinear and angular momenta as low moments of vorticity. The conservation lawsare compared with those obtained in the moduli space approximation for vortexdynamics.
