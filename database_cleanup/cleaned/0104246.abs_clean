"Quantization, Gauge Theory and Strings" in memory of E.S.Fradkin, Moscow,correctedGeneral properties of the theory of higher spin gauge fields in $AdS_4$ arediscussed. Some new results on the 4d conformal higher spin gauge theory areannounced. Talk given at the International Conference "Quantization, GaugeTheory and Strings" in memory of E.S.Fradkin, Moscow, June 5-10, 2000.
