The Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin model for describing chiral forms is considered atthe quantum level. We study the ultraviolet and infrared behaviour of the modelin two, four and six dimensions in the framework of algebraic renormalization.The absence of anomalies, as well as the finiteness, up to non-physicalrenormalizations, are shown in all dimensions analyzed.
