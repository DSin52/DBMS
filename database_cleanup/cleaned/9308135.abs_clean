Some old and new evidence for the existence of the string (planar randomsurfaces) representation of multicolour QCD are reviewed. They concern therandom surface representation of the strong coupling expansion in latticemulticolour gauge theory in any dimension. Our old idea of modified strongcoupling expansion in terms of planar random surfaces, valid for the physicalweak coupling phase of the four-dimensional QCD, is explained in detail. Somechecks of the validity of this expansion are proposed. (The lectures given inthe Trieste Spring School and Workshop-1993 on String Theory).
