Title: On spectral theory of quantum vertex operators

Comments: 14 pages

In this note we prove the Davies-Foda-Jimbo-Miwa-Nakayashiki conjecture onthe asymptotics of the composition of n quantum vertex operators for thequantum affine algebra U_q(\hat sl_2), as n goes to infinity. For this purposewe define and study the leading eigenvalue and eigenvector of the product oftwo components of the quantum vertex operator. This eigenvector and thecorresponding eigenvalue were recently computed by M.Jimbo. The results of hiscomputation are given in Section 4.
