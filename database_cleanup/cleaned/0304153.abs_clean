The time-varying density of D-branes and anti-D-branes in an expandinguniverse is calculated. The D-brane anti-brane annihilation rate is shown to betoo small to compete with the expansion rate of a FRW type universe and thebranes over-close the universe. This brane problem is analogous to the oldmonopole problem. Interestingly however, it is shown that small dimensionD-branes annihilate more slowly than high dimension branes. Hence, an initiallybrany universe may be filled with only low dimension branes at late times. Whencombined with an appropriate late inflationary theory this leads to anattractive dynamical way to create a realistic braneworld scenario.
