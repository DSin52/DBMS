We calculate the one-loop effective potential for the toroidal non-abelianD-brane in the constant magnetic SU(2) gauge field. The study of its propertiesshows that the potential is unbounded below. This fact indicates theinstability of the non-abelian D-brane in the background under considerationlike the instability of chromomagnetic vacuum in SU(2) gauge theory.
