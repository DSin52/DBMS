A generic Lagrangian, in arbitrary spacetime dimension, describing theinteraction of a graviton, a dilaton and two antisymmetric tensors isconsidered. An isotropic p-brane solution consisting of three blocks anddepending on four parameters in the Lagrangian and two arbitrary harmonicfunctions is obtained. For specific values of parameters in the Lagrangian thesolution may be identified with previously known superstring solutions.
