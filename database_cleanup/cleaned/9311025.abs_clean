Title: Real Time Propagator in the First Quantised Formalism

Authors: Samir D. Mathur

Comments: pages, plain tex

We argue that a basic modification must be made to the first quantisedformalism of string theory if the physics of `particle creation' is to becorrectly described. The analogous quantisation of the relativistic particle isperformed, and it is shown that the proper time along the world line must goboth forwards and backwards (in the usual quantisation it only goes forwards).The matrix propagator of the real time formalism is obtained from the twodirections of proper time.
