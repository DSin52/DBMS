Vacuum polarization effects are non-perturbatively incorporated into thephoton propagator to eliminate the severe infrared problems characteristic ofQED$_3$. The theory is thus rephrased in terms of a massive vector boson whosemass is $e^2/(8\pi)$. Subsequently, it is shown that electron-electron boundstates are possible in QED$_3$.
