We recently obtained the conditions on the couplings of the generaltwo-dimensional massive sigma-model required by (p,q)-supersymmetry. Here wecompute the Poisson bracket algebra of the supersymmetry and central Noethercharges, and show that the action is invariant under the automorphism group ofthis algebra. Surprisingly, for the (4,4) case the automorphism group is alwaysa subgroup of SO(3), rather than SO(4). We also reanalyse the conditions forthe (2,2) and (4,4) supersymmetry of the zero torsion models withoutassumptions about the central charge matrix.
