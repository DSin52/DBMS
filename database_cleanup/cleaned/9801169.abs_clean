We discuss the construction of the physical configuration space forYang-Mills quantum mechanics and Yang-Mills theory on a cylinder. We explicitlyeliminate the redundant degrees of freedom by either fixing a gauge orintroducing gauge invariant variables. Both methods are shown to be equivalentif the Gribov problem is treated properly and the necessary boundaryidentifications on the Gribov horizon are performed. In addition, we analyzethe significance of non-generic configurations and clarify the relation betweenthe Gribov problem and coordinate singularities.
