The property of some finite W algebras to be the commutant of a particularsubalgebra of a simple Lie algebra G is used to construct realizations of G.When G=so(4,2), unitary representations of the conformal and Poincare algebrasare recognized in this approach, which can be compared to the usual inducedrepresentation technique. When G=sp(2,R) or sp(4,R), the anyonic parameter canbe seen as the eigenvalue of a W generator in such W representations of G. Thegeneralization of such properties to the affine case is also discussed in theconclusion, where an alternative of the Wakimoto construction for sl(2) level kis briefly presented. This mini review is based on invited talks presented byP. Sorba at the ``Vth International Colloquium on Quantum Groups and IntegrableSystems'', Prague (Czech Republic), June 1996; ``Extended and Quantum Algebrasand their Applications to Physics'', Tianjin (China), August 1996; ``SelectedTopics of Theoretical and Modern Mathematical Physics'', Tbilisi (Georgia),September 1996; to be published in the Proceedings.
