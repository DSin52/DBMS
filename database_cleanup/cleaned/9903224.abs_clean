We study the conformal field theory of the D1/D5 system compactified on X (Xis T^4 or K3). It is described by a sigma model whose target space is themoduli space of instantons on X. For values of the parameters where the branescan separate, the spectrum of dimensions in the conformal field theory exhibitsa continuum above a gap. This continuum leads to a pathology of the conformalfield theory, which explains a variety of problems in various systems. Inparticular, we explain the apparent discrepancy between different methods offinding the spectrum of chiral fields at certain points in the moduli space ofthe system.
