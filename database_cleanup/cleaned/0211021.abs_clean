We compute the short distance expansion of fields or operators that live inthe coadjoint representation of an infinite dimensional Lie algebra by usingonly properties of the adjoint representation and its dual. We explicitlycompute the short distance expansion for the duals of the Virasoro algebra,affine Lie Algebras and the geometrically realized N-extended supersymmetric GRVirasoro algebra.
