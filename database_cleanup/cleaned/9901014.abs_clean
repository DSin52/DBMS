The relation between some perturbative non-BPS states of the heterotic theoryon T^4 and non-perturbative non-BPS states of the orbifold limit of type IIA onK3 is exhibited. The relevant states include a non-BPS D-string, and a non-BPSbound state of BPS D-particles (`D-molecule'). The domains of stability ofthese states in the two theories are determined and compared.
