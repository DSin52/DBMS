We consider a general d=4 N=1 globally supersymmetric lagrangian involvingchiral and vector superfields, with arbitrary superpotential, Kahler potentialand gauge kinetic function. We compute perturbative quantum corrections byemploying a component field approach that respects supersymmetry and backgroundgauge invariance. In particular, we obtain the full one-loop correction to theKahler potential in supersymmetric Landau gauge. Two derivations of this resultare described. The non-renormalization of the superpotential and the quadraticcorrection to the Fayet-Iliopoulos terms are further checks of ourcomputations.
