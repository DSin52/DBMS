Free field equations, with various spins, for space-time algebras withsecond-rank tensor (instead of usual vector) momentum are constructed. Similaralgebras are appearing in superstring/M theories. The most attention is payedto the gauge invariance properties, particularly the spin two equations withgauge invariance are constructed for dimensions 2+2 and 2+4 and connection toEinstein equation and diffeomorphism invariance is established.
