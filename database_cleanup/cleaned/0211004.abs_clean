Title: Liouville-von Neumann approach and time-dependent Gaussian approximation

Authors: Hyeong-Chan Kim and Jae Hyung Yee

Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures

We show that Liouville-von Neumann approach to quantum mechanical systems,which demands the existence of invariant operators, reproduces thetime-dependent variational Gaussian approximation. We find the effective actionof the time-dependent systems and show that many aspects of the dynamics areindependent of the details of time evolution, e.g., the squeezing of thewave-function is determined by the effective potential of the final stage oftime-evolution.
