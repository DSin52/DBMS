We investigate the late-time behavior of a universe containing a supergravitygas and wrapped 2-branes in the context of M-theory compactified on T^10. Thesupergravity gas tends to drive uniform expansion, while the branes impede theexpansion of the directions about which they are wrapped. Assuming spatialhomogeneity, we study the dynamics both numerically and analytically. At latetimes the radii obey power laws which are determined by the brane wrappingnumbers, leading to interesting hierarchies of scale between the wrapped andunwrapped dimensions. The biggest hierarchy that could evolve from an initialthermal fluctuation produces three large unwrapped dimensions. We also studyconfigurations corresponding to string winding, in which the M2-branes are allwrapped around the (small) 11th dimension, and show that this recovers thescenario discussed by Brandenberger and Vafa.
