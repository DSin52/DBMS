Title: Non-Abelian Eikonal Formalism in QCD_4

Comments: Latex, CARRUTHERS61

Using a new technique for the extraction of leading-log energy dependencefrom the non-Abelian portion of quark-line interactions, hadronic scatteringamplitudes may be represented in terms of functional integrals over gluonicmaterial exchanged between scattering quarks. If that material is furtherrepresented by a condensed tube of gluonic flux (obtained by dimensionaltransmutation), these functional integrals will produce effective propagatorscorresponding to plasma oscillations, or ``condensons'', in this condensedgluonic material. These condensons yield a non-zero, non-tachyonic, finite,gauge-invariant contribution only when the gluonic flux tube corresponds to a``rigid string'' of negligible thickness, so that this formalism provides anatural mechanism for a ``dynamical string'' in QCD4. Summation over a subset ofsuch relevant condensons (at least in SU(2)) generates a form of theDonnachie-Landshoff Pomeron for the scattering amplitude. Other, non-condensateapproaches are also available.
