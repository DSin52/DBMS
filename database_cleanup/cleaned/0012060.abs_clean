Stability and causality are investigated for quantum field theoriesincorporating Lorentz and CPT violation. Explicit calculations in the quadraticsector of a general renormalizable lagrangian for a massive fermion reveal thatno difficulty arises for low energies if the parameters controlling thebreaking are small, but for high energies either energy positivity ormicrocausality is violated in some observer frame. However, this can be avoidedif the lagrangian is the sub-Planck limit of a nonlocal theory with spontaneousLorentz and CPT violation. Our analysis supports the stability and causality ofthe Lorentz- and CPT-violating standard-model extension that would emerge atlow energies from spontaneous breaking in a realistic string theory.
