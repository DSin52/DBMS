We consider Type IIB orientifold models on Calabi-Yau spaces with three-formG-flux turned on. These fluxes freeze some of the complex structure moduli andthe complex dilaton via an F-term scalar potential. By introducing pairs ofD9-anti-D9 branes with abelian magnetic fluxes it is possible to freeze alsosome of the Kaehler moduli via a D-term potential. Moreover, such magneticfluxes in general lead to chiral fermions, which make them interesting forstring model-building. These issues are demonstrated in a simple toy modelbased on a Z_2 x Z_2' orbifold.
