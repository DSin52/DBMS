Title: On ghost condensation, mass generation and Abelian dominance in the

Maximal Abelian GaugeAuthors: David Dudal and Henri Verschelde

Recent work claimed that the off-diagonal gluons (and ghosts) in pureYang-Mills theories, with Maximal Abelian gauge fixing (MAG), attain adynamical mass through an off-diagonal ghost condensate. This condensationtakes place due to a quartic ghost interaction, unavoidably present in MAG forrenormalizability purposes. The off-diagonal mass can be seen as evidence forAbelian dominance. We discuss why ghost condensation of the type discussed inthose works cannot be the reason for the off-diagonal mass and Abeliandominance, since it results in a tachyonic mass. We also point out what thefull mechanism behind the generation of a real mass might look like.
