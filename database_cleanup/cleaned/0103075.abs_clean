We discuss the phase structure of the four-dimensional compact U(1) gaugetheory at finite temperature using a deformation of the topological model. Itsphase structure can be determined by the behavior of the Coulomb gas (CG)system on the cylinder. We utilize the relation between the CG system and thesine-Gordon (SG) model, and investigate the phase structure of the gauge theoryin terms of the SG model. Especially, the critical-line equation of the gaugetheory in the strong-coupling and high-temperature region is obtained bycalculating the one-loop effective potential of the SG model.
