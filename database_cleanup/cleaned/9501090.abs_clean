We consider the geometric entropy of free nonrelativistic fermions in twodimensions and show that it is ultraviolet finite for finite fermi energies,but divergent in the infrared. In terms of the corresponding collective fieldtheory this is a {\em nonperturbative} effect and is related to the softbehaviour of the usual thermodynamic entropy at high temperatures. We then showthat thermodynamic entropy of the singlet sector of the one dimensional matrixmodel at high temperatures is governed by nonperturbative effects of theunderlying string theory. In the high temperature limit the ``exact''expression for the entropy is regular but leads to a negative specific heat,thus implying an instability. We speculate that in a properly defined twodimensional string theory, the thermodynamic entropy could approach a constantat high temperatures and lead to a geometric entropy which is finite in theultraviolet.
