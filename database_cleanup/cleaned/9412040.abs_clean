For gauge theories with confinement, the analytic structure of amplitudes isexplored. It is shown that the analytic properties of physical amplitudes arethe same as those obtained on the basis of an effective theory involving onlythe composite, physical fields. The corresponding proofs of dispersionrelations remain valid. Anomalous thresholds are considered. They are relatedto the composite structure of particles. It is shown, that there are no suchthresholds in physical amplitudes which are associated with confinedconstituents, like quarks and gluons in QCD. Unphysical amplitudes areconsidered briefly, using propagator functions as an example. For general,covariant, linear gauges, it is shown that these functions must havesingularities at finite, real points, which may be associated with confinedstates.
