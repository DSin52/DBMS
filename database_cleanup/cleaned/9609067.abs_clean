The three-dimensional real scalar model, in which the $Z_2$ symmetryspontaneously breaks, is renormalized in a nonperturbative manner based on theTamm-Dancoff truncation of the Fock space. A critical line is calculated bydiagonalizing the Hamiltonian regularized with basis functions. The marginal($\phi^6$) coupling dependence of the critical line is weak. In the brokenphase the canonical Hamiltonian is tachyonic, so the field is shifted as$\phi(x)\to\varphi(x)+v$. The shifted value $v$ is determined as a function ofrunning mass and coupling so that the mass of the ground state vanishes.
