A simple formal computation, and a variation on an old thought experiment,both indicate that QCD with light quarks may confine fundamental color magneticcharges, giving an explicit as well as elegant resolution to the `global color'paradox, strengthening Vachaspati's SU(5) electric-magnetic duality, openingnew lines of inquiry for monopoles in cosmology, and suggesting a class ofgeometrically large QCD excitations -- loops of Z(3) color magnetic fluxentwined with light-quark current. The proposal may be directly testable inlattice gauge theory or supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Recent results indeeply-inelastic electron scattering, and future experiments both there and inhigh-energy collisions of nuclei, could give evidence on the existence of Z(3)loops. If confirmed, they would represent a consistent realization of the boldconcept underlying the Slansky-Goldman-Shaw `glow' model -- phenomena besidesstandard meson-baryon physics manifest at long distance scales -- but withoutthat model's isolable fractional electric charges.
