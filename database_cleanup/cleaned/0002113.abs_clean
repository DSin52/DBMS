We investigate the presence of chaos in a system of two real scalar fieldswith discrete Z_2 x Z_2 symmetry. The potential that identify the system isdefined with a real parameter r and presents distinct features for r>0 and forr<0. For static field configurations, the system supports two topologicalsectors for r>0, and only one for r<0. Under the assumption of spatiallyhomogeneous fields, the system exhibts chaotic behavior almost everywhere inparameter space. In particular a more complex dynamics appears for r>0; in thiscase chaos can decrease for increasing energy, a fact that is absent for r<0.
