We compute a time-dependent noncommutativity parameter in a model with atime-dependent background, a space-time metric of the plane wave type supportedby a Neveu-Schwarz two-form potential. This model is the open string version ofthe WZW model based on a non-semi-simple group previously studied by Nappi andWitten. Like its closed string counterpart, it is exactly conformallyinvariant. We quantize the sigma-model in light-cone gauge, compute theworldsheet propagator, and use it to derive the noncommutativity parameter.
