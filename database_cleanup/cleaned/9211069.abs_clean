In this talk we consider the relationship between the conjectured uniquenessof the Moonshine module of Frenkel, Lepowsky and Meurman and MonstrousMoonshine, the genus zero property for Thompson series discovered by Conway andNorton. We discuss some evidence to support the uniqueness of the Moonshinemodule by considering possible alternative orbifold constructions from a Leechlattice compactified string. Within these constructions we find a newrelationship between the centralisers of the Monster group and the Conway groupgeneralising an observation made by Conway and Norton. We also relate theuniqueness of the Moonshine module to Monstrous Moonshine and argue that giventhis uniqueness, then the genus zero properties hold if and only if orbifoldingthe Moonshine module with respect to a Monster element reproduces the Moonshinemodule or the Leech theory.
