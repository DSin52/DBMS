In this review I discuss various aspects of some of the recently constructedblack hole and soliton solutions in string theory. I begin with the axionicinstanton and related solutions of bosonic and heterotic string theory. Thelatter ten-dimensional solutions can be compactified to supersymmetricmonopole, string and domain wall solutions which break $1/2$ of the spacetimesupersymmetries of $N=4, D=4$ heterotic string theory, and which can begeneralized to two-parameter charged black hole solutions. The low-energydynamics of these solutions is also discussed, as well as their connectionswith strong/weak coupling duality and target space duality in string theory.Finally, new solutions are presented which break $3/4, 7/8$ and all of thespacetime supersymmetries and which also arise in more realistic $N=1$ and$N=2$ compactifications.
