We generalize our results${}^1$ on charged topological solitons (CTS) in$4+1$ dimensional $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons (YMCS) theory to $SU(N)$. The$SU(N)$ multiplet structure of two classes of solitons associated with themaximal embeddings $SU(2)\times U(1)^{N-2}\subset SU(N)$ and $SO(3)\timesU(1)^{N-3}\subset SU(N)$ and the vital role of the $SU(N)$ multiplet oftopological currents is clarified. In the case of the first embedding oneobtains a $^{N}C_{2}-$plet of CTS. In the second, for $N = 3$, one obtainsneutral solitons which, though (classically) spinless, have magnetic moments.For $N \geq 4$, after modding out the above mentioned non-particulate feature,one obtains $^{N}C_{3}$ plets of CTS.
