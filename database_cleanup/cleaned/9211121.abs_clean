In this paper we continue the programme of topologically twisting N=2theories in D=4, focusing on the coupling of vector multiplets to N=2supergravity. We show that in the minimal case, namely when the specialgeometry prepotential F(X) is a quadratic polynomial, the theory has a so farunknown on shell U(1) symmetry, that we name R-duality. R-duality is ageneralization of the chiral-dual on shell symmetry of N=2 pure supergravityand of the R-symmetry of N=2 super Yang-Mills theory. Thanks to this, thetheory can be topologically twisted and topologically shifted, precisely aspure N=2 supergravity, to yield a natural coupling of topological gravity totopological Yang-Mills theory. The gauge-fixing condition that emerges from thetwisting is the self- duality condition on the gauge field-stength and on thespin connection. Hence our theory reduces to intersection theory in themoduli-space of gauge instantons living in gravitational instanton backgrounds.We remark that the topological Yang-Mills theory we obtain by taking the flatspace limit of our gravity coupled Lagrangian is different from the Donaldsontheory constructed by Witten. Whether this difference is substantial and whatits geometrical implications may be is yet to be seen. We also discuss thetopological twist of the hypermultiplets leading to topological quaternionic$\sigma$-models. The instantons of these models, named by us hyperinstantons,correspond to a notion of triholomorphic mappings discussed in the paper.
