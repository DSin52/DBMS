The most general large N eigenvalues distribution for the one matrix model isshown to consist of tree-like structures in the complex plane. For the m=2critical point, such a split solution describes the strong coupling phase of 2dquantum gravity (c=0 non-critical string). It is obtained by takingcombinations of complex contours in the matrix integral, and the relativeweight of the contours is identified with the non-perturbative theta-parameterthat fixes uniquely the solution of the string equation (Painleve I). Thisallows to recover by instanton methods results on the non-perturbative effectsobtained by the Isomonodromic Deformation Method, and to construct for eachtheta-vacuum the observables (the loop correlation functions) which satisfy theloop equations. The breakdown of analyticity of the large N solution is relatedto the existence of poles for the loop operators.
