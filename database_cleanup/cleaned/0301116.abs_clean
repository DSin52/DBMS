Title: Gravity induced over a smooth soliton

Authors: Marko Kolanovic

Comments: 12 pages, 2 figures

I consider gravity induced over a smooth (finite thickness) soliton. Gravitonkinetic term is coupled to bulk scalar that develops solitonic vacuumexpectation value. Couplings of Kaluza-Klein modes to soliton-localized matterare suppressed, giving rise to crossover distance $r_c=M_{P}^2/M_{*}^3$ between4D and 5D behavior. This system can be viewed as a finite thickness braneregularization of the model of Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati.
