Title: A categorical construction of 4D TQFTs

Comments: 11 pages

We construct a four dimensional topological Quantum Field Theory from amodular tensor category. We complete the proof in the case of SU(2)q at a rootof unity. Our construction may be important in the physical interpretation ofthe Chern Simons state in the Ashtekar variables.
