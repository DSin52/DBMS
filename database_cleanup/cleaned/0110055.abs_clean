This review is devoted to strings and branes. Firstly, perturbative stringtheory is introduced. The appearance of various types of branes is discussed.These include orbifold fixed planes, D-branes and orientifold planes. Theconnection to BPS vacua of supergravity is presented afterwards. Asapplications, we outline the role of branes in string dualities, field theorydualities, the AdS/CFT correspondence and scenarios where the string scale isat a TeV. Some issues of warped compactifications are also addressed. Thesecomprise corrections to gravitational interactions as well as the cosmologicalconstant problem.
