U(1) bundlesAuthors: Kazuyuki Fujii

Comments: 17 pages, LaTeX2e

A volume form $H$ on the $n$--dimensional sphere $S^n$ is closed $(dH=0)$, sothat it is locally written as $H=dB$, where B is a $(n-1)$--form. In the firsthalf we give an explicit form to B and, moreover, a speculation concerninghigher order U(1) bundles. In the second half we apply our B in the case $n=3$to a string soliton solution discussed by Perry and Schwarz.
