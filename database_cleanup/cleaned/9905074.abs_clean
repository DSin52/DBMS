The vortex-like solution to the non-linear field equations in atwo-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory with the Chern-Simons mass term is found athigh temperature. It is derived from the effective Lagrangian including theleading order finite temperature corrections. The discovered fieldconfiguration possesses the finite energy and the quantized magnetic flux. Atthe centre of the vortex the point charge is located which is surrounded by thedistributed charge of the opposite sign and the vortex is neutral as a whole.At high temperature the energy of the vortex is negative and it corresponds tothe ground state. The derived solution is considered to be a result of heatingthe lattice vacuum structure formed at zero temperature.
