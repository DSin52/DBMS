Title: The Exact Solution of Born-Infeld Theory in Two Dimension

Authors: Noriaki Ikeda

Comments: 9 pages, latex, no figures

We obtain the exact operator solution of two-dimensional quantum Born-Infeldtheory. This theory has a Lagrangian density non-polynomial in the fundamentalfields. So this analysis might shed some light on the analysis ofnon-perturbative effects of field theories. We find the new exact soluble classof quantum field theories.
