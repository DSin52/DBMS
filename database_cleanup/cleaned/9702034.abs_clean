We extend work done previously concerning the formation of vortices in aU(1)->1 gauge theory at a first order phase transition to the symmetry breakingSU(2)xU(1)->U(1). It is shown that the collision of bubbles, appearing at thephase transition, allow the possibility for forming non-topological stringsassociated with the gauge group. The method used also shows clearly how thesevortices are related to the Nielsen-Olesen vortices.
