We calculate the spectrum of the matrix M' of Neumann coefficients of theWitten vertex, expressed in the oscillator basis including the zero-mode a_0.We find that in addition to the known continuous spectrum inside [-1/3,0) ofthe matrix M without the zero-modes, there is also an additional eigenvalueinside (0,1). For every eigenvalue, there is a pair of eigenvectors, atwist-even and a twist-odd. We give analytically these eigenvectors as well asthe generating function for their components. Also, we have found aninteresting critical parameter b_0 = 8 ln 2 on which the forms of theeigenvectors depend.
