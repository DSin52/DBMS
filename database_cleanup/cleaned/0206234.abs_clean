The effective action in gauge theories is known to depend on a choice ofgauge fixing conditions. This dependence is such that any change of gaugeconditions is equivalent to a field redefinition in the effective action. Inthis sense, the quantum deformation of conformal symmetry in the N = 4 superYang-Mills theory, which was computed in 't Hooft gauge in hep-th/9808039 andhep-th/0203236, is gauge dependent. The deformation is an intrinsic property ofthe theory in that it cannot be eliminated by a local choice of gauge (althoughwe sketch a field redefinition induced by a nonlocal gauge which, on theCoulomb branch of the theory, converts the one-loop quantum-corrected conformaltransformations to the classical ones). We explicitly compute the deformedconformal symmetry in R_\xi gauge. The conformal transformation law of thegauge field turns out to be \xi-independent. We construct the scalar fieldredefinition which relates the 't Hooft and R_\xi gauge results. A uniquefeature of 't Hooft gauge is that it makes it possible to consistently truncatethe one-loop conformal deformation to the terms of first order in derivativesof the fields such that the corresponding transformations form a fieldrealization of the conformal algebra.
