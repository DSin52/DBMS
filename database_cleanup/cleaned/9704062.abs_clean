A field dependent $su(2)$ gauge transformation connects between the adiabaticand diabatic pictures in the (Landau-Zener-Stueckelberg) potential curvecrossing problem. It is pointed out that weak and strong potential curvecrossing interactions are interchanged under this transformation, and thusrealizing a naive strong and weak duality. A reliable perturbation theoryshould thus be formulated in the both limits of weak and strong interactions.In fact, main characteristics of the potential crossing phenomena such as theLandau-Zener formula including its numerical coefficient are well-described bysimple (time-independent) perturbation theory without referring to Stokesphenomena. We also show that quantum coherence in a double well potential isgenerally suppressed by the effect of potential curve crossing, which isanalogous to the effect of Ohmic dissipation on quantum coherence.
