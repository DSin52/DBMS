Title: Six Dimensional Schwarzschild Black Holes in M(atrix) Theory

Comments: 6 pages in phyzzx.tex

We calculate the entropy of six dimensional Schwarzschild black holes inmatrix theory. We use the description of the matrix model on $T^5$ as theworld-volume theory of NS five-branes and show that the black hole entropy isreproduced by noncritical closed strings with fractional tension living on thefive-brane.
