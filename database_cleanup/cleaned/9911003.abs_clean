This thesis aims to make precise the microscopic understanding of Hawkingradiation from the D1/D5 black hole. We present an explict construction of allthe shortmultiplets of the ${\cal N}=(4,4)$ SCFT on the symmetric product$\tilde{T}^4/S(Q_1Q_5)$. An investigation of the symmerties of this SCFTenables us to make a one-to-one correspondence beween the supergravity moduliand the marginal opeerators of the SCFT. We analyse the gauge theory dynamicsof the splitting of the D1/D5 system into subsystems and show that it agreeswith supergravity. We have shown that the fixed scalars of the D1/D5 systemcouple only to (2,2) operators thus removing earlier discrepancies betweenD-brane calculations and semiclassical calculations. The absorptioncross-section of the minimal scalars is determined from first principles upto apropotionality constant. We show that the absorption cross-section of theminimal scalars computed in supergravity and the SCFT is independent of themoduli.
