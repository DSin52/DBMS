If the linear perturbation theory is valid through the bounce, the survivingfluctuations from the ekpyrotic scenario (cyclic one as well) should have veryblue spectra with suppressed amplitude for the scalar-type structure. We derivethe same (and consistent) result using the curvature perturbation in theuniform-field (comoving) gauge and in the zero-shear gauge. Previously, Khouryet al. interpreted results from the latter gauge condition incorrectly andclaimed the scale-invariant spectrum, thus generating controversy in theliterature. We also correct similar errors in the literature based on wrongmode identification and joining condition. No joining condition is needed forthe derivation.
