In this note we calculate the Casimir effect of free thermal gravitons inEinstein universe and discuss how it changes the entropy bound conditionproposed recently by Verlinde [hep-th/0008140] as a higher dimensionalgeneralization of Cardy's formula for conformal field theories (CFT). We findthat the graviton's Casimir effect is necessary in order not to violateVerlinde's bound for weakly coupled CFT. We also comment on the implication ofthis new Cardy's formula to the thermodynamics of black $p$-brane.
