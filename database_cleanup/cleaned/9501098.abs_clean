Boundary conditions compatible with classical integrability are studied bothdirectly, using an approach based on the explicit construction of conservedquantities, and indirectly by first developing a generalisation of the Lax pairidea. The latter approach is closer to the spirit of earlier work by Sklyaninand yields a complete set of conjectures for permissible boundary conditionsfor any affine Toda field theory.
