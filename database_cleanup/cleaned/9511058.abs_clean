Recent work initiated by Strominger has lead to a consistent physicalinterpretation of certain types of transitions between different string vacua.These transitions, discovered several years ago, involve singular conifoldconfigurations which connect distinct Calabi-Yau manifolds. In this paper wediscuss a number of aspects of conifold transitions pertinent to bothworldsheet and spacetime mirror symmetry. It is shown that the mirror transformbased on fractional transformations allows an extension of the mirror map toconifold boundary points of the moduli space of weighted Calabi-Yau manifolds.The conifold points encountered in the mirror context are not amenable to ananalysis via the original splitting constructions. We describe the firstexamples of such nonsplitting conifold transitions, which turn out to connectthe known web of Calabi-Yau spaces to new regions of the collective modulispace. We then generalize the splitting conifold transition to weightedmanifolds and describe a class of connections between the webs of ordinary andweighted projective Calabi-Yau spaces. Combining these two constructions wefind evidence for a dual analog of conifold transitions in heterotic N$=$2compactifications on K3$\times $T$^2$ and in particular describe the firstconifold transition of a Calabi-Yau manifold whose heterotic dual has beenidentified by Kachru and Vafa. We furthermore present a special type ofconifold transition which, when applied to certain classes of Calabi-Yau K3fibrations, preserves the fiber structure.
