17-31In the present note we suggest an affinization of a theorem by Kostrikinet.al. about the decomposition of some complex simple Lie algebras ${\cal G}$into the algebraic sum of pairwise orthogonal Cartan subalgebras. We point outthat the untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebras of types $A_{p^m-1}$ ($p$ prime,$m\geq 1$), $B_r, \, C_{2^m}, D_r,\, G_2,\, E_7,\, E_8$ can be decomposed intothe algebraic sum of pairwise or\-tho\-go\-nal Heisenberg subalgebras. The$A_{p^m-1}$ and $G_2$ cases are discussed in great detail. Some possibleapplications of such decompositions are also discussed.
