The presence of a cosmological constant, Lambda, in an action with higherpowers of the curvature can produce rapidly oscillating metrics. We develop aperturbative approach for generating periodic solutions to the non-linear fieldequations for such actions based on a small amplitude expansion. We find thatthese oscillations have an amplitude proportional to \sqrt{\Lambda} and afrequency of order the Planck mass. In a 4+1 dimensional scenario, a family ofmetrics exists that are periodic in the extra dimension and are parameterizedby an effective four-dimensional cosmological constant which drives a rapidoscillation.
