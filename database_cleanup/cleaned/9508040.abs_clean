The effects of three-dimensional perturbations in two-dimensional turbulenceare investigated, through a conformal field theory approach. We compute scalingexponents for the energy spectra of enstrophy and energy cascades, in a strongcoupling limit, and compare them to the values found in recent experiments. Theextension of unperturbed conformal turbulence to the present situation isperformed by means of a simple physical picture in which the existence of smallscale random forces is closely related to deviations of the exacttwo-dimensional fluid motion.
