After recalling briefly some basic properties of the quantum group $GL_q(2)$,we study the quantum sphere $S_q^2$, quantum projective space $CP_q(N)$ andquantum Grassmannians as examples of complex (K\"{a}hler) quantum manifolds.The differential and integral calculus on these manifolds are discussed. It isshown that many relations of classical projective geometry generalize to thequantum case. For the case of the quantum sphere a comparison is made with A.Connes' method.
