Title: Some remarks about gauge-invariant Yang-Mills fields

Comments: 14 pages, latex

In order to eliminate gauge variant degrees of freedom we study the way tointroduce gauge invariant fields in pure non-Abelian Yang-Mills theory. Ourapproach is based on the use of the gauge-invariant but path-dependentvariables formalism. It is shown that for a special class of paths these fieldscoincide with the usual ones in some definite gauges. The interquark potentialis discussed by exploiting the rich structure of the gluonic cloud or dressingaround static fermions.
