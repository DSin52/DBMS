Bracket preserving gauge equivalence is established between several two-bosongenerated KP type of hierarchies. These KP hierarchies reduce under symplecticreduction (via Dirac constraints) to KdV, mKdV and Schwarzian KdV hierarchies.Under this reduction the gauge equivalence is taking form of the conventionalMiura maps between the above KdV type of hierarchies.
