The theory of reheating of the Universe after inflation is developed. Thetransition from inflation to the hot Universe turns out to be stronglymodel-dependent and typically consists of several stages. Immediately afterinflation the field $\phi$ begins rapidly rolling towards the minimum of itseffective potential. Contrary to some earlier expectations, particle productionduring this stage does not lead to the appearance of an extra friction term$\Gamma\dot\phi$ in the equation of motion of the field $\phi$. Reheatingbecomes efficient only at the next stage, when the field $\phi$ rapidlyoscillates near the minimum of its effective potential. We have found thattypically in the beginning of this stage the classical inflaton field $\phi$very rapidly (explosively) decays into $\phi$-particles or into other bosonsdue to broad parametric resonance. This stage cannot be described by thestandard elementary approach to reheating based on perturbation theory. Thebosons produced at this stage, as well as some part of the classical field$\phi$ which survives the stage of explosive reheating, should further decayinto other particles, which eventually become thermalized. The last stages ofdecay can be described in terms of perturbation theory. Complete reheating ispossible only in those theories where a single massive $\phi$-particle candecay into other particles. This imposes strong constraints on the structure ofinflationary models. On the other hand, this means that a scalar field can be acold dark matter candidate even if it is strongly coupled to other fields.
