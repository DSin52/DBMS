We show that $N=2$ and $N=4$ extended supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories infour space-time dimensions could be derived as action functionals fornon-commutative spaces. The coupling of $N=1$ and $N=2$ super Yang-Mills to$N=1$ and $N=2$ matter could be derived as action functionals ofnon-commutative spaces only for a restricted class of models where a generalsuperpotential is not allowed.
