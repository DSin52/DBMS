We study N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory with gauge group SU(2)compactified to three dimensions on a circle of circumference beta. The eightfermion terms in the effective action on the Coulomb branch are determinedexactly, for all beta, assuming the existence of an interacting Spin(8)invariant fixed point at the origin. The resulting formulae are manifestlyinvariant under the SL(2,Z) duality of four dimensional N=4 SYM and lead tointeresting quantitative predictions for instanton effects in gauge theory andin Type II string theory.
