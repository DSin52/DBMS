We study the free field realization of the two-dimensional osp(1|2) currentalgebra. We consider the case in which the level of the affine osp(1|2)symmetry is a positive integer. Using the Coulomb gas technique we obtainintegral representations for the conformal blocks of the model. In particular,from the behaviour of the four-point function, we extract the structureconstants for the product of two arbitrary primary operators of the theory.From this result we derive the fusion rules of the osp(1|2) conformal fieldtheory and we explore the connections between the osp(1|2) affine symmetry andthe N=1 superconformal field theories.
