It is shown that the twisted sector spectrum, as well as the associatedChern-Simons interactions, can be determined on M-theory orbifold fixed planesthat do not admit gravitational anomalies. This is demonstrated for theseven-planes arising within the context of an explicit $R^6 \times S^1/Z_2\times T^4/Z_2$ orbifold, although the results are completely general. Localanomaly cancellation in this context is shown to require fractional anomalydata that can only arise from a twisted sector on the seven-planes, thusdetermining the twisted spectrum up to a small ambiguity. These results openthe door to the construction of arbitrary M-theory orbifolds, including thosecontaining fixed four-planes which are of phenomenological interest.
