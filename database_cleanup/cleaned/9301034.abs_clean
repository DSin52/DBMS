We study the electrodynamics of generic charged particles (bosons, fermions,relativistic or not) constrained to move on an infinite plane. An effectivegauge theory in 2+1 dimensional spacetime which describes the realelectromagnetic interaction of this particles is obtained. The relationshipbetween this effective theory with the Chern-Simons theory is explored. It isshown that the QED lagrangian {\it per se} produces the Chern-Simons constraintrelating the current to the effective gauge field in 2+1 D. It is also shownthat the geometry of the system unavoidably induces a contribution from thetopological $\theta$-term that generates an explicit Chern-Simons term for theeffective 2+1 dimensional gauge field as well as a minimal coupling of thematter to it. The possible relation of the effective three dimensional theorywith the bosonization of the Dirac fermion field in 2+1 D is briefly discussedas well as the potential applications in Condensed Matter systems.
