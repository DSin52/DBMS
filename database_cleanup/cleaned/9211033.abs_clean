superalgebras $A(n,n)$, $D(n+1,n)$ and $B(n,n)$ which admit a fermionic set ofsimple roots and a fermionic untwisted affine extension. In particular, weconcentrate on two simple examples, the $B(1,1)$ and $A(1,1)$ theories. Both inthe conformal and massive case we address the issue of quantum integrability byconstructing the first non trivial conserved currents and proving theirconservation to all--loop orders. While the $D(n+1,n)$ and $B(n,n)$ systems aregenuine $N=1$ supersymmetric theories, the $A(n,n)$ models possess a global$N=2$ supersymmetry. In the conformal case, we show that the $A(n,n)$stress--energy tensor, uniquely determined by the holomorphicity condition, hasvanishing central charge and it corresponds to the stress--energy tensor of theassociated topological theory.
