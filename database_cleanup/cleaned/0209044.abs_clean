According to Belinsky, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz, gravity near a space-likesingularity reduces to a set of decoupled one-dimensional mechanical models ateach point in space. We point out that these models fall into a class ofconformal mechanical models first introduced by de Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan(DFF). The deformation used by DFF to render the spectrum discrete correspondsto a negative cosmological constant. The wave function of the universe is thezero-energy eigenmode of the Hamiltonian, also known as the spherical vector ofthe representation of the conformal group SO(1,2). A new class of conformalquantum mechanical models is constructed, based on the quantization ofnilpotent coadjoint orbits, where the conformal group is enhanced to an ADEnon-compact group for which the spherical vector is known.
