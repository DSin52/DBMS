Making combined use of the Matrix and Maldacena conjectures, the relationbetween various thermodynamic transitions in super Yang-Mills (SYM) andsupergravity is clarified. The thermodynamic phase diagram of an object in DLCQM-theory in four and five non-compact space dimensions is constructed; matrixstrings, matrix black holes, and black $p$-branes are among the various phases.Critical manifolds are characterized by the principles of correspondence andlongitudinal localization, and a triple point is identified. The microscopicdynamics of the Matrix string near two of the transitions is studied; weidentify a signature of black hole formation from SYM physics.
