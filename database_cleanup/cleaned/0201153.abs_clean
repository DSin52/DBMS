We calculate the ring of differential operators on some singular affinevarieties (intersecting stacks, a point on a singular curve or an orbifold).Our results support the proposed connection of the ring of differentialoperators with geometry of D-branes in (bosonic) string theory. In particular,the answer does know about the resolution of singularities in accordance withthe string theory predictions.
