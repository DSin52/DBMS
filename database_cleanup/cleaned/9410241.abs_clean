Title: Introduction to Braided Geometry and $q$-Minkowski Space

Comments: 60 pages

We present a systematic introduction to the geometry of linear braidedspaces. These are versions of $\R^n$ in which the coordinates $x_i$ havebraid-statistics described by an R-matrix. From this starting point we surveyexponentials, Gaussians, integration and forms, i.e. the basic ingredients for$q$-deformed physics are covered. The braided approach includes natural$q$-Euclidean and $q$-Minkowski spaces in R-matrix form.
