Following our earlier work we argue in detail for the equivalence of thenonlinear $\sigma$ model with Hopf term at~$\theta=\pi/2s$ ~and an interactingspin-s theory. We give an ansatz for spin-s operators in the $\sigma$ model andshow the equivalence of the correlation functions.We also show the relationbetween topological and Noether currents. We obtain the Lorentz and discretetransformation properties of the spin-s operator from the fields of the$\sigma$ model. We also explore the connection of this model with Quantum HallFluids.
