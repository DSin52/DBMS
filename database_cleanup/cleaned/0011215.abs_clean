The free (4,0) superconformal theory in 6 dimensions and its toroidaldimensional reductions are studied. The reduction to four dimensions on a2-torus has an $SL(2,\Z)$ duality symmetry that acts non-trivially on thelinearised gravity sector, interchanging the linearised Einstein equations andBianchi identities and giving a self-duality between strong and weak couplingregimes. The possibility of this extending to an interacting form of the theoryis discussed and implications for the non-geometric picture of gravity thatcould emerge are considered.
