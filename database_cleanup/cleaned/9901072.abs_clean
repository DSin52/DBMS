Various aspects of the Nahm equations in 3 and 7 dimensions are investigated.The residues of the variables at simple poles in the 7-dimensional case form analgebra. A large class of matrix representations of this algebra isconstructed. The large $N$ limit of these equations is taken by replacing thecommutators by Moyal Brackets, and a set of non trivial solutions in ageneralised form of Wigner distribution functions is obtained.
