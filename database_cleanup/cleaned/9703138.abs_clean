We discuss different criteria for `classical size' of extremal Dirichletp-branes in type-II supergravity. Using strong-weak coupling duality, we findthat the size of the strong-coupling region at the core of the (p<3)-branes, isalways given by the asymptotic string scale, if measured in the weakly coupleddual string metric. We also point out how the eleven-dimensional Planck scalearises in the classical 0-brane solution, as well as the ten-dimensional Planckscale in the D-instanton solution.
