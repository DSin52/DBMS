We present duality invariant structure of the thermodynamic quantities ofnon-extreme black hole solutions of torodially compactified Type II (M-theory)and heterotic string in five and four dimensions. These quantities areparameterized by duality invariant combinations of charges and thenon-extremality parameter, which measures a deviation from the BPS-saturatedlimit. In particular, in D=5 we find explicit S- and T-duality [U-duality]invariant expressions for solutions of toroidally compactified heterotic string[Type II string]. In D=4, we consider general S-duality invariant expressionsfor non-extreme solutions of pure N=4 supergravity and find to the leadingorder in non-extremality parameter the T- and S-duality invariant expressionsof toroidally compactified heterotic string. General non-extreme solutions oftoroidally compactified string in D=4 are awaiting further investigation.
