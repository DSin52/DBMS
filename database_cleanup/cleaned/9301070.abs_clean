Previous results on quasi-classical limit of the KP hierarchy and itsW-infinity symmetries are extended to the Toda hierarchy. The Planck constant$\hbar$ now emerges as the spacing unit of difference operators in the Laxformalism. Basic notions, such as dressing operators, Baker-Akhiezer functionsand tau function, are redefined. $W_{1+\infty}$ symmetries of the Todahierarchy are realized by suitable rescaling of the Date-Jimbo-Kashiara-Miwavertex operators. These symmetries are contracted to $w_{1+\infty}$ symmetriesof the dispersionless hierarchy through their action on the tau function. (Afew errors in the earlier version is corrected.)
