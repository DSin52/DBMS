The algebraic structures underlying quasi-exact solvability for spin 1/2Hamiltonians in one dimension are studied in detail. Necessary and sufficientconditions for a matrix second-order differential operator preserving a spaceof wave functions with polynomial components to be equivalent to a \sch\operator are found. Systematic simplifications of these conditions areanalyzed, and are then applied to the construction of several new examples ofmulti-parameter QES spin 1/2 Hamiltonians in one dimension.
