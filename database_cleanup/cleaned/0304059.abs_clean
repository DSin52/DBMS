Title: Modified Star-Products Beyond the Large-B Limit

Authors: Pascal Grange

Comments: 9 pages; references added

Derivative corrections to the Wess--Zumino couplings of open-string effectiveactions are computed at all orders in derivatives, taking the open-stringmetric into account. This leads to a set of deformed star-products beyond theSeiberg--Witten limit, and allows to reinterpret the couplings in terms of adeformed integration prescription along a Wilson line in the non-commutativeset-up. Moreover, the recursive definition of the star-products inducesdeformations of U(1) non-commutative Yang--Mills theory.
