2+1-dimensional Anti-deSitter gravity is quantized in the presence of anexternal scalar field. We find that the coupling between the scalar field andgravity is equivalently described by a perturbed conformal field theory at theboundary of AdS_3. We derive the explicit form of this coupling, which allowsus to perform a microscopic computation of the transition rates between blackhole states due to absorption and induced emission of the scalar field.Detailed thermodynamic balance then yields Hawking radiation as spontaneousemission, and we find agreement with the semiclassical result, includinggreybody factors. This result also has application to four and five dimensionalblack holes in supergravity. However, since we only deal with gravitationaldegrees of freedom, the approach is not based on string theory, and does notdepend, either, on the validity of Maldacena's AdS/CFT conjecture.
