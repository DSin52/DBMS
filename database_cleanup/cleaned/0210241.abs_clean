Using the covariant N=2 harmonic supergraph techniques we calculate theone-loop low-energy effective action of N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory in Coulombbranch with gauge group SU(2) spontaneously broken down to U(1). The fulldependence of the low-energy effective action on both the hypermultiplet andgauge fields is determined. The direct quantum calculation confirms thecorrectness of the exact N=4 SYM low-energy effective action derived inhep-th/0111062 on the purely algebraic ground by invoking a hidden N=2supersymmetry which completes the manifest N=2 one to N=4. Our results providean exhaustive solution to the problem of finding out the exact completely N=4supersymmetric low-energy effective action for the theory under consideration.
