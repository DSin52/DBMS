We study the Penrose limit of ODp theory. There are two different PP-wavelimits of the theory. One of them is a ten dimensional PP-wave and the other afour dimensional one. We observe the later one leads to an exactly solvablebackground for type II string theories where we have both NS and RR fields. ThePenrose limit of different branes of string (M-theory) in a nonzero B/E field(C field) is also studied. These backgrounds are conjectured to provide dualdescription of NCSYM, NCOS and OM theory. We see that under S-duality thesubsector of NCSYM$_4$ and NCOS$_4$ which are dual to the corresponding stringtheory on PP-wave coming from NCYM$_4$ and NCOS$_4$ map to each other for givennull geodesic.
