The non-relativistic Maxwell-Chern-Simons model recently introduced by Mantonis shown to admit self-dual vortex solutions with non-zero electric field. Theinterrelated ``geometric'' and ``hidden'' symmetries are explained. The theoryis also extended to (non-relativistic) spinors. A relativistic, self-dualmodel, whose non-relativistic limit is the Manton model is also presented. Therelation to previous work is discussed.
