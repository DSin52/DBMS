Supersymmetric (pseudo-classical) mechanics has recently been generalized to{\it fractional}\/ supersymmetric mechanics. In such a construction, the actionis invariant under fractional supersymmetry transformations, which are the$F^{\,\rm th}$ roots of time translations (with $F=1,2,...$). Associated withthese symmetries, there are conserved charges with fractional canonicaldimension $1+1/F$. Using \pg\ variables satisfying $\t^F=0$, we present afractional-superspace formulation of this construction.
