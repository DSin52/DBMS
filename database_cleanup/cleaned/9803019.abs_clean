In order to study quantum aspects of $\s$-models related by Poisson--LieT-duality, we construct three- and two-dimensional models that correspond, inone of the dual faces, to deformations of $S^3$ and $S^2$. Their classicalcanonical equivalence is demonstrated by means of a generating functional,which we explicitly compute. We examine how they behave under therenormalization group and show that dually related models have the same 1-loopbeta functions for the coupling and deformation parameters. We find non-trivialfixed points in the ultraviolet, where the theories do not becomeasymptotically free. This suggests that the limit of Poisson--Lie T-duality tothe usual Abelian and non-Abelian T-dualities does not exist quantummechanically, although it does so classically.
