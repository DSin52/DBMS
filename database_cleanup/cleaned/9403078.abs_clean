Title: Strong Coupling Phase of Chiral Gross Neveu Model

Authors: Hiroshi Nohara

Comments: 10 pages

We perform the numerical simulation of the two dimensional chiral Gross Neveumodel using the Kogut-Susskind(KS) fermion. In the case of SU(4), theKosterlitz-Thouless phase transition happens at some critical value of thecoupling constant. In the case of one flavour, there exists the strong couplingphase in which the correlation functions vanish and the general covariance isrealized in the quantum field thoery through the dynamical process.
