We show that it is possible to construct a quantum field theory that isinvariant under the translation of the noncommutative parameter$\theta_{\mu\nu}$. This is realized in a noncommutative cohomological fieldtheory. As an example, a noncommutative cohomological scalar field theory isconstructed, and its partition function is calculated. The partition functionis the Euler number of Gopakumar, Minwalla and Strominger (GMS) soliton space.
