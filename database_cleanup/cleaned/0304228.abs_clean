The construction of dual theories for linearized gravity in four dimensionsis considered. Our approach is based on the parent Lagrangian method previouslydeveloped for the massive spin-two case, but now considered for the zero masscase. This leads to a dual theory described in terms of a rank two symmetrictensor, analogous to the usual gravitational field, and an auxiliaryantisymmetric field. This theory has an enlarged gauge symmetry, but with anadequate partial gauge fixing it can be reduced to a gauge symmetry similar tothe standard one of linearized gravitation. We present examples illustratingthe general procedure and the physical interpretation of the dual fields. Thezero mass case of the massive theory dual to the massive spin-two theory isalso examined, but we show that it only contains a spin-zero excitation.
