In this paper we generalize some of these results for loop algebras andgroups as well as for the Virasoro algebra to the two-dimensional case. Wedefine and study a class of infinite dimensional complex Lie groups which arecentral extensions of the group of smooth maps from a two dimensionalorientable surface without boundary to a simple complex Lie group G. Theseextensions naturally correspond to complex curves. The kernel of such anextension is the Jacobian of the curve. The study of the coadjoint action showsthat its orbits are labelled by moduli of holomorphic principal G-bundles overthe curve and can be described in the language of partial differentialequations. In genus one it is also possible to describe the orbits as conjugacyclasses of the twisted loop group, which leads to consideration of differenceequations for holomorphic functions. This gives rise to a hope that thedescribed groups should possess a counterpart of the rich representation theorythat has been developed for loop groups. We also define a two-dimensionalanalogue of the Virasoro algebra associated with a complex curve. In genus one,a study of a complex analogue of Hill's operator yields a description ofinvariants of the coadjoint action of this Lie algebra. The answer turns out toextended algebra of currents in sl(2).
