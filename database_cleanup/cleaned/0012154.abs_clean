Explicit formulas for the zeta functions $\zeta_\alpha (s)$ corresponding tobosonic ($\alpha =2$) and to fermionic ($\alpha =3$) quantum fields living on anoncommutative, partially toroidal spacetime are derived. Formulas for the mostgeneral case of the zeta function associated to a quadratic+linear+constantform (in {\bf Z}) are obtained. They provide the analytical continuation of thezeta functions in question to the whole complex $s-$plane, in terms of seriesof Bessel functions (of fast, exponential convergence), thus being extendedChowla-Selberg formulas. As well known, this is the most convenient expressionthat can be found for the analytical continuation of a zeta function, inparticular, the residua of the poles and their finite parts are explicitlygiven there. An important novelty is the fact that simple poles show up at$s=0$, as well as in other places (simple or double, depending on the number ofcompactified, noncompactified, and noncommutative dimensions of the spacetime),where they had never appeared before. This poses a challenge to thezeta-function regularization procedure.
