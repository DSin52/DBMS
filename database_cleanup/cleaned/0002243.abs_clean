references addedThe spherical field formalism---a nonperturbative approach to quantum fieldtheory---was recently introduced and applied to phi^4 theory in two dimensions.The spherical field method reduces a quantum field theory to afinite-dimensional quantum mechanical system by expanding field configurationsin terms of spherical partial wave modes. We extend the formalism to phi^4theory in three dimensions and demonstrate the application of the method byanalyzing the phase structure of this theory.
