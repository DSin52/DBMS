We analyze the zero mass black holes that arise as classical solutions to lowenergy heterotic string theory. Though these solutions contain nakedsingularities, it has been conjectured that they should be allowed in thetheory. We find a solution describing a pair of oppositely charged masslessblack holes in uniformly accelerated motion under no external force. Byanalytically continuing the solution to Euclidean time, we find an instantonmediating the pair production of these objects in Minkowski space. We analyzethe creation rate, and discuss some consequences of the result.
