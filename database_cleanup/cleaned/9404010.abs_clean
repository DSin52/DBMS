Title: Some Classical and Quantum Algebras

Comments: 19 pages

We discuss the notion of a Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) algebra and give severalclassical examples from differential geometry and Lie theory. We introduce thenotion of a quantum operator algebra (QOA) as a generalization of a classicaloperator algebra. In some examples, we view a QOA as a deformation of acommutative algebra. We then review the notion of a vertex operator algebra(VOA) and show that a vertex operator algebra is a QOA with some additionalstructures. Finally, we establish a connection between BV algebras and VOAs.
