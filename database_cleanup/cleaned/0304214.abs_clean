The 7--particle form factors of the fundamental spin field of the O(3)nonlinear $\sigma$--model are constructed. We calculate the correspondingcontribution to the spin--spin correlation function, and compare withpredictions from the spectral density scaling hypothesis. The resultingapproximation to the spin--spin correlation function agrees well with thatcomputed in renormalized (asymptotically free) perturbation theory in theexpected energy range. Further we observe simple lower and upper bounds for thesum of the absolute square of the form factors which may be of use for analyticestimates.
