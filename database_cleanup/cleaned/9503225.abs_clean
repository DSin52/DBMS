For all Poincar\'e invariant Lagrangians of the form ${\cal L}\equivf(F_{\mu\nu})$, in three Euclidean dimensions, where $f$ is any invariantfunction of a non-compact $U(1)$ field strength $F_{\mu\nu}$, we find that theonly continuum limit (described by just such a gauge field) is that of freerenormalization group by neglecting all higher derivative terms $\sim\partial^nF$ in ${\cal L}$, but allowing for a general non-vanishing anomalousdimension. Then we prove analytically that the resulting flow equation has onlyhigh-$T_c$ superconductivity is briefly discussed.
