We twist the monopole equations of Seiberg and Witten and show how theseequations are realized in topological Yang-Mills theory. A Floer derivative anda Morse functional are found and are used to construct a unitary transformationbetween the usual Floer cohomologies and those of the monopole equations.Furthermore, these equations are seen to reside in the vanishing self-dualcurvature condition of an $OSp(1|2)$-bundle. Alternatively, they may be seenarising directly from a vanishing self-dual curvature condition on an$SU(2)$-bundle in which the fermions are realized as spanning the tangent spacefor a specific background.
