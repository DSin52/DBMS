Title: Subluminal and superluminal solutions in vacuum of the Maxwell equations

and the massless Dirac equationAuthors: W. A. Rodrigues, Jr. and J. Vaz, Jr.

Comments: REVTeX, 8 pages, talk given at the International Conference on the

Theory of the Electron, Sept.95, Mexico City. To appear in the proceedingsWe show that Maxwell equations and Dirac equation (with zero mass term) haveboth subluminal and superluminal solutions in vacuum. We also discuss thepossible fundamental physical consequences of our results.
