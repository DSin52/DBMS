The issue of gauge invariances in the sigma model formalism is discussed atthe free and interacting level. The problem of deriving gauge invariantinteracting equations can be addressed using the proper time formalism. Thisformalism is discussed, both for point particles and strings. The covariantKlein Gordon equation arises in a geometric way from the boundary terms. Thisformalism is similar to the background independent open string formalismintroduced by Witten.
