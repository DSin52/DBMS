We investigate the structure of equations of motion and lagrangianconstraints in a general theory of massive spin 2 field interacting withexternal gravity. We demonstrate how consistency with the flat limit can beachieved in a number of specific spacetimes. One such example is an arbitrarystatic spacetime though equations of motion in this case may lack causalproperties. Another example is provided by external gravity fulfilling vacuumEinstein equations with arbitrary cosmological constant. In the latter casethere exists one-parameter family of theories describing causal propagation ofthe correct number of degrees of freedom for the massive spin 2 field inarbitrary dimension. For a specific value of the parameter a gauge invariancewith a vector parameter appears, this value is interpreted as massless limit ofthe theory. Another specific value of the parameter produces gauge invariancewith a scalar parameter and this cannot be interpreted as a consistent massiveor massless theory.
