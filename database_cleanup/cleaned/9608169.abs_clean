We describe a class of topological field theories called ``balancedtopological field theories.'' These theories are associated to moduli problemswith vanishing virtual dimension and calculate the Euler character of variousmoduli spaces. We show that these theories are closely related to the geometryand equivariant cohomology of ``iterated superspaces'' that carry twodifferentials. We find the most general action for these theories, which turnsout to define Morse theory on field space. We illustrate the constructions withnumerous examples. Finally, we relate these theories to topologicalsigma-models twisted using an isometry of the target space.
