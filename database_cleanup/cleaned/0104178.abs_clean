We construct the manifestly Lorentz-invariant twistorial formulation of N=1D=4 superparticle with tensorial central charges which describes massive andmassless cases in a uniform manner. The tensorial central charges are realizedin terms of even spinor variables and central charge coordinates. The fullanalysis of the number of conserved supersymmetries has been carried out. Inthe massive case the superparticle preserves 1/4 or 1/2 of target-spacesupersymmetries whereas the massless superparticle preserves two or threesupersymmetries.
