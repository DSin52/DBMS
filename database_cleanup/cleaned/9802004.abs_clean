Recently, a non-hyperelliptic curve describing the Coulomb branch of N=2 SUSY$SU(N_c)$ Yang-Mills theory with an antisymmetric tensor matter was proposedusing a configuration of a single M theory five-brane. We study the singularsurface in the moduli space of the curve to compare it with results from the``integrating in'' method in field theory. In order to achieve the consistency,we find it necessary to take account of an additional superpotential$W_{\Delta}$ which has been neglected so far. The explicit form of $W_{\Delta}$is worked out.
