We present a complete scheme to discuss linear perturbations in thetwo-branes model of the Randall and Sundrum scenario with the stabilizationmechanism proposed by Goldberger and Wise. We confirm that under theapproximation of zero mode truncation the induced metric on the branesreproduces that of the usual 4-dimensional Einstein gravity. We also presentformulas to evaluate the mass spectrum and the contribution to the metricperturbations from all the Kaluza-Klein modes. We also conjecture that themodel has tachyonic modes unless the background configuration for the bulkscalar field introduced to stabilize the distance between the two branes ismonotonic in the fifth dimension.
