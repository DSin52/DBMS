QUARKS'2002, Novgorod, Russia, June 1-7, 2002We assume that QCD can be effectively described with string-like variables.The hadronic string is built over the chirally non-invariant QCD vacuum bymeans of the boundary interaction with background chiral fields associated withpions. By making this interaction compatible with the conformal symmetry of thestring and with the unitarity constraint on chiral fields we reconstruct theequations of motion for the latter ones and furthermore recover the Lagrangianof non-linear sigma model of pion interactions. The estimated chiral structuralconstants of Gasser and Leutwyler fit well the phenomenological values.
