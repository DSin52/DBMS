We derive the explicit form of the Wess-Zumino quantum effective action ofchiral $\, \Winf$-symmetric system of matter fields coupled to a general chiral$\, \Winf$-gravity background. It is expressed as a geometric action on acoadjoint orbit of the deformed group of area-preserving diffeomorphisms oncylinder whose underlying Lie algebra is the centrally-extended algebra ofsymbols of differential operators on the circle. Also, we present a systematicderivation , in terms of symbols, of the ``hidden" $SL (\infty ; \IR )$Kac-Moody currents and the associated $SL (\infty ; \IR )$ Sugawara form ofenergy-momentum tensor component $T_{++}$ as a consequence of the $SL (\infty ;\IR )$ stationary subgroup of the relevant $\, \Winf$ coadjoint orbit.
