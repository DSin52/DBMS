We introduce a realization of Seiberg duality in MQCD that does not involvemoving branes. Using related arguments in M Theory and IIA, we investigate theflavor symmetry breaking via flavored magnetic monopole condensation ofhep-th/0005076. We verify our results by considering visualizations of M5branes corresponding to $\N=2$ vacua which survive soft breaking by an adjointmass term.
