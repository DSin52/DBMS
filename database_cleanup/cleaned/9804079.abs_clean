Title: Renormalization conditions and the effective potential of the massless

phi^4 theoryComments: LaTex, 7 pages, 3 postscript figures

We point out that there is a missing portion in the two-loop effectivepotential of the massless O(N) phi^4 theory obtained by Jackiw in his classicpaper, Phys. Rev. D 9, 1686 (1974).
