We discuss the properties of black holes in brane-world scenarios where ouruniverse is viewed as a four-dimensional sub-manifold of somehigher-dimensional spacetime. We consider in detail such a model wherefour-dimensional spacetime lies at the junction of several domain walls in ahigher dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. In this model there may be anynumber p of infinitely large extra dimensions transverse to the brane-world. Wepresent an exact solution describing a black p-brane which will induce on thebrane-world the Schwarzschild solution. This exact solution is unstable to theGregory-Laflamme instability, whereby long-wavelength perturbations cause theextended horizon to fragment. We therefore argue that at late times anon-rotating uncharged black hole in the brane-world is described by a deformedevent horizon in p+4 dimensions which will induce, to good approximation, theSchwarzschild solution in the four-dimensional brane world. When p=2, thisdeformed horizon resembles a black diamond and more generally for p>2, apolyhedron.
