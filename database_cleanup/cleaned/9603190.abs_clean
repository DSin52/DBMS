The complete spectrum of states in the supersymmetric principal chiral modelbased on SU(n) is conjectured, and an exact factorizable S-matrix is proposedto describe scattering amongst these states. The SU(n)_L*SU(n)_R symmetry ofthe lagrangian is manifest in the S-matrix construction. The supersymmetries,on the other hand, are incorporated in the guise of spin-1/2 charges acting ona set of RSOS kinks associated with su(n) at level n. To test the proposedS-matrix, calculations of the change in the ground-state energy in the presenceof a coupling to a background charge are carried out. The results derived fromthe lagrangian using perturbation theory and from the S-matrix using the TBAare found to be in complete agreement for a variety of background charges whichpick out, in turn, the highest weight states in each of the fundamentalrepresentations of SU(n). In particular, these methods rule out the possibilityof additional CDD factors in the S-matrix. Comparison of the expressions foundfor the free-energy also yields an exact result for the mass-gap in these
