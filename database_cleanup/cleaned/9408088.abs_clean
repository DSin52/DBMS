In this paper we study the dynamics of a statistical ensemble of strings,building on a recently proposed gauge theory of the string geodesic field. Weshow that this stochastic approach is equivalent to the Carath\'eodoryformulation of the Nambu-Goto action, supplemented by an averaging procedureover the family of classical string world-sheets which are solutions of theequation of motion. In this new framework, the string geodesic field isreinterpreted as the Gibbs current density associated with the stringstatistical ensemble. Next, we show that the classical field equations derivedfrom the string gauge action, can be obtained as the semi-classical limit ofthe string functional wave equation. For closed strings, the wave equationitself is completely analogous to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation used in quantumcosmology. Thus, in the string case, the wave function has support on the spaceof all possible spatial loop configurations. Finally, we show that the stringdistribution induces a multi-phase, or {\it cellular} structure on thespacetime manifold characterized by domains with a purely Riemannian geometryseparated by domain walls over which there exists a predominantly Weylgeometry.
