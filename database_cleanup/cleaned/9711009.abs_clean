We derive the fully extended supersymmetry algebra carried by D-branes in amassless type IIA superspace vacuum. We find that the extended algebra containsnot only topological charges that probe the presence of compact spacetimedimensions but also pieces that measure non-trivial configurations of the gaugefield on the worldvolume of the brane. Furthermore there are terms that measurethe coupling of the non-triviality of the worldvolume regarded as a U(1)-bundleof the gauge field to possible compact spacetime dimensions. In particular, theextended algebra carried by the D-2-brane can contain the charge of a Diracmonopole of the gauge field. In the course of this work we derive a set ofgeneralized Gamma-matrix identities that include the ones presently known forthe IIA case.In the first part of the paper we give an introduction to the basic notionsof Noether current algebras and charge algebras; furthermore we find a Theoremthat describes in a general context how the presence of a gauge field on theworldvolume of an embedded object transforming under the symmetry group on thetarget space alters the algebra of the Noether charges, which otherwise wouldbe the same as the algebra of the symmetry group. This is a phenomenon recentlyfound by Sorokin and Townsend in the case of the M-5-brane, but here we showthat it holds quite generally, and in particular also in the case of D-branes.
