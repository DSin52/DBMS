We consider possible mixing of electromagnetic and gravitational shock waves,in the Planckian energy scattering of point particles in Minkowski space. Byboosting a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole solution to the velocity of light,it is shown that no mixing of shock waves takes place for arbitrary finitecharge carried by the black hole. However, a similar boosting procedure for afunction of even a neutral test particle, acquires a small additional phasefactor depending on the dilatonic black hole charge. Possible implications forpoles in the amplitudes for the dilaton gravity case are discussed.
