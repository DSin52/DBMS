Title: Conformal fixed point, Cosmological Constant and Quintessence

Comments: More detailed discussion of quantum fluctuations,update with

WMAP-data,4 pages,LaTexWe connect a possible solution for the ``cosmological constant problem'' tothe existence of a (postulated) conformal fixed point in a fundamental theory.The resulting cosmology leads to quintessence, where the present accelerationof the expansion of the universe is linked to a crossover in the flow ofcoupling constants.
