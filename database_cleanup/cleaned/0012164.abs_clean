In this work we study the dynamics of branes on group manifolds G deep in thestringy regime. After giving a brief overview of the various branes that can beconstructed within the boundary conformal field theory approach, we analyze indetail the condensation processes that occur on stacks of such branes. At largevolume our discussion is based on certain effective gauge theories onnon-commutative `fuzzy' spaces. Using the `absorption of the boundaryspin'-principle which was formulated by Affleck and Ludwig in their work on theKondo model, we extrapolate the brane dynamics into the stringy regime. Forsupersymmetric theories, the resulting condensation processes turn out to beconsistent with the existence of certain conserved charges taking values insome non-trivial discrete abelian groups. We obtain strong constraints on thesecharge groups for G = SU(N). The results may be compared with a recent proposalof Bouwknegt and Mathai according to which charge groups on curved spaces X(with a non-vanishing NSNS 3-form field strength H) are given by the twistedK-groups K*_H(X).
