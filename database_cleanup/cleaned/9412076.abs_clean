The properties of static spherically symmetric black holes, which are eitherelectrically or magnetically charged, and which are coupled to the dilaton inthe presence of a cosmological constant, are considered. It is shown that suchsolutions do not exist if the cosmological constant is positive (in arbitraryspacetime dimension >= 4). However, asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holesolutions with a single horizon do exist if the cosmological constant isnegative. These solutions are studied numerically in four dimensions and thethermodynamic properties of the solutions are derived. The extreme solutionsare found to have zero entropy and infinite temperature for all non-zero valuesof the dilaton coupling constant.
