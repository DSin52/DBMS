Title: Boson Mapping in Field Theory

Authors: P.O. Hess, J.C. L\'opez Vieyra, C.R. Stephens

Comments: 9 pages Latex; to be published in ``Proceedings of the Conference on

Elementary Matter'', South Africa, 1996A boson mapping of pair field operators is presented. The mapping preservesall hermiticity properties and the Poisson bracket relations between fields andmomenta. The most practical application of the boson mapping is to fieldtheories which exhibit bound states of pairs of fields. As a concreteapplication we consider, in the low energy limit, the Wick-Cutkosky model withequal mass for the charged fields.
