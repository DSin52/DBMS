We write down matrix models for Ising spins with zero external field on thevertices of dynamical triangulated random surfaces (DTRS) and dynamicallyquadrangulated random surfaces (DQRS) and compare these with the standardmatrix model approach which places the spins on the dual $\phi^3$ and $\phi^4$graphs. We show that the critical temperatures calculated in the DTRS and DQRSmodels agree with those deduced from duality arguments in the standardapproach. Using the DQRS model we observe that the Ising antiferromagnet stillundergoes a phase transition to a Neel (checkerboard) ordered ground statewhich is absent because of frustration in the other cases.
