A new model of bosonic strings is considered. An action of the model is thesum of the standard string action and a term describing an interaction of ametric with a linear (affine) connection. The Lagrangian of this interaction isan arbitrary analytic function $f(R)$ of the scalar curvature. This is aclassically integrable model. The space of classical solutions of the theoryconsists from sectors with constant curvature. In each sector the equations ofmotion reduce to the standard string equations and to an additional constantcurvature equation for the linear connection. A bifurcation in the space of allLagrangians takes place. Quantization of the model is briefly discussed. In aquasiclassical approximation one gets the standard string model with afluctuating cosmological constant. The Lagrangian $f(R)$, like Morse function,governs transitions between manifolds with different topologies.
