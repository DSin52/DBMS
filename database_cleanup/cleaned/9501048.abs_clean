We apply the Mellin-Barnes integral representation to several situations ofinterest in mathematical-physics. At the purely mathematical level, we deriveuseful asymptotic expansions of different zeta-functions and partitionfunctions. These results are then employed in different topics of quantum fieldtheory, which include the high-temperature expansion of the free energy of ascalar field in ultrastatic curved spacetime, the asymptotics of the $p$-branedensity of states, and an explicit approach to the asymptotics of thedeterminants that appear in string theory.
