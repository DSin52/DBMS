We consider integrable systems that are connected with orthogonal separationof variables in complex Riemannian spaces of constant curvature. An isomorphismwith the hyperbolic Gaudin magnet, previously pointed out by one of us, extendsto coordinates of this type. The complete classification of these separablecoordinate systems is provided by means of the corresponding $L$-matrices forthe Gaudin magnet. The limiting procedures (or $\epsilon $ calculus) whichrelate various degenerate orthogonal coordinate systems play a crucial resultin the classification of all such systems.
