Assuming the existence of a $dS/CFT$ correspondence we study the holograms ofsources moving along geodesics in the bulk by calculating the one pointfunctions they induce in the boundary theory. In analogy with a similar studyof uniformly accelerated sources in $AdS$ spacetime, we argue that comovinggeodesic observers correspond to a coordinate system on the boundary in whichthe one point function is {\it constant}. For $dS_3$ we show that the conformaltransformations on the boundary which achieve this - when continued suitably toLorentzian signature - induce nontrivial Bogoliubov transformations betweenmodes, leading to a thermal spectrum. This may be regarded as a holographicsignature of thermality detected by bulk geodesic observers.
