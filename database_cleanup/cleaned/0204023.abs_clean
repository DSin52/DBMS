We study the N=1 Sp(2N+2M)xSp(2N) cascading gauge theory on a stack of Nphysical and M fractional (half) D3-branes at the singularity of anorientifolded conifold. In addition to the D3-branes and an O7-plane, thebackground contains eight D7-branes, which give rise to matter in thefundamental representation of the gauge group. The moduli space of the gaugetheory is analyzed and its structure is related to the brane configurations inthe dual type IIB theory and in type IIA/M-theory.
