Title: Twisted Homotopy

Comments: 7 pages,Latex,no figures

After summarising the physical approach leading to twisted homotopy andafter developing the cohomological approach further with respect to ourprevious work we propose a third alternative approach to twisted homotopybased on group theoretic considerations. In this approach the fundamentalgroup $\Pi (m) $ isomorphic to Z which describes homotopic loops on thepunctured plane$ R^2/(0) $ is enhanced in a special way to the continuousSO(2) group . This is performed by letting the parameter of the group $ m\rightarrow \lambda $ while keeping its generator unchanged .It is shown thatsuch non-trivial procedure has the effect of introducing well definedself-interactions among loops which are at the basis of twisted homotopy wherethe angle $ \lambda $ plays the role of the self coupling constant.
