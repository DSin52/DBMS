Spectra of glueball masses in non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in threeand four dimensions have recently been computed using the conjectured dualitybetween superstring theory and large N gauge theory. The Kaluza-Klein states ofsupergravity do not correspond to any states in the Yang-Mills theory andtherefore should decouple in the continuum limit. On the other hand, in thesupergravity limit g_{YM}^2 N -> \infty, we find that the masses of theKaluza-Klein states are comparable to those of the glueballs. We also show thatthe leading (g_{YM}^2N)^{-1} corrections do not make these states heavier thanthe glueballs. Therefore, the decoupling of the Kaluza-Klein states is notevident to this order.
