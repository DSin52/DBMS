Title: Group Theory Structures Underlying Integrable Systems

Authors: A.Mironov

Comments: 7 pages, LaTeX, no figures; Talk presented at the II Sakharov

International ConferenceDifferent group structures which underline the integrable systems areconsidered. In some cases, the quantization of the integrable system can beprovided with substituting groups by their quantum counterparts. However, someother group structures keep non-deformed in the course of quantizing theintegrable system although their treatment is to be changed. Manifest examplesof the KP/Toda hierarchy and the Liouville theory are considered.
