Title: Axion-Dilaton Black Holes

Authors: Renata Kallosh

Comments: 8 pages, LATEX, (Talk presented at the TEXAS/PASCOS conference,

Berkeley, December 1992)In this talk some essential features of stringy black holes are described. Weconsider charged four-dimensional axion-dilaton black holes. The Hawkingtemperature and the entropy of all solutions are shown to be simple functionsof the squares of supercharges, defining the positivity bounds. Sphericallysymmetric and multi black hole solutions are presented. The extreme solutionshave some unbroken supersymmetries. Axion-dilaton black holes with zero entropyand zero area of the horizon form a family of stable particle-like objects,which we call holons. We discuss the possibility of splitting of nearly extremeblack holes into holons.
