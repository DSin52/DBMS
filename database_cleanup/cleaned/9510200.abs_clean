We obtain form factors for scattering of gravitons and anti-symmetric tensorparticles off Dirichlet $p$-branes in Type II superstring theory. As expected,in fact it is saturated by a single dilaton tadpole graph. In contrast,$p$-branes with $p>-1$ acquire size of order the string scale due to quantumeffects and exhibit Regge behavior. We find their leading form factors inclosed form and show that they contain an infinite sequence of poles associatedwith $p$-brane excitations. Finally, we argue that the $p$-brane form factorsfor scattering of R-R bosons will have the same stringy features found withNS-NS states.
