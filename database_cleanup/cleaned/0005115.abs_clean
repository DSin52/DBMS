Recent conjectures of the c-theorem in four and higher dimensions havesuggested that the coefficient of the Euler characteristic in the trace anomalycould measure the degrees of freedom in field theory and decrease along therenormalization-group flow. We compute this quantity for free massless scalar,fermion and antisymmetric tensor fields in any dimension, and analyse itsdependence on spin and space-time dimension. In the limit of large number ofdimensions, where the theories become semiclassical, we find that this quantitydoes not approach the classical number of field components, but is enhanced forspinful particles. This seemingly strange behaviour is found to be consistentwith known renormalization-group patterns and a specific c-theorem conjecture.
