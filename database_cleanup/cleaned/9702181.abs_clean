We propose a generalization of meanders, i.e., configurations ofnon-selfintersecting loops crossing a line through a given number of points, toSU(N). This uses the reformulation of meanders as pairs of reduced elements ofthe Temperley-Lieb algebra, a SU(2)-related quotient of the Hecke algebra, witha natural generalization to SU(N). We also derive explicit formulas for SU(N)meander determinants, defined as the Gram determinants of the correspondingbases of the Hecke algebra.
