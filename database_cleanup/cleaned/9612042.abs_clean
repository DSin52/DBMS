We construct the Wess-Zumino terms from anomalies in case of quasigroups forthe following situations. One is effective gauge field theories ofNambu-Goldstone fields associated with spontaneously broken global symmetriesand the other is anomalous gauge theories. The formalism that we will developcan be seen as a generalization of the non-linear realization method of Liegroups. As an example we consider 2d gravity with a Weyl invariantregularization
