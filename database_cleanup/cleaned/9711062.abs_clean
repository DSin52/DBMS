It is shown that canonical quantization of the $4d$ Siegel superparticleyields massless Wess-Zumino model as an effective field theory. Quantum statesof the superparticle are realized in terms of the real scalar superfields whichprove to be decomposed into the sum of on-shell chiral and antichiralsuperfields.
