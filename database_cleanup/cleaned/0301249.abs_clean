To appear in a special issue of IJMPAIn this work we explain the construction of the thermal vacuum for thebosonic string, as well that of the thermal boundary state interpreted as a$D_{p}$-brane at finite temperature. In both case we calculate the respectiveentropy using the entropy operator of the Thermo Field Dynamics Theory. We showthat the contribution of the thermal string entropy is explicitly present inthe $D_{p}$-brane entropy. Furthermore, we show that the Thermo Field approachis suitable to introduce temperature in boundary states.
