Authors: Bihn Zhou and Chuan-Jie Zhu

Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX, no figures

In this note we present an application of the Schwarzian derivative. Byexploiting some properties of the Schwarzian derivative, we solve the equationappearing in the gravity-dilaton-antisymmetric tensor system. We also mentionthat this method can also be used to solve some other equations.
