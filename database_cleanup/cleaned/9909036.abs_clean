Title: Low Energy String

Comments: 31 pages, AmsTex, no figures

It is argued that a low energy string may be an Aristotelian top, i.e. arigid body which however cannot be rotationally excited, but in an externalelectromagnetic field exhibits a sort of precession with a Larmor type angularvelocity. On the basis of this observation a proposal is made for a new twosteps derivation of the electroweak standard model from the string dynamics. Inthe first step a theory of Aristotelian top is formulated and studied in moredetail and in the second step an attempt is made to derive the electroweakstandard model from the top dynamics. Before the symmetry breaking fermions arerepresented by straight frozen strings - rotators, whose symmetry under therotation around their axes is interpreted as the group $U(1)_Y$. The emergenceof $SU(2)_L$ group is somewhat less transparent and is supposed to be connectedwith the new degree of freedom of relativistic rotators, which leads to the upand down type fermions. The symmetry breaking is associated with the bending ofthe rotators under the influence of Higgs field and with their subsequenttransformation into the curved frozen strings - tops. In this new picture ofelectroweak interaction the chirality of the theory has a simple and naturalexplanation, the weak isospin and hypercharge are inherent properties ofrelativistic rotators/tops and the superselection rule associated with electriccharge is a consequence of the accepted distinction between up and down typefermions.
