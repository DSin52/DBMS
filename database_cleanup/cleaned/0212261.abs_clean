Title: Ghost constraints and the covariant quantization of the superparticle in

ten dimensionsAuthors: Michael Chesterman (Queen Mary, London)

We present a modification of the Berkovits superparticle. This is firstly inorder to covariantly quantize the pure spinor ghosts, and secondly tocovariantly calculate matrix elements of a generic operator between two states.We proceed by lifting the pure spinor ghost constraints and regaining themthrough a BRST cohomology. We are then able to perform a BRST quantization ofthe system in the usual way, except for some interesting subtleties. Since thepure spinor constraints are reducible, ghosts for ghosts terms are needed,which have so far been calculated up to level 4. Even without a completion ofthese terms, we are still able to calculate arbitrary matrix elements of aphysical operator between two physical states.
