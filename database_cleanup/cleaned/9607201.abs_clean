Title: Lectures on Superstring and M Theory Dualities

Comments: 67 pages, latex, 1 figure; Lectures given at the ICTP Spring School

(March 1996) and the TASI Summer School (June 1996), TASI96Journal-ref: Nucl.Phys.Proc.Suppl. 55B (1997) 1-32

These lectures begin by reviewing the evidence for S duality of thetoroidally compactified heterotic string in 4d that was obtained in the period1992--94. Next they review recently discovered dualities that relate all fiveof the 10d superstring theories and a quantum extension of 11d supergravitycalled M theory. The study of p-branes of various dimensions (some of which areD-branes) plays a central role. The final sections survey supersymmetric stringvacua in 6d and some of the dual constructions by which they can be obtained.Special emphasis is given to a class of N=1 models that exhibit``heterotic-heterotic duality.''
