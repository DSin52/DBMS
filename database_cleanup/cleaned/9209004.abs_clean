We present a notion of symmetry for 1+1-dimensional integrable systems whichis consistent with their group theoretic description and reproduces in specialcases the known Baecklund transformation for the generalized Korteweg-deVrieshierarchies. We also apply it to the relativistic invariance of theLeznov-Saveliev systems.
