We investigate a class of models in 1+1 dimensions with four fermioninteraction term. At each order of the perturbation expansion, the models areultraviolet finite and Lorentz non-invariant. We show that for certainprivileged values of the coupling constants, Lorentz symmetry is restored, andindeed the model turns out to be conformally invariant. This phenomenon is bothquantum mechanical and non-perturbative.
