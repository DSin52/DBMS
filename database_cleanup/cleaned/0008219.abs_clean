The extremum of the Willmore-like functional for $m$-dimensional Riemanniansurface immersed in $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifold under normal variationsis studied and various cases of interest are examined. This study is used torelate the parameters of QCD string action, including the Polyakov-Kleinertextrinsic curvature action, with the geometric properties of the world sheet.The world sheet has been shown to have {\it{negative stiffness}} on the basisof geometric considerations.
