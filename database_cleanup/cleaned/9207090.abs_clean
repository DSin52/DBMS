Title: Invariants of Colored Links and a Property of the Clebsch-Gordan

Coefficients of $U_q(g)$Comments: 4 pages

We show that multivariable colored link invariants are derived from the rootsof unity representations of $U_q(g)$. We propose a property of theClebsch-Gordan coefficients of $U_q(g)$, which is important for defining theinvariants of colored links. For $U_q(sl_2) we explicitly prove the property,and then construct invariants of colored links and colored ribbon graphs, whichgeneralize the multivariable Alexander polynomial.
