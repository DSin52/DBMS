The effect of the Gaussian curvature in the rigid string action on theinterquark potential is investigated. The linearized equations of motion andboundary conditions, following from the modified string action, are obtained.The equation, defining the eigenfrequency spectrum of the string oscillationsis derived. On this basis, the interquark potential, generated by the string iscalculated in one-loop approximation. A substantial influence of thetopological term in the string action on the interquark potential at thedistances of hadronic size order or less is revealed.
