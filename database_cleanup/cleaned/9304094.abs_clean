Following the general method discussed in Refs.[1,2], Liouville gravity andthe 2 dimensional model of non-Einstenian gravity ${\cal L} \sim curv^2 +torsion^2 + cosm. const.$ can be formulated as ISO(1,1) gauge theories. In thefirst order formalism the models present, besides the Poincar\'e gaugesymmetry, additional local symmetries. We show that in both models one can fixthese additional symmetries preserving the ISO(1,1) gauge symmetry and thediffeomorphism invariance, so that, after a preliminary Dirac procedure, theremaining constraints uniquely satisfy the ISO(1,1) algebra. After theadditional symmetry is fixed, the equations of motion are unaltered. One thusremarkably simplifies the canonical structure, especially of the second model.Moreover, one shows that the Poincar\'e group can always be used consistentlyas a gauge group for gravitational theories in two dimensions.
