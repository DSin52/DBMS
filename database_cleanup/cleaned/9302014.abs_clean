We propose an improved iterative scheme for calculating higher genuscontributions to the multi-loop (or multi-point) correlators and the partitionfunction of the hermitian one matrix model. We present explicit results up togenus two. We develop a version which gives directly the result in the doublescaling limit and present explicit results up to genus four. Using the latterversion we prove that the hermitian and the complex matrix model are equivalentin the double scaling limit and that in this limit they are both equivalent tothe Kontsevich model. We discuss how our results away from the double scalinglimit are related to the structure of moduli space.
