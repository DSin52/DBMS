We show that the Bessel equation can be cast, by means of suitabletransformations, into a system of two damped/amplified parametric oscillatorequations. The relation with the group contraction mechanism is analyzed andthe breakdown of loop-antiloop symmetry due to group contraction manifestsitself as violation of time-reversal symmetry. A preliminary discussion of therelation between some infinite dimensional loop-algebras, such as theVirasoro-like algebra, and the Euclidean algebras e(2) and e(3) is alsopresented.
