We develop a transfer matrix formalism for two-dimensional pure gravity. Bytaking the continuum limit, we obtain a "Hamiltonian formalism'' in which thegeodesic distance plays the role of time. Applying this formalism, we obtain auniversal function which describes the fractal structures of two dimensionalquantum gravity in the continuum limit.
