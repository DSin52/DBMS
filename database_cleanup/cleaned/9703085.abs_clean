We define an infinite class of integrable theories with a defect which areformulated as chiral defect perturbations of a conformal field theory. Suchtheories can be interacting in the bulk, and are purely transmitting throughthe defect. The examples of the sine-Gordon theory and Ising model are workedout in some detail.
