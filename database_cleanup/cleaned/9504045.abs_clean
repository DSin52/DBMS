Recently we have shown that a phase transition occurs in the leadingapproximation of the large N limit in rigid strings coupled to long rangeKalb-Ramond interactions. The disordered phase is essentially theNambu-Goto-Polyakov string theory while The ordered phase is a new theory. Inthis part I letter we study the first sub-leading quantum corrections of thefree rigid string and derive the renormalization group equation. We show thatthe theory is asymptotically free, thus the extrinsic curvature of the stringdrops out at large distance scales in the disordered phase. In part II wegeneralize the results of this letter to the interacting theory of rigidstrings with the long range Kalb-Ramond interactions. We derive therenormalized mass gap equation and obtain the renormalized critical line. Ourmain and final result is that the phase transition does indeed survive quantumfluctuations.
