We study the question of existence and the number of normalized vacuum statesin N = 4 super-Yang-Mills quantum mechanics for any gauge group. The massdeformation method is the simplest and clearest one. It allowed us to calculatethe number of normalized vacuum states for all gauge groups. For all unitarygroups, #(vac) = 1, but for the symplectic groups [starting from Sp(6) ], forthe orthogonal groups [starting from SO(8)] and for all the exceptional groups,it is greater than one. We also discuss at length the functional integralmethod. We calculate the ``deficit term'' for some non-unitary groups andpredict the value of the integral giving the ``principal contribution''. Theissues like the Born-Oppenheimer procedure to derive the effective theory andthe manifestation of the localized vacua for the asymptotic effective wavefunctions are also discussed.
