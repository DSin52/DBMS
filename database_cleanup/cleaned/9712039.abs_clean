We show that the exact $beta$--function of 4D N=2 SYM plays the role of themetric whose inverse satisfies the WDVV--like equations $\F_{ikl}\beta^{lm}\F_{mnj}=\F_{jkl}\beta^{lm}\F_{mni}$. The conjecture that the WDVV--likeequations are equivalent to the identity involving the $u$--modulus and theprepotential $\F$, seen as a superconformal anomaly, sheds light on therecently considered c-theorem for the N=2 SYM field theories.
