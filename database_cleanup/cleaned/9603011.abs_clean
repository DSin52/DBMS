We approach the study of non--integrable models of two--dimensional quantumfield theory as perturbations of the integrable ones. By exploiting theknowledge of the exact $S$-matrix and Form Factors of the integrable fieldtheories we obtain the first order corrections to the mass ratios, the vacuumenergy density and the $S$-matrix of the non-integrable theories. Asinteresting applications of the formalism, we study the scaling region of theIsing model in an external magnetic field at $T \sim T_c$ and the scalingregion around the minimal model $M_{2,7}$. For these models, a remarkableagreement is observed between the theoretical predictions and the dataextracted by a numerical diagonalization of their Hamiltonian.
