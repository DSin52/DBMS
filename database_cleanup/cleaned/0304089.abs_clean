M-theory compactifies on a seven-dimensional time-dependent hyperbolic orflat space to a four-dimensional FLRW cosmology undergoing a period ofaccelerated expansion in Einstein conformal frame. The strong energy conditionis violated by the scalar fields produced in the compactification, as isnecessary to evade the no-go theorem for time-independent compactifications.The four-form field strength of eleven-dimensional supergravity smoothlyswitches on during the period of accelerated expansion in hyperboliccompactifications, whereas in flat compactifications, the three-form potentialsmoothly changes its sign. For small acceleration times, this behaviour is likea phase transition of the three-form potential, during which the cosmologicalscale factor approximately doubles.
