We present a Mathai-Quillen interpretation of topological sigma models. Thekey to the construction is a natural connection in a suitable infinitedimensional vector bundle over the space of maps from a Riemann surface (theworld sheet) to an almost complex manifold (the target). We show that thecovariant derivative of the section defined by the differential operator thatappears in the equation for pseudo-holomorphic curves is precisely thelinearization of the operator itself. We also discuss the Mathai-Quillenformalism of gauged topological sigma models.
