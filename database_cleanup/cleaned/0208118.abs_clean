Title: Quantum groups and quantum field theory

Authors: Christian Brouder and Robert Oeckl

Comments: 22 pages, no figures

The quantum field algebra of real scalar fields is shown to be an example ofinfinite dimensional quantum group. The underlying Hopf algebra is thesymmetric algebra S(V) and the product is Wick's normal product. Twocoquasitriangular structures can be built from the two-point function and theFeynman propagator of scalar fields to reproduce the operator product and thetime-ordered product as twist deformations of the normal product. Acorrespondence is established between the quantum group and the quantum fieldconcepts. On the mathematical side the underlying structures come out of Hopfalgebra cohomology.
