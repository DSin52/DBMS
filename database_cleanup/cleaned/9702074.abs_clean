There exist two different languages, the ^sl(2) and N=2 ones, to describesimilar structures; a dictionary is given translating the keyrepresentation-theoretic terms related to the two algebras. The main tool todescribe the structure of ^sl(2) and N=2 modules is provided by diagrams ofextremal vectors. The ^sl(2) and N=2 representation theories of certainhighest-weight types turn out to be equivalent modulo the respective spectralflows.
