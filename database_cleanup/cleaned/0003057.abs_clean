Using properties of the DBI action we find D-branes on $S^3$ of the radius$Q_5$ corresponding to the conjugacy classes of SU(2). The branes are stabledue to nonzero 2-form NSNS background. In the limit of large $Q_5$ the dynamicsof branes is governed by the non-commutative Yang-Mills theory. The resultspartially overlap with those obtained in the recent paper hep-th/0003037.
