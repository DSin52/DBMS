We suggest a D=11 super Poincar\'e invariant action for the superstring whichhas free dynamics in the physical variables sector. Instead of the standardapproach based on the searching for an action with local $\kappa$-symmetry (or,equivalently, with corresponding first class constraints), we propose a theorywith fermionic constraints of second class only. Then the $\kappa$-symmetry andthe well known $\Gamma$-matrix identities are not necessary for theconstruction. Thus, at the classical level, the superstring action of the typedescribed can exist in any spacetime dimensions and the known brane-scan can berevisited.
