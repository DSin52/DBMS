The quantum theory of a free particle on a portion of two-dimensionalEuclidean space bounded by a circle and subject to non-local boundaryconditions gives rise to bulk and surface states. Starting from this well knownproperty, a counterpart for gravity is here considered. In particular, ifspatial components of metric perturbations are set to zero at the boundary,invariance of the full set of boundary conditions under infinitesimaldiffeomorphisms is compatible with non-local boundary conditions on normalcomponents of metric perturbations if and only if both the gauge-field operatorand the ghost operator are pseudo-differential operators in one-loop quantumgravity.
