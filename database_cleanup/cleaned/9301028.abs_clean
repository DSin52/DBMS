These notes summarize the lectures delivered in the V Mexican School ofParticle Physics, at the University of Guanajuato. We give a survey of theapplication of Ashtekar's variables to the quantization of General Relativityin four dimensions with special emphasis on the application of techniques ofanalytic knot theory to the loop representation. We discuss the role that theJones Polynomial plays as a generator of nondegenerate quantum states of thegravitational field.
