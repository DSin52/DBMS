We have examined solutions of tetrahedron equations from the elliptic freefermion model by using Korepanov mechanism based on tetrahedral Zamolodchikovalgebras. As a byproduct, we have found a new integrable 2-dim. lattice model.We have also studied the relation between tetrahedral Zamolodchikov algebrasand tetrahedron equations.
