We use the Regge-Teitelboim method to treat surface integrals in gaugetheories to find global charges in Chern-Simons theory. We derive the affineand Virasoro generators as global charges associated with symmetries of theboundary. The role of boundary conditions is clarified. We prove that fordiffeomorphisms that do not preserve the boundary there is a classicalcontribution to the central charge in the Virasoro algebra. The example ofanti-de Sitter 2+1 gravity is considered in detail.
