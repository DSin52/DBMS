Title: Open String Creation by S-Branes

Authors: Andrew Strominger

Comments: Talk presented at the Hangzhou String 2002 Conference, August 12-15

An sp-brane can be viewed as the creation and decay of an unstableD(p+1)-brane. It is argued that the decaying half of an sp-brane can bedescribed by a variant of boundary Liouville theory. The pair creation of openstrings by a decaying s-brane is studied in the minisuperspace approximation tothe Liouville theory. In this approximation a Hagedorn-like divergence is foundin the pair creation rate, suggesting the s-brane energy is rapidly transferredinto closed string radiation.
