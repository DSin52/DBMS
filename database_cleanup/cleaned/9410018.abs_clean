We investigate the dependence of the number and type of untwisted moduli onthe boundary condition vectors of relistic free fermionic strings. The numberof moduli is given by six minus the number of complex internal world--sheetfermions and the type of moduli is determined by the details of theworld--sheet left--right asymmetry of the boundary conditions for the internalfermions. We give a geometrical description of our results in terms of thetransformations of the compactified dimensions of $Z_2 \times Z_2$ orbifolds.We investigate all possible boundary conditions for the internal fermions andprove our results in general by showing that world--sheet supersymmetryeliminates those boundary conditions which violate our results.
