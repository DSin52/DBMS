As a preparation for the study of {\it arbitrary} extensions of $d=2$ gravitywe present a detailed investigation of $SO(N)$ supergravity. By gauging achiral, nilpotent subgroup of the $OSp(N|2)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model we obtainan all order expression for the effective action. Reality of the couplingconstant imposes the usual restrictions on $c$ for $N=0$ and 1. No suchrestrictions appear for $N\geq 2$. For $N=2$, 3 and 4, no renormalizations ofthe coupling constant beyond one loop occur. These results are related tonon-renormalization theorems for theories with extended supersymmetries.Arbitrary (super)extensions of $d=2$ gravity are then analyzed. The inducedtheory is represented by a WZW model for which a chiral, solvable group isgauged. From this, we obtain the effective action. All order expressions forboth the coupling constant renormalization and the wavefunction renormalizationare given. From this we classify all extensions of $d=2$ gravity for which thecoupling constant gets at most a one loop renormalization. As an application ofthe general strategy, $N=4$ theories based on $D(2,1,\a)$ and $SU(1,1|2)$, all$WA$ gravities and the $N=2$ $W_n$ models are treated in some detail.
