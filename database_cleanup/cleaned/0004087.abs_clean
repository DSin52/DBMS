We consider chiral condensates in SU(2) gauge theory with broken N=2supersymmetry. The matter sector contains an adjoint multiplet and onefundamental flavor. Matter and gaugino condensates are determined byintegrating out the adjoint field. The only nonperturbative input is theAffleck-Dine-Seiberg (ADS) superpotential generated by one instanton plus theKonishi anomaly. These results are consistent with those obtained by the`integrating in' procedure, including a reproduction of the Seiberg-Wittencurve from the ADS superpotential. We then calculate monopole, dyon, and chargecondensates using the Seiberg-Witten approach. We show that the monopole andcharge condensates vanish at the Argyres-Douglas point where the monopole andcharge vacua collide. We interpret this phenomenon as a deconfinement ofelectric and magnetic charges at the Argyres-Douglas point.
