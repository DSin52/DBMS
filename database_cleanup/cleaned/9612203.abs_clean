The off-shell vector-tensor multiplet is considered in an arbitrarybackground of N=2 vector supermultiplets. We establish the existence of twoinequivalent versions, characterized by different Chern-Simons couplings. Inone version the vector field of the vector-tensor multiplet is containedquadratically in the Chern-Simons term, which implies nonlinear terms in thesupersymmetry transformations and equations of motion. In the second version,which requires a background of at least two abelian vector supermultiplets, thesupersymmetry transformations remain at most linear in the vector-tensorcomponents. This version is of the type known to arise from reduction of tensorsupermultiplets in six dimensions. Our work applies to any number ofvector-tensor multiplets.
