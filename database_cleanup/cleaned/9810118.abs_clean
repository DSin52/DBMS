The simplest supersymmetry (SUSY) algebra in four dimensional Euclidean space($4dE$) has been shown to closely resemble the $N = 2$ SUSY algebra in fourdimensional Minkowski space ($4dM$). The structure of the former algebra isexamined in greater detail in this paper. We first present its Clifford algebrastructure. This algebra shows that the momentum Casimir invariant of physicalstates has an upper bound which is fixed by the central charges. Secondly, weuse reduction of the $N = 1$ SUSY algebra in six dimensional Minkowski space($6dM$) to $4dE$; this reproduces our SUSY algebra in $4dE$. Moreover, thissame reduction of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SSYM) in $6dM$ reproducesZumino's SSYM in $4dE$. We demonstrate how this dimensional reduction can beused to introduce additional generators into the SUSY algebra in $4dE$.
