The validity of dilute gas approximation is explored by making use of thelarge-sized instanton in quantum mechanical model. It is shown that theEuclidean probability amplitude derived through a dilute gas approximation notonly cannot explain the result of the linear combination of atomic orbitalsapproximation, but also does not exhibit a proper limiting case when the sizeof instanton is very large.
