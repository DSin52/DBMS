Scattering amplitudes of the spin-4/3 fractional superstring are shown tosatisfy spurious state decoupling and cyclic symmetry (duality) at tree-levelin the string perturbation expansion. This fractional superstring ischaracterized by the spin-4/3 fractional superconformal algebra---aparafermionic algebra studied by Zamolodchikov and Fateev involving chiralspin-4/3 currents on the world-sheet in addition to the stress-energy tensor.Examples of tree scattering amplitudes are calculated in an explicit c=5representation of this fractional superconformal algebra realized in terms offree bosons on the string world-sheet. The target space of this model isthree-dimensional flat Minkowski space-time with a level-2 Kac-Moody so(2,1)internal symmetry, and has bosons and fermions in its spectrum. Its closedstring version contains a graviton in its spectrum. Tree-level unitarity (i.e.,the no-ghost theorem for space-time bosonic physical states) can be shown forthis model. Since the critical central charge of the spin-4/3 fractionalsuperstring theory is 10, this c=5 representation cannot be consistent at thestring loop level. The existence of a critical fractional superstringcontaining a four-dimensional space-time remains an open question.
