We present a class of exact solutions for homogeneous, anisotropiccosmologies in four dimensions derived from the low-energy string effectiveaction including a homogeneous dilaton $\phi$ and antisymmetric tensorpotential $B_{\mu\nu}$. Making this potential time-dependent produces ananisotropic energy-momentum tensor, and leads us to consider a Bianchi Icosmology. The solution for the axion field must then only be a linear functionof one spatial coordinate. This in turn places an upper bound on the product ofthe two scale factors evolving perpendicular to the gradient of the axionfield. The only late-time isotropic solution is then a {\em contracting}universe.
