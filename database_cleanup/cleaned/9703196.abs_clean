The weak energy condition is known to fail in general when applied toexpectation values of the the energy momentum tensor in flat space quantumfield theory. It is shown how the usual counter arguments against its validityare no longer applicable if the states $|\psi \r$ for which the expectationvalue is considered are restricted to a suitably defined subspace. A possiblenatural restriction on $|\psi \r$ is suggested and illustrated by two quantummechanical examples based on a simple perturbed harmonic oscillatorHamiltonian. The proposed alternative quantum weak energy condition is appliedto states formed by the action of scalar, vector and the energy momentum tensoroperators on the vacuum. We assume conformal invariance in order to determinealmost uniquely three-point functions involving the energy momentum tensor interms of a few parameters. The positivity conditions lead to non trivialinequalities for these parameters. They are satisfied in free field theories,except in one case for dimensions close to two. Further restrictions on $|\psi\r$ are suggested which remove this problem. The inequalities which follow fromconsidering the state formed by applying the energy momentum tensor to thevacuum are shown to imply that the coefficient of the topological term in theexpectation value of the trace of the energy momentum tensor in an arbitrarycurved space background is positive, in accord with calculations in free fieldtheories.
