The local BRST cohomology is computed in old and new minimal supergravity,including the coupling to Yang-Mills gauge multiplets. This covers thedetermination of all gauge invariant local actions for these models, theclassification of all the possible counterterms that are invariant on-shell, ofall candidate gauge anomalies, and of the possible nontrivial (continuous)deformations of the standard actions and gauge transformations. Among others itis proved that in old minimal supergravity the most general gauge invariantaction can indeed be constructed from well-known superspace integrals, whereasin new minimal supergravity there are only a few additional (but important)contributions which cannot be constructed in this way without further ado.Furthermore the results indicate that supersymmetry itself is not anomalous inminimal supergravity and show that the gauge transformations are extremelystable under consistent deformations of the models. There is however an unusualdeformation converting new into old minimal supergravity with localR-invariance which is reminiscent of a duality transformation.
