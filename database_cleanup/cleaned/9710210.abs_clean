Dimensional reduction of various gravity and supergravity models leads toeffectively two-dimensional field theories described by gravity coupled G/Hcoset space sigma-models. The transition matrices of the associated linearsystem provide a complete set of conserved charges. Their Poisson algebra is asemi-classical Yangian double modified by a twist which is a remnant of theunderlying coset structure. The classical Geroch group is generated by theLie-Poisson action of these charges. Canonical quantization of the structureleads to a twisted Yangian double with fixed central extension at a criticallevel.
