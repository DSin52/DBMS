We study aspects of the propagation of strings on BTZ black holes. Afterperforming a careful analysis of the global spacetime structure of generic BTZblack holes, and its relation to the geometry of the SL(2,R) group manifold, wefocus on the simplest case of the massless BTZ black hole. We study the SL(2,R)Wess-Zumino-Witten model in the worldsheet minisuperspace limit, taking intoaccount special features associated to the Lorentzian signature of spacetime.We analyse the two- and three-point functions in the pointparticle limit. Tolay bare the underlying group structure of the correlation functions, we derivenew results on Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for SL(2,R) in a parabolic basis. Wecomment on the application of our results to string theory in singulartime-dependent orbifolds, and to a Lorentzian version of the AdS/CFTcorrespondence.
