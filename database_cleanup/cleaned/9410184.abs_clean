We study a two parameter family of Calabi-Yau d-fold by means of mirrorsymmetry. We construct mirror maps and calculate correlation functionsassociated with {\kae} moduli in the original manifold. We find there are morecomplicated instanton corrections of these couplings than threefolds, which isexpected to reflect families of instantons with continous parameters.
