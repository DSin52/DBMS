E2-96-227, Dubna, 1996; to be published in Physical Review DIn the Dirac approach to the generalized Hamiltonian formalism, dynamicalsystems with first- and second-class constraints are investigated. Theclassification and separation of constraints into the first- and second-classones are presented with the help of passing to an equivalent canonical set ofconstraints. The general structure of second-class constraints is clarified.
