Title: The heat kernel approach for calculating the effective action in quantum

field theory and quantum gravityComments: 21 pages, Plain TeX, 52 KB, no figures

A short informal overview about recent progress in the calculation of theeffective action in quantum gravity is given. I describe briefly the standardheat kernel approach to the calculation of the effective action and discuss theapplicability of the Schwinger - De Witt asymptotic expansion in the case ofstrong background fields. I propose a new ansatz for the heat kernel thatgeneralizes the Schwinger - De Witt one and is always valid. Then I discuss thegeneral structure of the asymptotic expansion and put forward some approximateexplicitly covariant methods for calculating the heat kernel, namely, thehigh-energy approximation as well as the low-energy one. In both cases theexplicit formulae for the heat kernel are given.
