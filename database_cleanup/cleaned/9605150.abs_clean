By analyzing $F$-theory on $K3$ near the orbifold limit of $K3$ we establishthe equivalence between $F$-theory on $K3$ and an orientifold of type IIB on$T^2$, which in turn, is related by a T-duality transformation to type I theoryon $T^2$. By analyzing the $F$-theory background away from the orbifold limit,we show that non-perturbative effects in the orientifold theory splits anorientifold plane into two planes, with non-trivial SL(2,Z) monodromy aroundeach of them. The mathematical description of this phenomenon is identical tothe Seiberg-Witten result for N=2 supersymmetric $SU(2)$ gauge theory with fourquark flavors. Points of enhanced gauge symmetry in the orientifold /$F$-theory are in one to one correspondence with the points of enhanced globalsymmetry in the Seiberg-Witten theory.
