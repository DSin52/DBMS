Using simple algebraic methods along with an analogy to the BFSS model, weexplore the possible (target) spacetime symmetries that may appear in a matrixdescription of de Sitter gravity. Such symmetry groups could arise in two ways,one from an ``IMF'' like construction and the other from a ``DLCQ'' likeconstruction. In contrast to the flat space case, we show that the twoconstructions will lead to different groups, i.e. the Newton-Hooke groupand the inhomogeneous Euclidean group (or its algebraic cousins). It is arguedthat matrix quantum mechanics based on the former symmetries look moreplausible. Then, after giving a detailed description of the relevant oneparticle dynamics, a concrete Newton-Hooke matrix model is proposed. The modelnaturally incorporates issues such as holography, UV-IR relations, andfuzziness, for gravity in $dS_{4}$. We also provide evidence to support apossible phase transition. The lower temperature phase, which corresponds togravity in the perturbative regime, has a Hilbert space of infinite dimension.In the higher temperature phase where the perturbation theory breaks down, thedimension of the Hilbert space may become finite.
