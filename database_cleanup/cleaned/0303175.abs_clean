Authors: Antonio S. de Castro

Comments: 11 pages

The Dirac equation is solved for a pseudoscalar Coulomb potential in atwo-dimensional world. An infinite sequence of bounded solutions are obtained.These results are in sharp contrast with those ones obtained in 3+1 dimensionswhere no bound-state solutions are found.
