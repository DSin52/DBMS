We construct the Picard-Fuchs equations of the $N=2$ supersymmetric $SU(2)$gauge theories with $N_f=0,1,3$ matter multiplets. For the $N_f=0$ theory fromthe solutions of the Picard-Fuchs equation the monodromy matrices on thequantum moduli space are determined. We analyze the Seiberg-Witten solutions tocompute monodromies exactly and present the instanton expansion of the periodsfor the $N_f=0,3$ theories.
