Title: Recent Progress of the Liouville Approach to 2D Gravity and its Toda (W)

GeneralizationsComments: 22 pages, no figures. Notes of lecture at the September Rome meeting

String Theory, Quantum Gravity, and the Unification of FundamentalInteractionsThese lecture notes review current progress on the class of conformaltheories which may be studied by quantizing the conformal Toda dynamics. Aftersummarizing recent developments in undertanding the quantum group structure ofthe Liouville theory, one recalls how classically, two-dimensional black holescome out from the non-abelian Toda systems, and reviews the geometricalinterpretation of the classical $A_n$-Toda theories, just put forward, thatrelates W-geometries with the external geometries of holomorphic surfaces incomplex projective spaces.
