Title: Gelfand-Fuchs cohomology and M-Theory as a Topological Quantum Field

TheoryAuthors: Ioannis P. Zois

Comments: new extended version

We introduce a Lagrangian density for M-Theory which is purely topologicalusing Gelfand-Fuchs cohomology. Next we calculate the partition function whichindeed gives topological invariants that can be expressed via the Ray-Singeranalytic torsion.
