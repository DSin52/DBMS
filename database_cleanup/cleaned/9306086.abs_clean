Title: Measurement of Nonlocal Variables without Breaking Causality

Authors: Lev Vaidman

Comments: 6 pages, to be published in the Proceedings of "Fundamental Problems

of Quantum Theory," Columbia SC 1992#We report results of an investigation of relativistic causality constraintson the measurability of nonlocal variables. We show that measurability ofcertain nondegenerate variables with entangled eigenstates contradicts theprinciple of causality, but that there are other, certainly nonlocal, variableswhich can be measured without breaking causality. We show that any causalmeasurement of nonlocal variables must erase certain local information. Forexample, for a system of two spin-1/2 particles, even if we take the weakestpossible definition of verification measurement, verification of an entangledstate must erase all local information.
