We study two-dimensional integrable $N=1$ supersymmetric theories (withouttopological charges) in the presence of a boundary. We find a universal ratiobetween the reflection amplitudes for particles that are related bysupersymmetry and we propose exact reflection matrices for the supersymmetricextensions of the multi-component Yang-Lee models and for the breathermultiplets of the supersymmetric sine-Gordon theory. We point out theconnection between our reflection matrices and the classical boundary actionsfor the supersymmetric sine-Gordon theory as constructed by Inami, Odake andZhang \cite{IOZ}.
