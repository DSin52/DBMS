The {\it {gauge - fixing} } and {\it gaugeless } methods for reducing thephase space in the generalized Hamiltonian dynamics are compared with the aimto define the class of admissible gauges . In the gaugeless approach, thereduced phase space of a Hamiltonian system with the first class constraints isabelianization of constraints with the subsequent canonical transformation sothat some of the new momenta are equal to the new abelian constraints. As aresult the corresponding conjugate coordinates are ignorable ( nonphysical )one while the remaining canonical pairs corresponds to the true dynamicalvariables. This representation for the phase space prompts us the definition ofsubclass of admissible gauges -- canonical gauges as functions depending onlyon the ignorable coordinates. A practical method to recognize the canonicalgauge is proposed .
