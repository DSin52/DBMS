A general method of the BRST--anti-BRST symmetric conversion of second-classconstraints is presented. It yields a pair of commuting and nilpotent BRST-typecharges that can be naturally regarded as BRST and anti-BRST ones.Interchanging the BRST and anti-BRST generators corresponds to a symmetrybetween the original second-class constraints and the conversion variables,which enter the formalism on equal footing.
