We formulate a manifestly supersymmetric gauge covariant regularization ofsupersymmetric chiral gauge theories. In our scheme, the effective action inthe superfield background field method above one-loop is always supersymmetricand gauge invariant. The gauge anomaly has a covariant form and can emerge onlyin one-loop diagrams with all the external lines being the background gaugesuperfield. We also present several illustrative applications in the one-loopmultiplet; the super-chiral anomaly and the superconformal anomaly; as thecorresponding anomalous commutators, the Konishi anomaly and an anomaloussupersymmetric transformation law of the supercurrent (the ``centralextension'' of N=1 supersymmetry algebra) and of the R-current.
