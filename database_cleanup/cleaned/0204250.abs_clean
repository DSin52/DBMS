We study path-integrals over reparametrizations of the world-sheet boundary.Such integrals arise when string propagates between fixed space-time contours.In gauge/string duality they are needed to describe gauge theory Wilson loops.We show that (1) in AdS/CFT, the integral is well defined and gives a finite1-loop correction to the Wilson loop; (2) in critical string theory, theintegral is UV divergent, and fixed contour amplitudes are off shell. In thesecond case, we show that the divergences can be removed by renormalizing thecontour. We calculate the 2-loop contour beta-function and explain how it isrelated to the D0-brane effective action. We also apply this method to computethe first alpha' correction to the effective action of higher dimensionalbranes.
