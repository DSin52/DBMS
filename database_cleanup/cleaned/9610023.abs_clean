In this work we use constructs from the dual space of the semi-direct productof the Virasoro algebra and the affine Lie algebra of a circle to write atheory of gravitation which is a natural analogue of Yang-Mills theory. Thetheory provides a relation between quadratic differentials in 1+1 dimensionsand rank two symmetric tensors in higher dimensions as well as a covariantlocal Lagrangian for two dimensional gravity. The isotropy equations ofcoadjoint orbits are interpreted as Gauss law constraints for a field theory intwo dimensions, which enables us to extend to higher dimensions. The theory hasa Newtonian limit in any space-time dimension. Our approach introduces a novelrelationship between string theories and 2D field theories that might be usefulin defining dual theories. We briefly discuss how this gravitational fieldcouples to fermions.
