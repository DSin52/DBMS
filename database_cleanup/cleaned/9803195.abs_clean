D-brane backgrounds are specified in closed string theories by holes withappropriate mixed Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on the stringworldsheet. As presently stated, the prescription defining D-brane backgroundsis such that the Einstein equation is not equivalent to the condition for scaleinvariance on the string worldsheet. A modified D-brane prescription is found,that leads to the desired equivalence, while preserving all known D-brane lore.A possible interpretation is that the worldsheet cutoff is finite. Possibleconnections to recent work of Maldacena and Strominger, and Gopakumar and Vafaare suggested.
