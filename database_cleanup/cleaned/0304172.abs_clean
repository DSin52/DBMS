Authors: Nobuyoshi Ohta

Comments: 20 pages, 17 figures, v2

We study aspects of the accelerating cosmologies obtained from thecompactification of vacuum solution and S2-branes of superstring/M theories.Parameter dependence of the resulting expansion of our universe and internalspace is examined for all cases. We find that accelerating expansions areobtained also from spherical internal spaces, albeit the solution enters intocontracting phase eventually. The relation between the models of SM2- andSD2-branes are also discussed, and a potential problem with SD2-brane model isnoted.
