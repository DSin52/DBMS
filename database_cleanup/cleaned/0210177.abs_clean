Institute 2002, Fuji-Yoshida, Japan, 13-20 August 2002We consider the 5D gauge unification of $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ into $SU(3)_W$at a TeV scale. Compactification of the extra dimension on an orbifold$S^1/(Z_2\times Z'_2)$ allows fixed points where $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$representations can be assigned. We explain the long proton lifetime and thetop-bottom mass hierarchy and etc. geometrically. We also show that local gaugeanomalies on the orbifold can be exactly cancelled by a 5D Chern-Simons termwith a jumping coefficient.
