We address non-perturbative effects and duality symmetries in $N=2$ heteroticstring theories in four dimensions. Specifically, we consider how each of thefour lines of enhanced gauge symmetries in the perturbative moduli space of$N=2$ $T_2$ compactifications is split into 2 lines where monopoles and dyonsbecome massless. This amounts to considering non-perturbative effectsoriginating from enhanced gauge symmetries at the microscopic string level. Weshow that the perturbative and non-perturbative monodromies consistently leadto the results of Seiberg-Witten upon identication of a consistent truncationprocedure from local to rigid $N=2$ supersymmetry.
