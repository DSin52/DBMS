Title: Towards the entropy of gravity time-dependent models via the

Cardy-Verlinde formulaAuthors: Octavio Obregon, Leonardo Patino and Hernando Quevedo

Comments: 13 pages

For models with several time-dependent components generalized entropies canbe defined. This is shown for the Bianchi type IX model. We first derive theCardy-Verlinde formula under the assumption that the first law ofthermodynamics is valid. This leads to an explicit expression of the totalentropy associated with this type of universes. Assuming the validity of theCardy entropy formula, we obtain expressions for the corresponding Bekenstein,Bekenstein-Hawking and Hubble entropies. We discuss the validity of theCardy-Verlinde formula and possible extensions of the outlined procedure toother time-dependent models.
