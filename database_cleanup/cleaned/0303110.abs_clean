to include the open as well as closed universeIn this paper, we analyze the anisotropy of the scale factor in theKantowski-Sachs spacetime. We show that the anisotropy will not increase whenthe expansion rate is greater than certain values while it will increase whenthe expansion rate is less than that value or the Universe is contracting. Itis manifested that the matter dominated and radiation dominated era favor theflat spacetime if the anisotropy does not develop significantly. The relationbetween the cosmological anisotropy and the red-shift of the supernovae, whichcould be used to verify the anisotropy through the observation, has beenderived.
