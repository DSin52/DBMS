I review the salient features of three classes of open-string models withbroken supersymmetry. These suffice to exhibit, in relatively simple settings,the two phenomena of ``brane supersymmetry'' and ``brane supersymmetrybreaking''. In the first class of models, to lowest order supersymmetry isbroken both in the closed and in the open sectors. In the second class ofmodels, to lowest order supersymmetry is broken in the closed sector, but is{\it exact} in the open sector, at least for the low-lying modes, and often forentire towers of string excitations. Finally, in the third class of models, tolowest order supersymmetry is {\it exact} in the closed (bulk) sector, but isbroken in the open sector. Brane supersymmetry breaking provides a naturalsolution to some old difficulties met in the construction of open-string vacua.
