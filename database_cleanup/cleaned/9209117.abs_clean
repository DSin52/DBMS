Title: Domain Walls in $N=1$ Supergravity

Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Stephen Griffies

Comments: 17 pages Talk given at the International Symposium on Black Holes,

Membranes, Wormholes, and Superstrings, The Woodlands, Texas, January, 1992,UPR-527-T (Comments in chapter 6 on AdS-Minkowski wall induced space-timehave been slightly changed)We discuss a study of domain walls in $N=1, d=4$ supergravity. The wallssaturate the Bogomol'nyi bound of wall energy per unit area thus provingstability of the classical solution. They interpolate between two vacua whosecosmological constant is non-positive and in general different. The matterconfiguration and induced geometry are static. We discuss the field theoreticrealization of these walls and classify three canonical configurations withexamples. The space-time induced by a wall interpolating between the Minkowski(topology $\Re^{4}$) and anti-de~Sitter (topology $S^{1}(time) \times\Re^{3}(space)$) vacua is discussed.
