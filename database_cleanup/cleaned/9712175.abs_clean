A massive gauge invariant formulation for scalar ($\phi$) and antisymmetric($C_{mnp}$) fields with a topological coupling, which provides a mass for theaxion field, is considered. The dual and local equivalence with the non-gaugeinvariant proposal is established, but on manifolds with non-trivialtopological structure both formulations are not globally equivalent.
