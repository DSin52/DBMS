We discuss the sigma model on the $PSL(n|n)$ supergroup manifold. Wedemonstrate that this theory is exactly conformal. The chiral algebra of thismodel is given by some extension of the Virasoro algebra, similar to the $W$algebra of Zamolodchikov. We also show that all group invariant correlationfunctions are coupling constant independent and can be computed in the freetheory. The non invariant correlation functions are highly nontrivial andcoupling dependent. At the end we compare two and three-point correlationfunctions of the $PSL(1,1|2)$ sigma model with the correlation functions in theboundary theory of $AdS_3 \times S^3$ and find a qualitative agreement.
