Authors: F. M"uller-Hoissen

``Generalized Symmetries in Physics'' (ASI Clausthal 1993), 12 pages, LaTeX,GOET-TP 97/93For the two-parameter matrix quantum group GLp,q(2) all bicovariantdifferential calculi (with a four-dimensional space of 1-forms) are known. Theyform a one-parameter family. Here, we give an improved presentation of previousresults by using a different parametrization. We also discuss different ways toobtain bicovariant calculi on the quantum subgroup SLq(2). For those calculi,we do not obtain the ordinary differential calculus on SL(2) in the classicallimit. The structure which emerges here can be generalized to a nonstandarddifferential calculus on an arbitrary differentiable manifold and exhibitsrelations with stochastic calculus and `proper time' relativistic quantumtheories.
