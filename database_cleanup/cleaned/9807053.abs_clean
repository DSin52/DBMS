The BRST-anti-BRST covariant extension is suggested for the split involutionquantization scheme for the second class constrained theories. The constraintalgebra generating equations involve on equal footing a pair of BRST chargesfor second class constraints and a pair of the respective anti-BRST charges.Formalism displays explicit Sp(2) \times Sp(2) symmetry property. Surprisingly,the the BRST-anti-BRST algebra must involve a central element, related to thenonvanishing part of the constraint commutator and having no direct analogue ina first class theory. The unitarizing Hamiltonian is fixed by the requirementof the explicit BRST-anti-BRST symmetry with a much more restricted ambiguityif compare to a first class theory or split involution second class case in thenonsymmetric formulation. The general method construction is supplemented bythe explicit derivation of the extended BRST symmetry generators for severalexamples of the second class theories, including self--dual nonabelian modeland massive Yang Mills theory.
