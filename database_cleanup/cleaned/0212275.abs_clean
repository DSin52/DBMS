Following recent advances in the local theory of current-algebraic orbifolds,we study various geometric properties of the general WZW orbifold, the generalcoset orbifold and a large class of (non-linear) sigma model orbifolds.Phase-space geometry is emphasized for the WZW orbifolds - while for the sigmamodel orbifolds we construct the corresponding {\it sigma model orbifoldaction}, which includes the previously-known general WZW orbifold action andgeneral coset orbifold action as special cases. We focus throughout on the {\ittwisted Einstein tensors} with diagonal monodromy, including the twistedEinstein metric, the twisted B field and the twisted torsion field of eachorbifold sector. Finally, we present strong evidence for a conjectured set of{\it twisted Einstein equations} which should describe those sigma modelorbifolds in this class which are also 1-loop conformal.
