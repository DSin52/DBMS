These notes are the written version of two lectures delivered at the VIIIMexican School on Particles and Fields on November 1998. The level of the notesis basic assuming only some knowledge on Statistical Mechanics, GeneralRelativity and Yang-Mills theory. After a brief introduction to the classicaland semiclassical aspects of black holes, we review some relevant results on2+1 quantum gravity. These include the Chern-Simons formulation and its affineKac-Moody algebra, the asymptotic algebra of Brown and Henneaux, and thestatistical mechanics description of 2+1 black holes. Hopefully, thiscontribution will be complementary with the review paper hep-th/9901148 by thesame author, and perhaps, a shortcut to some recent developments in threedimensional gravity.
