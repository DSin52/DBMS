We give the exact solution of the Kazakov-Migdal induced gauge model in thecase of a D=1 compactified lattice with a generic number $S$ of sites and forany value of N. Due to the peculiar features of the model, the partitionfunction that we obtain also describes the vortex-free sector of the D=1compactified bosonic string, and it coincides in the continuum limit with theone obtained by Boulatov and Kazakov in this context.
