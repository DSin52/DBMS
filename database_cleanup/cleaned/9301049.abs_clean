As shown by Witten the N=1 supersymmetric gauged WZW model based on a group Ghas an extended N=2 supersymmetry if the gauged subgroup H is so chosen thatG/H is Kahler. We extend Witten's result and prove that the N=1 supersymmetricgauged WZW models over G X U(1) are actually invariant under N=4 superconformaltransformations if the gauged subgroup H is such that G/HXSU(2) is aquaternionic symmetric space. A previous construction of "maximal" N=4superconformal algebras with SU(2)XSU(2)XU(1) symmetry is reformulated andfurther developed so as to relate them to the N=4 gauged WZW models. Based onearlier results we expect the quantization of N=4 gauged WZW models to yieldthe unitary realizations of maximal N=4 superconformal algebras provided bythis construction.
