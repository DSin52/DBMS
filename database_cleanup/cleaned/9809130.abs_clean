We evaluate quasi-classically the Ramond partition function of Euclidean D=10U(N) super-Yang--Mills theory reduced to a two-dimensional torus. The resultcan be interpreted in terms of free strings wrapping the space-time torus, asexpected from the point of view of Matrix string theory. We demonstrate that,when extrapolated to the ultraviolet limit (small area of the torus), thequasi-classical expressions reproduce exactly the recently obtained expressionfor the partition of the completely reduced SYM theory, including the overallnumerical factor. This is an evidence that our quasi-classical calculationmight be exact.
