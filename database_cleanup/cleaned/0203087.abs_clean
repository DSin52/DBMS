We use higher derivative classical gravity to study the nonlinear couplingbetween the cosmological expansion of the universe and metric oscillations ofPlanck frequency and very small amplitude. We derive field equations at highorders in the derivative expansion and find that the nature of the new dynamicsis extremely restricted. For the equation of state parameter $w>0$ the relativeimportance of the oscillations grows logarithmically. Their effect on thecosmological expansion resembles that of dark energy.
