The recently introduced $\kappa$-Poincare-Dirac equation is gauged to treatthe $\kappa$-Dirac-Coulomb problem. For the resulting equation, we prove thatthe perturbation to first order in the quantum group parameter vanishesidentically. The second order perturbation is singular, but assuming aheuristic cut-off allows a qualitative estimate of the quantum group parameter.
