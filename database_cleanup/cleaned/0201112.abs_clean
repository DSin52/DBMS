69-86string tension a' and the radius R. The standard AdS/CFT correspondencerequires that the string coordinates are rescaled so that the action depends0 limit is equivalent to R \to 0 for fixed $a'$ or to the zero-tension limit inhep-th/0009171 on the light cone superstring we explicitly obtain the \lambda=0 form of its action. Its zero-mode part is the same as the superparticleaction in AdS_5 x S^5, and thus the \lambda=0 string spectrum must include, asexpected, the ``protected'' type IIB supergravity states. Following recentsuggestions, it is conjectured that the spectrum of this tensionless stringshould as well contain higher spin massless states in AdS_5. We also discussthe case of another parametrization of the string action which hasstraightforward R\to\infty flat space limit but where R \to 0 and a' \to \inftylimits are not equivalent. There R \to 0 corresponds to shrinking S^5 to zerothe size and ``freezing'' the fluctuations of the radial coordinate of AdS_5.This case is the basis of the ``non-standard'' AdS/CFT correspondence suggestedin hep-th/0010106. Parts of this work were presented in the talk at``Supergravity at 25'' conference, Stony Brook, December 1-2, 2001.
