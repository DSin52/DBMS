In this paper we show that the matrix model techniques developed by Dijkgraafand Vafa can be extended to compute quantum deformed moduli spaces of vacua infour dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories. The examples studied give themoduli space of a bulk D-brane probe in geometrically engineered theories, inthe presence of fractional branes at singularities.
