Orland at the NATO Advanced Workshop, ``New Developments in Quantum FieldTheory", Zakopane, Poland, June 14-19, 1997, proceedings to be published byPlenum PressWe describe an approach to understanding exponential decay of correlationfunctions in asymptotically free theories. This approach is systematic; it doesnot start from any conjectured mechanism or picture. We begin by studying themetric on the space of configurations and the behavior of the potential-energyfunction on this space.We describe how these ideas fit in the framework of QCD, as discussed earlierby one of us (P.O.). We then consider the 1+1-dimensional O(2) and O(3)nonlinear sigma models and show that no gap exists in the former at weakcoupling. In the O(3) model a new kind of strong/weak-coupling duality isrealized. We briefly outline our proposals for understanding the spectrum.
