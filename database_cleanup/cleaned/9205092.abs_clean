Previous analyses on the gauge invariance of the action for a generallycovariant system are generalized. It is shown that if the action principle isproperly improved, there is as much gauge freedom at the endpoints for anarbitrary gauge system as there is for a system with ``internal'' gaugesymmetries. The key point is to correctly identify the boundary conditions forthe allowed histories and to include the appropriate end-point contribution inthe action. The path integral is then discussed. It is proved that by employingthe improved action, one can use time-independent canonical gauges even in thecase of generally covariant theories. From the point of view of the action andthe path integral, there is thus no conceptual difference between generalcovariance and ``ordinary gauge invariance''. The discussion is illustrated inthe case of the point particle, for which various canonical gauges areconsidered.
