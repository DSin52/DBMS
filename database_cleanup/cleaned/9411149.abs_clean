We demonstrate electric-magnetic duality in N=1 supersymmetric non-Abeliangauge theories in four dimensions by presenting two different gauge theories(different gauge groups and quark representations) leading to the samenon-trivial long distance physics. The quarks and gluons of one theory can beinterpreted as solitons (non-Abelian magnetic monopoles) of the elementaryfields of the other theory. The weak coupling region of one theory is mapped toa strong coupling region of the other. When one of the theories is Higgsed byan expectation value of a squark, the other theory is confined. Masslessglueballs, baryons and Abelian magnetic monopoles in the confining descriptionare the weakly coupled elementary quarks (i.e.\ solitons of the confinedquarks) in the dual Higgs description.
