We study the behaviour of quantum field theories defined on a surface $S$ asit tends to a null surface $S_n$. In the case of a real, free scalar fieldtheory the above limiting procedure reduces the system to one with a finitenumber of degrees of freedom. This system is shown to admit a one parameterfamily of inequivalent quantizations. A duality symmetry present in the modelcan be used to remove the quantum ambiguity at the self-dual point . In thecase of the non-linear $\sigma$-model with the Wess-Zumino-Witten term asimilar limiting behaviour is obtained. The quantization ambiguity in this casehowever cannot be removed by any means.
