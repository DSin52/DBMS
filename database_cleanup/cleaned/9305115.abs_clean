The exact free energy of SU($N$) Chern-Simons theory at level $k$ is expandedin powers of $(N+k)^{-2}.$ This expansion keeps rank-level duality manifest,and simplifies as $k$ becomes large, keeping $N$ fixed (or vice versa)---thisis the weak-coupling (strong-coupling) limit. With the standard normalization,the free energy on the three-sphere in this limit is shown to be the generatingfunction of the Euler characteristics of the moduli spaces of surfaces of genus$g,$ providing a string interpretation for the perturbative expansion. Asimilar expansion is found for the three-torus, with differences that shedlight on contributions from different spacetime topologies in string theory.
