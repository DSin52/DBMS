Title: Definite and Indefinite Unitary Time Representations for Hilbert and

Non-Hilbert SpacesComments: 16 pages, latex, macros included

Stable states (particles), ghosts and unstables states (particles) arediscussed with respect to the time representations involved, their unitarygroups and the induced Hilbert spaces. Unstable particles with their decaychannels are treated as higher dimensional probability collectives withnonabelian probability groups U(n) generalizing the individual abelianU(1)-normalization for stable states (particles).
