In D-dimensional spacetimes which can be foliated by n-dimensionalhomogeneous subspaces, a quantum field can be decomposed in terms of modes onthe subspaces, reducing the system to a collection of (D-n)-dimensional fields.This allows one to write bare D-dimensional field quantities like the Greenfunction and the effective action as sums of their (D-n)-dimensionalcounterparts in the dimensionally reduced theory. It has been shown, however,that renormalization breaks this relationship between the original anddimensionally reduced theories, an effect called the dimensional-reductionanomaly. We examine the dimensional-reduction anomaly for the important case ofspherically symmetric spaces.
