We show that any covariant scattering amplitude of the $W_3$ string willcontain, as part of its integrand, a factor that obeys the differentialequations satisfied by an Ising model correlation function. This factor canthus be identified with such a correlation function, in agreement with aprevious result of the authors. The $W_3$ string is also shown to contain an$N=2$ parafermion theory, and hence to contain in addition the non-linearinfinite-dimensional $W$-algebra corresponding to this parafermion theory. Thephysical states form a representation of this algebra.
