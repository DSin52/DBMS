For the D-branes on the SL(2,R) WZW model we present a particular choice ofouter automorphism for the gluing condition of currents that leads to a specialAdS_2 brane configuration. This configuration is shown to be a static solutionin the cylindrical coordinates, and a nonstatic solution in the Poincar\'ecoordinates to the nonlinear equation of motion for the Dirac-Born-Infeldaction of a D-string. The generalization of it gives a family of nonstaticAdS_2 brane solutions. They are deomonstrated to transform to each other underthe isometry group of AdS_3 spacetime.
