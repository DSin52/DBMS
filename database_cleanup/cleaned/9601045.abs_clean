We explore quantum electrodynamics in (1+1) dimensions at finite temperatureusing the method of Discretized Light-Cone Quantisation. The partitionfunction, energy and specific heat are computed in the canonical ensemble usingthe spectrum of invariant masses computed with a standard DLCQ numericalroutine. In particular, the specific heat exhibits a peak which grows as thecontinuum limit is numerically approached. A critical exponent is tentativelyextracted. The surprising result is that the density of states containssignificant finite size artifacts even for a relatively high harmonicresolution. These and the other outstanding problems in the present calculationare discussed.
