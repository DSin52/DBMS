We investigate fluxbrane solutions to the Einstein-antisymmetric form-dilatontheory in arbitrary space-time dimensions for a transverse space of cylindricaltopology $S^k\times R^n$, corresponding to smeared and unsmeared solutions. Amaster equation for a single metric function is derived. This is a non-linearsecond-order ordinary differential equation admitting an analytic solution,singular at the origin, which serves as an attractor for globally regularsolutions, whose existence is demonstrated numerically. For all fluxbranes ofdifferent levels of smearing the metric function diverges at infinity as thesame power of the radial coordinate except for the maximally smeared case,where a global solution is known in closed form and can be obtainedalgebraically using U-duality. The particular cases of F6 and F3 fluxbranes inD=11 supergravity and fluxbranes in IIA, IIB supergravities are discussed.
