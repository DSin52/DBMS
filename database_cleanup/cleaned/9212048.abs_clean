We point out the existence of an arithmetical symmetry for the commutant ofthe modular matrices S and T. This symmetry holds for all affine simple Liealgebras at all levels and implies the equality of certain coefficients in anymodular invariant. Particularizing to SU(3)_k, we classify the modularinvariant partition functions when k+3 is an integer coprime with 6 and when itis a power of either 2 or 3. Our results imply that no detailed knowledge ofthe commutant is needed to undertake a classification of all modularinvariants.
