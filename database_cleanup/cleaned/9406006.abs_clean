We find the explicit operatorial form of renormalon-type singularities inabelian gauge theory. Local operators of dimension six take care of the firstU.V. renormalon, non local operators are needed for I.R. singularities. In theeffective lagrangian constructed with these operators non local imaginary partsappearing in the usual perturbative expansion at large orders are cancelled.
