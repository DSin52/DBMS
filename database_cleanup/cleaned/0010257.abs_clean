Methods in Physics, Dubna, August 2000, 10 pagesA class of non abelian affine Toda models is constructed in terms of theaxial and vector gauged WZW model. It is shown that the multivacua structure ofthe potential together with non abelian nature of the zero grade subalgebraallows soliton solutions with non trivial electric and topological charges.Their zero curvature representation and the classical $r$-matrix are alsoconstructed in order to prove their classical integrability.
