We study higher order approximations in the renormalization group approach tomatrix models. We use constraint equations on the free energy resulting from afreedom of field redefinitionsand obtain the effective beta function for asingle coupling constant to the fifth order. The fixed point and the stringsusceptibility exponent are shown to approach the values obtained in the exactsolution as the order of approximations becomes higher.
