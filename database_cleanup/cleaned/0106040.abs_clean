We propose a general method to study open/closed string dualities fromtransitions in M theory which is valid for a large class of geometricalconfigurations. By T-duality we can transform geometrically engineeredconfigurations into N = 1 brane configurations and study the transitions of thecorresponding branes by lifting the configurations to M-theory. We describe thetransformed degenerated M5 branes and extract the field theory information ongluino condensation by factorization of the Seiberg-Witten curve. We alsoinclude massive flavors and orientifolds and discuss Seiberg duality whichappears in this case as a birational flop. After the transition, the Seibergduality becomes an abelian electric-magnetic duality.
