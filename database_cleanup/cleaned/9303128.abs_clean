The path integral for the propagator is expanded into a perturbation series,which can be exactly summed in the case of $\delta$-function perturbationsgiving a closed expression for the (energy-dependent) Green function. Makingthe strength of the $\delta$-function perturbation infinite repulsive, producesa totally reflecting boundary, hence giving a path integral solution inhalf-spaces in terms of the corresponding Green function. The example of theWood-Saxon potential serves by an appropriate limiting procedure to obtain theGreen function for the step-potential and the finite potential-well in thehalf-space, respectively.
