221-226In a short review of recent work, we discuss the general problem ofconstructing the actions of new conformal field theories from old conformalfield theories. Such a construction follows when the old conformal field theoryadmits new conformal stress tensors in its chiral algebra, and it turns outthat the new conformal field theory is generically a new spin-two gauge theory.As an example we discuss the new spin-two gauged sigma models which arise inthis fashion from the general conformal non-linear sigma model.
