A recent paper by Moore and Witten explained that Ramond-Ramond fields inType II superstring theory have a global meaning in K-theory. In this note weamplify and generalize some points raised in that paper. In particular, weexpress the coupling of the Ramond-Ramond fields to D-branes in a K-theoreticframework and show that the anomaly in this coupling exactly cancels theanomaly from the fermions on the brane, both in Type IIA and Type IIB.
