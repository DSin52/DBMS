Deriglazov and Galajinsky have recently proposed a new covariant action forthe Green-Schwarz superstring which can be constructed in any spacetimedimension. In this short note, I show that their action contains extra on-shelldegrees of freedom as compared with the standard action, and is thereforeinequivalent.
