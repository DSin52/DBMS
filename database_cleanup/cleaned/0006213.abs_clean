The theories in which our world presents a domain wall (brane) embedded inlarge extra dimensions predict new types of topological defects. These defectsarise due to the fact that the brane on which we live spontaneously breaksisometries of the extra space giving mass to some graviphotons. In many casesthe corresponding vacuum manifold has nontrivial homotopies -- this gives riseto topologically stable defects in four dimensions, such as cosmic strings andmonopoles that carry gravimagnetic flux. The core structure of these defects issomewhat peculiar. Due to the fact that the translation invariance in the extradirection(s) is restored in their core, they act as "windows" to the extradimensions. We also discuss the corresponding analog of the Alice strings.Encircling such an object one would get transported onto a parallel brane.
