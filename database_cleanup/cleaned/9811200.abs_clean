We investigate the two-logarithm matrix model with the potential$X\Lambda+\alpha\log(1+X)+\beta\log(1-X)$ related to an exactly solvableKazakov-Migdal model. In the proper normalization, using Virasoro constraints,we prove the equivalence of this model and the Kontsevich-Penner matrix modeland construct the 1/N-expansion solution of this model.
