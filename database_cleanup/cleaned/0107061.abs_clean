We construct an effective action describing an elementary M5-braneinteracting with dynamical eleven-dimensional supergravity, which is free fromgravitational anomalies. The current associated to the elementary brane istaken as a distribution valued delta-function on the support of the 5-braneitself. Crucial ingredients of the construction are the consistent inclusion ofthe dynamics of the chiral two-form on the 5-brane, and the use of an invariantChern-kernel allowing to introduce a D=11 three-form potential which is welldefined on the worldvolume of the 5-brane.
