We review the construction of the cross product algebra $\A\rtimes\U$ fromtwo dually paired Hopf algebras $\U$ and $\A$. The canonical element in $\U\otimes \A$ is then introduced, and its properties examined. We find that it isuseful for giving coactions on $\A\rtimes\U$, and it allows the construction ofobjects with specific invariance properties under these coactions. A ``vacuumoperator'' is found which projects elements of $\A\rtimes\U$ onto said objects.We then discuss bicovariant vector fields in the context of the canonicalelement.
