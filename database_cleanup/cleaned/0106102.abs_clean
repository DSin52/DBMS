We inspect a particular gauge field theory model that describes theproperties of a variety of physical systems, including a charge neutraltwo-component plasma, a Gross-Pitaevskii functional of two charged Cooper paircondensates, and a limiting case of the bosonic sector in the Salam-Weinbergmodel. It has been argued that this field theory model also admits stableknot-like solitons. Here we produce numerical evidence in support for theexistence of these solitons, by considering stable axis-symmetric solutionsthat can be thought of as straight twisted vortex lines clamped at the twoends. We compute the energy of these solutions as a function of the amount oftwist per unit length. The result can be described in terms of a energyspectral function. We find that this spectral function acquires a minimum whichcorresponds to a nontrivial twist per unit length, strongly suggesting that themodel indeed supports stable toroidal solitons.
