Version to appear in Proceedings of the Royal SocietyWe consider the equilibria of point particles under the action of two bodycentral forces in which there are both repulsive and attractive interactions,often known as central configurations, with diverse applications in physics, inparticular as homothetic time-dependent solutions to Newton's equations ofmotion and as stationary states in the One Component Plasma model.Concentrating mainly on the case of an inverse square law balanced by a linearforce, we compute numerically equilibria and their statistical properties. Whenall the masses (or charges) of the particles are equal, for small numbers ofpoints they are regular convex deltahedra, which on increasing the number ofpoints give way to a multi-shell structure. In the limit of a large number ofpoints we argue using an analytic model that they form a homogeneous sphericaldistribution of points, whose spatial distribution appears, from ourpreliminary investigation, to be similar to that of a Bernal hard-sphereliquid.
