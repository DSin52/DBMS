Title: Vortices under S-duality

Authors: John H. Brodie

Comments: 5 pages, 1 figure

We investigate a system of 1,3, and 7-branes in type IIB string theory. Weidentify the 1-brane with the vortex of the Abelian Higgs model. We claim thatin the S-dual, the theory on the 3-brane confines electric flux which weidentify with the fundamental string and that the dual photon has a mass. Wethen investigate ways of breaking supersymmetry in the brane set up.
