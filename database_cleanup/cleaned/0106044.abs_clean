The effect of non-commutativity on electromagnetic waves violates Lorentzvelocity for propagation transverse to b differs from c, while propagationalong b is unchanged. In principle, this allows a test by the Michelson-Morleyinterference method. We also study non-commutativity in another context, byconstructing the theory describing a charged fluid in a strong magnetic field,which forces the fluid particles into their lowest Landau level and renders thefluid dynamics non-commutative, with a Moyal product determined by thebackground magnetic field.
