High energy string scattering at fixed momentum transfer, known to bedominated by Regge trajectory exchange, is interpreted by identifying familiesof string states which induce each type of trajectory exchange. These includethe usual leading trajectory $\alpha(t)=\alpha^\prime t+1$ and its daughters aswell as the ``sister'' trajectories $\alpha_m(t)=\alpha(t)/m-(m-1)/2$ and theirdaughters. The contribution of the sister $\alpha_m$ to high energy scatteringis dominated by string excitations in the $m^{th}$ mode. Thus, at large $-t$,string scattering is dominated by wee partons, consistently with a picture ofstring as an infinitely composite system of ``constituents'' which carry zeroenergy and momentum.
