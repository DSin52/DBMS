By generalizing the Feynman proof of the Lorentz force law, recently reportedby Dyson, we derive equations of motion for particles possessing internaldegrees of freedom $I^a$ which do not, in general, generate a finite algebra.We obtain consistency criteria for fields which interact with such particles.It is argued that when a particle with internal $SU_q(2)$ degrees of freedom iscoupled to $SU(2)$ gauge fields, $SU(2)$ gauge invariance is broken to $U(1)$.We further claim that when such an $SU_q(2)$ particle acts as a source for thefield theory, the second rank antisymmetric field tensor, in general, cannot beglobally defined.
