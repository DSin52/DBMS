Title: Virtual Monopole Geometry and Confinement

Comments: 10 pages, latex

Generalizing the geometry of the gauge covariant variables in Yang-Millstheory proposed by Johnson and Haagensen, the 4-d geometry associated with aAdS$_2\times S^2$, $R^2\times S^2$ and $H_+\times S^2$, depending on theasymptotic behavior of the torsion. Using this geometry, the Wilson loopaverage is computed {\it \`{a} la} Nambu-Goto action. In case of AdS$_2\timesS^2$, it satisfies the area law.
