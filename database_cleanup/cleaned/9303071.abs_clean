The full non-linear structure of the action and transformation rules for$\W_N$-gravity coupled to matter are obtained from a non-linear truncation ofthose for $w_ \infty$ gravity. The geometry of the construction is discussed,and it is shown that the defining equations become linear after a twistor-liketransform.
