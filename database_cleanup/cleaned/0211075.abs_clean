In this note we investigate the effective superpotential of an N=1 SU(N_c)gauge theory with one adjoint chiral multiplet and N_f fundamental chiralmultiplets. We propose a matrix model prescription in which only matrix modeldiagrams with less than two boundaries contribute to the gauge theory effectivesuperpotential. This prescription reproduces exactly the known gauge theoryphysics for all N_f and $N_c$. For N_f < N_c this is given by theAffleck-Dine-Seiberg superpotential. For N_f > N_c we present arguments leadingto the conclusion that the dynamics of these theories is also reproduced by thematrix model.
