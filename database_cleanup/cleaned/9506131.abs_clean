We show that the exact static, i.e. `anti-gravitating', magnetic multimonopole solutions of the Einstein/Maxwell/dilaton-YM/Higgs equations found byKastor, London, Traschen, and the authors, for arbitrary non-zero dilatoncoupling constant $a$, are equivalent to the string theory BPS magneticmonopole solutions of Harvey and Liu when $a=\sqrt{3}$. For this value of $a$,the monopole solutions also solve the equations of five-dimensionalsupergravity/YM theory. We also discuss some features of the dyon solutionsobtained by boosting in the fifth dimension and some features of the modulispace of anti-gravitating multi-monopoles.
