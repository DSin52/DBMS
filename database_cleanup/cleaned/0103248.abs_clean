We study the averaged action of the Randall-Sundrum model with a timedependent metric ansatz. It can be reformulated in terms of a Brans-Dickeaction with time dependent Newton's constant. We show that the physics of earlyuniverse, particularly inflation, is governed by the Brans-Dicke theory. TheBrans-Dicke scalar, however, quickly settles to its equilibrium value anddecouples from the post-inflationary cosmology. The deceleration parameter isnegative to start with but changes sign before the Brans-Dicke scalar settlesto its equilibrium value. Consequently, the brane metric smoothly exitsinflation. We have also studied the slow-roll inflation in our model andinvestigated the spectra of the density perturbation generated by the radionfield and find them consistent with the current observations.
