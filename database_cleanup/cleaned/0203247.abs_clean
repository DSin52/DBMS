In this paper we present a classification of possible dynamics of closedstring moduli within specific toroidal compactifications of Type II stringtheories due to the NS-NS tadpole terms in the reduced action. They appear aspotential terms for the moduli when supersymmetry is broken due to the presenceof D-branes. We particularise to specific constructions with two, four andsix-dimensional tori, and study the stabilisation of the complex structuremoduli at the disk level. We find that, depending on the cycle on the compactsolution inside the complex structure moduli space, and the configuration isstable at the critical point, ii) the moduli fields are driven towards theboundary of the moduli space, iii) there is no stable solution at the minimumof the potential and the system decays into a set of branes.
