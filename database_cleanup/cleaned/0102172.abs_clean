The supergravity dual of $N$ regular and $M$ fractional D3-branes on theconifold has a naked singularity in the infrared. Supersymmetric resolution ofof chiral symmetry breaking. Buchel suggested that at sufficiently highcloaked by a horizon. This would be the supergravity manifestation of chiralsymmetry restoration. In previous work [hep-th/0102105] the ansatz and thesystem of second-order radial differential equations necessary to find such asolution were written down. In this paper we find smooth solutions to thissystem in a perturbation theory that is valid when the Hawking temperature ofthe horizon is very high.
