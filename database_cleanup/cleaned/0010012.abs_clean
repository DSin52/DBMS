"Nonperturbative Quantum Effects 2000"The structure of a new family of factorised $S$-matrix theories withresonance poles is reviewed. They are conjectured to correspond to theHomogeneous sine-Gordon theories associated with simply laced compact Liegroups. Two of their more remarkable properties are, first, that some of theresonance poles can be traced to the presence of unstable particles in thespectrum, and, second, that they involve several independent mass scales. Theconjectured relationship with the simply laced HSG theories has been checked bymeans of the Thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) and, more recently, through theexplicit calculation of the Form Factors. The main results of the TBA analysisare summarized.
