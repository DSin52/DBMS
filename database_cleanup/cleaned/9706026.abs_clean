Journal-ref: Nucl.Phys. B530 (1998) 665-682

In this note we give a new construction of the N=2 superconformal algebrausing currents of the affine superalgebra $\hat{sl}(2 | 1)$ and free bosonicfields, and also the N=4 superconformal algebra without central charge in termsof currents of $\hat{sl}(2 | 2)$ and free bosonic fields. Arguments oncommutants and invariant subspaces are added.
