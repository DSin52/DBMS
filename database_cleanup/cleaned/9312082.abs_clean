IF/UFRJUsing the heat kernel regularization we show that the Abelian chiral anomalyin the limit of infinite temperature it is not a well defined quantity,contrary to what happens at any finite temperature. We show that there is anambiguity in the ordering of the limits of infinite temperature and removal ofthe cut-off so that changing this ordering we find different results for thechiral anomaly. We discuss these cases and their possible interpretation.
