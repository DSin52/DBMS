We discuss In\"on\"u-Wigner contractions of affine Kac-Moody algebras. Weshow that the Sugawara construction for the contracted affine algebra existsonly for a fixed value of the level $k$, which is determined in terms of thedimension of the uncontracted part of the starting Lie algebra, and thequadratic Casimir in the adjoint representation. Further, we discusscontractions of $G/H$ coset spaces, and obtain an affine {\it translation}algebra, which yields a Virasoro algebra (via a GKO construction) with acentral charge given by $dim(G/H)$.
