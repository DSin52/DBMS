Scientific, Singapore, 1995, pp. 241-262We review recent work which has significantly sharpened our geometricunderstanding and interpretation of the moduli space of certain $N$=2superconformal field theories. This has resolved some important issues inmirror symmetry and has also established that string theory admits physicallysmooth processes which can result in a change in topology of the spatialuniverse.
