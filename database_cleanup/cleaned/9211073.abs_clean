We give two results concerning the construction of modular invariantpartition functions for conformal field theories constructed by tensoringtogether other conformal field theories. First we show how the possible modularinvariants for the tensor product theory are constrained if the allowed modularinvariants of the individual conformal field theory factors have beenclassified. We illustrate the use of these constraints for theories of the type$SU(2)_{K_A}\otimes SU(2)_{K_B}$, finding all consistent theories for $K_A,K_B$odd. Second we show how known diagonal modular invariants can be used toconstruct some inherently asymmetric ones where the holomorphic andanti-holomorphic theories do not share the same chiral algebra. Some explicitexamples are given.
