typos corrected, minor changesWe discuss the Green-Schwarz action for type IIB strings in generalplane-wave backgrounds obtained as Penrose limits from any IIB supergravitysolutions with vanishing background fermions. Using the normal-coordinateexpansion in superspace, we prove that the light-cone action is necessarilyquadratic in the fermionic coordinates. This proof is valid for more generalpp-wave backgrounds under certain conditions. We also write down the completequadratic action for general bosonic on-shell backgrounds in a form in whichits geometrical meaning is manifest both in the Einstein and string frames.When the dilaton and 1-form field strength are vanishing, and the other fieldstrengths are constant, our string-frame action reduces, up to conventions, tothe one which has been written down using the supercovariant derivative.
