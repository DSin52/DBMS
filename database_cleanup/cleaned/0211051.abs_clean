In the q-deformed theory the perturbation approach can be expressed in termsof two pairs of undeformed position and momentum operators. There are twoconfiguration spaces. Correspondingly there are two q-perturbationHamiltonians, one originates from the perturbation expansion of the potentialin one configuration space, the other one originates from the perturbationexpansion of the kinetic energy in another configuration space.In order to establish a general foundation of the q-perturbation theory, twoPerturbation expressions of the q-deformed uncertainty relations calculated bytwo pairs of undeformed operators are the same, and the two q-deformeduncertainty relations undercut Heisenberg's minimal one in the same style. (II)singular) the expectation values of two q-perturbation Hamiltonians in theeigenstates of the undeformed Hamiltonian are equivalent to all orders of theperturbation expansion. As an example of singular potentials the perturbationenergy spectra of the q-deformed Coulomb potential are studied.
