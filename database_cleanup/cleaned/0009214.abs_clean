In this paper we investigate the tachyon instability of open bosonic stringtheory applying methods of boundary conformal field theory. We considercompactifications on maximal tori of various simple Lie algebras with aspecific background coupled to the string boundaries. The resulting world-sheetCFT is a free theory perturbed by a boundary term that is marginal but nottruly marginal. Assuming that the theory flows to a nontrivial infrared fixedpoint that is similar to the one in Kondo model, we calculate the new spectrumand some of the Green's functions. We find that in some of the sectors thetachyon mass gets lifted that can be interpreted as a result of switching onappropriate Wilson lines. Various compactifications and patterns of flows areinvestigated.
