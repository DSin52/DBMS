Title: Investigation of Discrete Gauge Anomalies in String Theory

Authors: D.A. MacIntire

Comments: 8 pages, SCIPP 93/27

In string theory, there are no continuous global symmetries. Discretesymmetries frequently appear, and these can often be understood as unbrokensubgroups of larger, spontaneously broken gauge symmetries (discrete gaugesymmetries). In cases which have been studied previously, anomalies in thesesymmetries could always be cancelled by a Green-Schwarz mechanism. In thepresent work, we describe results of an investigation of a large number of$\ZZ_3$ orbifold models with two and three Wilson lines. We find that thediscrete gauge anomalies can always be cancelled.}
