SystemsThe self-dual Chern-Simons solitons under the influence of the quantumpotential are considered. The single-valuedness condition for an arbitraryinteger number $N \ge 0$ of solitons leads to quantization of Chern-Simonscoupling constant $\kappa = m {e^{2} \over g}$, and the integer strength ofquantum potential $s = 1 - m^{2}$. As we show, the Jackiw-Pi model correspondsto the first member (m = 1) of our hierarchy of the Chern-Simons gaugednonlinear Schr\"odinger models, admitting self-dual solitons. New type ofexponentially localized Chern-Simons solitons for the Bloch electrons near thehyperbolic energy band boundary are found.
