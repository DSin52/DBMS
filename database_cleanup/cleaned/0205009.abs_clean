We consider an dS_4 brane embedded in a five-dimensional bulk with apositive, vanishing or negative bulk cosmological constant and derive thelocalized graviton spectrum that consists of a normalizable zero-mode separatedby a gap from a continuum of massive states. We estimate the massive sectorcontribution to the static potential at short distances and find that only inthe case of a negative bulk cosmological constant there is a range, determinedby the effective four-dimensional and the bulk cosmological constants, wherethe conventional Newton law is valid.
