Canonical BRST quantization of the topological particle defined by a Morsefunction h is described. Stochastic calculus, using Brownian paths whichimplement the WKB method in a new way providing rigorous tunnelling resultseven in curved space, is used to give an explicit and simple expression for thematrix elements of the evolution operator for the BRST Hamiltonian. Thesematrix elements lead to a representation of the manifold cohomology in terms ofcritical points of h along lines developed by Witten.
