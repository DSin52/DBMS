We investigate a class of operators with non-vanishing averages in aD-dimensional matrix model recently proposed by Kazakov and Migdal. Among theoperators considered are ``filled Wilson loops" which are the most reasonablecounterparts of Wilson loops in the conventional Wilson formulation of latticeQCD. The averages of interest are represented as partition functions of certain2-dimensional statistical systems with nearest neighbor interactions. The``string tension" $\alpha'$, which is the exponent in the area law for the``filled Wilson loop" is equal to the free energy density of the correspondingstatistical system. The continuum limit of the Kazakov--Migdal modelcorresponds to the critical point of this statistical system. We argue that inthe large $N$ limit this critical point occurs at zero temperature. In thiscase we express $\alpha'$ in terms of the distribution density of eigenvaluesof the matrix-valued master field. We show that the properties of the continuumlimit and the description of how this limit is approached is very unusual anddiffers drastically from what occurs in both the Wilson theory ($S\propto({\rmTr}\prod U +{\rm c.c.})$) and in the ``adjoint'' theory ($S\propto\vert{\rmTr}\prod U\vert^2$). Instead, the continuum limit of the model appears to beintriguingly similar to a $c>1$ string theory.
