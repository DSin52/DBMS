The notion of a "point" is essential to describe the topology of spacetime.Despite this, a point probably does not play a particularly distinguished rolein any intrinsic formulation of string theory. We discuss one way to try todetermine the notion of a point from a worldsheet point of view. The derivedcategory description of D-branes is the key tool. The case of a flop isanalyzed and Pi-stability in this context is tied in to some ideas ofBridgeland. Monodromy associated to the flop is also computed via Pi-stabilityand shown to be consistent with previous conjectures.
