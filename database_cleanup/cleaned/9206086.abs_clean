We propose random matrix models which have $N=\half$ supersymmetry in zerodimension. The supersymmetry breaks down spontaneously. It is shown that thedouble scaling limit can be defined in these models and the breakdown of thesupersymmetry remains in the continuum limit. The exact non-trivial partitionfunctions of the string theories corresponding to these matrix models are alsoobtained.
