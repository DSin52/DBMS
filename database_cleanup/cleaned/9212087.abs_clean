For every partition of a positive integer $n$ in $k$ parts and every point ofan infinite Grassmannian we obtain a solution of the $k$ componentdifferential-difference KP hierarchy and a corresponding Baker function. Apartition of $n$ also determines a vertex operator construction of thefundamental representations of the infinite matrix algebra $gl_\infty$ andhence a $\tau$ function. We use these fundamental representations to study theGauss decomposition in the infinite matrix group $Gl_\infty$ and to express theBaker function in terms of $\tau$-functions. The reduction to loop algebras isdiscussed.
