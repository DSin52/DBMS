Following a previous work on Abelian (2,0)-gauge theories, one reassesseshere the task of coupling (2,0) relaxed Yang-Mills super-potentials to a(2,0)-nonlinear Sigma-model, by gauging the isotropy or the isometry group ofthe latter. One pays special attention to the extra "chiral-like"component-field gauge potential that comes out from the relaxation ofconstraints.
