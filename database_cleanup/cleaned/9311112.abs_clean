We consider the possible covariant external algebra structures for Cartan's1. the invariant 1-forms realize an adjoint representation of quantum group;2. all monomials of these forms possess the unique ordering.For the obtained external algebras we define the exterior derivativepossessing the usual nilpotence condition, and the generally deformed versionof Leibniz rules. The status of the known examples of GL_q(N)-differentialcalculi in the proposed classification scheme, and the problems ofSL_q(N)-reduction are discussed.
