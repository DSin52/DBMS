We present a construction of superconformal field theories for manifolds withSpin(7) holonomy. Geometrically these models correspond to the realization ofSpin(7) manifolds as anti-holomorphic quotients of Calabi-Yau fourfolds.Describing the fourfolds as Gepner models and requiring anomaly cancellation wedetermine the resulting Betti numbers of the Spin(7) superconformal fieldtheory. As in the G_2 case, we find that the Gepner model and the geometricresult disagree.
