The geometry of the D1-D5 system with a small angular momentum j has a longthroat ending in a conical defect. We solve the scalar wave equation for lowenergy quanta in this geometry. The quantum is found to reflect off the end ofthe throat, and stay trapped in the throat for a long time. The length of thethroat for j=1/2 equals n_1n_5 R, the length of the effective string in theCFT; we also find that at this distance the incident wave becomes nonlinear.Filling the throat with several quanta gives a `hot tube' which has emissionproperties similar to those of the near extremal black hole.
