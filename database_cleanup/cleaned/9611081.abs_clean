By relating the two-dimensional U(N) Principal Chiral Model to a simplelinear system we obtain a free-field parametrisation of solutions. Obvioussymmetry transformations on the free-field data give symmetries of the model.In this way all known `hidden symmetries' and B\"acklund transformations, aswell as a host of new symmetries, arise.
