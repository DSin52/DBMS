Title: All-orders wormhole vertex operators from the Wheeler-deWitt equation

Authors: Alex Lyons

Comments: 20 pages (Replaced with TeXable version.)

We discuss the calculation of semi-classical wormhole vertex operators fromwave functions which satisfy the Wheeler-deWitt equation and momentumconstraints, together with certain `wormhole boundary conditions'. We considera massless minimally coupled scalar field, initially in the sphericallysymmetric `mini-superspace' approximation, and then in the `midi-superspace'approximation, where non-spherically symmetric perturbations are linearizedabout a spherically symmetric mini-superspace background. Our approach suggeststhat there are higher derivative corrections to the vertex operator from thenon-spherically symmetric perturbations. This is compared directly with theapproach based on complete wormhole solutions to the equations of motion whereit has been claimed that the semi-classical vertex operator is exactly given bythe lowest order term, to all orders in the size of the wormhole throat. Ourresults are also compared with the conformally coupled case.
