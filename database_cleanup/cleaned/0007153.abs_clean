We use the level truncation scheme to obtain accurate descriptions of openbosonic string field configurations corresponding to large marginaldeformations such as background Wilson lines. To do so, we solve for all fieldsas functions of the massless string field, and confirm that the effectivepotential of the massless field becomes increasingly flat as the level ofapproximation is increased. Surprisingly, as a result of the merging of twobranches of the solution - one originating at zero tachyon vev and the otheroriginating at the tachyonic vacuum - this effective potential exists only fora finite range of values of the massless field. We use the D1 to D0 branemarginal transition on a circle to explore the possibility that this finiterange corresponds to the infinite range of the conformal field theory parameterdescribing marginal deformations, but are unable to arrive at a definitiveconclusion.
