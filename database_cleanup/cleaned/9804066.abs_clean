Title: Conjectures on (0,2) Mirror Symmetry

Authors: E. Sharpe

Comments: 21 pages, LaTex, 2 figures, title altered to avoid confusion with an

older paper -- no other changesIn this paper we conjecture a reformulation of the monomial-divisor mirrormap for (2,2) mirror symmetry, valid at a boundary of the moduli space, that iseasily extended to also include tangent bundle deformations -- an importantstep towards understanding (0,2) mirror symmetry. We check our conjecture in afew simple cases, and thereby illustrate how to perform calculations using adescription of sheaves recently published by Knutson, Sharpe.
