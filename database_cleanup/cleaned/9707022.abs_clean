We show how to evaluate the periods in Seiberg-Witten theories and inK3-fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds by using fibrations of the theories. In theSeiberg-Witten theories, it is shown that the dual pair of fields can beconstructed from the classical fields in a simple form. As for Calabi-Yaumanifolds which are fibrations of K3 surface, we obtain the solutions of thePicard-Fuchs equations from the periods of K3 surface. By utilizing theexpression of periods for two-parameter models of type-II string, we derive thesolutions of the Picard-Fuchs equations around the points of enhanced gaugesymmetry and show a simple connection to the SU(2) Seiberg-Witten theory.
