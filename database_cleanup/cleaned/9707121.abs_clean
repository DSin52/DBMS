We discuss the geometrical connection between 2D conformal field theories,random walks on hyperbolic Riemann surfaces and knot theory. For the wide classof CFTs with monodromies being the discrete subgroups of SL(2,R), thedetermination of four-point correlation functions are related to constructionof topological invariants for random walks on multipunctured Riemann surfaces
