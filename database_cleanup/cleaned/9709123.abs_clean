We review some tests of the 0-brane and instanton matrix models based oncomparing long-distance interaction potentials between branes and their boundstates (with 1/2,1/4 or 1/8 of supersymmetry) in supergravity and in superYang-Mills descriptions. We first consider the supergravity-SYM correspondenceat the level of the leading term in the interaction potential, and thendescribe some recent results concerning the subleading term and theirimplications for the structure of the 2-loop F^6 term in the SYM effectiveaction.
