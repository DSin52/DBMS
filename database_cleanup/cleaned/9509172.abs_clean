Title: Stochastic Coupling of Fermions

Republic,Prague)Comments: 17 pages

The stochastic quantization of the fermion field is performed starting fromDirac equations. The statistical properties of stochastic terms in Langevinequations are described by explicit formulae of a Markov process. Theinteraction of the field is introduced as correlation of the stochastic terms.In the long time limit free fermions disappear and proper combinations of fieldcomponents propagate as a scalar boson field. The existence and uniqueness ofthe long time limit is proved in the first order approximation of stochasticLiouville equation.
