Non--Abelian duality in relation to supersymmetry is examined. When theaction of the isometry group on the complex structures is non--trivial,extended supersymmetry is realized non--locally after duality, using pathordered Wilson lines. Prototype examples considered in detail are,hyper--Kahler metrics with SO(3) isometry and supersymmetric WZW models. Forthe latter, the natural objects in the non--local realizations of supersymmetryarising after duality are the classical non--Abelian parafermions. Thecanonical equivalence of WZW models and their non--Abelian duals with respectto a vector subgroup is also established.
