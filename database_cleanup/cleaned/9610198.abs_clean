Title: T-duality and the moment map

Authors: C. Klimcik, P. Severa

Comments: 7 pages, LaTeX, acknowledgement added

Aspects of Poisson-Lie T-duality are reviewed in more algebraic way than inour, rather geometric, previous papers. As a new result, a moment map isconstructed for the Poisson-Lie symmetry of the system consisting of openstrings propagating in a Poisson-Lie group manifold.
