We study the structure and properties of vortices in a recently proposedAbelian Maxwell-Chern-Simons model in $2 +1 $ dimensions. The model which isdescribed by gauge field interacting with a complex scalar field, includes twoterms. Self-dual relativistic vortices are discussed in detail. We also findone dimensional soliton solutions of the domain wall type. The vortices arecorrectly described by the domain wall solutions in the large flux limit.
