We derive a set of equations for the wavefunction describing the marginalbound state of a single D0-brane with a single D4-brane. These are equationsdetermining the vacuum of an N=8 abelian gauge theory with a chargedhypermultiplet. We then solve these equations for the most general possiblezero-energy solution using a Taylor series. We find that there are an infinitenumber of such solutions of which only one must be normalizable. We explore thestructure of a normalizable solution under the assumption of an asymptoticexpansion. Even the leading terms in the asymptotic series, which shouldreflect the supergravity solution, are unusual. Through the $Spin(5)$ flavorsymmetry, the modes which are massive at long distance actually influence theleading behavior. Lastly, we show that the vacuum equations can quiteremarkably be reduced to a single equation involving one unknown function. Theresulting equation has a surprisingly simple and suggestive form.
