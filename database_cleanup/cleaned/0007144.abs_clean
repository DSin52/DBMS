A field theory is developed based on the idea that the effective action ofyet unknown fundamental theory, at energy scale below M_{p} has the form ofnew measure \Phi is defined using the third-rank antisymmetric tensor. In thenew variables (Einstein frame) all equations of motion take canonical GR formand therefore models are free of the well-known "defects" that distinguish theBrans-Dicke type theories from GR. All novelty is revealed only in an unusualstructure of the effective potential U(\phi) and interactions which turns overintuitive ideas based on our experience in field theory. E.g. the greater\Lambda we admit in L_{2}, the smaller U(\phi) will be in the Einstein picture.Field theory models are suggested with explicitly broken global continuossymmetry which in the Einstein frame has the form \phi\to\phi+const. Thesymmetry restoration occurs as \phi\to\infty. A few models are presented wherefor inflation model, e. g. U=\lambda\phi^4 with \lambda\sim 10^{-14};for\phi>-M_{p}, U has mainly exponential form U\sim e^{-a\phi/M_{p}} with\phi>M_{p} that implies quintessence era. There is no need in any fine tuningto prevent appearance of the CC term or any other terms that could violateflatness of U at \phi\ggM_{p}. \lambda\sim 10^{-14} is obtained without finetuning as well. Quantized matter fields models, including gauge theories withSSB can be incorporated without altering mentioned above results. Directfermion-inflaton coupling resembles Wetterich's model but it does not lead toany observable effect at present. SSB does not raise any problem with CC.
