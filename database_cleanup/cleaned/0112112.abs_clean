In this paper we use the anholonomic frames method to construct exactsolutions for vacuum 5D gravity with metrics having off-diagonal components.The solutions are in general anisotropic and possess interesting features suchas an anisotropic warp factor with respect to the extra dimension, or agravitational scaling/running of some of the physical parameters associatedwith the solutions. A certain class of solutions are found to describeSchwarzschild black holes which ``solitonically'' propagate in spacetime. Thesolitonic character of these black hole solutions arises from the embedding ofa 3D soliton configuration (e.g. the soliton solutions to theKadomtsev-Petviashvily or sine-Gordon equations) into certain ansatz functionsof the 5D metric. These solitonic solutions may either violate or preservelocal Lorentz invariance. In addition there is a connection between thesesolutions and noncommutative field theory.
