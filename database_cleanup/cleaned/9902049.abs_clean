We define gravitational mass in asymptotically de Sitter space-times withcompactified dimension. It was shown that the mass can be negative forspace-time with matter spreading beyond the cosmological horizon scale or largeoutward `momentum' in four dimension. We give simple examples with negativeenergy in higher dimensions even if the matter is not beyond horizon or systemdoes not have large `momentum'. They do not have the lower bound on the mass.We also give a positive energy argument in higher dimensions and realise thatelementary fermion cannot exist in our examples.
