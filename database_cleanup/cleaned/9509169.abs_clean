The conformal factor of the spacetime metric becomes dynamical due to thetrace anomaly of matter fields. Its dynamics is described by an effectiveaction which we quantize by canonical methods on the Einstein universe $R\timesS^3$. We find an infinite tower of discrete states which satisfy theconstraints of quantum diffeomorphism invariance. These physical states are inone-to-one correspondence with operators constructed by integrating integerpowers of the Ricci scalar.
