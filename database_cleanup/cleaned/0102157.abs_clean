We analyze the algebra of observables of a charged particle on anoncommutative torus in a constant magnetic field. We present a set ofgenerators of this algebra which coincide with the generators for a commutativetorus but at a different value of the magnetic field, and demonstrate theexistence of a critical value of the magnetic field for which the algebrareduces. We then obtain the irreducible representations of the algebra andrelate them to noncommutative bundles. Finally we comment on Landau levels,density of states and the critical case.
