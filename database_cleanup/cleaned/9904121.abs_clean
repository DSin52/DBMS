Prepotentials in N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories are known to obeynon-linear partial differential equations calledWitten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde (WDVV) equations. In this paper, theprepotentials at one-instanton level in N=2 supersymmetric SU(4) Yang-Millstheory are studied from the standpoint of WDVV equations. Especially, it isshown that the one-instanton prepotentials are obtained from WDVV equations byassuming the perturbative prepotential and by using the scaling relation as asubsidiary condition but are determined without introducing Seiberg-Wittencurve. In this way, various one-instanton prepotentials which satisfy both WDVVequations and scaling relation can be derived, but it turns out that among themthere exist one-instanton prepotentials which coincide with the instantoncalculus.
