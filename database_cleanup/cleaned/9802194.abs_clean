A type IIA string (or F-theory) compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold isbelieved to be dual to a heterotic string on a K3 surface times a 2-torus (oron a K3 surface). We consider how the resulting moduli space of hypermultipletsis identified between these two pictures in the case of the E8xE8 heteroticstring. As examples we discuss SU(2)-bundles and G2-bundles on the K3 surfaceand the case of point-like instantons. We are lead to a rather beautifulidentification between the integral cohomology of the Calabi-Yau threefold andsome integral structures on the heterotic side somewhat reminiscent of mirrorsymmetry. We discuss the consequences for probing nonperturbative effects inthe both the type IIA string and the heterotic string.
