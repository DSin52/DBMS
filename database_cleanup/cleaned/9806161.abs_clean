We establish self-duality of super D3-brane theory as an exact symmetry ofthe action both in the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalism. In the Lagrangianformalism, the action is shown to satisfy the Gaillard-Zumino condition. Thisalgebraic relation is recognized in our previous paper to be a necessary andsufficient condition for generic action of U(1) gauge field strength coupledwith gravity and matters to be self-dual. For the super D3-brane action, SO(2)duality transformation of a world-volume gauge field should be associated withSO(2) rotation of fermionic brane coordinates in N=2 SUSY multiplet. This SO(2)duality symmetry is lifted to SL(2,R) symmetry in the presence of a dilaton andan axion background fields. In the canonical formalism, we show that theduality rotation is described by a canonical transformation, and theHamiltonian of the D3-brane action is invariant under the transformation.
