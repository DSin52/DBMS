't Hooft has recently developed a discretisation of (2+1) gravity which has amultiple-valued Hamiltonian and which therefore admits quantum time evolutiononly in discrete steps. In this paper, we describe several models in thecontinuum with single-valued equations of motion in classical physics, but withmultiple-valued Hamiltonians. Their time displacements in quantum theory aretherefore obliged to be discrete. Classical models on smooth spatial manifoldsare also constructed with the property that spatial displacements can beimplemented only in discrete steps in quantum theory. All these models showthat quantization can profoundly affect classical topology.
