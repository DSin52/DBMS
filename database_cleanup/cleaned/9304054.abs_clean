We generalize to dimension $p>1$ the notion of string structure and discussthe related obstruction. We apply our results to a model of bosonic $p$-branespropagating on a principal $G$-bundle, coupled to a Yang--Mills field and anantisymmetric tensor field and in the presence of a Wess-Zumino term in theLagrangian. We construct the quantization line bundle and discuss the action ofbackground gauge transformations on wave functions.
