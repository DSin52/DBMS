In extended supergravity theories there are $p$-brane solutions preservingdifferent numbers of supersymmetries, depending on the charges, the spacetimedimension and the number of original supersymmetries (8, 16 or 32). We findU-duality invariant conditions on the quantized charges which specify thenumber of supersymmetries preserved with a particular charge configuration.These conditions relate U-duality invariants to the picture of intersectingbranes. The analysis is carried out for all extended supergravities with 16 or32 supersymmetries in various dimensions.
