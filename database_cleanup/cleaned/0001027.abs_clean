We propose a bi-local representation in noncommutative field theory. Itprovides a simple description for high momentum degrees of freedom. It alsoshows that the low momentum modes can be well approximated by ordinary localfields. Long range interactions are generated in the effective action for thelower momentum modes after integrating out the high momentum bi-local fields.The low momentum modes can be represented by diagonal blocks in the matrixmodel picture and the high momentum bi-local fields correspond to off-diagonalblocks. This block-block interaction picture simply reproduces the infraredsingular behaviors of nonplanar diagrams in noncommutative field theory.
