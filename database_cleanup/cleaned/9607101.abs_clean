We develop a simple computational tool for $SU(3)$ analogous to Bargmann'scalculus for $SU(2)$. Crucial new inputs are, (i) explicit representation ofthe Gelfand-Zetlin basis in terms of polynomials in four variables and positiveor negative integral powers of a fifth variable (ii) an auxiliary Gaussianmeasure with respect to which the Gelfand-Zetlin states are orthogonal but notnormalized (iii) simple generating functions for generating all basis statesand also all invariants. As an illustration of our techniques, an algebraicformula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is obtained for the first time.This involves only Gaussian integrations. Thus $SU(3)$ is made as accessiblefor computations as $SU(2)$ is.
