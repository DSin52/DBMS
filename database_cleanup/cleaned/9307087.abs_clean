We construct a $W_{\infty}$ gauge field theory of electrons in the lowestLandau level. For this purpose we introduce an external gauge potential $\cal A$ such that its $W_{\infty}$ gauge transformations cancel against the gaugetransformation of the electron field. We then show that the electromagneticinteractions of electrons in the lowest Landau level are obtained through anon-linear realization of $\cal A$ in terms of the $U(1)$ gauge potential$A^{\m}$. As applications we derive the effective Lagrangians for circulardroplets and for the $\n =1$ quantum Hall system.
