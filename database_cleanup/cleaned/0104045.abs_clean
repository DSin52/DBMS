We derive the couplings of noncommutative D-branes to spatially varyingRamond-Ramond fields, extending our earlier results in hep-th/0009101. Thesecouplings are expressed in terms of *n products of operators involving openWilson lines. Equivalence of the noncommutative to the commutative couplingsimplies interesting identities as well as an expression for the Seiberg-Wittenmap that was previously conjectured. We generalise our couplings to includetransverse scalars, thereby obtaining a Seiberg-Witten map relating commutativeand noncommutative descriptions of these scalars. RR couplings for unstablenon-BPS branes are also proposed.
