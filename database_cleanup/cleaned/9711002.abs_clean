This article is based on a talk given at the ``Strings'97'' conference. Itdiscusses the search for the universality class of confining strings. The keyingredients include the loop equations, the zigzag symmetry, the non-linearrenormalization group. Some new tests for the equivalence between gauge fieldsand strings are proposed.
