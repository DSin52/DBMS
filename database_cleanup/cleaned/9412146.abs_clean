The Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) method is applied to the quantization ofthe solitons of the non-linear $O(3)$ model in $2+1$ dimensions. We show thatthis method allows for a simple and systematic treatment of zero-modes with anon-commuting algebra. We obtain the expression of the BRST hamiltonian andshow that the residual interaction can be perturbatively treated in anIR-divergence-free way. As an application of the formalism we explicitlyevaluate the two-loop correction to the soliton mass.
