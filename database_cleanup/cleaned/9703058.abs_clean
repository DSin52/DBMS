Title: A comment on non-Abelian duality and the strong CP problem

Comments: 7 pages, Latex, no figures

It is pointed out that the strong CP problem may have a natural solution inthe context of a recently proposed dualized version of the Standard Model whereHiggs fields and generations emerge naturally. Although fermions have finitepole-masses, the fermionic mass matrix itself is factorizable (having only onenonzero eigenvalue) to all orders in perturbation theory thus allowing one toperform a chiral transformation $\psi\to\psi'=e^{-i\gamma_{5}\alpha}\psi$ andto rotate the theta-angle to zero.
