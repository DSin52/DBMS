Massive theories of abelian p-forms are quantized in a generalizedpath-representation that leads to a description of the phase space in terms ofa pair of dual non-local operators analogous to the Wilson Loop and the 'tHooft disorder operators. Special atention is devoted to the study of theduality between the Topologically Massive and the Self-Dual models in 2+1dimensions. It is shown that these models share a geometric representation inwhich just one non local operator suffices to describe the observables.
