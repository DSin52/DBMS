We discuss the role of fixed scalars($\nu,\lambda$) in scattering off afive-dimensional balck hole. The issue is to explain the disagreement of thegreybody factor for $\lambda$ between the semiclassical and effective stringcalculations. In the effective string approach, this is related to theoperators with dimension (3,1) and (1,3). On the semiclassical calculation,this originates from a complicated mixing between $\lambda$ and other fields.Hence it may depend on the decoupling procedure. It is shown that $\lambda$depends on the gauge choices such as the harmonic, dilaton gauges, and theKrasnitz-Klebanov setting for $h_{\mu\nu}$. It turns out that $\nu$ plays arole of test field well, while the role of $\lambda$ is obscure.
