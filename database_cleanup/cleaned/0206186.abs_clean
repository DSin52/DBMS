Consistent couplings among a set of scalar fields, two types of one-forms anda system of two-forms are investigated in the light of the Hamiltonian BRSTcohomology, giving a four-dimensional nonlinear gauge theory. The emerginginteractions deform the first-class constraints, the Hamiltonian gauge algebra,as well as the reducibility relations.
