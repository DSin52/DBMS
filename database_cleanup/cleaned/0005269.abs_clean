We discuss a simple procedure for computing one-loop quantum energies of anystatic field configuration that depends non-trivially on only a single spatialcoordinate. We specifically focus on domain wall-type field configurations thatconnect two distinct minima of the effective potential, and may or may not bethe solutions of classical field equations. We avoid the conventional summationof zero-point energies, and instead exploit the relation between functionaldeterminants and solutions of associated differential equations. This approachallows ultraviolet divergences to be easily isolated and extracted using any$\phi^4$ theory, and three-dimensional scalar electrodynamics with spontaneoussymmetry breaking at the one-loop level.
