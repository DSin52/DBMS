We show that the existent fuzzy S^2 and S^4 models are natural candidates forthe quantum geometry on the corresponding spheres in AdS/CFT correspondence.These models fit nicely the data from the dipole mechanism for the stringyexclusion principle. In the AdS_2 X S^2 case, we show that a wrapped fractionalmembrane can be used to count for the large ground state degeneracy. We alsopropose a fuzzy AdS_2 model whose fundamental commutation relation may underliethe UV/IR connection.
