Amplitudes for boson-boson and fermion-boson interactions are calculated inthe second order of perturbation theory in the Lobachevsky space. An essentialingredient of the used model is the Weinberg's $2(2j+1)$ component formalismfor describing a particle of spin $j$, recently developed substantially. Theboson-boson amplitude is then compared with the two-fermion amplitude obtainedby Skachkov long ago on the ground of the hamiltonian formulation of quantumfield theory on the mass hyperboloid, $p_0^2 -{\vec p}^{2}=M^2$, proposed byKadyshevsky. The parametrization of the amplitudes by means of the momentumtransfer in the Lobachevsky space leads to same spin structures in theexpressions of $T$ matrices for the fermion and the boson cases. However,certain differences are found. Possible physical applications are discussed.
