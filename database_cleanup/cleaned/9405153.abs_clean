We show that Galois theory of cyclotomic number fields provides a powerfultool to construct systematically integer-valued matrices commuting with themodular matrix S, as well as automorphisms of the fusion rules. Both of theseprescriptions allow the construction of modular invariants and offer newinsight in the structure of known exceptional invariants.
