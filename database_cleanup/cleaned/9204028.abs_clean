We formulate the $c=1$ matrix model as a quantum fluid and discuss itsclassical limit in detail, emphasizing the $\hbar$ corrections. We view thefermi fluid profiles as elements of \winf-coadjoint orbit and write down ageometric action for the classical phase space. In the specific representationof fluid profiles as `strings' the action is written in a four-dimensional formin terms of gauge fields built out of the embedding of the `string' in thephase plane. We show that the collective field action can be derived from theabove action provided one restricts to quadratic fluid profiles and ignores thedynamics of their `turning points'.
