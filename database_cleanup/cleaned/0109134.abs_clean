We perform the Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization of Yang-Mills theory on a2-point space, discussing the formulation of Connes-Lott as well as Connes'real spectral triple approach. Despite of the model's apparent simplicity thegauge structure reveals infinite reducibility and the gauge fixing is afflictedwith the Gribov problem.
