Title: Maximal-acceleration phase space relativity from Clifford algebras

Comments: 15 pages, revised Latex file

We present a new physical model that links the maximum speed of light withthe minimal Planck scale into a maximal-acceleration Relativity principle inthe spacetime tangent bundle and in phase spaces (cotangent bundle). Crucial inorder to establish this link is the use of Clifford algebras in phase spaces.The maximal proper-acceleration bound is a = c^2/ \Lambda in full agreementwith the old predictions of Caianiello, the Finslerian geometry point of viewof Brandt and more recent results in the literature. We present the reasons whyan Extended Scale Relativity based on Clifford spaces is physically moreappealing than those based on kappa-deformed Poincare algebras and theinhomogeneous quantum groups operating in quantum Minkowski spacetimes. Themain reason being that the Planck scale should not be taken as a deformationparameter to construct quantum algebras but should exist already as the minimumscale in Clifford spaces.
