The correspondence between the four-dimensional SU(N), $\cN = 4$ SYM taken atlarge $N$ and the type II B SUGRA on the $AdS_5\times S_5$ background isconsidered. We argue that the classical equations of motion in the SUGRApicture can be interpreted as that of the renormalization group on the SYMside. In fact, when the D3-brane is slightly excited higher derivative terms inthe field theory on its world-volume deform it form the conformal $\cN = 4$ SYMlimit. We give arguments in favor of that the deformation goes in the way setby the SUGRA equations of motion. Concrete example of the s-wave dilaton isconsidered.
