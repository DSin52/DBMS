PhysicsBekenstein proposed that the spectrum of horizon area of quantized blackholes must be discrete and uniformly spaced. We examine this proposal in thecontext of spherically symmetric charged black holes in a general class ofgravity theories. By imposing suitable boundary conditions on the reduced phasespace of the theory to incorporate the thermodynamic properties of these blackholes and then performing a simplifying canonical transformation, we are ableto quantize the system exactly. The resulting spectra of horizon area, as wellas that of charge are indeed discrete. Within this quantization scheme,near-extremal black holes (of any mass) turn out to be highly quantum objects,whereas extremal black holes do not appear in the spectrum, a result that isconsistent with the postulated third law of black hole thermodynamics.
