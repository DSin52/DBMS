We consider the process of black hole formation in particle collisions in theexactly solvable framework of 2+1 dimensional Anti de Sitter gravity. Aneffective Hamiltonian describing the near horizon dynamics of a head oncollision is given. The Hamiltonian exhibits a universal structure, with aformation of a horizon at a critical distance. Based on it we evaluate theaction for the process and discuss the semiclassical amplitude for black holeformation. The derived amplitude is seen to contain no exponential suppressionor enhancement. Coments on the CFT description of the process are made.
