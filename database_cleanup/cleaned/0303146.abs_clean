Title: Classification of 't Hooft instantons over multi-centered gravitational

instantonsComments: 18 pages, LaTeX, no figures

This work presents a classification of all smooth 't Hooft-Jackiw-Nohl-Rebbiinstantons over Gibbons-Hawking spaces. That is, we find all smooth SU(2)Yang-Mills instantons over these spaces which arise by conformal rescalings ofthe metric with suitable functions.Since the Gibbons-Hawking spaces are hyper-Kahler gravitational instantons,the rescaling functions must be positive harmonic. By using twistor methods wepresent integral formulae for the kernel of the Laplacian associated to thesespaces. These integrals are generalizations of the classical Whittaker-Watsonformula. By the aid of these we prove that all 't Hooft instantons have alreadybeen found in a recent paper.This result also shows that actually all such smooth 'tHooft-Jackiw-Nohl-Rebbi instantons describe singular magnetic monopoles overthe flat three-space with zero magnetic charge moreover the reducible onesgenerate the the full L^2 cohomology of the Gibbons-Hawking spaces.
