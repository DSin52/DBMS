We present a new class of quantum two dimensional dilaton gravity model,which is described by $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model deformedby $(1,1)$-operator. We analyze the model by ${1 \over k}$ expansion ($k$ isthe level of $SL(2,R)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model) and we find that the curvaturesingularity does not appear when $k$ is large and the Bondi mass is boundedfrom below. Furthermore, the rate of the Hawking radiation in the quantum blackhole created by shock wave goes to zero asymptotically and the radiation stopswhen the Bondi mass vanishes.
