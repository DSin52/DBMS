Title: On the M-theory Interpretation of Orientifold Planes

Authors: Eric G. Gimon

Comments: 16 pages, 4 figures, LaTeX

We obtain an M--theory interpretation of different IIA orientifold planes bycompactifying them on a circle and use a chain of dualities to get a new IIAlimit of these objects using this circle as the eleventh dimension. Using thecombination of the two IIA description, we give an interpretation for allorientifold four-planes in M-theory, including a mechanism for freezingM5-branes at singularities.
