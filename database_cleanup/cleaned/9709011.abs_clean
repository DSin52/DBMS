1997A renormalized perturbative expansion of interacting quantum fields on aglobally hyperbolic spacetime is performed by adapting the Bogoliubov EpsteinGlaser method to a curved background. The results heavily rely on techniquesfrom microlocal analysis, in particular on Radzikowski's characterization ofHadamard states by wave front sets of Wightman functions.
