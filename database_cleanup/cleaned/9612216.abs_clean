We study a 3-dimensional topological sigma-model, whose target space is ahyper-Kahler manifold X. A Feynman diagram calculation of its partitionfunction demonstrates that it is a finite type invariant of 3-manifolds whichis similar in structure to those appearing in the perturbative calculation ofthe Chern-Simons partition function.The sigma-model suggests a new system of weights for finite type invariantsof 3-manifolds, described by trivalent graphs. The Riemann curvature of X playsthe role of Lie algebra structure constants in Chern-Simons theory, and theBianchi identity plays the role of the Jacobi identity in guaranteeing theso-called IHX relation among the weights.We argue that, for special choices of X, the partition function of thesigma-model yields the Casson-Walker invariant and its generalizations. We alsoderive Walker's surgery formula from the SL(2,Z) action on thefinite-dimensional Hilbert space obtained by quantizing the sigma-model on atwo-dimensional torus.
