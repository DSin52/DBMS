Title: On the composite fermion approach in the FQHE

Authors: M.Eliashvili

Comments: 9p.LATEX

FQHE is presented in the form of non-unitary singular similaritytransformation, which relates the Laughlin wave function (and its particle-holeconjugate) to the composite quasi- particle incompressible ground state.(ENSLAPP-A-478/94)
