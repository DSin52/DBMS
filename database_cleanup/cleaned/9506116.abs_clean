Using Operator Product Expansions and a graphical ansatz for the four-pointfunction of the fundamental field \phi^{\alpha}(x) in the conformally invariantO(N) vector model, we calculate the next-to-leading order in 1/N values of thequantities C_{T} and C_{J}. We check the results against what is expected frompossible generalisations of the C- and k-theorems in higher dimensions and alsoagainst known three-loop calculations in a O(N) invariant \phi^{4} theory ford=4-\epsilon.
