Title: A Large Distance Expansion for Quantum Field Theory

Comments: 5 pages, latex, invited talk at the Second International Sakharov

Conference on Physics, May 1996Using analyticity of the vacuum wave-functional under complex scalings, thevacuum of a quantum field theory may be reconstructed from a derivativeexpansion valid for slowly varying fields. This enables the eigenvalue problemfor the Hamiltonian to be reduced to algebraic equations. Applied to Yang-Millstheory this expansion leads to a confining force between quarks.
