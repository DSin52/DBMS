Title: Exact Solutions for Cosmological Models with a Scalar Field

Authors: Hossein Motavali, Mahdi Golshani

Comments: 7 pages

We consider the existence of a Noether symmetry in the scalar-tensor theoryof gravity in flat Friedman Robertson Walker (FRW) cosmology. The forms ofcoupling function $\omega(\phi)$ and generic potential $V(\phi)$ are obtainedby requiring the existence of a Noether symmetry for such theory. We deriveexact cosmological solutions of the field equations from a point-likeLagrangian.
