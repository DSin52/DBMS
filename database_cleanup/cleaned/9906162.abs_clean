By analysing supersymmetry transformations we derive new BPS equations forthe D=11 fivebrane propagating in flat space that involve the world-volumethree-form. The equations generalise those of 2,3,4 and 5 dimensional specialLagrangian submanifolds and are relevant for describing membranes ending onthese submanifolds.
