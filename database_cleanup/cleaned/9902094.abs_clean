We construct a topological invariant of the renormalization grouptrajectories of a large class of 2D quantum integrable models, described by thethermodynamic Bethe ansatz approach. A geometrical description of thisinvariant in terms of triangulations of three-dimensional manifolds is proposedand associated dilogarithm identities are proven.
