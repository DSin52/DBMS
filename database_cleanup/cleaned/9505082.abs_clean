There are supersymmetric gauge theories which do not possess any parametersnor flat directions, and hence cannot be studied anywhere in the field spaceusing holomorphy (``non-calculable''). Some of them are believed to breaksupersymmetry dynamically. We propose a simple technique to analyze thesemodels. Introducing a vector-like field into the model, one finds flatdirections where one can study the dynamics. We unambiguously show that thesupersymmetry is broken when the mass of the vector-like field is small butfinite, and hence Witten index vanishes. If we increase the mass of thevector-like field, it eventually decouples from the dynamics and the modelsreduce to the original non-calculable models. Assuming the continuity of theWitten index in the parameter space, one can establish the dynamicalsupersymmetry breaking in the non-calculable models.
