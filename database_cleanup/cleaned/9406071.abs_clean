Title: Chiral fermion action with (8,0) worldsheet supersymmetry

Authors: E. Ivanov and E. Sokatchev

Comments: 13 pages, LaTeX

We propose an action describing chiral fermions with an arbitrary gauge groupand with manifest $(8,0)$ worldsheet supersymmetry. The form of the action isinspired by and adapted for completing the twistor-like formulation of the$D=10$ heterotic superstring.
