We study the effects of interference between the self-dual and anti self-dualmassive modes of the linearized Einstein-Chern-Simons topological gravity. Thedual models to be used in the interference process are carefully analyzed withspecial emphasis on their propagating spectrum. We identify the opposite dualaspects, necessary for the application of the interference formalism on thismodel. The soldered theory so obtained displays explicitly massive modes of theProca type. It may also be written in a form of Polyakov-Weigman identity to abetter appreciation of its physical contents.
