We revisit local mirror symmetry associated with del Pezzo surfaces inCalabi-Yau threefolds in view of five-dimensional N=1 E_N theories compactifiedon a circle. The mirror partner of singular Calabi-Yau with a shrinking delPezzo four-cycle is described as the affine 7-brane backgrounds probed by aD3-brane. Evaluating the mirror map and the BPS central charge we relatejunction charges to RR charges of D-branes wrapped on del Pezzo surfaces. Thisenables us to determine how the string junctions are mapped to D-branes on delPezzo surfaces.
