By using the Hamiltonian version of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we computethe two-point Green function of a local operator in D=4 N=4 super Yang-Millstheory, which corresponds to a massive antisymmetric tensor field of the secondrank on the $AdS_{5}$ background. We discuss the conformal transformationsinduced on the boundary by isometries of $AdS_{5}$.
