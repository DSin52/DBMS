We investigate a relationship between the number of the negative modes aroundperiodic instanton solution and the type of the decay-rate transition. It isshown that for the case of first-order decay-rate transition the lowestpositive mode at low energy periodic instanton becomes additional negative modeat high energy regime, while in the second-order case there is only onenegative mode in the full range of energy. This kind of analysis on thenegative modes makes it possible to derive the criterion for the first-ordertransition.
