The Hoft structure of the central extension of the $U_q \left(\widehat{sl\left( n \right) }\right)$ algebra is considered. The intertwinematrix induces new integrable spin chain models. We show the relation of thesemodels and the biparametric spin chain $\widehat{sl_{p,q} \left( n \right)}$models. The cases $n=2$ are $n=3$ are discussed and for $n=2$ we obtain themodel of Dasgupta and Chowdhury . The case $n=3$ is solved with nested Betheansatz method and it is showed the dependence of the Bethe equations in thesecond parameter introduced
