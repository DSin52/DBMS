We present a generalization of the non-Abelian version of the $CP^{N-1}$models (also known as Grassmannian models) that involve composite gauge fieldsto accommodate partial breaking of the non-Abelian gauge symmetry. For this tobe possible, in most cases, the constituent fields need to belong to an anomalyfree complex representation. Symmetry is broken dynamically for large $N$primarily by a naturally generated composite scalar which simulates Higgsmechanism. In the example studied in some detail, the gauge group SO(10) getsbroken down to subgroups like SU(5) or SU(5)$\times$U(1).
