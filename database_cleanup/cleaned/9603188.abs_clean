Dual Feynman rules for Dirac monopoles in Yang-Mills fields are obtained bythe Wu-Yang (1976) criterion in which dynamics result as a consequence of theconstraint defining the monopole as a topological obstruction in the field. Theusual path-integral approach is adopted, but using loop space variables of thetype introduced by Polyakov (1980). An anti-symmetric tensor potential$L_{\mu\nu}[\xi|s]$ appears as the Lagrange multiplier for the Wu-Yangconstraint which has to be gauge-fixed because of the ``magnetic''$\widetilde{U}$-symmetry of the theory. Two sets of ghosts are thus introduced,which subsequently integrate out and decouple. The generating functional isthen calculated to order $g^0$ and expanded in a series in $\widetilde{g}$. Itis shown to be expressible in terms of a local ``dual potential''$\widetilde{A}_\mu (x)$ found earlier, which has the same progagator and thesame interaction vertex with the monopole field as those of the ordinaryYang-Mills potential $A_\mu$ with a colour charge, indicating thus a certaindegree of dual symmetry in the theory. For the abelian case the Feynman rulesobtained here are the same as in QED to all orders in $g$, as expected by dualsymmetry.
