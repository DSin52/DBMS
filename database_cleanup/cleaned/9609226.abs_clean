We discuss BF theories defined on manifolds with spatial boundaries.Variational arguments show that one needs to augment the usual action with aboundary term for specific types of boundary conditions. We also show how touse this procedure to find the boundary actions for theories of gravity withfirst order formulations. Possible connection with the membrane approach isalso discussed.
