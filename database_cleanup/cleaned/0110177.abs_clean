Using the point-splitting regularisation, we calculate the axial anomaly inan arbitrary even dimensional Non-Commutative (NC) field theory. Our result is(star) gauge invariant in its {\it unintegrated} form, to the leading order inthe NC parameter.Exploiting the Seiberg Witten map, this result gets transformed to thefamiliar Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly in ordinary space-time. Furthermore, usingthis map, we derive an expression for the unintegrated axial anomaly forconstant fields in NC space-time, that is valid to all finite orders of the NCparameter.
