D-instantons are considered as a probe of coinciding $N$ D3-branes. They canfeel an external metric via the commutator terms in their effective action. Weshow that when the D-instantons are separated from the D3-branes, the metricwhich is probed at the one loop level, {\it exactly} coincides with that of theBPS R-R 3-brane. Interesting connection of this result to the possibleexplanation of the AdS/CFT correspondence within IKKT M-atrix theory isdiscussed.
