By exploiting the properties of q-deformed Coxeter elements, the scatteringmatrices of affine Toda field theories with real coupling constant related toany dual pair of simple Lie algebras may be expressed in a completely genericway. We discuss the governing equations for the existence of bound states, i.e.the fusing rules, in terms of q-deformed Coxeter elements, twisted q-deformedCoxeter elements and undeformed Coxeter elements. We establish the preciserelation between these different formulations and study their solutions. Thegeneralized S-matrix bootstrap equations are shown to be equivalent to thefusing rules. The relation between different versions of fusing rules andquantum conserved quantities, which result as nullvectors of a doublyq-deformed Cartan like matrix, is presented. The properties of this matrixtogether with the so-called combined bootstrap equations are utilised in orderto derive generic integral representations for the scattering matrix in termsof quantities of either of the two dual algebras. We present extensivecase-by-case data, in particular on the orbits generated by the various Coxeterelements.
