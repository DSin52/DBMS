Title: Wave Functional of Quantum Black Holes in Two Dimensions

Authors: Takayuki Hori and Masaru Kamata

Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX, TEP-10

The wheeler-DeWitt method is applied to the quantization of the 1 + 1dimensional dilaton gravity coupled with the conformal matter fields. Exactsolutions to the WD equations are found, which are interpreted asright(left)-moving black holes.
