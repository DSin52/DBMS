Given the two boson representation of the conformal algebra \hat W_\infty,the second Hamiltonian structure of the KP hierarchy, I construct abi-Hamiltonian hierarchy for the two associated currents. The KP hierarchyappears as a composite of this new and simpler system. The bi-Hamiltonianstructure of the new hierarchy gives naturally all the Hamiltonian structuresof the KP system.
