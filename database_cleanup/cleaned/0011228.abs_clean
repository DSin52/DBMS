We try to give a qualitative description of the Godbillon-Vey class and itsrelation on the one hand to the holonomy and on the other hand to thetopological entropy of a foliation, using a remarkable theorem proved recentlyby G. Duminy (which still remains unpublished), relating these three notions inthe case of codim-1 foliations. Moreover we shall investigate its possibleconsequences on string theory. In particular we shall present a conceptualargument according to which the curvature of the B-field (rank twoantisymmetric tensor) of open strings might be related to the Godbillon-Veyclass using a suitable generalisation of ``Non-Abelian Geometry'' which hasjust appeared in physics literature. Our starting point again is theConnes-Douglas-Schwarz article on compactifications of matrix models tononcommutative tori.
