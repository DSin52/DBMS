We analyze the finite temperature deconfining phase transition in 2+1dimensional Georgi-Glashow model. We show explicitly that the transition is dueto the restoration of the magnetic $Z_2$ symmetry and that it is in the Isinguniversality class. We find that neglecting effects of the charged $W$ bosonsleads to incorrect predictions for the value of the critical temperature andthe universality class of the transition, as well as for various correlationfunctions in the high temperature phase. We derive the effective action for thePolyakov loop in the high temperature phase and calculate the correlationfunctions of magnetic vortex operators.
