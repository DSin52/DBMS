166-178There being no precise definition of the quantum integrability, theseparability of variables can serve as its practical substitute. For anyquantum integrable model generated by the Yangian Y[sl(3)] the canonicalcoordinates and the conjugated operators are constructed which satisfy the``quantum characteristic equation'' (quantum counterpart of the spectralalgebraic curve for the L operator). The coordinates constructed provide alocal separation of variables. The conditions are enlisted which are necessaryfor the global separation of variables to take place.
