We study the BPS black hole solutions of the (truncated) action for heteroticstring theory compactified on a six-torus. The O(3,Z) duality symmetry of thetheory, together with the bound state interpretation of extreme black holes, isused to generate the whole spectrum of the solutions. The correspondingspacetime structures, written in terms of the string metric, are analyzed indetail. In particular, we show that only the elementary solutions present nakedsingularities. The bound states have either null singularities (electricsolutions) or are regular (magnetic or dyonic solutions) with near-horizongeometries given by the product of two 2d spaces of constant curvature. Thebehavior of some of these solutions as supersymmetric attractors is discussed.We also show that our approach is very useful to understand some of thepuzzling features of charged black hole solutions in string theory.
