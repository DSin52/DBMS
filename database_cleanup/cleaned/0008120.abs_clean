We investigate the Kac-Moody algebra of noncommutative Wess-Zumino-Wittenmodel and find its structure to be the same as the commutative case. Variouskinds of gauged noncommutative WZW models are constructed. In particular,noncommutative $U(2)/U(1)$ WZW model is studied and by integrating out thegauge fields, we obtain a noncommutative non-linear $\sigma$-model.
