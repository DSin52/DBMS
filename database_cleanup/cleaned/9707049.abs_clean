We present an algorithm for obtaining the matter content of effectivesix-dimensional theories resulting from compactification of F-theory onelliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds which are hypersurfaces in toric varieties. Thealgorithm allows us to read off the matter content of the theory from thepolyhedron describing the Calabi-Yau manifold. This is based on the generalizedGreen-Schwarz anomaly cancellation condition.
