Eleven different types of "maximally superintegrable" Hamiltonian systems onthe real hyperboloid $(s^0)^2-(s^1)^2+(s^2)^2-(s^3)^2=1$ are obtained. All ofthem correspond to a free Hamiltonian system on the homogeneous space$SU(2,2)/U(2,1)$, but to reductions by different maximal abelian subgroups of$SU(2,2)$. Each of the obtained systems allows 5 functionally independentintegrals of motion, from which it is possible to form two or more triplets ininvolution (each of them includes the hamiltonian). The corresponding classicaland quantum equations of motion can be solved by separation of variables on the$O(2,2)$ space.
