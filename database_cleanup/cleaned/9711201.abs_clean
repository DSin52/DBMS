We show that various disconnected components of the moduli space ofsuperstring vacua with 16 supercharges admit a rationale in terms of BPSun-orientifolds, i.e. type I toroidal compactifications with constantnon-vanishing but quantized vacuum expectation values of the NS-NSantisymmetric tensor. These include various heterotic vacua with reduced rank,known as CHL strings, and their dual type II (2,2) superstrings below D=6. TypeI vacua without open strings allow for an interpretation of severaldisconnected components with N_V=10-D. An adiabatic argument relates theseunconventional type I superstrings to type II (4,0) superstrings withoutD-branes. The latter are connected by U-duality below D=6 to type II (2,2)superstrings. We also comment on the relation between some of these vacua andcompactifications of the putative M-theory on unorientable manifolds as well asF-theory vacua.
