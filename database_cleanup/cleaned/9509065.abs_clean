Title: Perturbative approach to the two-dimensional quantum gravity

Comments: LaTeX, 16 pages, no figures, Talk given at the VI Seminar "Quantum

Gravity" (Institute for Nuclear Research, Moscow, June, 1995)The main part of this presentation is a review of the previous original workson the perturbative covariant approach to the $2$-dimensional quantum gravity.We discuss the renormalization of the two-dimensional dilaton gravity in aharmonic gauge, the form of the quantum corrections to the classical potential,and the conditions of Weyl invariance in a theory of string coupled to $2d$quantum gravity.
