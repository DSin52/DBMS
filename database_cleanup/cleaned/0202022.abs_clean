Grav. 19 (2002) 3033-3048Generalized composite fluxbrane solutions for a wide class of intersectionrules are obtained. The solutions are defined on a manifold which contains aproduct of n Ricci-flat spaces M_1 x ... x M_n with 1-dimensional M_1. They aredefined up to a set of functions H_s obeying non-linear differential equationsequivalent to Toda-type equations with certain boundary conditions imposed. Aconjecture on polynomial structure of governing functions H_s for intersectionsrelated to semisimple Lie algebras is suggested. This conjecture is valid forpolynomials coincide with the components of the dual Weyl vector in the basisof simple roots. Explicit formulas for A_1 + ... + A_1 (orthogonal),"block-ortogonal" and A_2 solutions are obtained. Certain examples of solutionsin D = 11 and D =10 (II A) supergravities (e.g. with A_2 intersection rules)and Kaluza-Klein dyonic A_2 flux tube, are considered.
