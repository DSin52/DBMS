We review the Lagrangian Batalin--Vilkovisky method for gauge theories. Thisincludes gauge fixing, quantisation and regularisation. We emphasize the roleof cohomology of the antibracket operation. Our main example is $d=2$ gravity,for which we also discuss the solutions for the cohomology in the space oflocal integrals. This leads to the most general form for the action, foranomalies and for background charges.
