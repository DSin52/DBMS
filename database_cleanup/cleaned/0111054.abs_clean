We study the Morita equivalence for fermion theories on noncommutativetwo-tori. For rational values of the $\theta$ parameter (in appropriate units)we show the equivalence between an abelian noncommutative fermion theory and anonabelian theory of twisted fermions on ordinary space. We study the chiralanomaly and compute the determinant of the Dirac operator in the dual theoriesshowing that the Morita equivalence also holds at this level.
