We study large dimensions and low string scale in four-dimensionalcompactifications of type II theories of closed strings at weak coupling. Wefind that the fundamental string scale, together with all compact dimensions,can be at the TeV, while the smallness of the string coupling accounts for theweakness of gravitational interactions. This is in contrast to the situationrecently studied in type I theories, where the string scale can be lowered onlyat the expense of introducing large transverse dimensions felt by gravity only.As a result, in these type II strings, there are no strong gravity effects atthe TeV, and the main experimental signature is the production of Kaluza-Kleinexcitations with gauge interactions. In the context of type IIB theories, wefind a new possibility providing a first instance of large non-transverseinteractions can be at the TeV, with the string scale and all other dimensionsat intermediate energies of the order of $10^{11}$ GeV, where gravity becomesalso strong. Finally, using duality, we provide a perturbative description forthe generic case of large dimensions in the heterotic string. In particular, weshow that the two type II theories above describe the cases of one and twoheterotic large dimensions. A new M-theory derivation of heterotic-type IIduality is instrumental for this discussion.
