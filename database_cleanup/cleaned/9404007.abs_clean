Comments: 8 pages

Journal-ref: J.Math.Phys. 36 (1995) 1547-1553

A new derivation of the quantum deformation of the 2 dimensional EuclideanPoincare group (cf S. Zakrzewski) is proposed. It is based on a contraction ofthe Hopf algebra Fun(SO_q(3)). The deformation parameter q is sent to one, asin the construction of the $\kappa$-Poincare deformed algebra. The quantumgroup obtained is dual to that algebra.
