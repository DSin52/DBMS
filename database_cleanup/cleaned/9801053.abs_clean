The entropy of the four dimensional Schwarzschild black hole is derived bymapping it onto a configuration of intersecting branes with four charges. Thisconfiguration is obtained by performing several boosts and dualities on aneutral black brane of M-theory to which the Schwarzschild black hole isrelated by trivial compactification. The infinite boost limit is well-definedand corresponds to extremality where the intersecting brane configuration is amarginal one on which a standard microscopic counting of the entropy can besafely performed. The result reproduces exactly the Bekenstein-Hawking entropyof the four dimensional black hole.
