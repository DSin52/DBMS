A recently introduced approach for the dynamical analysis and quantization offield theoretical models with second class constraints is ilustrated applied tolinearized gravity in 3-D. The canonical structure of two different models oflinerized gravity in 3-D, the intermediate and the self dual models, isdiscussed in detail. It is shown that the first order self dual model whoseconstraints are all second class may be regarded as a gauge fixed version ofthe second order gauge invariant intermediate model. In particular it is shownhow to construct the gauge invariant hamiltonian of the intermediate modelstarting from the one of the self dual model. The relation with the topologically massive linearized gravity is also discussed.
