Authors: Andrey Yu. Dubin

Comments: 11 pages, the short version of hep-th/0101182, the proof (directly

from the Loop equation) of the dimensional reduction in the extremestrong-coupling limit is additionally includedJournal-ref: Phys.Lett. B508 (2001) 137-145

I put forward the stringy representation of the 1/N strong coupling (SC)expansion for the regularized Wilson's loop-averages in the continuous D>=3Yang-Mills theory (YM_{D}) with a sufficiently large bare coupling constant\lambda>\lambda_{cr} and a fixed ultraviolet cut off \Lambda. The proposedrepresentation is proved to provide with the confining solution of theDyson-Schwinger chain of the judiciously regularized U(N) Loop equations.Building on the results obtained, we suggest the stringy pattern of thelow-energy theory associated to the D=4 U(\infty)=SU(\infty) gauge theory inthe standard \lambda=>0 phase with the asymptotic freedom in the UV domain. Anontrivial test, to clarify whether the AdS/CFT correspondence conjecture maybe indeed applicable to the large N pure YM_{4} theory in the \lambda=>\inftylimit, is also discussed.
