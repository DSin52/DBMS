We describe local mirror symmetry from a mathematical point of view and makeseveral A-model calculations using the mirror principle (localization). Ourresults agree with B-model computations from solutions of Picard-Fuchsdifferential equations constructed form the local geometry near a Fano surfacewithin a Calabi-Yau manifold. We interpret the Gromov-Witten-type numbers froman enumerative point of view. We also describe the geometry of singularsurfaces and show how the local invariants of singular surfaces agree with thesmooth cases when they occur as complete intersections.
