We investigate N=1 super Yang-Mills theory using fractional branes. We firstdefine the beta-function with respect to a supergravity coordinate. To providethe relation between the supergravity parameter and the renormalization groupscale we use the UV known gauge theory beta-function as a type of boundarycondition. We show that there are no privileged renormalization schemesconnected to a given supergravity solution while we investigate in some detailtwo schemes. The Wilsonian one where just one loop is manifest and the onecontaining multi-loops. A new functional relation between the gauginocondensate and the supergravity coordinates is finally determined.
