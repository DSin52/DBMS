We use an auxiliary field construction to discuss the hard thermal loopeffective action associated with massless thermal SU(N) QCD interacting with aweak gravitational field. It is demonstrated that the previous attempt toderive this effective action has only been partially successful and that it ispresently only known to first order in the graviton coupling constant. This isstill sufficient to enable a calculation of a symmetric traceless quark gluonplasma energy momentum tensor. Finally, we comment on the conserved currentsand charges of the derived energy momentum tensor.
