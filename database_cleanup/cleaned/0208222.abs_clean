Fest), Minneapolis, May 2002Three closely related issues will be discussed. Magnetic quarks havingnon-Abelian charges have been found recently to appear as the dominant infrareddegrees of freedom in some vacua of softly broken N=2 supersymmetric QCD withSU(n_c) gauge group. Their condensation upon N=1 perturbation causesconfinement and dynamical symmetry breaking. We argue that these magneticquarks can be naturally related to the semiclassical non-Abelian monopoles ofthe type first discussed by Goddard, Nuyts, Olive and E. Weinberg. We discussalso general properties of non-Abelian vortices and discuss their relevance tothe confinement in QCD. Finally, calculation by Douglas and Shenker of thetension ratios for vortices of different N-alities in the softly broken N=2supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory, is carried to the second order in theadjoint multiplet mass. A correction to the ratios violating the sine formulais found, showing that the latter is not a universal quantity.
