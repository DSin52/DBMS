We have devoted an effort to study some nonlinear actions, characteristics ofthe ${\cal W}$-theories, in the framework of the soldering formalism. We havedisclosed interesting new results concerning the embedding of the originalchiral ${\cal W}$-particles in different metrical spaces in the final solderedaction, i.e., the metric gets modified by the soldering interference process.The results are presented in a weak field approximation for the ${\cal W}_N$case when N is greater than 3 and also in an exact way for ${\cal W}_2$. Wehave promoted a generalization of the interference phenomena to ${\calW}_N$-theories of different chiralities and shown that the geometrical featuresintroduced can yield a new understanding about the interference formalism inquantum field theories.
