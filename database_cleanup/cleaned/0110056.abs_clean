Title: Point particle in general background fields vs. free gauge theories of

traceless symmetric tensorsAuthors: A. Yu. Segal (Lebedev Physical Institute)

Comments: 21 pages, remarks on nonlinear generalization added, a mistake in the

discussion of degenerate solutions correctedPoint particle may interact to traceless symmetric tensors of arbitrary rank.Free gauge theories of traceless symmetric tensors are constructed, thatprovides a possibility for a new type of interactions, when particles exchangeby those gauge fields. The gauge theories are parameterized by the particle'smass m and otherwise are unique for each rank s. For m=0, they are local gaugemodels with actions of 2s-th order in derivatives, known in d=4 as "pure spin",or "conformal higher spin" actions by Fradkin and Tseytlin. For nonzero m, eachrank-s model undergoes a unique nonlocal deformation which entangles fields ofall ranks, starting from s. There exists a nonlocal transform which maps m > 0theories onto m=0 ones, however, this map degenerates at some m > 0 fieldswhose polarizations are determined by zeros of Bessel functions. Conformalcovariance properties of the m=0 models are analyzed, the space of gauge fieldsis shown to admit an action of an infinite-dimensional "conformal higher spin"Lie algebra which leaves gauge transformations intact.
