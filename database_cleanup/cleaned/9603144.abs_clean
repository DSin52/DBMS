The Wess-Zumino term of the spinning string is constructed in terms of theiranomalies using an extended field-antifield formalism. A new feature appearsfrom a fact that the non-anomalous transformations do not form a sub-group. Thealgebra of the extended variables closes only using the equations of motionderived from the WZ term.
