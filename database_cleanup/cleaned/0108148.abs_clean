We give the bare-bone description of the quasitriangular chiral WZW model forthe particular choice of the Lu-Weinstein-Soibelman Drinfeld double of theaffine Kac-Moody group. The symplectic structure of the model and itsPoisson-Lie symmetry are completely characterized by two $r$-matrices withspectral parameter. One of them is ordinary and trigonometric and characterizesthe $q$-current algebra. The other is dynamical and elliptic (in fact Felder'sone) and characterizes the braiding of $q$-primary fields.
