A \rep of \sun, which diverges in the limit of \cl, is investigated. This isan infinite dimensional and a non-unitary \rep, defined for the real value of $q, \ 0 < q < 1. $ Each \irrep is specified by $ n $ continuous variables andone discrete variable. This \rep gives a new solution of the Yang-Baxterequation, when the R-matrix is evaluated. It is shown that a continuousvariables can be regarded as a spectral parameter.
