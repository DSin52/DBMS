Title: Covariant Quantization Of Green Schwarz Superstring

Authors: A.Restuccia and J. Stephany

Comments: 21 pages

We describe a canonical covariant approach to the quantization of theGreen-Schwarz superstring. The approach is first applied to the canonicalcovariant quantization of the Brink and Schwarz superparticle. The Kalloshaction is obtained in this case, with the correct BRST cohomology.
