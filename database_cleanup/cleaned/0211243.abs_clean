Title: Supersymmetry on the Surface S_2

Journal-ref: Mod.Phys.Lett. A17 (2002) 2545-2552

By using symplectic Majorana spinors as Grassmann coordinates in a superspaceassociated with the supersymmetric extension of the isometry group on thespherical surface S_2, it proves possible to formulate supersymmetric models onS_2 using superspace techniques.
