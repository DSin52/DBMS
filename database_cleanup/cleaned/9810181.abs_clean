Comments: 4 pages, LaTeX, PACS

6th International Conference on Path-Integrals from peV to TeV, 50 Years fromFeynman's Paper, Florence, Italy, 25-29 August 1998We study the unscreened Coulomb interaction in a one-dimensional electronsystem at low-energy. We use renormalization group methods and a GWapproximation, in order to analyze the model. This yields both a strongwavefunction renormalization and a renormalization of the Fermi velocity. Thesignificance of the effects depends on the filling level of the Fermi system.Despite the long-range character of the interaction, the system still fallsinto the Luttinger liquid universality class, since the effective couplingsremain bounded at arbitrarily low energies.
