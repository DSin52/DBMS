Joint Meeting of Chinese Physicists Worldwide, Hong Kong, August 2000The origin of fermion generations is one of the great mysteries in particlephysics. We consider here a possible solution within the Standard Modelframework based on a nonabelian generalization of electric-magnetic duality.First, nonabelian duality says that dual to the colour (electric) symmetrySU(3), there is a ``colour magnetic symmetry'' $\widetilde{SU}(3)$, which by aresult of 't~Hooft is spontaneously broken and can thus play the role of the"horizontal symmetry" of generations. Second, nonabelian duality suggests themanner this symmetry is broken with frame vectors in internal symmetry spaceacting as Higgs fields. As a result, mass matrices factorize leading to fermionmass hierarchy. A calculation to first order gives mixing (CKM and MNS)matrices in general agreement with experiment. In particular, quark mixing isseen naturally to be weak compared with leptons, while within the leptonsector, $\mu-\tau$ mixing turns out near maximal but $e-\tau$ mixing small,just as seen in recent $\nu$ oscillation experiments. In addition, the schemeleads to many testable predictions ranging from rare FCNC meson decays and$\mu-e$ conversion in nuclei to cosmic ray air showers above $10^{20}$ eV.
