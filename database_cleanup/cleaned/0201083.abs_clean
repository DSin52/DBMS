Title: Worldine deviations and epicycles

Authors: J.W. van Holten

Comments: Talk presented at the Journees Relativistes, Dublin (Ireland), sept.

2001In general relativity, only relative acceleration has an observer-independendworld lines of test bodies diverge or converge. We derive the equationsgoverning both in the conventional geometric formalism as well as using thebackground field method. This allows us to generalize the results to testbodies with charge and/or spin. The application of the equations to the motionof particles in a central field results in an elegant, fully relativisticversion of the Ptolemaean epicycle scheme.
