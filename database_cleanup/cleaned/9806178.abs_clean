We review the assumptions and the logic underlying the derivation of DLCQMatrix models. In particular we try to clarify what remains valid at finite$N$, the role of the non-renormalization theorems and higher order terms in thesupergravity expansion. The relation to Maldacena's conjecture is alsodiscussed. In particular the compactification of the Matrix model on $T_3$ iscompared to the $AdS_5\times S_5$ ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills duality, andthe different role of the branes in the two cases is pointed out.
