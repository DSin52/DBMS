We consider quantum mechanics on the noncommutative plane in the presence ofmagnetic field $B$. We show, that the model has two essentially differentphases separated by the point $B\theta=c\hbar^2/e$, where $\theta$ is aparameter of noncommutativity. In this point the system reduces toexactly-solvable one-dimensional system. When $\kappa=1-eB\theta/c\hbar^2<0$there is a finite number of states corresponding to the given value of theangular momentum. In another phase, i.e. when $\kappa>0$ the number of statesis infinite. The perturbative spectrum near the critical point $\kappa=0$ iscomputed.
