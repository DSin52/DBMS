We consider the one-loop effective action due to a spinor loop coupled to anabelian vector and axial vector field background. After rewriting thiseffective action in terms of an auxiliary non-abelian gauge connection, we usethe De Witt expansion to analyze both its anomalous and non-anomalous content.The same transformation allows us to obtain a novel worldline path integralrepresentation for this effective action which avoids the usual separation intothe real and imaginary parts of the Euclidean effective action, as well as theintroduction of auxiliary dimensions.
