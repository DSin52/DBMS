We consider the question which potentials in the action of a (1+1)dimensional scalar field theory allowing for spontaneous symmetry breaking havequantum fluctuations corresponding to reflectionless scattering data. Thegeneral problem of restoration from known scattering data is formulated and anumber of explicit examples is given. Only certain sets of reflectionlessscattering data correspond to symmetry breaking and all restored potentials aresimilar either to the Phi**4-model or to the sine-Gordon model.
