Title: Light-Front QCD

Comments: 44 pages, LATEX (including 4 ps-figures), uses epsfig.sty. Based on

and Non-Perturbative Aspects of QCD, Newton Institute, Cambridge, 23 June - 4July, 1997Light-front coordinates offer a scenario in which a constituent approximationof hadron structure can emerge from QCD. This requires cutoffs that violateLorentz covariance and gauge invariance, and a new renormalization groupformalism based on a similarity transformation is used with coupling coherenceto fix counterterms that restore these symmetries. The counterterms containfunctions of longitudinal momentum fractions which severely complicaterenormalization, but they also offer possible resolutions of apparentcontradictions between the constituent picture and QCD. The similaritytransformation and coupling coherence are applied to QED; and it is shown thatthe resultant Hamiltonian leads to the correct bound state results. The sametechniques are applied to QCD and it is shown that a simple confinementmechanism and a reasonable description of heavy quark bound states emergenaturally.
