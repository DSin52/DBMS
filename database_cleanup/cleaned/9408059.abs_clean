Title: On The Inhomogeneous Quantum Groups

Comments: Some references have been added

Using the multi-parametric deformation of the algebra of functions on $\GL{n+1} $ and the universal enveloping algebra $ \U{\igl{n+1}} $, we constructthe multi-parametric quantum groups $ \IGLq{n} $ and $ \Uq{\igl{n}} $.
