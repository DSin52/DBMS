Migdal and Kazakov have suggested that lattice QCD with an adjointrepresentation scalar in the infinite coupling limit could induce QCD.I find an exact saddlepoint of this theory for infinite $N$ in the case of aquadratic scalar potential. I discuss some aspects of this solution and alsoshow how the continuum D=1 matrix model with an arbitrary potential can bereproduced through this approach.
