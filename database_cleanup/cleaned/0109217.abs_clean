We find one explicit L^2 harmonic form for every Calabi manifold. Calabimanifolds are known to arise in low energy dynamics of solitons in Yang-Millstheories, and the L^2 harmonic form corresponds to the supersymmetric groundstate. As the normalizable ground state of a single U(N) instanton, it isrelated to the bound state of a single D0 to multiple coincident D4's in thenon-commutative setting, or equivalently a unit Kaluza-Klein mode in DLCQ offivebrane worldvolume theory. As the ground state of nonabelian masslessmonopoles realized around a monopole-``anti''-monopole pair, it shows how thelong range force between the pair is screened in a manner reminiscent of largeN behavior of quark-anti-quark potential found in AdS/CFT correspondence.
