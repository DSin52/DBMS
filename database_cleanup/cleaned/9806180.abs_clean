We discuss twisted states of AdS orbifolds which couple to N=2 chiral primaryoperators not invariant under exchange of the gauge factors. Kaluza-Kleinreduction on the fixed circle gives the correct conformal dimensions ofoperators in the superconformal theory and involves some aspects of monopoledynamics in the non-trivial background. As a byproduct we found evidence fordecoupling of U(1) factors in the four-dimensional gauge theory.
