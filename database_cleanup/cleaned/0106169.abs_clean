A new quantization scheme (WL-scheme), using world lines as objects ofquantization, is proposed. Applying to nonlinear scalar field, the WL -schemeis investigated and compared with the conventional PA-scheme of quantization.In the PA-scheme objects of quantization are particles and antiparticles, whichare fragments of the total physical object -- world line (WL). Applying to thenonlinear field, the PA-scheme of quantization leads to such difficulties asnonstationary vacuum, obligatory use of perturbation theory technique, normalordering and cut-off in the scattering problem. These difficulties arecorollaries of inconsistency of PA-scheme. The WL-scheme is free of thesedifficulties. These difficulties are connected with the reconstruction problemof the total world lines from their fragments (particles and antiparticles). Inthe case, when these fragments interact between themselves, such areconstruction is very complicated problem. The new WL-scheme of quantizationis free of all these problems, because it does not cut the total world lineinto fragments (particles and antiparticles). Formally appearance of fragmentsin the conventional quantization PA-scheme is a corollary of identification ofthe energy with the Hamiltonian. In fact such an identification is notnecessary. It leads only to difficulties. The new WL-scheme of quantizationdoes not use this identification and enables to go around all these problems.The WL-scheme enables not to use additional (to nonrelativistic QM)quantization rules, used in the relativistic QFT (normal ordering, perturbationtechnique, renormalization).
