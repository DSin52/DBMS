We present massive N=2 supergravity with SO(2)-gauging in nine-dimensions bydirect construction. A full lagrangian and transformation rules are fixed,respectively up to quartic and quadratic fermion terms. Corresponding to thegeneralized Scherk-Schwarz dimensional reduction utilizing SL(2,R) symmetry,this theory allows three arbitrary mass parameters m_0, m_1and m_2 in additionto the minimal gauge coupling g, so that our system has the most general formcompared with other results in the past. Unlike ordinary gauged maximalsupergravity theories in other dimensions, the scalar potential is positivedefinite for arbitrary values of the mass parameters. As an application, wealso analyze the stability and supersymmetry for 7-brane domain wall solutionsfor this gauged maximal supergravity, keeping the three mass parameters.
