In this paper properties of D branes in a nine dimensional asymmetricorbifold are discussed, using a $(-1)^{F_L}\sigma_{1/2}$ projection, where$F_L$ is the leftmoving space-time fermion number and $\sigma_{1/2}$ is afreely acting shift of order two. There are two types of non BPS D branes,which are stable at $R>2$ and $R<2$ respectively. At R=2 there is aperturbative enhancement of gauge symmetry and the two types of branes arerelated by a global bulk symmetry transformation. At this point in the modulispace the associated boundary states are constructed using a free fermionrepresentation of the theory. Some aspects of the enhancement of gauge symmetryin the S-dual type $\tilde I$ theory are discussed.
