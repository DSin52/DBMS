Title: Review of Open Superstring Field Theory

Comments: 17 pages latex

I review the construction of an action for open superstring field theorywhich does not suffer from the contact term problems of other approaches. Thisaction resembles a Wess-Zumino-Witten action and can be constructed in amanifestly D=4 super-Poincar\'e covariant manner. This review is based onlectures given at the ICTP Latin-American String School in Mexico City and theKomaba 2000 Workshop in Tokyo.
