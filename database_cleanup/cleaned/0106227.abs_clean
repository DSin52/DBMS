We study gravitating monopoles and non-abelian black holes of SU(2)Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory coupled to a massless dilaton. The domain ofexistence of these solutions decreases with increasing dilaton couplingconstant. The critical solutions of this system are Einstein-Maxwell-dilatonsolutions.
