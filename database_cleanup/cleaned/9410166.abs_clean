We describe the general framework for constructing collective--theoryHamiltonians whose hermicity requirements imply a Kac--Moody algebra ofconstraints on the associated Jacobian. We give explicit examples for thealgebras $sl(2)_k$ and $sl(3)_k$. The reduction to $W_n$--constraints, relevantto $n$-matrix models, is described for the Jacobians.
