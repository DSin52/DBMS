An exact superpotential is derived for the N=1 theories which arise asmassive deformations of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory. Thesuperpotential of the SU(N) theory formulated on R^{3}\times S^{1} is shown tocoincide with the complexified potential of the N-body elliptic Calogero-MoserHamiltonian. This superpotential reproduces the vacuum structure predicted byDonagi and Witten for the corresponding four-dimensional theory and alsotransforms covariantly under the S-duality group of N=4 SYM. The analysisyields exact formulae with interesting modular properties for the condensatesof gauge-invariant chiral operators in the four-dimensional theory.
