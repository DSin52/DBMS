A bicovariant calculus of differential operators on a quantum group isconstructed in a natural way, using invariant maps from \fun\ to \uqg\ , givenby elements of the pure braid group. These operators --- the `reflectionmatrix' $Y \equiv L^+ SL^-$ being a special case --- generate algebras thatlinearly close under adjoint actions, i.e. they form generalized Lie algebras.We establish the connection between the Hopf algebra formulation of thecalculus and a formulation in compact matrix form which is quite powerful foractual computations and as applications we find the quantum determinant and anorthogonality relation for $Y$ in $SO_q(N)$.
