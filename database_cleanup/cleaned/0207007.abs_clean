The Atiyah-Singer index theorem is investigated on various compact manifoldswhich admit finite matrix approximations (``fuzzy spaces'') with a view toapplications in a modified Kaluza-Klein type approach in which the internalspace consists of a finite number of points. Motivated by the chiral nature ofthe standard model spectrum we investigate manifolds that do not admit spinorsbut do admit $Spin^c$ structures. It is shown that, by twisting withappropriate bundles, one generation of the electroweak sector of the standardmodel, including a right-handed neutrino, can be obtained in this way from thecomplex projective space $\CP^2$. The unitary Grassmannian $U(5)/(U(3)\timesU(2))$ yields a spectrum that contains the correct charges for the Fermions ofthe standard model, with varying multiplicities for the different particlestates.
