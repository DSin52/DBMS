In the spirit of the quantum Hamiltonian reduction we establish a relationbetween the chiral $n$-point functions, as well as the equations governingthem, of the $A_1^{(1)}$ WZNW conformal theory and the corresponding Virasorominimal models. The WZNW correlators are described as solutions of the Knizhnikexploited are certain relations in twisted cohomology. The results extend toarbitrary level $k+2 \neq 0$ and isospin values of the type $J=j-j'(k+2)$, $ \2j, 2j' \in Z\!\!\!Z_+$.
