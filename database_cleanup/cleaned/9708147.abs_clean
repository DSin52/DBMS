We use the abelian Born-Infeld action for the worldvolume gauge field andtransverse displacement scalars to explore new aspects of D-brane structure anddynamics. We study several classic gauge field configurations, including pointcharges in any worldvolume dimension and vortices in two worldvolumedimensions, and show that, with an appropriate excitation of the transversecoordinate field, they are BPS-saturated solutions. The Coulomb point chargesolutions turn out to represent, with considerable fidelity, fundamentalstrings attached to the brane (their magnetic counterparts describe D1-branesattached to D3-branes). We also show that S-matrix for small excitationspropagating on the point charge solution is consistent with (and gives furtherilluminating information about) Polchinski's effective open string boundarycondition.
