We use a D-instanton or physical gauge approach to re-derive the heteroticstring worldsheet instanton contribution to the superpotential in Calabi-Yaucompactification. We derive an analogous formula for worldsheet instantoncorrections to the moduli space metric in heterotic string or Type Icompactification on a K3 surface. In addition, we give a global analysis of thephase of the worldsheet path integral of the heterotic string, showingprecisely how the B-field must be interpreted.
