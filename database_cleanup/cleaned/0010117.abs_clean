We perform a general analysis of representations of the superconformalalgebras OSp(8/4,R) and OSp(8*/2N) in harmonic superspace. We present aconstruction of their highest-weight UIR's by multiplication of the differenttypes of massless conformal superfields ("supersingletons"). In particular, all"short multiplets" are classified. Representations undergoing shortening have"protected dimension" and may correspond to BPS states in the dual supergravitytheory in anti-de Sitter space. These results are relevant for theclassification of multitrace operators in boundary conformally invarianttheories as well as for the classification of AdS black holes preservingdifferent fractions of supersymmetry.
