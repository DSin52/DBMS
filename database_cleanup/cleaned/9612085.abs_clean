We study limits of four-dimensional type II Calabi-Yau compactificationswith vanishing four-cycle singularities, which are dual to $\IT^2$compactifications of the six-dimensional non-critical string with $E_8$symmetry. We define proper subsectors of the full string theory, which can beconsistently decoupled. In this way we obtain rigid effective theories thathave an intrinsically stringy BPS spectrum. Geometrically the moduli spacescorrespond to special geometry of certain non-compact Calabi-Yau spaces of anintriguing form. An equivalent description can be given in terms ofSeiberg-Witten curves, given by the elliptic simple singularities together witha peculiar choice of meromorphic differentials. We speculate that the modulispaces describe non-perturbative non-critical string theories.
