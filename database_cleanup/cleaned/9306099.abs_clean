In this paper we study the quantum Clifford-Hopf algebras $\widehat{CH_q(D)}$for even dimensions $D$ and obtain their intertwiner $R-$matrices, which areelliptic solutions to the Yang- Baxter equation. In the trigonometric limit ofthese new algebras we find the possibility to connect with extendedsupersymmetry. We also analyze the corresponding spin chain hamiltonian, whichleads to Suzuki's generalized $XY$ model.
