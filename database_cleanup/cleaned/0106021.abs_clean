The physics that is traditionally formulated in one--time-physics(1T-physics) can also be formulated in two-time-physics (2T-physics). Thephysical phenomena in 1T or 2T physics are not different, but the spacetimeformalism used to describe them is. The 2T description involves two extradimensions (one time and one space), is more symmetric, and makes manifest manyhidden features of 1T-physics. One such hidden feature is that families ofapparently different 1T-dynamical systems in d dimensions holographicallydescribe the same 2T system in d+2 dimensions. In 2T-physics there are twotimelike dimensions, but there is also a crucial gauge symmetry that thins outspacetime, thus making 2T-physics effectively equivalent to 1T-physics. Thegauge symmetry is also responsible for ensuring causality and unitarity in aspacetime with two timelike dimensions. What is gained through 2T-physics is aunification of diverse 1T dynamics by making manifest hidden symmetries andrelationships among them. Such symmetries and relationships is the evidence forthe presence of the underlying higher dimensional spacetime structure.2T-physics could be viewed as a device for gaining a better understanding of1T-physics, but beyond this, 2T-physics offers new vistas in the search of theunified theory while raising deep questions about the meaning of spacetime. Inthese lectures, the recent developments in the powerful gauge field theoryformulation of 2T-physics will be described after a brief review of the resultsobtained so far in the more intuitive worldline approach.
