In an abelian topologically massive gauge theory, any eigenstate ofthe Hamiltonian can be decomposed into a factor describing massivepropagating gauge bosons and a Chern-Simons wave function describinga set of nonpropagating ``topological'' excitations.  The energydepends only on the propagating modes, and energy eigenstates thusoccur with a degeneracy that can be parametrized by the Hilbertspace of the pure Chern-Simons theory.  We show that for a{\em nonabelian} topologically massive gauge theory, this degeneracya similar factorization, the Hamiltonian couples the propagating  andnonpropagating (topological) modes.
