We study aspects of superstring vacua of non-compact special holonomymanifolds with conical singularities constructed systematically using soluble N= 1 superconformal field theories (SCFT's). It is known that Einsteinhomogeneous spaces G/H generate Ricci flat manifolds with special holonomies ontheir cones R_+ x G/H, when they are endowed with appropriate geometricalstructures, namely, the Sasaki-Einstein, tri-Sasakian, nearly Kahler, and weakG_2 structures for SU(n), Sp(n), G_2, and Spin(7) holonomies, respectively.(N = 1 Liouville) x (N=1 supercoset CFT on G/H) where we use the affine Liealgebras of G and H in order to capture the geometry associated to an Einsteinhomogeneous space G/H. Remarkably, we find the same number of spacetime andworldsheet SUSY's in our ``CFT cone'' construction as expected from theanalysis of geometrical cones over G/H in many examples. We also present ananalysis on the possible Liouville potential terms (cosmological constant typeoperators) which provide the marginal deformations resolving the conicalsingularities.
