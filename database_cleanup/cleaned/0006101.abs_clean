We calculate the scalar potential of supersymmetric QCD (in the regime N_f <N_c) coupled to N=1 supergravity with moduli-dependent gauge kinetic functionand masses. The gauge dynamics are described by theTaylor-Veneziano-Yankielowicz superpotential for composite effective fields.The potential can be expanded about the ``truncated'' point in the gaugino andmatter condensate directions in order to find corrections to the globallysupersymmetric minimum. The results are relevant to the phenomenology ofsupersymmetry-breaking in string-inspired supergravity models, and also torecent work on domain walls in SQCD.
