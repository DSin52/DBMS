addedWe study the topological properties of fuzzy sphere. We show that thetopological charge is only defined modulo N+1, that is finite integer quotientZ_{N+1}, where N is a cut-off spin of fuzzy sphere. This periodic structure ontopological charges is shown based on the boson realizations of SU(2) algebra,Schwinger vs. Holstein-Primakoff. We argue that this result can have a naturalK-theory interpretation and the topological charges on fuzzy sphere can beclassified by the twisted K-theory. We also outline how solitons on fuzzysphere can realize D-brane solitons in the presence of Neveu-Schwarz fivebranesproposed by Harvey and Moore.
