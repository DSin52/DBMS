We introduce two simple models which feature an Alice electrodynamics phase.In a well defined sense the Alice flux solutions we obtain in these models obeyfirst order equations similar to those of the Nielsen-Olesen fluxtube in theabelian higgs model in the Bogomol'nyi limit. Some numerical solutions arepresented as well.
