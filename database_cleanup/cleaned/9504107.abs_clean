The restricted SOS model of Andrews, Baxter and Forrester has been studied.The finite size corrections to the eigenvalue spectra of the transfer matrix ofthe model with a more general crossing parameter have been calculated.Therefore the conformal weights and the central charges of the non-unitary orunitary minimal conformal field have been extracted from the finite sizecorrections.
