We find explicitly the induced graviton propagator on de Sitter branesembedded in various five-dimensional spacetimes; de Sitter branes in AdS andMinkowski space are particular cases. By studying the structure of themomentum-space propagator, we are able to extract interesting physics, much ofwhich is qualitatively different from that of flat branes. We find that 1)there can be a set of graviton-like particles which mediate brane gravity atdifferent scales; 2) localized gravity can exist even on de Sitter branes inMinkowski space; 3) Kaluza-Klein modes also contribute to conventional 4-Dgravity for de Sitter branes in AdS; and 4) Newton's constant can varyconsiderably with scale. We comment on the implications for the effectivecosmological constant.
