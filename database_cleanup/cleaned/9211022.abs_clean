Usually in quantum mechanics the Heisenberg algebra is generated by operatorsof position and momentum. The algebra is then represented on an Hilbert spaceof square integrable functions. Alternatively one generates the Heisenbergalgebra by the raising and lowering operators. It is then natural to representit on the Bargmann Fock space of holomorphic functions. In the following I showthat the Bargmann Fock construction can also be done in the quantum groupsymmetric case. This leads to a 'q- deformed quantum mechanics' in which thebasic concepts, Hilbert space of states and unitarity of time evolution, arepreserved.
