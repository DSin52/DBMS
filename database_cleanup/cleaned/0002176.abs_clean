We study the possible BPS domain wall junction configurations for generalpolynomial superpotentials of N=1 supersymmetric Wess-Zumino models in D=4. Wescan the parameter space of the superpotential and find different possible BPSstates for different values of the deformation parameters and present ourresults graphically. We comment on the domain walls in F/M/IIA theoriesobtained from the Calabi-Yau fourfolds with isolated singularities and abackground flux.
