We consider the $AdS_5$ solution deformed by a non-constant dilatoninterpolating between the standard AdS (UV region) and flat boundary background(IR region). We show that this dilatonic solution can be generalized to thecase of a non-flat boundaries provided that the metric of the boundariessatisfies the vacuum Einstein field equations. As an example, we describe thecase when the four-dimensional boundaries represent the Kerr space-time.
