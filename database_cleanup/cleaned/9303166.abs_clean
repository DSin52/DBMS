We propose a regular way to construct lattice versions of $W$-algebras, bothfor quantum and classical cases. In the classical case we write the algebraexplicitly and derive the lattice analogue of Boussinesq equation from theHamiltonian equations of motion. Connection between the latticeFaddeev-Takhtadjan-Volkov algebra [1] and q-deformed Virasoro is alsodiscussed.
