Type I string theory provides eight classes of unstable D-brane systems. Wedetermine the gauge group and tachyon spectrum for each one, and therebydescribe the gauge symmetry breaking pattern in the low-energy world-volumefield theory. The topologies of the resulting coset vacuum manifolds arerelated to the real K-theory groups KO^{-n}, extending the known relationsbetween the Type II classifying spaces BU and U and the complex K-theory groupsK^0 and K^{-1}. We also comment on the role of the background D9-branes.
