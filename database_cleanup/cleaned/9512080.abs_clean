We derive a worldline path integral representation for the effective actionof a multiplet of Dirac fermions coupled to the most general set ofmatrix-valued scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial vector and antisymmetrictensor background fields. By representing internal degrees of freedom in termsof worldline fermions as well, we obtain a formulation which manifestlyexhibits chiral gauge invariance.
