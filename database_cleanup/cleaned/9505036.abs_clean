Using the effective potential, the large-$N$ nonlinear $O(N)$ sigma modelwith the curvature coupled term is studied on $S^2\times R^1$. We show that,for the conformally coupled case, the dynamical mass generation of the model inthe strong-coupled regime on $R^3$ takes place for any finite scalar curvature(or radius of the $S^2$). If the coupling constant is larger than that of theconformally coupled case, there exist a critical curvature (radius) above(below) which the dynamical mass generation does not take place even in thestrong-coupled regime. Below the critical curvature, the mass generation occursas in the model on $R^3$.
