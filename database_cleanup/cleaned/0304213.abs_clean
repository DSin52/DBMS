Title: Tachyon condensation in open-closed p-adic string theory

Authors: Nicolas Moeller and Martin Schnabl

Comments: 20 pages, 3 figures

We study a simple model of p-adic closed and open strings. It sheds somelight on the dynamics of tachyon condensation for both types of strings. Wecalculate the effect of static and decaying D-brane configurations on theclosed string background. For closed string tachyons we find lumps analogous toD-branes. By studying their fluctuation spectrum and the D-branes they admit,we argue that closed string lumps should be interpreted as spacetimes of lowerdimensionality described by some noncritical p-adic string theory.
