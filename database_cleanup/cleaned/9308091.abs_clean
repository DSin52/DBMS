We present the results of an extension of our previous work on large-scalesimulations of dynamically triangulated toroidal random surfaces embedded in$R^3$ with extrinsic curvature. We find that the extrinsic-curvature specificheat peak ceases to grow on lattices with more than 576 nodes and that thelocation of the peak $\lam_c$ also stabilizes. The evidence for a truecrumpling transition is still weak. If we assume it exists we can say that thefinite-size scaling exponent $\frac {\alpha} {\nu d}$ is very close to zero ornegative. On the other hand our new data does rule out the observed peak asbeing a finite-size artifact of the persistence length becoming comparable tothe extent of the lattice.
