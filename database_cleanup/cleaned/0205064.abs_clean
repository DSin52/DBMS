In the context of gauge/gravity duality, we try to understand better theproposed duality between the fractional D2-brane supergravity solutions of(Nucl. Phys. B 606 (2001) 18, hep-th/0101096) and a confining 2+1 dimensionalgauge theory. Based on the similarities between this fractional D2-branesolution and D3-brane supergravity solutions with more firmly established gaugetheory duals, we conjecture that a confining q-string in the 2+1 dimensionalgauge theory is dual to a wrapped D4-brane. In particular, the D4-brane lookslike a string in the gauge theory directions but wraps a S**3 in S**4 in thetransverse geometry. For one of the supergravity solutions, we find a nearwe conjecture that the gauge theory dual is SU(N) far in the infrared. We alsoconjecture that a quadratic or near quadratic scaling is a generic feature ofconfining 2+1 dimensional SU(N) gauge theories.
