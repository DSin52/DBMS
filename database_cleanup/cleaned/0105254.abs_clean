The OPE of two N=2 R-symmetry current (short) multiplets is determined by thepossible superspace three-point functions that two such multiplets can formwith a third, a priori long multiplet. We show that the shortness conditions onthe former put strong restrictions on the quantum numbers of the latter. Inparticular, no anomalous dimension is allowed unless the third supermultipletis an R-symmetry singlet. This phenomenon should explain many knownnon-renormalization properties of correlation functions, including the one offour stress-tensor multiplets in N=4 SYM_4.
