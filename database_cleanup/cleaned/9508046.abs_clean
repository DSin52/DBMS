Title: N=1 Heterotic-Supergravity Duality and Joyce Manifolds

Comments: Minor Latex Error Corrected, 7 pages, Latex file

We construct the heterotic dual theory in four dimensions of elevendimensional supergravity compactified on a particular Joyce manifold, $J$. Inparticular, $J$ is constructed from resolving fixed point singularities oforbifolds of the seven torus in such a way that one is forced to consider ageneralised orbifold on the heterotic side. We conjecture that a heterotic dualexists for all the compact 7-manifolds of $G_{2}$ holonomy constructed byJoyce.
