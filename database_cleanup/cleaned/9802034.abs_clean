String configurations have been identified in compactified Matrix theory atvanishing string coupling. We show how the interactions of these strings aredetermined by the Yang-Mills gauge field on the worldsheet. At finite stringcoupling, this suggests the underlying dynamics is not well-approximated as atheory of strings. This may explain why string perturbation theory divergesbadly, while Matrix string perturbation theory presumably has a perturbativeexpansion with properties similar to the strong coupling expansion of 2dYang-Mills theory.
