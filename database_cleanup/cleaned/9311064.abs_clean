We study a model of quantum Yang-Mills theory with a finite number of gaugeinvariant degrees of freedom. The gauge field has only a finite number ofdegrees of freedom since we assume that space-time is a two dimensionalcylinder. We couple the gauge field to matter, modeled by either one or twononrelativistic point particles. These problems can be solved {\it without anygauge fixing}, by generalizing the canonical quantization methods ofRef.\[rajeev] to the case including matter. For this, we make use of thegeometry of the space of connections, which has the structure of a PrincipalFiber Bundle with an infinite dimensional fiber. We are able to reduce bothproblems to finite dimensional, exactly solvable, quantum mechanics problems.In the case of one particle, we find that the ground state energy will divergein the limit of infinite radius of space, consistent with confinement. In thecase of two particles, this does not happen if they can form a color singletbound state (`meson').
