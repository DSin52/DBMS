(Pushkin, St.Petersburg, Russia, May 14-21, 2000), published by Institute forNuclear Research, Moscow, 2002, pp.263-270The renormalization-group functions of the two-dimensional n-vector \lambda\phi^4 model are calculated in the five-loop approximation. Perturbative seriesfor the \beta-function and critical exponents are resummed by thePade-Borel-Leroy techniques. An account for the five-loop term shifts theWilson fixed point location only briefly, leaving it outside the segment formedby the results of the lattice calculations. This is argued to reflect theinfluence of the non-analytical contribution to the \beta-function. Theevaluation of the critical exponents for n = 1, n = 0 and n = -1 in thefive-loop approximation and comparison of the results with known exact valuesconfirm the conclusion that non-analytical contributions are visible in twodimensions. For the 2D Ising model, the estimate \omega = 1.31 for thecorrection-to-scaling exponent is found.
