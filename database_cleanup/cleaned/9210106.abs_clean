A topological procedure for computing correlation functions for any (1,q)model is presented. Our procedure can be used to compute any correlationfunction on the sphere as well as some correlation functions at higher genus.We derive new and simpler recursion relations that extend previously knownresults based on W constraints. In addition, we compute an effective contactalgebra with multiple contacts that extends Verlindes' algebra. Computationaltechniques based on the KdV approach are developed and used to compute the samecorrelation functions. A simple and elegant proof of the puncture equationderived directly from the KdV equations is included. We hope that this approachcan lead to a deeper understanding of D=1 quantum gravity and non-criticalstring theory.
