We present a solvable model of two-dimensional dilaton-gravity coupled to amassless scalar field. We locally integrate the field equations and brieflydiscuss the properties of the solutions. For a particular choice of thecoupling between the dilaton and the scalar field the model can be interpretedas the two-dimensional effective theory of 2+1 cylindrical gravity minimallycoupled to a massless scalar field.
