We study a class of near-BPS operators for a complex 2-parameter family ofN=1 superconformal Yang-Mills theories that can be obtained by aLeigh-Strassler deformation of N=4 SYM theory. We identify these operators inthe large N and large R-charge limit and compute their exact scaling dimensionsusing N=1 superspace methods. From these scaling dimensions we attempt toreverse-engineer the light-cone worldsheet theory that describes stringpropagation on the Penrose limit of the dual geometry.
