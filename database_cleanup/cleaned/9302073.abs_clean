This paper is devoted to the exploration of some of the geometrical issuesraised by the $N=2$ superstring. We begin by reviewing the reasons that$\beta$-functions for the $N=2$ superstring require it to live in afour-dimensional self-dual spacetime of signature $(--++)$, together with someof the arguments as to why the only degree of freedom in the theory is thatdescribed by the gravitational field. We then move on to describe at length thegeometry of flat space, and how a real version of twistor theory is relevant toit. We then describe some of the more complicated spacetimes that satisfy the$\beta$-function equations. Finally we speculate on the deeper significance ofsome of these spacetimes.
