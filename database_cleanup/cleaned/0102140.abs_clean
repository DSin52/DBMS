The constraints of the superfield method in two-dimensional supergravity areadapted to allow for nonvanishing bosonic torsion. As the analysis of theBianchi identities reveals, a new vector superfield is encountered besides thewell-known scalar one. The constraints are solved both with superfields using aspecial decomposition of the supervielbein, and explicitly in terms ofcomponent fields in a Wess-Zumino gauge. The graded Poisson Sigma Model (gPSM)is the alternative method used to construct supersymmetric gravity theories. Inthis context the graded Jacobi identity is solved algebraically for generalcases. Some of the Poisson algebras obtained are singular, or severalpotentials contained in them are restricted. This is discussed for a selectionof representative algebras. It is found, that the gPSM is far more flexible andit shows the inherent ambiguity of the supersymmetric extension more clearlythan the superfield method. Among the various models spherically reducedEinstein gravity and gravity with torsion are treated. Also the Legendretransformation to eliminate auxiliary fields, superdilaton theories and theexplicit solution of the gPSM equations of motion for a typical model arepresented. Furthermore, the PSM field equations are analyzed in detail, leadingto the so called "symplectic extension". Thereby, the Poisson tensor isextended to become regular by adding new coordinates to the target space. Forgravity models this is achieved with one additional coordinate. Finally, therelation of the gPSM to the superfield method is established by extending thebase manifold to become a supermanifold.
