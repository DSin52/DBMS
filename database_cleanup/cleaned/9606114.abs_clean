The algebra of non-commutative differential geometry (NCG) on the discretespace $M_4\times Z\ma{N}$ previously proposed by the present author is improvedto give the consistent explanation of the generalized gauge field as thegeneralized connection on $M_4\times Z\ma{N}$. The nilpotency of thegeneralized exterior derivative ${\mbf d}$ is easily proved. The matrixformulation where the generalized gauge field is denoted in matrix form isshown to have the same content with the ordinary formulation using {\mbf d},which helps us understand the implications of the algebraic rules of NCG on$M_4\times Z\ma{N}$. The Lagrangian of spontaneously broken gauge theory whichhas the extra restriction on the coupling constant of the Higgs potential isobtained by taking the inner product of the generalized field strength. Thecovariant derivative operating on the fermion field determines the paralleltransformation on $M_4\times Z\ma{N}$, which confirms that the Higgs field isthe connection on the discrete space. This implies that the Higgs particle is agauge particle on the same footing as the weak bosons. Thus, it is expectedthat the mass relation $m\ma{H}=\frac{4}{\sqrt{3}}m\ma{W}\sin\theta\ma{W}$proposed by the present author holds without any correction in the same way asthe mass relation $m\ma{W}=m\ma{Z}\cos\theta\ma{W}$. The Higgs kinetic andpotential terms are regarded as the curvatures on $M_4\times Z\ma{N}$.
