2935-2938Two canonical formulations of the Einstein gravity in 2+1 dimensions, namely,the ADM formalism and the Chern-Simons gravity, are investigated in the case ofnonvanishing cosmological constant. General arguments for reducing phase spacesof the two formalisms are given when spatial hypersurface is compact. Inparticular when the space has the topology of a sphere $S^{2}$ or a torus$T^{2}$, the spacetimes constructed from these two formulations can beidentified and the classical equivalence between the ADM and the CSG is shown.Moreover in the $g=1$ case the relations between their phase spaces, andtherefore between their quantizations, are given in almost the same form asthat in the case when the cosmological constant vanishes. There are, however,some modifications, the most remarkable one of which is that the phase space ofthe CSG is in 1 to 2 correspondence with the one of the ADM when thecosmological constant is negative.
