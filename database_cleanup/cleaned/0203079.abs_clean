We encode dynamical symmetries of Born-Infeld theory in a geometry on thetangent bundle of generally curved spacetime manifolds. The resulting covariantformulation of a maximal acceleration extension of special and generalrelativity is put to use in the discussion of particular point particledynamics and the transition to a first quantized theory.
