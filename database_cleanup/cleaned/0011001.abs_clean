Using the Vafa-Witten twisted version of N=4 Super Yang-Mills a subset of thesupercharges actually relevant for the nonrenormalization properties of thetheory is identified. In particular, a relationship between the gauge-fixedaction and the chiral primary operator tr(\phi)^2 is worked out. This resultcan be understood as an off-shell extension of the reduction formula introducedby Intriligator.
