Title: A Lagrangian Formulation of 2-Dimensional Topological Gravity and

\v{C}ech-De-Rham CohomologyComments: 18 pages, plain Tex, based on talks given by C.M. Becchi at the

``International Symposium on BRS Symmetry on the Occasion of its 20thAnniversary'', RIMS-Kyoto University, September 18-22, 1995, and at theMeeting of the EEC network on ``Gauge theories, Applied Supersymmetry andQuantum Gravity'', Leuven, July 1995We present a very simplified analysis of how one can overcome the Gribovproblem in a non-abelian gauge theory. Our formulae, albeit quite simplified,show that possible breakdowns of the Slavnov-Taylor identity could in principlecome from singularities in space of gauge orbits. To test these ideas weexhibit the calculation of a very simple correlation function of 2-dimensionaltopological gravity and we show how in this model the singularities of themoduli space induce a breakdown of the Slavnov-Taylor identity. We comment onthe technical relevance of the possibility of including the singularities intoa finite number of cells of the moduli space.
