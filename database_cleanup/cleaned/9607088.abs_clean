The two flavour, four dimensional WZW model coupled to electromagnetism, istreated as a constraint system in the context of the Faddeev-Jackiw approach.No approximation is made. Detailed exposition of the calculations is given.Solution of the constraints followed by proper Darboux's transformations leadsto an unconstrained Coulomb-gauge Lagrangian density.
