Title: Gluon condensate and the vacuum structure of QCD

Interdisciplinar, Univ. de Lisboa, Portugal)Comments: 12 pages Latex

Phenomenological evidence and analytic approximations to the QCD ground statesuggest a complex gluon condensate structure. Exclusion of elementary fermionexcitations by the generation of infinite mass corrections is a consequence. Inaddition the existence of vacuum condensates in unbroken non-abelian gaugetheories, endows SU(3) and higher order groups with a non-trivial structure inthe manifold of possible vacuum solutions, which is not present in SU(2). Thismay be related to the existence of particle generations.
