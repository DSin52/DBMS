Boundary states corresponding to wrapped D-branes in Calabi-Yaucompactifications of type II strings are discussed using Gepner models. Inparticular boundary conditions corresponding to D-0 branes and D-instantons infour dimensions are investigated. The boundary states constructed by Recknageland Schomerus are analyzed in the light-cone gauge and the broken and conservedspace-time supersymmetry charges are found. The geometrical interpretation ofthese algebraically constructed boundary states is clarified in some simplecases. Moreover, the action of mirror symmetry and other discrete symmetries ofthe Gepner model on the boundary states are discussed. As an application theboundary states are used to calculate instanton induced corrections to metricon the hypermultiplets in the N=2 effective action.
