Title: On a Model of the $\pi^+$ Meson

Authors: Sze Kui Ng

Comments: 17 pages, 6 figures

In this paper we propose a model of the $\pi$ mesons. In this model we givethe formation of the $\pi^+$ meson by strong interaction and the decay of the$\pi^+$ meson to the moun $\mu^+$ and the moun neutrino $\nu_{\mu}$ by weakinteraction. We give a mass machanism for the generation of the masses of the$\pi^0$ meson, $\pi^+$ meson, the moun $\mu^+$ and the moun neutrino$\nu_{\mu}$.
