Vacuum structures of supersymmetric (SUSY) Yang-Mills theories in $1+1$dimensions are studied with the spatial direction compactified. SUSY allowsonly periodic boundary conditions for both fermions and bosons. By using theBorn-Oppenheimer approximation for the weak coupling limit, we find that thevacuum energy vanishes, and hence the SUSY is unbroken. Other boundaryconditions are also studied, especially the antiperiodic boundary condition forfermions which is related to the system in finite temperatures. In that case wefind for gaugino bilinears a nonvanishing vacuum condensation which indicatesinstanton contributions.
