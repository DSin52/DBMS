We consider some questions of naturalness which arise when one considersglobal symmetries, the strong CP problem, and the cosmological constantproblem. Using string theory as a model, we argue that it is reasonable topostulate weakly broken global discrete symmetries. We review the argumentsthat gravity is likely to spoil the Peccei-Quinn solution of the strong CPproblem, and update earlier analyses showing that discrete symmetries can leadto axions with suitable properties. Even if there are not suitable axions, wenote that string theory is a theory in which CP is spontaneously broken and$\theta$ in principle calculable. $\theta$ thus might turn out to be smallalong lines suggested some time ago by Nelson and by Barr.
