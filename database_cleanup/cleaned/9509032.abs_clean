We review our new method, which might be the most direct and efficient wayfor approaching the continuum physics from Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. Itconsists of solving the eigenvalue equation with a truncation scheme preservingthe continuum limit. The efficiency has been confirmed by the observations ofthe scaling behaviors for the long wavelength vacuum wave functions and massgaps in (2+1)-dimensional models and (1+1)-dimensional $\sigma$ model even atvery low truncation orders. Most of these results show rapid convergence to theavailable Monte Carlo data, ensuring the reliability of our method.
