An (m, n)-string bound state (with m, n relatively prime integers) in typeIIB string theory can be interpreted from the D-string worldsheet point of viewas n D-strings carrying m units of quantized electric flux or quantizedelectric field. We argue, from the D-brane worldvolume point of view, thatsimilar Dp-brane bound states should also exist for $2 \le p \le 8$ in bothtype IIA (when $p$ is even) and type IIB (when $p$ is odd) string theories. Asin $p = 1$ case, these bound states can each be interpreted as $n$ Dp-branescarrying m units of quantized constant electric field. In particular, they allpreserve one half of the spacetime supersymmetries.
