We show that it is possible to formulate a gauge theory starting from a localaction at the ultraviolet (UV) momentum cutoff which is BRS invariant. One hasto require that fields in the UV action and the fields in the effective actionare not the same but related by a local field transformation. The few relevantparameters involved in this transformation (six for the $SU(2)$ gauge theory),are perturbatively fixed by the gauge symmetry.
