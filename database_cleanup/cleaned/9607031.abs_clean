1520-1529In this paper we explicitly prove that Integrable System solved by QuantumInverse Scattering Method can be described with the pure algebraic object(Universal R-matrix) and proper algebraic representations. Namely, on theexample of the Quantum Volterra model we construct L-operator and fundamentalR--matrix from universal R--matrix for Quantum Affine $U_q(\widehat{sl}_2)$Algebra and q-oscillator representation for it. In this way there exists anequivalence between the Integrable System with symmetry algebra A and therepresentation of this algebra.
