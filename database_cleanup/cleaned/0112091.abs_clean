Title: Supersymmetric Harmonic Maps into Lie Groups

Authors: F. O'Dea (University of Texas at Austin)

Comments: LaTeX 2.09 using revtex.sty

We look at the supersymmetric generalization of harmonic maps into Liegroups, known to physicists as the chiral model. Explicit solutions to theequations are found and examined using Backlund transformations.
