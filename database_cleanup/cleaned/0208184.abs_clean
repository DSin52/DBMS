The action for a non-BPS p=2 brane embedded in a flat N=1, D=4 targetsuperspace is obtained through the method of nonlinear realizations of theassociated super-Poincare symmetries. The brane excitation modes correspond tothe Nambu-Goldstone degrees of freedom resulting from the broken spacetranslational symmetry and the target space supersymmetries. The action forthis p=2 brane is found to be an invariant synthesis of the Akulov-Volkov andNambu-Goto actions. The dual D2-brane Born-Infeld action is derived. Theinvariant coupling of matter fields localized on the brane to theNambu-Goldstone modes is also obtained.
