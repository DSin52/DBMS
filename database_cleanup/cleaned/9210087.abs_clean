Comments: 4 pages

We compute explicitly the Schr\"odinger picture space of states of SU(2)Chern-Simons theory on $T^2\times R$ in the presence of temporal Wilson lines.Relation with Friedan-Shenker bundle of conformal field theory and theexistence of a projective flat connection on this bundle is discussed.
