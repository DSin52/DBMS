and C.J. Burden, World Scientific, (Singapore 1995) , 26-128A four part series of lectures on the connection of statistical mechanics andquantum field theory. The general principles relating statistical mechanics andthe path integral formulation of quantum field theory are presented in thefirst lecture. These principles are then illustrated in lecture 2 by apresentation of the theory of the Ising model for $H=0$, where both thehomogeneous and randomly inhomogeneous models are treated and the scalingtheory and the relation with Fredholm determinants and Painlev{\'e} equationsis presented. In lecture 3 we consider the Ising model with $H\neq 0$, wherethe relation with gauge theory is used to discuss the phenomenon ofconfinement. We conclude in the last lecture with a discussion of quantum spindiffusion in one dimensional chains and a presentation of the chiral Pottsmodel which illustrates the physical effects that can occur when the Euclideanand Minkowski regions are not connected by an analytic continuation.
