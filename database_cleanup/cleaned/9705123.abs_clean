The classical action for pure Yang--Mills gauge theory can be formulated as adeformation of the topological $BF$ theory where, beside the two-form field$B$, one has to add one extra-field $\eta$ given by a one-form which transformsas the difference of two connections. The ensuing action functional gives atheory that is both classically and quantistically equivalent to the originalYang--Mills theory. In order to prove such an equivalence, it is shown that thedependency on the field $\eta$ can be gauged away completely. This gives riseto a field theory that, for this reason, can be considered as semi-topologicalor topological in some but not all the fields of the theory. The symmetry groupinvolved in this theory is an affine extension of the tangent gauge groupacting on the tangent bundle of the space of connections. A mathematicalanalysis of this group action and of the relevant BRST complex is discussed indetails.
