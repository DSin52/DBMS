We consider the propagation of perturbations along an infinitely longstationary open string in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole. Theequations of motion for the perturbations in the 2 transverse physicaldirections are solved to second order in a weak field expansion. We then set upa scattering formalism where an ingoing wave is partly transmitted and partlyreflected due to the interaction with the gravitational field of the blackhole. We finally calculate the reflection coefficient to third order in ourweak field expansion.
