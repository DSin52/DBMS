The Hopf term in the $2 + 1$ dimensional O(3) nonlinear sigma model, which isknown to be responsible for fractional spin and statistics, is re-examined fromthe viewpoint of quantization ambiguity. It is confirmed that the Hopf term canbe understood as a term induced quantum mechanically, in precisely the samemanner as the $\theta$-term in QCD. We present a detailed analysis of thetopological aspect of the model based on the adjoint orbit parametrization ofthe spin vectors, which is not only very useful in handling topological(soliton and/or Hopf) numbers, but also plays a crucial role in defining theHopf term for configurations of nonvanishing soliton numbers. The Hopf term isseen to arise explicitly as a quantum effect which emerges when quantizing an$S^1$ degree of freedom hidden in the configuration space.
