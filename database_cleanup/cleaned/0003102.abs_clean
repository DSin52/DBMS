We present a new class of solutions of D=10, N=2 chiral supergravity. Anonvanishing background for the field strength G_{MNR} of the complex two-formtriggers AdS_3 x M_7 compactifications, where M_7 is a 7-dimensional compactmanifold. When M_7 is a nonsymmetric coset space G/H, we can always find a setof constants G_{MNR} covariantly conserved and thus satisfying the fieldequations. For example the structure constants of G with indices in the G/Hdirections are a covariantly conserved tensor. In some symmetric G/H, wherethese structure constants vanish, there may still exist conserved 3-forms,yielding AdS_3 x G/H solutions. The conditions for supersymmetry of the AdS_3 xM_7 compactifications are derived, and tested for the supersymmetric solutionsAdS_3 x S^3 x T^4 and AdS_3 x S^3 x S^3 x S^1. Finally, we show that the AdS_3x S^3 x T^4 supersymmetric background can be seen as the sigma = 0 limit in aone-parameter class of solutions of the form AdS_3 x S^3 x CP^2, the parametersigma being the inverse "radius" of CP^2. For sigma different from 0 allsupersymmetries are broken.
