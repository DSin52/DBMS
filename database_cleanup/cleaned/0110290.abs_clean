Using the heat kernel method and the analytic continuation of the zetafunction, we calculate the canonical and improved vacuum stress tensors,${T_{\mu \nu}(\vec{x})}$ and ${\Theta_{\mu \nu}(\vec{x})}$, associated with amassless scalar field confined in the interior of an infinitely longrectangular waveguide. The local depence of the renormalized energy for twospecial configurations when the total energy is positive and negative arepresented using ${T_{00}(\vec{x})}$ and ${\Theta_{00}(\vec{x})}$. From thestress tensors we obtain the local Casimir forces in all walls by introducing aparticular external configuration. It is shown that this external configurationcannot give account of the edge divergences of the local forces. The local formof the forces is obtained for three special configurations.
