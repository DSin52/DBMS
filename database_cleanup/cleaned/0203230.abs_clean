We suppose that there are both particles with negative energies described byL_{W} and particles with positive energies described by L_{F}, L_{W} and L_{F}are independent of each other before quantization, dependent on each otherafter quantization and symmetric, and L=L_{W} + L_{F}. From this we present anew quantization method for QED. That the energy of the vacuum state is equalto zero is naturally obtained. Thus we can easily determine the cosmologicalconstant according to data of astronomical observation, and it is possible tocorrect nonperturbational methods which depend on the energy of the groundstate in quantum field theory.
