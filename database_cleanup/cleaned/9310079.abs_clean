I construct the ground state, up to first nonperturbative order, of thestochastic stabilization of the zero dimensional matrix model which defines 2DQuantum Gravity. It is given by the linear combination of a perturbative wavefunction and a nonperturbative one. The nonperturbative behaviour which arisefrom the stabilized model and from the string equation are similar. I show themodification of the loop equation by nonperturbative contribution.
