The Abelian Higgs model and the Georgi-Glashow model in 2 and 3 Euclideandimensions respectively, support both finite size instantons and sphalerons.The instantons are the familiar Nielsen-Oleson vortices and the't Hooft-Polyakov monopole solutions respectively. We have constructed thesphaleron solutions and calculated the Chern-Simons charges N_cs for sphaleronsof both models and have constructed two types of noncontractible loops betweentopologically distinct vacuua. In the 3 dimensional model, the sphaleron andthe vacuua have zero magnetic and electric flux while the configurations on theloops have non vanishing magnetic flux.
