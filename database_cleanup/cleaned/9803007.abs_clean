We derive the hole probability and the distribution of the smallesteigenvalue of chiral hermitian random matrices corresponding to Dirac operatorscoupled to massive quarks in QCD. They are expressed in terms of the QCDpartition function in the mesoscopic regime. Their universality is explicitlyrelated to that of the microscopic massive Bessel kernel.
