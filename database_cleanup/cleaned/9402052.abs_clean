We consider a class of spin systems on randomly triangulated surfaces asdiscrete approximations to conformal matter fields coupled to 2d gravity. Onthe basis of certain universality assumptions we argue that at critical pointswith diverging string susceptibility the model either exhibits mean fieldbehaviour or it can effectively be described by a conformal matter system withcentral charge less than or equal to 1 coupled to 2d gravity. As a particularconsequence we conclude in the unitary case that the string susceptibilityexponent is limited to possible values of the form 1/n, n=2,3,4,..., where n=2corresponds to mean field behaviour.
