Lesna, Slovak Republic, 7-13 September 1998Local symmetries of the action for a relativistic particle with curvature andtorsion of its world curve in the (2+1)-dimensional space-time are studied.With the help of the method, worked out recently by the authors (Phys.Rev.,D56, 1135, 1142 (1997)), first the local-symmetry transformations are obtainedboth in the phase and configuration space. At the classical level, thedependence of the particle mass on the parameters of curvature and torsion andthe Regge trajectory are obtained. It is shown that the tachyonic sector can beremoved by a proper gauge choice.
