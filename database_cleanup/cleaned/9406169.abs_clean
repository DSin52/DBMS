A two-dimensional nonrelativistic fermion system coupled to bothelectromagnetic gauge fields and Chern-Simons gauge fields is analysed.Polarization tensors relevant in the quantum Hall effect and anyonsuperconductivity are obtained as simple closed integrals and are evaluatednumerically for all momenta and frequencies. The correction to the energydensity is evaluated in the random phase approximation (RPA), by summing aninfinite series of ring diagrams. It is found that the correction hassignificant dependence on the particle number density.In the context of anyon superconductivity, the energy density relative to themean field value is minimized at a hole concentration per lattice plaquette(0.05 \sim 0.06) (p_c a/\hbar)^2 where p_c and a are the momentum cutoff andlattice constant, respectively. At the minimum the correction is about -5 %\sim -25 %, depending on the ratio (2m \omega_c)/(p_c^2) where \omega_c is thefrequency cutoff.In the Jain-Fradkin-Lopez picture of the fractional quantum Hall effect theRPA correction to the energy density is very large. It diverges logarithmicallyas the cutoff is removed, implying that corrections beyond RPA become importantat large momentum and frequency.
