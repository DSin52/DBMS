Within a self-consistent proper-time Renormalization Group (RG) approach weinvestigate an effective QCD trace anomaly realization with dilatons anddetermine the finite-temperature behavior of the gluon condensate. Fixing theeffective model at vanishing temperature to the glueball mass and the bagconstant a possible gluonic phase transition is explored in detail. Within theRG framework the full non-truncated dilaton potential analysis is compared witha truncated potential version.
