We discuss the origin of enhanced gauge symmetry in ALE (and K3)compactification of M theory, either defined as the strong coupling limit ofthe type IIa superstring, or as defined by Banks et al. In the D-braneformalism, wrapped membranes are D0 branes with twisted string boundaryconditions, and appear on the same footing with the Kaluza-Klein excitations ofthe gauge bosons. In M(atrix) theory, the construction appears to work forarbitrary ALE metric.
