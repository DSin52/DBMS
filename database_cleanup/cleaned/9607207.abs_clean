We discuss non-trivial fixed points of the renormalization group with dualdescriptions in $N=4$ gauge theories in three dimensions. This new duality actsas mirror symmetry, exchanging the Higgs and Coulomb branches of the theories.Quantum effects on the Coulomb branch arise classically on the Higgs branch ofthe dual theory. We present examples of dual theories whose Higgs/Coulombbranch are the ALE spaces and whose Coulomb/Higgs branches are the moduli spaceof instantons of the corresponding $ADE$ gauge group. In particular, we showthat in three dimensions small $E_8$ instantons in string theory are describedby a local quantum field theory.
