It has been conjectured that a pair of D5 - anti D5 branes wrapped on somenon-trivial two cycle of a Calabi-Yau manifold becomes a stable BPS D3 brane inthe presence of a very large B field and magnetic fluxes on their worldvolumes.We discuss this by considering the non-commutative field theory on theworldvolume of the pair of branes whose field multiplication is made withrespect to two different * products due to the presence of different F fieldson the two branes. The tachyonic field becomes massless for a specific choiceof the magnetic fluxes and it allows a trivial solution. Our discussiongeneralizes recent results concerning stability of brane-antibrane systems onCalabi-Yau spaces to the case of non-commutative branes.
