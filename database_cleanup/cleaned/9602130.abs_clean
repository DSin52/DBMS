We study the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the fermion self-energy in masslessand massive $QED_2$, in the ladder approximation. When the fermion is massless(and the photon massless or massive), we check the reliability of thisapproximation by comparing its solutions with the exact ones. They agree onlywhen the photon is massless. For a massive fermion and massless photon, we showthat there is no consistent solution at all, the infrared divergencesintroduced by the approximation forbidding even the trivial solution. When bothfermion and photon are massive, we find a non-perturbative (extra) fermion massgeneration (which survives in the limit when the bare mass of the fermion tendsto zero). We argue that, in this case, the ladder approximation will providereliable results if the bare masses of the fields are large compared with the(dimensionful) coupling constant.
