Title: Randomness and Irreversibility in Quantum Field Theory

Authors: J. Perez-Mercader

Comments: RevTeX, 13 pages plus 4 Figures (available from the author upon

request), LAEFF--93/006Quantum fluctuations, through quantum corrections, have the potential to leadto irreversibility in quantum field theory. We consider the virtual ``charge"distribution generated by quantum corrections in the leading log, short rangeapproximation, and adopt for it a statistical interpretation. This virtualcharge density has fractal structure, and it is seen that, independently ofwhether the theory is or is not asymptotically free, it describes a systemwhere the equilibrium state is at its classical limit ($\hbar \rightarrow 0$).We also present a simple analysis of how diffusion of the charge densityproceeds as a function of the distance at which the system is probed.
