Title: AN EXACT COSMOLOGICAL SOLUTION TO STRING THEORY

Authors: Oscar Jofre and Carmen N\'u\~nez.

Comments: Marginal errors corrected. The sign of the level k of the Kac-Moody

algebra was changed to explicitly take into account the non-compactness ofthe group. Some references have been added.A homogeneous anisotropic four dimensional spacetime with Lorentziansignature is constructed from an ungauged WZW model based on a non-semisimpleLie group. The associated non-linear $\sigma $-model describes stringpropagation in an expanding-contracting universe with antisymmetric tensor anddilaton backgrounds. The current algebra of SL(2,R)$\times $R is constructed interms of two free boson fields and two generalized parafermions, or four freebosons with background charge. This representation is used to study the stringspectrum in the cosmological background.
