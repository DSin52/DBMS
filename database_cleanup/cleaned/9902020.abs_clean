A recent experiment with squeezed light has shown that two-photon absorptionby an atom can occur with a linear intensity dependence. We point out that thisresult verifies a prediction made by us more than a decade ago from an analysisof a nonlocal model of QED. This model had earlier been proposed by us in an adhoc manner to interpret certain features of multiphoton double ionization andabove-threshold ionization in an atom placed in a strong laser field ; in thispaper we show that the model can be obtained field- theoretically by demandingcovariance of the field Lagrangian under a nonlocal U(1) gauge transformation.The model also makes direct contact with squeezed light, and thus allows us todescribe these two completely different scenarios from a unified point of view.We obtain a fundamentally new result from our nonlocal QED, namely thatonly the past, but not the future, can influence the present - thusestablishing a non-thermodynamic arrow of time at the quantum level. We alsoshow that correlations within a quantum system should necessarily be of theEPR-type, a result that agrees with Bell's theorem. These results follow fromthe simple requirement of energy conservation in matter-radiation interaction.Furthermore, we also predict new and experimentally verifiable results on thebasis of our model QED.
