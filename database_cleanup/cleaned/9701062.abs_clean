We compute the form factors of exponential operators $e^{kg\varphi(x)}$ inthe two-dimensional integrable Bullough-Dodd model ($a_2^{(2)}$ Affine TodaField Theory). These form factors are selected among the solutions of generalnonderivative scalar operators by their asymptotic cluster property. Throughanalitical continuation to complex values of the coupling constant thesesolutions permit to compute the form factors of scaling relevant primary fieldsin the lightest-breather sector of integrable $\phi_{1,2}$ and $\phi_{1,5}$deformations of conformal minimal models. We also obtain the exactwave-function renormalization constant Z(g) of the model and the properly
