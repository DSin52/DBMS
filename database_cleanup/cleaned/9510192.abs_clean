A Chern-Simons action written with Christoffel Symbols has a natural gaugesymmetry of diffeomorphisms. This Chern-Simons action will induce aWess-Zumio-Witten model on the boundary of the manifold. If we restrict thediffeomorphisms to chiral diffeomorphism, the Wess-Zumio-Witten model isequivalent to a quantum Liouville action.
