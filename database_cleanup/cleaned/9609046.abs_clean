This is the text of a talk given at the Inaugural Conference of the AsiaPacific Center for Theoretical Physics, Seoul, Korea, June 9, 1996. If natureis described by string theory, and if the compactification radius is large (assuggested by the unification of couplings), then the theory is in a regime bestdescribed by the low energy limit of $M$-theory. We discuss somephenomenological aspects of this view. The scale at which conventional quantumfield theory breaks down is of order the unification scale and consequently(approximate) discrete symmetries are essential to prevent proton decay. Thereare one or more light axions, one of which solves the strong CP problem.Modular cosmology is still problematic but much more complex than inperturbative string vacua.
