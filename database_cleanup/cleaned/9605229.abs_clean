We use the multimonopole moduli space as a tool for studying the propertiesof BPS monopoles carrying nonabelian magnetic charges. For configurations whosetotal magnetic charge is purely abelian, the moduli space for nonabelianbreaking can be obtained as a smooth limit of that for a purely abelianbreaking. As the asymptotic Higgs field is varied toward one of the specialvalues for which the unbroken symmetry is enlarged to a nonabelian group, someof the fundamental monopoles of unit topological charge remain massive butacquire nonabelian magnetic charges. The BPS mass formula indicates that othersshould become massless in this limit. We find that these do not correspond todistinct solitons but instead manifest themselves as ``nonabelian clouds''surrounding the massive monopoles. The moduli space coordinates describing theposition and $U(1)$ phase of these massless monopoles are transformed into anequal number of nonabelian global gauge orientation and gauge-invariantstructure parameters characterizing the nonabelian cloud. We illustrate thisexplicitly in a class of $Sp(2N)$ examples for which the full family ofmonopole solutions is known. We show in detail how the unbroken symmetries ofthe theory are manifested as isometries of the moduli space metric. We discussthe connection of these results to the Montonen-Olive duality conjecture,arguing in particular that the massless monopoles should be understood as theduals to the massless gauge bosons that appear as the mediators of thenonabelian forces in the perturbative sector.
