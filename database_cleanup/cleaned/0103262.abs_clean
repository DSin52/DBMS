We consider the matrix quantum mechanics of N D0-branes in the background ofthe 1-form RR field. It is observed that the transformations of matrixcoordinates of D0-branes induce on the Abelian RR field symmetrytransformations that are like those of non-Abelian gauge fields. TheLorentz-like equations of motion for matrix coordinates are derived. The fieldstrengths appearing in the Lorentz-like equations transform in the adjointrepresentation of U(N) under symmetry transformations. A possible relationbetween D0-brane dynamics in RR background, and the semi-classical dynamics ofcharged particles in Yang-Mills background is mentioned.
