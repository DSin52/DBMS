A Newtonian matrix cosmology, correspoding to the BFSS model ofeleven-dimensional M-theory in the IMF as a (0+1) M(atrix) model isconstructed. Interesting new results are obtained, such as the existence of(much sought for in the past) static solutions. The possible interpretation ofthe off-diagonal entries as a background geometry is also briefly discussed.
