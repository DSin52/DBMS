The solutions of Heisenberg equations and two-particles eigenvalue problemsfor nonrelativistic models of current-current fermion interaction and $N,\Theta $ model are obtained in the frameworks of dynamical mapping method. Theequivalence of different types of dynamical mapping is shown. The connectionbetween renormalization procedure and theory of selfadjoint extensions iselucidated.
