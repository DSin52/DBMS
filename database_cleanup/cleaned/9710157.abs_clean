Authors: Daniel Zwanziger (New York University)

Comments: 21 pages, Latex file, no figures, Lectures given at the NATO ASI on

Confinement, Duality and Non-perturbative Aspects of QCD, Cambridge, UK, June23 - July 4, 1997We review the canonical quantization of continuum Yang-Mills theory, andderive the continuum Coulomb-gauge Hamiltonian by a simplification of theChrist-Lee method. We then analogously derive, by a simple and elementarymethod, the lattice Coulomb-gauge Hamiltonian in the minimal Coulomb gauge (andin other Coulomb gauges) from the known Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian.
