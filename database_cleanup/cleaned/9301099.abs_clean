We present a detailed investigation of scattering processes in $W_3$ stringtheory. We discover further physical states with continuous momentum, whichinvolve excitations of the ghosts as well as the matter, and use them to gain abetter understanding of the interacting theory. The scattering amplitudesdisplay factorisation properties, with states from the different sectors of thetheory being exchanged in the various intermediate channels. We find strongevidence for the unitarity of the theory, despite the unusual ghost structureof some of the physical states. Finally, we show that by performing atransformation of the quantum fields that involves mixing the ghost fields withone of the matter fields, the structure of the physical states is dramaticallysimplified. The new formalism provides a concise framework within which tostudy the $W_3$ string.
