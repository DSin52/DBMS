We verify that the fractional KdV equation is a bi-hamiltonian system usingthe zero curvature equation in $SL(3)$ matrix valued Lax pair representation,and explicitly find the closed form for the hamiltonian operators of thesystem. The second hamiltonian operator is the classical version of the$W^{(2)}_3$ algebra. We also construct systematically the Miura map of$W^{(2)}_3$ algebra using a gauge transformation of the $SL(3)$ matrix valuedLax operator in a particular gauge, and construct the modified fractional KdVequaiotn as hamiltonian system.
