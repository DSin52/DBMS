Title: Non-Perturbative effective Lagrangians for super-matrix models

Authors: R. Brustein, M. Faux and B. Ovrut

Comments: Presented by B. Ovrut at the International Europhysics Conference,

Marseille, July 22-28,1993, 5 papges, preprint CERN-TH.7013/93We discuss $d=1, {\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric matrix models and exhibit theassociated $d=2$ collective field theory in the limit of dense eigenvalues.From this field theory we construct, by the addition of several new fields, a$d=2$ supersymmetric effective field theory, which reduces to the collectivefield theory when the new fields are replaced with their vacuum expectationvalues. This effective theory is Poincare invariant and contains perturbativeand non-perturbative information about the associated superstrings.
