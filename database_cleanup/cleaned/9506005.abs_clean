Title: THE SINGULARITY STRUCTURE OF THE YANG-MILLS CONFIGURATION SPACE

Authors: J. Fuchs

Comments: 13 pages, latex. Invited talk at the Workshop on Quantum and

Classical Gauge Theory, Banach Center, Warsaw, May 1995The geometric description of Yang-Mills theories and their configurationspace M is reviewed. The presence of singularities in M is explained and someof their properties are described. The singularity structure is analyzed indetail for structure group SU(2).
