colloquium on group theoretical methods in physics, July 1996, Goslar,GermanyWe associate to outer automorphisms of generalized Kac-Moody algebrasgeneralized character-valued indices, the twining characters. A characterformula for twining characters is derived which shows that they coincide withthe ordinary characters of some other generalized Kac-Moody algebra, theso-called orbit Lie algebra. Some applications to problems in conformal fieldtheory, algebraic geometry and the theory of sporadic simple groups aresketched.
