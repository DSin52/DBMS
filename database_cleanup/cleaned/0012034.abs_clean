We investigate solutions of type II supergravity which have the product R^4 xM^6 structure with non-compact M^6 factor and which preserve at least foursupersymmetries. In particular, we consider various conifolds and the N=1supersymmetric NS5-brane wrapped on 2-sphere solution recently discussed inhep-th/0008001. In all of these cases, we explicitly construct the complexstructures, and the Kaehler and parallel (3,0) forms of the corresponding M^6.In addition, we verify that the above solutions preserve, respectively, eightand four supersymmetries of type II theory. We also demonstrate that theordinary and fractional D3-brane solutions on singular, resolved and deformedconifolds, and the (S-dual of) NS5-brane wrapped on 2-sphere can be obtained asspecial cases from a universal ansatz for the supergravity fields and a single1-d action governing their radial evolution. We show that like the 3-branes onconifolds, the NS5-brane on 2-sphere background can be found as a solution offirst order system following from a superpotential.
