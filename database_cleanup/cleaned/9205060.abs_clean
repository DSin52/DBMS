We study cosmological implications of the duality ($PSL(2,{\bf Z})$)invariant potential for the compactification radius $T$, arising in a class ofsuperstring vacua. We show that in spite of having only one minimum in thefundamental domain of the $T$ field there are two types of non-supersymmetricT+i$, analogous to the axionic domain wall, and another one associated with thenoncompact symmetry $T\to 1/T$, analogous to the $Z_2$ domain walls. The firstone is bound by stringy cosmic strings. The scale of such domain walls isgoverned by the scale of gaugino condensation (${\cal O} (10^{16}$ GeV) in thecase of hidden $E_8$ gauge group), while the separation between minima is oforder $M_{pl}$. We discuss the formation of walls and their cosmologicalcosmic strings and/or inflation. Since there is no usual Kibble mechanism tocreate strings, either one must assume they exist $ab\ initio$, or one mustconclude that string cosmologies require inflation. The non-perturbativepotential dealt with here appears not to give the needed inflationary epoch.
