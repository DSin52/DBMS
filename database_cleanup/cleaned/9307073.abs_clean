We prove that all the correlation functions in the $(1,q)$ models arecalculable using only the Virasoro and the $W^{(3)}$ constraints. This resultis based on the invariance of correlators with respect to an interchange of theorder of the operators they contain.In terms of the topological recursion relations, it means that only two andthree contacts and the corresponding degenerations of the underlying surfacesare relevant. An algorithm to compute correlators for any $q$ and at any genusis presented and demonstrated through some examples. On route to these results,some interesting polynomial identities, which are generalizations of Abel'sidentity, were discovered. }
