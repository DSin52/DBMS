Several examples are given of continuous families of SU(2) vector potentials$A_i^a(x)$ in 3 space dimensions which generate the same magnetic field$B^{ai}(x)$ (with det $B\neq 0$). These Wu-Yang families are obtained from theEinstein equation $R_{ij}=-2G_{ij}$ derived recently via a local map of thegauge field system into a spatial geometry with $2$-tensor $G_{ij}=B^a{}_iB^a{}_j\det B$ and connection $\Gamma_{jk}^i$ with torsion defined from gaugecovariant derivatives of $B$.
