a semidirect product and coproduct $B\cocross \widetilde{SO_q(1,3)}$ where $B$is a braided-quantum group structure on the $q$-Minkowski space of 4-momentumwith braided-coproduct $\und\Delta \vecp=\vecp\tens 1+1\tens \vecp$. Here thenecessary $B$ is not a usual kind of quantum group, but one with braidstatistics. Similar braided-vectors and covectors $V(R')$, $V^*(R')$ exist fora general R-matrix. The abstract structure of the $q$-Lorentz group is alsostudied.
