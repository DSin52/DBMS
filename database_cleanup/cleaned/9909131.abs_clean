show section of the proceedings of Cargese'99 summer school "Progress inString Theory and M-theory", May 24 - June 5 (talk by Celine Laroche)propose a topological quantum field theory as a twisted candidate to formulatecovariant matrix strings. The model relies on the octonionic or complexifiedinstanton equations defined on an eight dimensional manifold with reducedholonomy. To allow untwisting of the model without producing an anomaly, wesuggest (partially twisted) W-gravity as an "extended" 2d-gravity sector.
