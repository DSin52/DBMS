We review briefly generalized Freedman-Townsend models found recently byHenneaux and Knaepen, and provide supersymmetric versions of such models infour dimensions which couple 2-form gauge potentials and ordinary gauge fieldsin a gauge invariant and supersymmetric manner. The latter models have theunusual feature that, in a WZ gauge, the supersymmetry transformations do notcommute with all the gauge transformations.
