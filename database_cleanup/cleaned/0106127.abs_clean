Using the thin-shell formalism we discuss the motion of domain walls in deSitter and anti-de Sitter (AdS) time-dependent bulks. This motion results in adynamics for the brane scale factor. We show that in the case of a clean branethe scale factor describes both singular and non-singular universes, withphases of contraction and expansion. These phases can be understood asquotients of AdS spacetime by a discrete symmetry group. We discuss this effectin some detail, and suggest how the AdS/CFT correspondence could be applied toobtain a non perturbative description of brane-world string cosmology.
