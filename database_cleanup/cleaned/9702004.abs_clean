Contribution to the XXI International Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methodsin Physics, Goslar, GermanyNew features of systems with non-trivial topology such as fractional quantumnumbers, inequivalent quantizations, good operators, topological anomalies,etc. are described in the framework of an algebraic quantization procedure on agroup. Modular invariance naturally appears as a subgroup of good operators inthe particular case of the torus.
