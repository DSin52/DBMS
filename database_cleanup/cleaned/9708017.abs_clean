We study the Picard-Fuchs differential equations for the Seiberg-Wittenperiod integrals in N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. For A-D-E gaugegroups we derive the Picard-Fuchs equations by using the flat coordinates inthe A-D-E singularity theory. We then find that these are equivalent to theGauss-Manin system for two-dimensional A-D-E topological Landau-Ginzburg modelsand the scaling relation for the Seiberg-Witten differential. This suggests aninteresting relationship between four-dimensional N=2 gauge theories in theCoulomb branch and two-dimensional topological field theories.
