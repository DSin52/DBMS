We prove the uniqueness theorem for self-gravitating non-linear sigma-modelsin higher dimensional spacetime. Applying the positive mass theorem we showthat Schwarzschild-Tagherlini spacetime is the only maximally extended, staticasymptotically flat solution with non-rotating regular event horizon with aconstant mapping.
