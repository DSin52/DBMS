Title: Path-Integral Aspects of Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics

Authors: Georg Junker

In this talk we briefly review the concept of supersymmetric quantummechanics using a model introduced by Witten. A quasi-classical path-integralevaluation for this model is performed, leading to a so-called supersymmetricquasi-classical quantization condition. Properties of this quantizationcondition are compared with those derived from the standard WKB approach.
