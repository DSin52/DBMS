The nature of Mean Field Solutions to the Equations of Motion of theChern--Simons Landau--Ginsberg (CSLG) description of the Fractional QuantumHall Effect (FQHE) is studied. Beginning with the conventional description ofthis model at some chemical potential $\mu_0$ and magnetic field $B$corresponding to a ``special'' filling fraction $\nu=2\pi\rho/eB=1/n$($n=1,3,5\cdot \cdot\cdot$) we show that a deviation of $\mu$ in a finite rangearound $\mu_0$ does not change the Mean Field solution and thus the meandensity of particles in the model. This result holds not only for the lowestenergy Mean Field solution but for the vortex excitations as well. The vortexconfigurations do not depend on $\mu$ in a finite range about $\mu_0$ in thismodel. However when $\mu-\mu_0 < \mu_{cr}^-$ (or $\mu-\mu_0>\mu_{cr}^+$) thelowest energy Mean Field solution describes a condensate of vortices (orantivortices). We give numerical examples of vortex and antivortexconfigurations and discuss the range of $\mu$ and $\nu$ over which the systemof vortices is dilute.
