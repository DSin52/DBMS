We study brane embeddings in M-theory plane-waves and their supersymmetry.The relation with branes in AdS backgrounds via the Penrose limit is alsoexplored. Longitudinal planar branes are originated from AdS branes while giantgravitons of AdS spaces become spherical branes which are realized as fuzzyspheres in the massive matrix theory.
