Title: Supergravity, Linear Multiplets, and Chern-Simons Forms

Authors: R. Grimm

Some general features of locally supersymmetric theories (N=1 in fourdimensions) involving Chern-Simons forms and antisymmetric tensors are sketchedout. The relevance of the three-form multiplet both for the description ofChern-Simons forms and the supersymmetry properties of the gaugino condensateis pointed out.
