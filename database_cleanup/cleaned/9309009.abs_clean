A new construction is presented for point interactions (PI) and generalisedpoint interactions (GPI). The construction is an inverse scattering procedure,using integral transforms suggested by the required scattering theory. Theusual class of PI in 3 dimensions (i.e. the self adjoint extensions of theLaplacian on the domain of smooth functions compactly supported away from theorigin) is reconstructed. In addition a 1-parameter family of GPI models termedresonance point interactions (RPI) is constructed, labelled by $M$. The case$M<0$ coincides with a special case of a known GPI model; the case $M>0$appears to be new. In both cases, the Hilbert space of states must be extended,for $M<0$, a larger Hilbert space is required, whilst for $M>0$, the Hilbertspace is extended to a Pontryagin space. In the latter case, the space ofphysical states is identified as a positive definite invariant subspace.Complete M{\o}ller wave operators are constructed for the models considered,using a two space formalism where necessary, which confirm that the PI and RPImodels exhibit the required scattering theory. The physical interpretation ofRPI as models for quantum mechanical systems exhibiting zero energy resonancesis described.
