We point out that in infinite spacetime dimensions, the singularity in theinterquark potential at small distances disappears if the string is anchored atone end to a heavy quark, at the other end to a light quark. This suggests thatif quarks are placed at the end of strings some unphysical features such astachyon states may be absent also in in finite dimensions.
