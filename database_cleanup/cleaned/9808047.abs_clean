Title: On the underlying theory approach for quantum theories

Comments: 12 pages, LaTex, no figure, explanations and speculative remarks

about the underlying theory approach recently proposed. Comments are welcomeSome explanations and implications of the underlying theory approach forquantum theories (QM or QFT) are discussed and suggested. This simple ideaseems to have significantly nontrivial effects for our understanding of thequantum theories.
