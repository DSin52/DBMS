The Seiberg-Witten solution of N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) gauge theories withmatter is analysed as an isomonodromy problem. We show that the holomorphicsection describing the effective action can be deformed by moving itssingularities on the moduli space while keeping their monodromies invariant.Well-known examples of isomonodromic sections are given by the correlators oftwo-dimensional rational conformal field theories -- the conformal blocks. TheSeiberg-Witten section similarly admits the operations of braiding and fusingof its singularities, which obey the Yang-Baxter and Pentagonal identities,respectively. Using them, we easily find the complete expressions of themonodromies with affine term, and the full quantum numbers of the BPS spectrum.While the braiding describes the quark-monopole transmutation, the fusingimplies the superconformal points in the moduli space. In the simplest case ofthree singularities, the supersymmetric sections are directly related to theconformal blocks of the logarithmic minimal models.
