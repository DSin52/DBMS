In this paper we provide a manifestly N=2 supersymmetric formulation of theM-fivebrane in the presence of threebrane solitons. The superspace form offour-dimensional effective equations for the threebranes are readily obtainedand yield the complete Seiberg-Witten equations of motion for N=2super-Yang-Mills. A particularly simple derivation is given by introducing anN=2 superfield generalisation of the Seiberg-Witten differential.
