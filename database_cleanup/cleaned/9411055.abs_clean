Title: Spacetime and Worldvolume Supersymmetric Super p-Brane Actions

Comments: 14 pages, plain tex, contribution to the VIth Regional Conference in

Mathematical Physics, Pakistan, 5-11 February, 1994We review the salient features of spacetime and worldvolume supersymmetricsuper p-brane actions. These are sigma models for maps from a worldvolumesuperspace to the target superspace. For p-branes, the symmetries of the modeldepend crucially on the existence of closed super (p+1)-forms on a worldvolumesuperspace, built out of the pull-backs of the Kalb-Ramond super (p+1)-form intarget superspace and its curvature. This formulation of super p-branes isusually referred to as the twistor-like formulation.
