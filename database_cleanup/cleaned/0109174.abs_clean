We consider high-energy fixed-angle scattering of glueballs in confininggauge theories that have supergravity duals. Although the effective descriptionis in terms of the scattering of strings, we find that the amplitudes are hard(power law). This is a consequence of the warped geometry of the dual theory,which has the effect that in an inertial frame the string process is never inthe soft regime. At small angle we find hard and Regge behaviors in differentkinematic regions.
