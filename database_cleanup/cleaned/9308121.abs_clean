Comments: 75 pages, Tex

The theory of embedded random surfaces, equivalent to two--dimensionalquantum gravity coupled to matter, is reviewed, further developed and partlygeneralized to four dimensions. It is shown that the action of the Liouvillefield theory that describes random surfaces contains terms that have not beennoticed previously. These terms are used to explain the phase diagram of theSine--Gordon model coupled to gravity, in agreement with recent results fromlattice computations. It is also demonstrated how the methods oftwo--dimensional quantum gravity can be applied to four--dimensional Euclideangravity in the limit of infinite Weyl coupling. Critical exponents arepredicted and an analog of the ``$c=1$ barrier'' of two--dimensional gravity isderived.
