Recently Magnea hep-th/9907096 , hep-th/9912207 [Phys.Rev.D61, 056005 (2000);Phys.Rev.D62, 016005 (2000)] claimed to have computed the first sum rules forDirac operators in 3D gauge theories from 0D non-linear sigma models. I pointout that these computations are incorrect, and that they contradict with theexact results for the spectral densities unambiguously derived from randommatrix theory by Nagao and myself.
