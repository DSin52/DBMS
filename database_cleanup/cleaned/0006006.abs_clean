We construct quantum evolution operators on the space of states, that isrepresented by the vertices of the n-dimensional unit hypercube. They realizethe metaplectic representation of the modular group SL(2,Z(2^n)). Byconstruction this representation acts in a natural way on the coordinates ofthe non-commutative 2-torus,T^2, and thus is relevant for noncommutative fieldtheories as well as theories of quantum space-time.
