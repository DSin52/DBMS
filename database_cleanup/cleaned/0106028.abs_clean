In this paper we study spatially quenched, SU(N) Yang-Mills theory in thelarge-N limit. The resulting reduced action shows the same formal look as theBanks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind M-theory action. The Weyl-Wigner-Moyal symbolof this matrix model is the Moyal deformation of a p(=2)-brane action. Thus,the large-N limit of the spatially quenched SU(N) Yang-Mills is seen todescribe a dynamical membrane. By assuming spherical symmetry we compute themass spectrum of this object in the WKB approximation.
