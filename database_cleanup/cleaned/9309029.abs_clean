Title: Multivariable Invariants of Colored Links Generalizing the Alexander

PolynomialComments: 19 pages

We discuss multivariable invariants of colored links associated with the$N$-dimensional root of unity representation of the quantum group. Theinvariants for $N>2$ are generalizations of the multi-variable Alexanderpolynomial. The invariants vanish for disconnected links. We review thedefinition of the invariants through (1,1)-tangles. When $(N,3)=1$ and $N$ isodd, the invariant does not vanish for the parallel link (cable) of the knot$3_1$, while the Alexander polynomial vanishes for the cable link.
