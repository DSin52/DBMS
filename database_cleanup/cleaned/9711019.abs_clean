Title: A Matrix Model Solution of Hirota Equation

Comments: 19 pages, Latex, no figures

SystemsWe present a hermitian matrix chain representation of the general solution ofthe Hirota bilinear difference equation of three variables. In the large Nlimit this matrix model provides some explicit particular solutions ofcontinuous differential Hirota equation of three variables. A relation of thisrepresentation to the eigenvalues of transfer matrices of 2D quantum integrablemodels is discussed.
