Small fluctuations around a constant electric or constant magnetic field areanalyzed in a theory with pseudo scalar [phi] with a coupling[g.phi.F.(F.dual)]. It is found that the magnetic external field leads to massgeneration for the small perturbations, while the electric field suffers from atachyonic instability in the case in which the field strength is higher than acritical value (related to the pseudo scalar mass). The vacuum energy can beexactly evaluated and it is found that an imaginary part is present when theexternal electric field exceeds its critical value.
