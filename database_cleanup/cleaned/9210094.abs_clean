A new string theory is proposed as a candidate for the large N limit of QCD.In this theory, strings are constrained to be non-backtracking; a conditionthat is essential for the gauge invariance of the underlying field theory.Thiscondition is implemented by first placing the theory on a lattice and thenintroducing fermionic variables on the world sheet. The naive continuum limitleads to a generalized Thirring model on the world sheet,and it is suggestedthat the application of the renormalization group should drive the couplingconstants to a conformally invariant fixed point.
