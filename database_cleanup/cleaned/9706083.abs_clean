We show that the growth of the size with the number of partons holds in aThomas-Fermi analysis of the threshold bound state of D0--branes. Our resultssharpen the evidence that for a fixed value of the eleven dimensional radiusthe partonic velocities can be made arbitrarily small as one approaches thelarge N limit.
