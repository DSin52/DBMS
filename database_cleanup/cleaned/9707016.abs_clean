We study a variety of supersymmetric systems describing sixth-orderinteractions between two coupled real superfields in 2+1 dimensions. We searchfor BPS domain ribbon solutions describing minimum energy static fieldconfigurations that break one half of the supersymmetries. We then use thesupersymmetric system to investigate the behavior of mesons and fermions in thebackground of the defects. In particular, we show that certain BPS domainribbons admit internal structure in the form of bosonic kinks and fermioniccondensate, for a given range of the two parameters that completely identifythe class of systems.
