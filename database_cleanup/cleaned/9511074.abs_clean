A novel BRST quantization is described, which is applied in generalizing theJackiw-Nair construction of anyon. We have explicitly shown that the matterstates connected to an unconventional ("non-zero") BRST ghost sector arephysical. They are identified to the Jackiw-Nair system in a particular gauge.Also for the first time an indepth analysis of the present kind for a reducibleconstraint system, ( where the constraints are not independent), has beenperformed.
