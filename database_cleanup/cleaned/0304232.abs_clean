Title: An alternative formulation of light-cone string field theory on the

plane waveAuthors: Ari Pankiewicz

Comments: 28 pages

We construct a manifestly SO(4) x SO(4) invariant, supersymmetric extensionof the closed string cubic interaction vertex and dynamical supercharges inlight-cone string field theory on the plane wave space-time. We find that theeffective vertex for states built out of bosonic creation oscillators coincideswith the one previously constructed in the SO(8) formalism and conjecture thatin general the two formulations are physically equivalent. Further evidence forthis claim is obtained from the discrete Z_2-symmetry of the plane wave and bycomputing the mass-shift of the simplest stringy state using perturbationtheory. We verify that the leading non-planar correction to the anomalousdimension of the dual gauge theory operators is correctly recovered.
