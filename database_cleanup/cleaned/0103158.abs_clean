We study the Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction of zero-modes of bulkantisymmetric tensor fields on a non-compact extra dimension in theRandall-Sundrum model. It is shown that in the Kaluza-Klein reduction on anon-compact extra dimension we have in general a zero-mode depending on a fifthdimension in addition to a conventional constant zero-mode in the Kaluza-Kleinreduction on a circle. We examine the localization property of these zero-modeson a flat Minkowski 3-brane. In particular, it is shown that a 2-form and a3-form on the brane can be respectively obtained from a 3-form and 4-form inthe bulk by taking the zero-mode dependent on the fifth dimension.
