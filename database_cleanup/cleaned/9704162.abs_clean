In the context of simple models, it is shown that demanding finiteness forphysical masses with respect to a longitudinal cutoff, can be used to fix theambiguity in the renormalization of fermions masses in the Hamiltonianlight-front formulation. Difficulties that arise in applications of finitenessconditions to discrete light-cone quantization are discussed.
