Title: Rotating and Orbiting Strings in the Near-Horizon Brane Backgrounds

Comments: 15 pages, LaTeX, no figures

Using the Schwarzschild-type coordinates in stead of the global ones wereconstruct the classical rotating closed string solutions in the AdS*5 x S*5backgrounds. They are explicitly described by the Jacobi elliptic andtrigonometrical functions of worldsheet coordinates. We study the orbitingclosed string configurations in the near-horizon geometries of Dp, NS1 and NS5branes, and derive the energy and spin of them, whose relation takes a simpleform for short strings. Specially in the D5 and NS5 backgrounds we have alinear relation that the energy of the point-like string is proportional to thespin, which is associated with the spectrum of strings in the pp-wavegeometries obtained by taking a special Penrose limit on the D5 and NS5backgrounds.
