The Lie-Poisson analogues of the cotangent bundle and coadjoint orbits of aLie group are considered. For the natural Poisson brackets the symplecticleaves in these manifolds are classified and the corresponding symplectic formsare described. Thus the construction of the Kirillov symplectic form isgeneralized for Lie-Poisson groups.
