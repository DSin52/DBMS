We consider the cosmology of a ``3-brane universe'' in a five dimensional(bulk) space-time with a cosmological constant. We show that Einstein'sequations admit a first integral, analogous to the first Friedmann equation,which governs the evolution of the metric in the brane, whatever the timeevolution of the metric along the fifth dimension. We thus obtain thecosmological evolution in the brane for any equation of state describing thematter in the brane, without needing the dependence of the metric on the fifthdimension. In the particular case $p = w \rho$, $(w = constant)$, we giveexplicit expressions for the time evolution of the brane scale factor, whichshow that standard cosmological evolution can be obtained (after an early nonconventional phase) in a scenario \`a la Randall and Sundrum, where a branetension compensates the bulk cosmological constant. We also show that a tinydeviation from exact compensation leads to an effective cosmological constantat late time. Moreover, when the metric along the fifth dimension is static, weare able to extend the solution found on the brane to the whole spacetime.
