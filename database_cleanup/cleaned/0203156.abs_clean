Title: Sigma Model Lagrangian for the Heisenberg Group

Authors: Belal E. Baaquie and Yim Kok Kean

We study the Lagrangian for a sigma model based on the non-compact Heisenberggroup. A unique feature of this model -- unlike the case for compact Lie groupsover the Heisenberg group is otherwise divergent. The resulting theory is areal Lagrangian with a quartic interaction term. After a few non-trivialtransformations, the Lagrangian is shown to be equivalent -- at the classicallevel -- to a complex cubic Lagrangian. A one loop computation shows that thequartic and cubic Lagrangians are equivalent at the quantum level as well. Thecomplex Lagrangian is known to classically equivalent to the SU(2) sigma model,with the equivalence breaking down at the quantum level. An explanation of thiswell known results emerges from the properties of the Heisenberg sigma model.
