Title: Can the Unruh-DeWitt detector extract energy from the vacuum?

Authors: H. Nikolic

Comments: 6 pages

The Unruh effect can be correctly treated only by using the Minkowskiquantization and a model of a "particle" detector, not by using the Rindlerquantization. The energy produced by a detector accelerated only for a shorttime can be much larger than the energy needed to change the velocity of thedetector. Although the measuring process lasts an infinite time, the productionof the energy can be qualitatively explained by a time-energy uncertaintyrelation.
