1821-1848We investigate Weyl anomalies on a curved world sheet to second order in aweak field expansion. Using a local version of the exact renormalization groupequations, we obtain nonperturbative results for the tachyon/graviton/dilatonsystem. We discuss the elimination of redundant operators, which play a crucialrole for the emergence of target space covariance. Performing the operatorproduct expansion on a curved world sheet allows us to obtain thenonperturbative contributions to the dilaton $\beta$ function. We find the$\beta$ functions, after suitable field redefinitions, to be related to atarget space effective action through a $\kappa$ function involvingderivatives. Also we can establish a nonperturbative Curci-Paffuti relationincluding the tachyon $\beta$ function.
