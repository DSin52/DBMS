Title: The Shimura-Taniyama Conjecture and Conformal Field Theory

Authors: Rolf Schimmrigk, Sean Underwood

The Shimura-Taniyama conjecture states that the Mellin transform of theHasse-Weil L-function of any elliptic curve defined over the rational numbersis a modular form. Recent work of Wiles, Taylor-Wiles andBreuil-Conrad-Diamond-Taylor has provided a proof of this longstandingconjecture. Elliptic curves provide the simplest framework for a class ofCalabi-Yau manifolds which have been conjectured to be exactly solvable. It isshown that the Hasse-Weil modular form determined by the arithmetic structureof the Fermat type elliptic curve is related in a natural way to a modular formarising from the character of a conformal field theory derived from an affineKac-Moody algebra.
