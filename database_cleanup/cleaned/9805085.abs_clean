Comments: latex, 30 pges

A free spinor field on a noncommutative sphere is described starting from acanonical realization of the enveloping algebra U(u(2|1)). The gauge extensionof the model - the Schwinger model on a noncommutative sphere is defined andthe model is quantized. The model contains only finite number degrees offreedom and is nonperturbatively UV-regular. The chiral anomaly and theeffective actions are calculated. In the nomcommutative limit standard formulasare recovered.
