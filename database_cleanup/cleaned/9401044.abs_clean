Two dimensional QCD coupled to fermions in the adjoint representation of thegauge group $SU(N)$, a useful toy model of QCD strings, is supersymmetric for acertain ratio of quark mass and gauge coupling constant. Here we study thetheory in the vicinity of the supersymmetric point; in particular we exhibitthe algebraic structure of the model and show that the mass splittings as onemoves away from the supersymmetric point obey a universal relation of the form${M_i}^2(B)-{M_i}^2(F)=M_i\delta m+O(\delta m^3)$. We discuss the connection ofthis relation to string and quark model expectations and verify it numericallyfor large $N$. At least for low lying states the $O(\delta m^3)$ correctionsare extremely small. We also discuss a natural generalization of QCD$_2$ withan infinite number of couplings, which preserves SUSY. This leads to a Landaulimit in which smooth worldsheets appear.
