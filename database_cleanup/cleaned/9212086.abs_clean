We use Hirota's method formulated as a recursive scheme to construct completeset of soliton solutions for the affine Toda field theory based on an arbitraryLie algebra. Our solutions include a new class of solitons connected with twodifferent type of degeneracies encountered in the Hirota's perturbationapproach. We also derive an universal mass formula for all Hirota's solutionsto the Affine Toda model valid for all underlying Lie groups. Embedding of theAffine Toda model in the Conformal Affine Toda model plays a crucial role inthis analysis.
