General permutation invariant statistics in the second quantized approach areconsidered. Simple interpolations between dual statistics are constructed.Particularly, we present a new minimal interpolation between parabosons andparafermions of any order. The connection with a simple mixing between bosonsand fermions is established. The construction is extended to anyonic-likestatistics.
