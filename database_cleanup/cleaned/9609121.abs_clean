Within the framework of semiclassical QCD approximations the short distancebehavior of two static color charges in (2+1)-dimensional QCD is discussed. Aclassical linearization of the field equations is exhibited and leads toanalytical results producing the static potential. Beyond the dominantclassical part proportional to ln lambda R, QCD contributions of order R^1/2and R are found.
