Utilizing techniques suggested by the recently obtained construction ofoff-shell spinning particles, we propose the arbitrary $N$-extension ofsupersymmetry for the KdV system. It is further suggested that the ${\aleph}_0$extension for the SKdV system provides a paradigm for {\underline {all}}supersymmetric completely integrable systems.
