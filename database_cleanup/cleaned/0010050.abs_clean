This work extends to the D-dimensional space-time the topological massgeneration mechanism of the nonabelian BF model in four dimensions. In order toconstruct the gauge invariant nonabelian kinetic terms for a (D-2)-form B and a1-form A, we introduce an auxiliary (D-3)-form V. Furthermore, we obtain acomplete set of BRST and anti-BRST transformation rules of the fields using theso called horizontality condition, and construct a BRST/anti-BRST invariantquantum action for the model in D-dimensional space-time.
