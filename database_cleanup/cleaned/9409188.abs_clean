We consider the interpretation in classical geometry of conformal fieldtheories constructed from orbifolds with discrete torsion. In examples we cananalyze, these spacetimes contain ``stringy regions'' that from a classicalpoint of view are singularities that are to be neither resolved nor blown up.Some of these models also give particularly simple and clear examples of mirrorsymmetry.
