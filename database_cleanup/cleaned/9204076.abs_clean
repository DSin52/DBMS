We show that baryons of three dimensional Quantum Chromodynamics can beunderstood as solitons of its effective lagrangian. In the parity preservingphase we study, these baryons are fermions for odd $N_c$ and bosons for even$N_c$, never anyons. We quantize the collective variables of the solitons andthere by calculate the flavor quantum numbers, magnetic moments and masssplittings of the baryon. The flavor quantum numbers are in agreement withnaive quark model for the low lying states. The magnetic moments and masssplittings are smaller in the soliton model by a factor of $\log {F_\pi\overN_c m_\pi}$. We also show that there is a dibaryon solution that is an analogueof the deuteron. These solitons can describe defects in a quantumanti--ferromagnet.
