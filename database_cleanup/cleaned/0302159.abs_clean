Electromagnetic plane waves provide examples of time-dependent open stringbackgrounds free of $\alpha'$ corrections. The solvable case of open strings ina quadrupolar wave front, analogous to pp-waves for closed strings, isdiscussed. In light-cone gauge, it leads to non-conformal boundary conditionssimilar to those induced by tachyon condensates. A maximum electric gradient isfound, at which macroscopic strings with vanishing tension are pair-produced --a non-relativistic analogue of the Born-Infeld critical electric field. Kineticinstabilities of quadrupolar electric fields are cured by standard atomicphysics techniques, and do not interfere with the former dynamic instability. Anew example of non-conformal open-closed duality is found. Propagation of openstrings in time-dependent wave fronts is discussed.
