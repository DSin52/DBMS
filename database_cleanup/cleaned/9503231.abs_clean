Title: Modular Invariance and the Finiteness of Superstring Theory

Comments: 35 pages, TeX, 2 figures. This is the July version with several

typographical corrections and 2 figures includedThe genus-dependence of multi-loop superstring amplitudes is bounded at largeorders in perturbation theory using the super-Schottky group parametrization ofsupermoduli space. Partial estimates of supermoduli space integrals suggest anexponential dependence on the genus when the integration region is restrictedto a single fundamental domain of the super-modular group in the super-Schottkyparameter space. Bounds for N-point superstring scattering amplitudes areobtained for arbitrary N and are shown to be consistent with exact resultsrecently obtained for special type II string amplitudes for orbifold orCalabi-Yau compactifications. It is suggested that the generic estimates, whichimply the validity of superstring perturbation theory in the weak-couplinglimit, might be used to determine scattering amplitudes at strong couplingbecause of the S-duality of type II and heterotic string theories.Non-perturbative effects are consistent with these estimates, based on a sumover closed surfaces, because they can be derived from an additionalcontribution to the sum over surfaces corresponding to the insertion ofDirichlet boundaries.
