Title: Conformal Covariance Subalgebras

Authors: Soeren Koester

Comments: 9 pages, no figures

We give a direct Lie algebraic characterisation of conformal inclusions ofchiral current algebras associated with compact, reductive Lie algebras. We usestraightforward quantum field theoretic arguments and prove a long standingconjecture of Schellekens and Warner on grounds of unitarity and positivity ofenergy. We explore the structures found to characterise ``conformal covariancesubalgebras'' and ``coset current algebras''.
