We show that a massive scalar field on a 2-dimensional Anti-De Sitter spacecan be mapped by means of a time-dependent canonical transformation into amassless free field theory when the mass square of the field is equal to minusthe curvature of the background metric. We also provide the (hidden) conformalsymmetry of the massive scalar field.
