An iterative scheme is set up for solving the loop equation of the hermitianone-matrix model with a multi-cut structure. Explicit results are presented forgenus one for an arbitrary but finite number of cuts. Due to the complicatedform of the boundary conditions, the loop correlators now contain ellipticintegrals. This demonstrates the existence of new universality classes for thehermitian matrix model. The two-cut solution is investigated in more detail,including the double-scaling limit. It is shown, that in special cases itdiffers from the known continuum solution with one cut.
