An introduction to supersymmetric (SUSY) solutions defined on the product ofRicci-flat spaces in D= 11 supergravity is presented. The paper contains some2^{-k}-splitting theorem that explains the appearance of N = 2^{-k} fractionalsupersymmetries. Examples of M2 and M5 branes on the product of two Ricci-flatspaces are considered and formulae for (fractional) numbers of unbroken SUSYare obtained.
