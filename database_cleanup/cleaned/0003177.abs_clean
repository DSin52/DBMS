We develop a systematic framework for studying target space duality at theclassical level. We show that target space duality between manifolds M andMtilde arises because of the existence of a very special symplectic manifold.This manifold locally looks like M x Mtilde and admits a double fibration. Weanalyze the local geometric requirements necessary for target space duality andprove that both manifolds must admit flat orthogonal connections. We show howabelian duality, nonabelian duality and Poisson-Lie duality are all specialcases of a more general framework. As an example we exhibit new (nonlinear)dualities in the case M = Mtilde = R^n.
