An affine vertex operator construction at arbitrary level is presented whichis based on a completely compactified chiral bosonic string whose momentumlattice is taken to be the (Minkowskian) affine weight lattice. Thisconstruction is manifestly physical in the sense of string theory, i.e., thevertex operators are functions of DDF ``oscillators'' and the Lorentzgenerators, both of which commute with the Virasoro constraints. We thereforeobtain explicit representations of affine highest weight modules in terms ofphysical (DDF) string states. This opens new perspectives on the representationtheory of affine Kac-Moody algebras, especially in view of the simultaneoustreatment of infinitely many affine highest weight representations of arbitrarylevel within a single state space as required for the study of hyperbolicKac-Moody algebras. A novel interpretation of the affine Weyl group as the``dimensional null reduction'' of the corresponding hyperbolic Weyl group isgiven, which follows upon re-expression of the affine Weyl translations asLorentz boosts.
