We show that $CPT$ is in general violated in a non-quantum-mechanical way inthe effective low-energy theory derived from string theory, as a result ofapparent world-sheet charge non-conservation induced by stringy monopolescorresponding to target-space black hole configurations. This modification ofquantum mechanics does not violate energy conservation. The magnitude of thiseffective spontaneous violation of $CPT$ may not be be far from the presentexperimental sensitivity in the neutral kaon system. We demonstrate that ourpreviously proposed stringy modifications to the quantum-mechanical descriptionof the neutral kaon system violate $CPT$, although in a different way from thatassumed in phenomenological analyses within conventional quantum mechanics. Weconstrain the novel $CPT$-violating parameters using available data on $K_L\rightarrow 2\pi$, $K_S \rightarrow 3\pi ^0$ and semileptonic $K_{L,S}$ decayasymmetries. We demonstrate that these data and an approximate treatment ofinterference effects in $K \rightarrow 2\pi $ decays are consistent with a {\itnon-vanishing} amount of $CPT$ violation at a level accessible to a new roundof experiments, and further data and/or analysis are required to exclude theextreme possibility that they dominate over $CP$ violation. Couldnon-quantum-field theoretical and non-quantum-mechanical $CPT$ violation usherin the long-awaited era of string phenomenology?}
