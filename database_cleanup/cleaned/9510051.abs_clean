Some inadequacy in the traditional description of the phenomenon ofelectro-magnetic field radiation created by a point charge moving along astraight line with an acceleration is found and discussed in this paper indetail. The possibility of simultaneous coexistence of Newton instantaneouslong-range interaction and Faraday-Maxwell short-rang interaction is pointedout.
