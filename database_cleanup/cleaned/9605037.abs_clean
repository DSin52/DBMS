The effective action of a SU(N)-gauge theory coupled to fermions is evaluatedat a large infrared cut-off scale k within the path integral approach. Thegauge field measure includes topologically non-trivial configurations(instantons). Due to the explicit infrared regularisation there are no gaugefield zero modes. The Dirac operator of instanton configurations shows a zeromode even after the infrared regularisation, which leads to U_A(1)-violatingterms in the effective action. These terms are calculated in the limit of largescales k.
