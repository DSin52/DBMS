This is the translation to appear in the "SUPERSYMMETRY 2000 - EncyclopaedicDictionary" of the original paper, published in March 1980, (C.R. Acad. Sci.Paris, Ser. A-B, 290, 1980) in which basic notions of noncommutative geometrywere introduced and applied to noncommutative tori. These include connectionson finite projective modules, their curvature, and the Chern character. Finiteprojective modules on the noncommutative two-torus $ \Tb^2_{\theta}$ wererealized as Schwartz spaces of vector valued functions on $\Rb$. Explicitconstant curvature connections were constructed and a basic integralityphenomenon of the total curvature was displayed. The pseudo-differentialcalculus and the Atiyah-Singer index theorems were extended to Lie groupactions on $C^*$ algebras and used to explain the above integrality of thetotal curvature by an index formula for finite difference-differentialoperators on the line. Recent interest in the hep-th literature for basicnotions of noncommutative geometry in the case of noncommutative tori (cf forinstance hep-th/0012145 for an excellent review) prompted us to make theEnglish translation of the original paper available.
