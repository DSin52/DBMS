We construct BPS states in the matrix description of M-theory. Starting froma set of basic M-theory branes, we study pair intersections which preservesupersymmetry. The fractions of the maximal supersymmetry obtained in this wayare 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 3/16 and 1/16. In explicit examples we establish that thematrix BPS states correspond to (intersecting) brane configurations that areobtained from the d=11 supersymmetry algebra. This correspondence for the 1/2supersymmetric branes includes the precise relations between the charges.
