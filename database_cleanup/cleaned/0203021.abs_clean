In two dimensional conformal field theory the generating functional forcorrelators of the stress-energy tensor is given by the non-local Polyakovaction associated with the background geometry. We study this functionalholographically by calculating the regularized on-shell action ofasymptotically AdS gravity in three dimensions, associated with a specified(but arbitrary) boundary metric. This procedure is simplified by making use ofthe Chern-Simons formulation, and a corresponding first-order expansion of thebulk dreibein, rather than the metric expansion of Fefferman and Graham. Thedependence of the resulting functional on local moduli of the boundary metricagrees precisely with the Polyakov action, in accord with the AdS/CFTcorrespondence. We also verify the consistency of this result with regard tothe nontrivial transformation properties of bulk solutions under Brown-Henneauxdiffeomorphisms.
