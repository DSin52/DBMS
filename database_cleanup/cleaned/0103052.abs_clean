Title: A New Mechanism for Trapping of Photon

Comments: 7 pages, LaTex 2e, no figures

We propose a new mechanism for trapping bulk gauge field, giving rise to amassless photon on a flat Minkowski 3-brane in the Randall-Sundrum model infive space-time dimensions. The mechanism we propose employs the topologicalHiggs mechansim where a topological term and a 3-form gauge potential play animportant role. This new mechanism might be considered as a gauge field'sanalog of the localization of bulk fermions with the mass term of a 'kink'profile.
