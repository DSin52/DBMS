Title: The D1-D5 brane system in six dimensions

Comments: 18 pages, RevTeX

We consider scattering of minimally coupled scalars from a six-dimensionalblack string carrying one and five brane charges but no Kaluza-Klein momentum.The leading correction to the absorption cross section is found by improvedmatching of inner and outer solutions to the wave equation. The world sheetinterpretation of this correction follows from the breaking of conformalinvariance by irrelevant Born-Infeld corrections. We note that discrepancies innormalisation are caused by there being two effective length scales in theblack string geometry but only one in the effective string model and comment onthe implications of our results for the effective string model.
