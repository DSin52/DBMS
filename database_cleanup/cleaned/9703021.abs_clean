The realizations of the exceptional non-linear (quadratically generated, orW-type) N=8 and N=7 superconformal algebras with Spin(7) and G_2 affinesymmetry currents are reviewed. Both the N=8 and N=7 algebras admit unitaryrealizations in terms of a single boson and free fermions in 8 of Spin(7) and 7of G_2, with the central charges c=26/5 and c=5, respectively. They also haverealizations over the coset spaces SO(8)XU(1)/SO(7) and SO(7)X U(1)/G_2 forsome fixed values of their central charges. The coset space SO(8)/SO(7) is theseven-sphere , whereas the space SO(7)/G_2 represents the seven-sphere withtorsion. We conclude with a discussion of a novel 'hybrid' method developedrecently that yields unitary realizations of the exceptional N=8 and N=7algebras for all allowed values of their central charges.
