Title: Vacuum Energy

additions for the second and third versions. First version 153 pages, 368references, Second version 161 pages, 399 references, Third version 167There appears to be three, perhaps related, ways of approaching the nature ofvacuum energy . The first is to say that it is just the lowest energy state ofa given, usually quantum, system. The second is to equate vacuum energy withthe Casimir energy. The third is to note that an energy difference from acomplete vacuum might have some long range effect, typically this energydifference is interpreted as the cosmological constant. All three approachesare reviewed, with an emphasis on recent work. It is hoped that this review iscomprehensive in scope. There is a discussion on whether there is a relationbetween vacuum energy and inertia. The solution suggested here to the nature ofthe vacuum is that Casimir energy can produce short range effects because ofboundary conditions, but that at long range there is no overall effect ofvacuum energy, unless one considers lagrangians of higher order than Einstein'sas vacuum induced. No original calculations are presented in support of thisposition. This is not a review of the cosmological constant {\it per se}, butrather vacuum energy in general, my approach to the cosmological constant isnot standard.
