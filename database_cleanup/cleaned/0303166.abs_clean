Title: Anomaly in conformal quantum mechanics

holesAuthors: Horacio E. Camblong and Carlos R. Ordonez

Comments: 4 pages

A number of physical systems exhibit asymptotic conformal invariance. Withina particular range of distances, they are characterized by an inverse squarepotential, the absence of dimensional scales, and an SO(2,1) symmetry algebra.Examples ranging from molecular physics to black holes are provided. For suchsystems, quantum symmetry breaking -- revealed by the failure of the symmetrygenerators to close the algebra -- is shown to be independent of therenormalization procedure.
