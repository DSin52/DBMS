We study toroidal compactification of Matrix theory, using ideas and resultsof non-commutative geometry. We generalize this to compactification on thenoncommutative torus, explain the classification of these backgrounds, andargue that they correspond in supergravity to tori with constant backgroundthree-form tensor field. The paper includes an introduction for mathematiciansto the IKKT formulation of Matrix theory and its relation to the BFSS Matrixtheory.
