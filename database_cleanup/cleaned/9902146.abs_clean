We discuss some aspects of cohomological properties of a two-dimensional freeAbelian gauge theory in the framework of BRST formalism. We derive theconserved and nilpotent BRST- and co-BRST charges and express the Hodgedecomposition theorem in terms of these charges and a conserved bosonic chargecorresponding to the Laplacian operator. It is because of the topologicalnature of free U(1) gauge theory that the Laplacian operator goes to zero whenequations of motion are exploited. We derive two sets of topological invariantswhich are related to each-other by a certain kind of duality transformation andexpress the Lagrangian density of this theory as the sum of terms that areBRST- and co-BRST invariants. Mathematically, this theory captures togethersome of the key features of Witten- and Schwarz type of topological fieldtheories.
