The representation theory of the group U(1,q) is discussed in detail becauseof its possible application in a quaternion version of the Salam-Weinbergtheory.As a consequence, from purely group theoretical arguments we demonstrate thatthe eigenvalues must be right-eigenvalues and that the only consistent scalarproducts are the complex ones. We also define an explicit quaternion tensorproduct which leads to a set of additional group representations for integer``spin''.
