Title: Symmetric Spaces with Conformal Symmetry

Authors: Andre Wehner

Comments: 16 pages

We consider an involutive automorphism of the conformal algebra and theresulting symmetric space. We display a new action of the conformal group whichgives rise to this space. The space has an intrinsic symplectic structure, agroup-invariant metric and connection, and serves as the model space for a newconformal gauge theory.
