The emitted power of the radiation from a charged particle moving uniformlyon a circle inside a cylindrical waveguide is considered. The expressions forthe energy flux of the radiation passing through the waveguide cross-sectionare derived for both TE and TM waves. The results of the numerical evaluationare presented for the number of emitted quanta depending on the waveguideradius, the radius of the charge rotation orbit and dielectric permittivity ofthe filling medium. These results are compared with the correspondingquantities for the synchrotron radiation in a homogeneous medium.
