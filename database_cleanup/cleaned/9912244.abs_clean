We study renormalization-group flow patterns in theories arising on D1-branesin various supersymmetry-breaking backgrounds. We argue that the theory of ND1-branes transverse to an orbifold space can be fine-tuned to flow to thecorresponding orbifold conformal field theory in the infrared, for particularvalues of the couplings and theta angles which we determine using the discretesymmetries of the model. By calculating various nonplanar contributions to thescalar potential in the worldvolume theory, we show that fine-tuning is in factrequired at finite N, as would be generically expected. We further comment onthe presence of singular conformal field theories (such as those whose targetspace includes a ``throat'' described by an exactly solvable CFT) in thenon-supersymmetric context. Throughout the analysis two applications aretechniques for studying worldsheet string theory.
