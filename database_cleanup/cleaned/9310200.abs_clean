Very recently Berkovits and Vafa have argued that the $N{=}0$ string is aparticular choice of background of the $N{=}1$ string. Under the assumptionthat the physical states of the $N{=}0$ string theory came essentially from thematter degrees of freedom, they proved that the amplitudes of both stringtheories agree. They also conjectured that this should persist whatever theform of the physical states. The aim of this note is to prove that boththeories have the same spectrum of physical states without making anyassumption on the form of the physical states. We also notice in passing thatthis result is reminiscent of a well-known fact in the theory of inducedrepresentations and we explore what repercussions this may have in the searchfor the universal string theory.
