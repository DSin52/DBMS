For the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) invariant extended action for anygauge theory, there exists another off-shell nilpotent symmetry. For lineargauges, it can be elevated to a symmetry of the quantum theory and used in theconstruction of the quantum effective action. Generalizations for nonlineargauges and actions with higher order ghost terms are also possible.
