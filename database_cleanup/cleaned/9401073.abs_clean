Title: Some Comments on QCD String

Authors: Michael R. Douglas (Rutgers)

Comments: RU-94-9. (harvmac, 9 pp.)

We try to draw lessons for higher dimensions from the string representationsrecently derived for large $N$ Yang-Mills theory by Gross and Taylor, Kostov,and others, and call attention to three characteristics that should be expectedcontinuous world-sheets; strong coupling at short distances; and negativeweights. To appear in the proceedings of the Strings '93 Berkeley conference.
