We show that it is possible to obtain the Gross-Neveu model in 1+1 dimensionsfrom gauge fields only. This is reminiscent of the fact that in 1+1 dimensionsthe gauge field tensor is essentially a pseudo-scalar. We also show that it ispossible in this context to combine the Gross-Neveu model with the massiveSchwinger model in the limit where the fermion mass is larger than the electriccharge.
