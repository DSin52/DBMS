{}From the ordinary tensile string we derive a geometric action for thetensionless ($T=0$) string and discuss its symmetries and field equations. TheWeyl symmetry of the usual string is shown to be replaced by a globalspace-time conformal symmetry in the $T\to 0$ limit. We present the explicitexpressions for the generators of this group in the light-cone gauge. Usingthese, we quantize the theory in an operator form and require the conformalsymmetry to remain a symmetry of the quantum theory. Modulo details concerningzero-modes that are discussed in the paper, this leads to the stringentrestriction that the physical states should be singlets under space-timediffeomorphisms, hinting at a topological theory. We present the details of thecalculation that leads to this conclusion.
