We present a general description of two mixed branes interactions. For thiswe consider two mixed branes with dimensions p_1 and p_2, in external fieldB_{\mu\nu} and arbitrary gauge fields A^1_{\alpha_1} and A^2_{\alpha_2} on theworld volume of them, in spacetime in which some of its directions arecompactified on circles with different radii. Some examples are considered toclear these general interactions. Finally contribution of the massless stateson the interactions is extracted. Closed string with mixed boundary conditionsand boundary state formalism, provide useful tools for calculation of theseinteractions.
