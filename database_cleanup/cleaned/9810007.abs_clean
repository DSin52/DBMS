Title: A proposal for a generalized canonical osp(1,2) quantization of

dynamical systems with constraintsAuthors: Petr M. Lavrov, Jorge Ananias Neto and Wilson Oliveira

Comments: Revised version. To appear in Mod.Phys.Lett.A

The aim of this paper is to consider a possibility of constructing forarbitrary dynamical systems with first-class constraints a generalizedcanonical quantization method based on the osp(1,2) supersymmetry principle.This proposal can be considered as a counterpart to the osp(1,2)-covariantLagrangian quantization method introduced recently by Geyer, Lavrov andM\"ulsch. The gauge dependence of Green's functions is studied. It is shownthat if the parameter m^2 of the osp(1,2) superalgebra is not equal to zerothen the vacuum functional and S-matrix depend on the gauge. In the limit $m\to0$ the gauge independence of vacuum functional and S - matrix are restored. TheWard identities related to the osp(1,2) symmetry are derived.
