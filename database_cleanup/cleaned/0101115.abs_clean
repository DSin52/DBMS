We consider the 3+1 visible sector to live on a Hanany-Witten D-braneconstruction in type IIA string theory. The messenger sector consists ofstretched strings from the visible brane to a hidden D6-brane in the extraspatial dimensions. In the open string channel supersymmetry is broken by gaugemediation while in the closed string channel supersymmetry is broken by gravitymediation. Hence, we call this kind of mediation ``string mediation''. Wedetached probe branes can break supersymmetry without generating a tachyon.Fermion masses are generated at one loop if the branes break a sufficientamount of the ten dimensional Lorentz group while scalar potentials aregenerated if there is a force between the visible brane and the hidden brane.Scalars can be lifted at two loops through a combination of brane bending andbrane forces. We find a large class of stable non-supersymmetric braneconfigurations of ten dimensinoal string theory.
