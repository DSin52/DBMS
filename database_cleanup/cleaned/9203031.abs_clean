The exact black hole solution of 2D closed string theory has, as any othermaximally extended Schwarzschild-like geometry, two asymptotically flatspacetime domains. One can get rid of the second domain by gauging the discretesymmetry on the SL(2,R)/U(1) coset that interchanges the two asymptotic domainsand preserves the Kruskal time orientation everywhere in the Kruskal plane.Here it is shown that upon performing this orbifold procedure, we obtain atheory of unoriented open and closed strings in a black hole background, withjust one asymptotically flat domain and a time-like orbifold singularity at theorigin. All of the open string states of the model are confined to the orbifoldsingularity. We also discuss various physical aspects of the truncated blackhole, in particular its target duality -- the model is dual to a conventionalopen string theory in the black hole geometry.
