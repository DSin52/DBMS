Recently, we presented a new class of quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians which$F=2,3,...\,.$ This construction, called fractional supersymmetric quantummechanics, was realized in terms of a paragrassmann variable $\theta$ of order$F$, which satisfies $\theta^F=0$. Here, we present an alternative realizationof such an algebra in which the internal space of the Hamiltonians is describedby a tensor product of two paragrassmann variables of orders $F$ and $F-1$respectively. In particular, we find $q$-deformed relations (where $q$ areroots of unity) between different conserved charges. (To appear in"Mod.Phys.Lett.A")
