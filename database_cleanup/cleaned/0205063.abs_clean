Phase Space is the framework best suited for quantizing superintegrablesystems, naturally preserving the symmetry algebras of the respectivehamiltonian invariants. The power and simplicity of the method is fullyillustrated through new applications to nonlinear sigma models, specificallyfor de Sitter N-spheres and Chiral Models, where the symmetric quantumhamiltonians amount to compact and elegant expressions. Additional power andelegance is provided by the use of Nambu Brackets to incorporate the extrainvariants of superintegrable models. Some new classical results are given forthese brackets, and their quantization is successfully compared to that ofMoyal, validating Nambu's original proposal.
