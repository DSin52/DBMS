We generalise the notions of supersymmetry and superspace by allowinggenerators and coordinates transforming according to more general Lorentzrepresentations than the spinorial and vectorial ones of standard lore. Thisyields novel SO(3,1)-covariant superspaces, which we call hyperspaces, havingdimensionality greater than (4|4) of traditional super-Minkowski space. As anapplication, we consider gauge fields on complexifications of thesesuperspaces; and extending the concept of self-duality, we obtain classes ofcompletely solvable equations analogous to the four-dimensional self-dualityequations.
