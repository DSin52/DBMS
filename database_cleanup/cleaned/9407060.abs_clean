We investigate a modification of the 2+1 dimensional abelian Chern-Simonstheory, obtained by adding a Proca mass term to the gauge field. We areparticularly interested in the infrared limit, which can be described by two{\it a priori} different "topological" quantum mechanical models. We applymethods of equivariant cohomology and the ensuing supersymmetry to analyze thepartition functions of these quantum mechanical models. In particular, we findthat a previously discussed phase-space reductive limiting procedure whichrelates these two models can be seen as a direct consequence of oursupersymmetry.
