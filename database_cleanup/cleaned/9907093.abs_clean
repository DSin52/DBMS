In a recent paper Klebanov and Witten (hep-th/9905104) proposed to formulatethe AdS/CFT correspondence principle by taking an "irregular boundarycondition" for a scalar field. In this paper we generalize this idea to thecase of spinor field with interaction. The action functional following from thechoice of irregular boundary conditions and which must be used in the AdS/CFTcorrespondence is related to the usual action by a Legendre transform. For thenew theory we found the modified Green's function that must be used forinternal lines in calculating higher order graphs. It is proved that theconsiderations are valid to all orders in perturbation theory.
