From the equivalence of the bosonic and fermionic representations offinitized characters in conformal field theory, one can extract mathematicalobjects known as Bailey pairs. Recently Berkovich, McCoy and Schilling haveconstructed a `generalized' character formula depending on two parameters $\ra$and $\r2$, using the Bailey pairs of the unitary model $M(p-1,p)$. By takingappropriate limits of these parameters, they were able to obtain the charactersof model $M(p,p+1)$, $N=1$ model $SM(p,p+2)$, and the unitary $N=2$ model withcentral charge $c=3(1-{\frac{2}{p}})$. In this letter we computed the effectivecentral charge associated with this `generalized' character formula using asaddle point method. The result is a simple expression in dilogarithms whichinterpolates between the central charges of these unitary models.
