Static solutions of the higher dimensional Einstein-Hilbert gravitysupplemented by quadratic curvature self-interactions are discussed in thepresence of hedgehog configurations along the transverse dimensions. Thequadratic part of the action is parametrized in terms of the (ghost-free)Euler-Gauss-Bonnet curvature invariant. Spherically symmetric profiles of thetransverse metric admit exponentially decaying warp factors both for positiveand negative bulk cosmological constants.
