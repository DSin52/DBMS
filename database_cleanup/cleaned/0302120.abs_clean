We survey noncommutative spacetimes with coordinates being envelopingalgebras of Lie algebras. We also explain how to do differential geometry onnoncommutative spaces that are obtained from commutative ones via aMoyal-product type cocycle twist, such as the noncommutative torus,$\theta$-spaces and Clifford algebras. The latter are noncommutativedeformations of the finite lattice $(Z_2)^n$ and we compute theirnoncommutative de Rham cohomology and moduli of solutions of Maxwell'sequations. We exactly quantize noncommutative U(1)-Yang-Mills theory on$Z_2\times Z_2$ in a path integral approach.
