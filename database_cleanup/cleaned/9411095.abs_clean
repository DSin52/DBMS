In this letter we discuss the relation of four-dimensional, $N=2$supersymmetric string backgrounds to integrable models. In particular we showthat non-K\"ahlerian gravitational backgrounds with one $U(1)$ isometry plusnon-trivial antisymmetric tensor and dilaton fields arise as the solutions ofthe Liouville equation or, for the case of vanishing central charge deficit, asthe solutions of the continual Toda equation. When performing an Abelianduality transformation, a particular class of solutions of the continual Todaequation leads to the well-known gravitational Eguchi-Hanson instantonbackground with self-dual curvature tensor.
