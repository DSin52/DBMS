We introduce the notion of rational Hopf algebras that we think are able todescribe the superselection symmetries of two dimensional rational quantumfield theories. As an example we show that a six dimensional rational Hopfalgebra $H$ can reproduce the fusion rules, the conformal weights, the quantumdimensions and the representation of the modular group of the chiral Isingmodel. $H$ plays the role of the global symmetry algebra of the chiral Isingrepresentation $\pi$ on $\HS_\pi$ of it is given, which contains the $c=1/2$unitary representations of the Virasoro algebra as subrepresentations; 2) theembedding $U\colon H\to\BOH$ is such that the observable algebra $\pi(\OA)^-$is the invariant subalgebra of $\BOH$ with respect to the left adjoint actionof $H$ and $U(H)$ is the commutant of $\pi(\OA)$; 3) there exist $H$-covariantprimary fields in $\BOH$, which obey generalized Cuntz algebra properties andintertwine between the inequivalent sectors of the observables.
