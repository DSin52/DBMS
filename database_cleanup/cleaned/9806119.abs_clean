I consider the (2+1)-dimensional Kerr-De Sitter space and its statisticalentropy computation. It is shown that this space has only one (cosmological)event horizon and there is a phase transition between the stable horizon andthe evaporating horizon at a point $M^2={1/3}J^2/l^2$ together with a lowerbound of the horizon temperature. Then, I compute the statistical entropy ofthe space by using a recently developed formulation of Chern-Simons theory withboundaries, and extended Cardy's formula. This is in agreement with thethermodynamics formula.
