Gravitational perturbations of anti-deSitter spacetime play important rolesin AdS/CFT correspondence and the brane world scenario. In this paper, wedevelop a gauge-invariant formalism of gravitational perturbations of maximallysymmetric spacetimes including anti-deSitter spacetime. Existence ofscalar-type master variables is shown and the corresponding master equationsare derived.
