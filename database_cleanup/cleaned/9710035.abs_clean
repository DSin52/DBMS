Title: Size of Black Holes through Polymer Scaling

Comments: Latex file, 8 pages

Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B424 (1998) 39-42

We imagine the strings on the stretched horizon of any $d$ space-timedimensional black hole to be bits of polymer. Then, proposing an interactionbetween these bits we obtain the size of the configuration, and thus of theblack hole, using the scaling laws. The transition from a typical black holestate to a typical string state has a simple explanation, which also holds forthe extremal black holes.
