A matrix model is constructed which describes a chiral version of the large$N$ $U(N)$ gauge theory on a two-dimensional sphere of area $A$. This theoryhas three separate phases. The large area phase describes the associated chiralstring theory. An exact expression for the free energy in the large area phaseis used to derive a remarkably simple formula for the number of topologicallyinequivalent covering maps of a sphere with fixed branch points and degree $n$.
