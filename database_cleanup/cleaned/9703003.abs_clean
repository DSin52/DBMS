Recent results on duality between string theories and connectedness of theirmoduli spaces seem to go a long way toward establishing the uniqueness of anunderlying theory. For the large class of Calabi-Yau 3-folds that can beembedded as hypersurfaces in toric varieties the proof of mathematicalconnectedness via singular limits is greatly simplified by using polytopes thatare maximal with respect to certain single or multiple weight systems. Weidentify the multiple weight systems occurring in this approach. We show thatall of the corresponding Calabi-Yau manifolds are connected among themselvesand to the web of CICY's. This almost completes the proof of connectedness fortoric Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces.
