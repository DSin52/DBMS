Following work on theories with SU(N) gauge groups, we perform a large-Nsaddle-point approximation of the measure for ADHM multi-instantons in N=4supersymmetric gauge theories with symplectic or orthogonal gauge groups. ForSp(N) we find that a saddle-point only exists in the even instanton chargesector. For either Sp(N) or SO(N) the saddle-point solution parametrizes AdS_5x RP^5, the dual supergravity geometry in the AdS/CFT correspondence for thesetheories. The instanton measure at large-N has the form of the partitionfunction of ten-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory with a unitarygauge group dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions.
