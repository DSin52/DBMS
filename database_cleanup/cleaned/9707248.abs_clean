Critical dynamics of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, coupled to a constantelectromagnetic field in D=2, 3, and 4, is reconsidered from a viewpoint ofinfrared behavior and vacuum instability. The latter is associated withconstant electric fields and cannot be avoidable in the nonperturbativeframework obtained through the proper time method. As for magnetic fields, aninfrared cut-off is essential to investigate the critical phenomena. The resultreconfirms the fact that the critical coupling in D=3 and 4 goes to zero evenunder an infinitesimal magnetic field. There also shows that a non-vanishing$F_{\mu\nu}\widetilde F^{\mu\nu}$ causes instability. A perturbation withrespect to external fields is adopted to investigate critical quantities, butthe resultant asymptotic expansion excellently matches with the exact value.
