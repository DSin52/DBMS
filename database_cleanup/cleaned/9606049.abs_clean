Using the heterotic--type II duality of $N=2$ string vacua in four space-timedimensions we study non-perturbative couplings of toroidally compactifiedsix-dimensional heterotic vacua. In particular, the heterotic--heterotic$S$-duality and the Coulomb branch of tensor multiplets observed in sixdimensions are studied from a four-dimensional point of view. We explicitlycompute the couplings of the vector multiplets of several type II vacua andinvestigate the implications for their heterotic duals.
