obeys a simple law in galilean frames, but how does the galilean character ofthe frame manifest itself at the place of the particle? A description of vacuumas a system of virtual particles will help to answer this question. For futureapplication to such a description, the notion of global particle is defined andstudied. To this end, a systematic use of the Fourier transformation on thePoincare group is needed. The state of a system of n free particles isrepresented by a statistical operator W, which defines an operator-valuedmeasure on the n-th power of the dual of the Poincare group. The inverseFourier-Stieltjes transform of that measure is called the characteristicfunction of the system; it is a function on the n-th power of the Poincarerestriction of the characteristic function to the diagonal subgroup ; itrepresents the state of the system, considered as a single particle. The mainproperties of characteristic functions, and particularly of globalcharacteristic functions, are studied. A mathematical Appendix defines twofunctional spaces involved.
