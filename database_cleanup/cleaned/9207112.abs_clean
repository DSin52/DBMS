We suggest a method to compute leading contribution at Planckian energies forsuperstring scattering amplitudes of any genus. In particular we test themethod at one-loop level by comparison with previous result for the Reggetrajectory renormalization. Modular invariance of these asymptotic terms arealso discussed.
