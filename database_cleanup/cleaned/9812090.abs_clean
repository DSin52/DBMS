Recently we have proposed a set of variables for describing the infraredlimit of four dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. here we extend thesevariables to the general case of four dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills theory. Wefind that the SU(N) connection A decomposes according to irreduciblerepresentations of SO(N-1) and the curvature two-form F is related to thesymplectic Kirillov two forms that characterize irreducible representations ofSU(N). We propose a general class of nonlinear chiral models that may describestable, soliton-like configurations with nontrivial topological numbers.
