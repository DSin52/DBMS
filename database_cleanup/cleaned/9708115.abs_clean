Massless Majorana fermions in the adjoint representation of SU(N_c) areexpected to screen gauge interactions in 1+1 dimensions, analogous to a similarHiggs phenomena known for 1+1-dimensional U(1) gauge theory with masslessfundamental fermions (Schwinger model). Using the light-cone formalism andlarge-N_c limit, a non-abelian analogue of the Schwinger boson is shown to beresponsible for the screening between heavy test charges. This adjoint bosondoes not exist simply as a physical state, but boundstates are built entirelyfrom this particle.
