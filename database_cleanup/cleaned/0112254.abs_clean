We study the collision between a BTZ black hole and a test particle coupledto a scalar field. We compute the power spectrum, the energy radiated and theplunging waveforms for this process. We show that for late times the signal isdominated by the quasinormal ringing. In terms of the AdS/CFT correspondencethe bulk gravity process maps into a thermal state, an expanding bubble andgauge particles decaying into bosons of the associated operator. These latterthermalize in a timescale predicted by the bulk theory.
