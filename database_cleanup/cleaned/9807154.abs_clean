Title: A Note on the Hitchin System in a Background B-field

Comments: 10 pages, harvmac file, no figures, added references

The space of solutions to the Hitchin equations on the dual torus withpunctures determines the Higgs branch of certain impurity theories. Analternative description of this Higgs branch is provided, in terms of theproper deformation of Hitchin system with deformation parameter given by a$B$-field. For the dual torus minus the singular points we construct explicitsolutions to the B-deformed Hitchin equations by reducing them to principalchiral model equations and then using deformation quantization methods.
