Title: Link Invariants, Holonomy Algebras and Functional Integration

Comments: 22 pages

Given a principal G-bundle over a smooth manifold M, with G a compact Liegroup, and given a finite-dimensional unitary representation of G, one maydefine an algebra of functions on the space of connections modulo gaugetransformations, the ``holonomy Banach algebra'' H_b, by completing an algebragenerated by regularized Wilson loops. Elements of the dual H_b* may beregarded as a substitute for measures on the space of connections modulo gaugetransformations. There is a natural linear map from diffeomorphism- invariantelements of H_b* to the space of complex-valued ambient isotopy invariants offramed oriented links in M. Moreover, this map is one-to-one. Similar resultshold for a C*-algebraic analog, the ``holonomy C*-algebra.'' These resultsclarify the relation between diffeomorphism-invariant gauge theories and linkinvariants, and the framing dependence of the expectation values of products ofWilson loops.
