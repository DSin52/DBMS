Title: On Charged Strings and their Networks

Authors: Alok Kumar and Sudipta Mukherji

Comments: 11 pages, no figure

We investigate properties of several string networks in $D < 10$ which carryelectric currents as well as electrostatic charge densities. We show theelectric-current conservations as well as the force-balance condition of thestring tensions on 3-string junctions in these networks. We also show theconsistency of the above string networks from their world-volume point of viewby comparing the world-volume energy-density with the induced worldsheet energydensity of the supergravity solution. Finally, we present new chargedmacroscopic string solutions in type II theories in D=8 and discuss certainissues related to their network construction.
