We investigate quantum aspects of Gopakumar-Minwalla-Strominger (GMS)solutions of noncommutative field theory (NCFT) at large noncommutativitylimit, $\theta \to \infty$. Building upon a quantitative map between operatorformulation of 2-(respectively, (2+1))-dimensional NCFTs and large $N$ matrixmodels of $c=0$ (respectively, $c=1$) noncritical strings, we show that GMSsolutions are quantum mechanically sensible only if we make appropriate jointscaling of $\theta$ and $N$. For 't Hooft's planar scaling, GMS solutions arereplaced by large $N$ saddle-point solutions. GMS solutions are recovered fromsaddle-point solutions at small 't Hooft coupling regime, but are destabilizedat large 'tHooft coupling regime by quantum effects. We make comparisonsbetween these large $N$ effects and recently studied infrared effects in NCFTs.We estimate U(N) symmetry breaking gradient effects and argue that they aresuppressed only at small 't Hooft coupling regime.
