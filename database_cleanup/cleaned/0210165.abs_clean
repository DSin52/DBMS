Constant ProblemAuthors: Robert H. Brandenberger

Energy', IAP Paris, July 1 - 5, 2002; 10 pagesThe presence of cosmological fluctuations influences the background cosmologyin which the perturbations evolve. This back-reaction arises as a second ordereffect in the cosmological perturbation expansion. The effect is cumulative inthe sense that all fluctuation modes contribute to the change in the backgroundgeometry, and as a consequence the back-reaction effect can be large even ifthe amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is small. We review two approachesused to quantify back-reaction. In the first approach, the effect of thefluctuations on the background is expressed in terms of an effectiveenergy-momentum tensor. We show that in the context of an inflationarybackground cosmology, the long wavelength contributions to the effectiveenergy-momentum tensor take the form of a negative cosmological constant, whoseabsolute value increases as a function of time since the phase space ofinfrared modes is increasing. This then leads to the speculation thatgravitational back-reaction may lead to a dynamical cancellation mechanism fora bare cosmological constant, and yield a scaling fixed point in the asymptoticfuture in which the remnant cosmological constant satisfies $\Omega_{\Lambda}\sim 1$. We then discuss how infrared modes effect local observables (asopposed to mathematical background quantities) and find that the leadinginfrared back-reaction contributions cancel in single field inflationarymodels. However, we expect non-trivial back-reaction of infrared modes inmodels with more than one matter field.
