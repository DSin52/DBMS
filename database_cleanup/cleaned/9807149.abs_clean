Title: Near-horizon geometries of supersymmetric branes

Authors: Jose M Figueroa-O'Farrill

Comments: 11 pages (v2

Geometry; Mathematical PhysicsThis is the written version of my talk at SUSY '98. It presents a geometriccharacterisation of the allowed near-horizon geometries of supersymmetricbranes. We focus primarily on the M2-brane, but results for other branes (e.g.,the D3-brane) are also presented. Some new examples are discussed.
