We extend strong/weak coupling duality to string theories without spacetimesupersymmetry, and focus on the case of the unique ten-dimensional,nonsupersymmetric, tachyon-free $SO(16)\times SO(16)$ heterotic string. Weconstruct a tachyon-free heterotic string model that interpolates smoothlybetween this string and the ten-dimensional supersymmetric $SO(32)$ heteroticstring, and we construct a dual for this interpolating model. We find that theperturbative massless states of our dual theories precisely match within acertain range of the interpolation. Further evidence for this proposed dualitycomes from a calculation of the one-loop cosmological constant in boththeories, as well as the presence of a soliton in the dual theory. This istherefore the first known duality relation between nonsupersymmetrictachyon-free string theories. Using this duality, we then investigate theperturbative and nonperturbative stability of the $SO(16)\times SO(16)$ string,and present a conjecture concerning its ultimate fate.
