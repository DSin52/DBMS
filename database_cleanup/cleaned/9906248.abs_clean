Journal-ref: JHEP 0102 (2001) 013

We present several non-trivial examples of the three-dimensional quantumNambu bracket which involve square matrices or three-index objects. Ourthey are skew-symmetric and they obey the Fundamental Identity. We contrast ourapproach to the existing literature on the quantum deformations of Nambumechanics. We also discuss possible applications of our results in M-theory.
