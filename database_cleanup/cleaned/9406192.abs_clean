\noindent Using hydrodynamic collective field theory approach we show thatone-particle density matrix of the $\nu=1/m$ fractional quantum Hall edge stateinterpolates between chiral Luttinger liquid behavior $\langle\psi^{\dagger}(r) \psi(0) \rangle \sim r^{-m} $ and Calogero-Sutherland modelbehavior $\langle \psi^{\dagger}(r) \psi(0) \rangle \sim r^{-(m+1/m)/2} $ asthe droplet width is varied continuously. Low-energy excitations are describedby $c=1$ conformal field theory of a compact boson of radius $\sqrt m$. Theresult suggests complementary relation between the two-dimensional quantum Halldroplet and the one-dimensional Calogero-Sutherland model.
