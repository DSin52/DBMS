Title: IIB Soliton Spectra with All Fluxes Activated

Authors: Jarah Evslin

Comments: 34 pages, 7 eps figures

Building upon an earlier proposal for the classification of fluxes, asequence is proposed which generalizes the AHSS by computing type IIB stringtheory's group of conserved RR and also NS charges, which is conjectured to bea K-theory of dual pairs. As a test, the formalism of Maldacena, Moore andSeiberg (hep-th/0108100) is applied to classify D-branes, NS5-branes, F-stringsand their dielectric counterparts in IIB compactified on a 3-sphere with bothNS and RR background fluxes. The soliton spectra on the 3-sphere are thencompared with the output of the sequence, as is the baryon spectrum in Witten'snon-spin^c example, AdS^5xRP^5. The group of conserved charges is seen tochange during Brown-Teitelboim-like phase transitions which change theeffective cosmological constant.
