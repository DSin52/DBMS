The superfield formulation of type II Green-Schwarz superstring with n= (1,0)worldsheet supersymmetry is constructed. It is shown that the inclusion of thesecond spinor coordinate in the target superspase leads to the possibility ofthe reparametrization invariant description of the superstring in the absenceof any field from the two dimensional supergravity multiplet. The twistor-likeaction of Chern-Simons type for bosonic string in D=3,4,6,10 is obtained fromthe component form of the superstring action.
