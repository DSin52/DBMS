In this paper we study K3 compactification of ten-dimensional massive typeIIA theory with all possible Ramond-Ramond background fluxes turned on. Theresulting six-dimensional theory is a new massive (gauged) supergravity with anaction that is manifestly invariant under an O(4,20) / (O(4) times O(20))duality symmetry. We discover that this six-dimensional theory interpolatesbetween vacua of ten-dimensional massive IIA supergravity and vacua of masslessIIA supergravity with appropriate background fluxes turned on. This in turnsuggests a new 11-dimensional interpretation for the massive type IIA theory.
