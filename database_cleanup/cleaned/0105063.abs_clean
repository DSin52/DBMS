I point out that (BPS saturated) A-type D-branes in superstringcompactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds correspond to {\em graded} specialLagrangian submanifolds, a particular case of the graded Lagrangiansubmanifolds considered by M. Kontsevich and P. Seidel. Combining this with thecategorical formulation of cubic string field theory in the presence ofD-branes, I consider a collection of {\em topological} D-branes wrapped overthe same Lagrangian cycle and {\em derive} its string field action from firstprinciples. The result is a {\em $\Z$-graded} version of super-Chern-Simonsfield theory living on the Lagrangian cycle, whose relevant string field is adegree one superconnection in a $\Z$-graded superbundle, in the sensepreviously considered in mathematical work of J. M. Bismutt and J. Lott. Thisgives a refined (and modified) version of a proposal previously made by C.Vafa. I analyze the vacuum deformations of this theory and relate them totopological D-brane composite formation, by using the general formalismdeveloped in a previous paper. This allows me to identify a large class oftopological D-brane composites (generalized, or `exotic' topological D-branes)which do not admit a traditional description. Among these are objects whichcorrespond to the `covariantly constant sequences of flat bundles' consideredby Bismut and Lott, as well as more general structures, which are related tothe enhanced triangulated categories of Bondal and Kapranov. I also give arough sketch of the relation between this construction and the large radiuslimit of a certain version of the `derived category of Fukaya's category'.
