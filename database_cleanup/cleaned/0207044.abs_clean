We define a sequence of VSFT D-branes whose low energy limit leads exactly toa corresponding sequence of GMS solitons. The D-branes are defined by acting ona fixed VSFT lump with operators defined by means of Laguerre polynomials whoseargument is quadratic in the string creation operators. The states obtained inthis way form an algebra under the SFT star product, which is isomorphic to acorresponding algebra of GMS solitons under the Moyal product. In order toobtain a regularized field theory limit we embed the theory in a constantbackground B field.
