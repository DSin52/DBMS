Title: q-Integration on Quantum Spaces

Authors: Hartmut Wachter

Comments: 44 pages

In this article we present formulae for q-integration on quantum spaces whichcould be of particular importance in physics, i.e. q-deformed Minkowski spaceand q-deformed Euclidean space in 3 or 4 dimensions. Furthermore, our formulaecan be regarded as a generalization of Jackson's q-integral to 3 and 4dimensions.
