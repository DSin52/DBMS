In this paper the elliptic genus for a general Calabi-Yau fourfold isderived. The recent work of Kawai calculating N=2 heterotic string one-loopthreshold corrections with a Wilson line turned on is extended to a similarcomputation where K3 is replaced by a general Calabi-Yau 3- or 4-fold. In allcases there seems to be a generalized Kac-Moody algebra involved, whosedenominator formula appears in the result.
