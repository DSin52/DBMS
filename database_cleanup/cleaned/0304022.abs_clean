We investigate a large class of supersymmetric magnetic brane solutionssupported by U(1) gauge fields in AdS gauged supergravities. We obtainfirst-order equations in terms of a superpotential. In particular, we findsystems which interpolate between AdS_{D-2}\times \Omega^2 (where \Omega^2=S^2or H^2) in the horizon and AdS_D-type geometry in the asymptotic region, for4\le D\le 7. The boundary geometry of the AdS_D-type metric isMinkowski_{D-3}\times \Omega^2. This provides smooth supergravity solutions forwhich the boundary of the AdS spacetime compactifies spontaneously. Thesesolutions indicate the existence of a large class of superconformal fieldtheories in diverse dimensions whose renormalization group flow runs from theUV to the IR fixed point. We show that the same set of first-order equationsalso admits solutions which are asymptotically AdS_{D-2}\times \Omega^2 butsingular at small distance. This implies that the stationary AdS_{D-2}\times\Omega^2 solutions typically lie on the inflection points of the modulus space.
