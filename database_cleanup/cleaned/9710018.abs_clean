Title: Spherical Curvature Inhomogeneities in String Cosmology

Authors: John D. Barrow, Kerstin E. Kunze

Comments: 19 pages, Latex, 4 figures

We study the evolution of non-linear spherically symmetric inhomogeneities instring cosmology. Friedmann solutions of different spatial curvature arematched to produce solutions which describe the evolution of non-linear densityand curvature inhomogeneities. The evolution of bound and unboundinhomogeneities are studied. The problem of primordial black hole formation isdiscussed in the string cosmological context and the pattern of evolution isdetermined in the pre- and post-big-bang phases of evolution.
