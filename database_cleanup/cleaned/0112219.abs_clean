We construct new D-brane bound states using charged macroscopic type IIBstring solutions.A generic bound state solution, when dimensionally reduced,carries multiple gauge charges. Starting with D=9 charged macroscopic strings,we obtain solutions in D=10, which are interpreted as carrying (F, D0, D2)charges as well as nonzero momenta. The masses and charges are also explicitlyshown to satisfy the non-threshold bound of 1/2 BPS objects. Our solutionsreduce to the known D-brane bound state solutions with appropriate restrictionsin the parameter space. We further generalize the results to (Dp- D(p+2)) boundstate in IIA/B theories, giving an explicit example with p=1.
