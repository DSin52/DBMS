We present a metric solution in six dimensions where gravity is localized ona four-dimensional singular string-like defect. The corrections tofour-dimensional gravity from the bulk continuum modes are suppressed by ${\calO}(1/r^3)$. No tuning of the bulk cosmological constant to the brane tension isrequired in order to cancel the four-dimensional cosmological constant.
