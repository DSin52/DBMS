Title: Macdonald's polynomials and representations of quantum groups

Comments: 20 pages, no figures

In this paper we present a formula for Macdonald's polynomials for the rootsystem A(n-1) which arises from the representation theory of quantum sl(n).This formula expresses Macdonald's polynomials via (weighted) traces ofintertwining operators between certain modules over quantum sl(n). We alsodescribe the commutative system of Macdonald's difference operators using thegenerators of the center of the quantum universal enveloping algebra, and usethis description to prove a trace formula for generic eigenfunctions of theseoperators. These functions are generalized q-hypergeometric functions which arerelated to solutions of the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations.
