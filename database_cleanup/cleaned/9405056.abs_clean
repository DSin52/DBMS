Title: Quantum Cohomology of Partial Flag Manifolds and a Residue Formula for

Their Intersection ParingsComments: 13 pages

As a generalization of our previous paper [GK], we formulate a residueformula and some simple behaviors of equivariant quantum cohomology applying tocompute the quantum cohomology of partial flag manifolds $F_{k_1,\cdots , k_l}$with a try to give a rigorous definition of equivariant quantum cohomology.
