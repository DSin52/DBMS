In two space-time dimensions, there is a theory of Lorentzian quantum gravitywhich can be defined by a rigorous, non-perturbative path integral and isinequivalent to the well-known theory of (Euclidean) quantum Liouville gravity.ii) it remains consistent when coupled to matter, even beyond the c=1 barrier,iii) it is closer to canonical quantization approaches than previouspath-integral formulations, and iv) its construction generalizes to higherdimensions.
