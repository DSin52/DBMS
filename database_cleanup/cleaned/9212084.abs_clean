Title: Fusion algebra and Verlinde's formula

Comments: 9 pages

We show that the coefficients of decomposition into an irreducible componentsof the tensor powers of level $r$ symmetric algebra of adjoint representationcoincide with the Verlinder numbers. Also we construct (for $sl(2)) therepresentations of a general linear group those dimensions are given bycorresponding Verlinde's numbers.
