Title: Perturbation theory in the invariant subspace

Comments: 17 p., LaTex, no figurs

The unitary transformation of path-integral differential measure isdescribed. The main properties of perturbation theory in the phase space ofaction-angle, energy-time variables are investigated. The measure incylindrical coordinates is derived also. The dependence of perturbation theorycontributions from global (topological) properties of corresponding phasespaces is shown.
