We compute the graviton induced corrections to Maxwell's equations in theone-loop and weak field approximations. The corrected equations are analogousto the classical equations in anisotropic and inhomogeneous media. We analyzein particular the corrections to the dispersion relations. When the wavelengthof the electromagnetic field is much smaller than a typical length scale of thegraviton two-point function, the speed of light depends on the direction ofpropagation and on the polarisation of the radiation. In the opposite case, thespeed of light may also depend on the energy of the electromagnetic radiation.We study in detail wave propagation in two special backgrounds, flatRobertson-Walker and static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. In the case of aflat Robertson-Walker gravitational background we find that the correctedelectromagnetic field equations correspond to an isotropic medium with atime-dependent effective refractive index. For a static, spherically symmetricbackground the graviton fluctuations induce a vacuum structure which causesbirefringence in the propagation of light.
