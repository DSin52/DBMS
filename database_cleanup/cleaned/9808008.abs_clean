Lattice calculations performed in Abelian gauges give strong evidence thatconfinement is realized as a dual Meissner effect, implying that theYang--Mills vacuum consists of a condensate of magnetic monopoles. We show inPolyakov gauge how the Pontrjagin index of the gauge field is related to themagnetic monopole charges.
