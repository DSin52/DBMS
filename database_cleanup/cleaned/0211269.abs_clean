Authors: Tamar Friedmann and Edward Witten

Models of particle physics based on manifolds of $G_2$ holonomy are in mostrespects much more complicated than other string-derived models, but as we showunification are particularly simple. We compute these corrections, gettingcompletely explicit results in some simple cases. We estimate the relationbetween Newton's constant, the GUT scale, and the value of $\alpha_{GUT}$, andexplore the implications for proton decay. In the case of proton decay, thereis an interesting mechanism which (relative to four-dimensional SUSY GUT's)enhances the gauge boson contribution to $p\to\pi^0e^+_L$ compared to othermodes such as $p\to \pi^0e^+_R$ or $p\to \pi^+\bar\nu_R$. Because of numericaluncertainties, we do not know whether to intepret this as an enhancement of the$p\to \pi^0e^+_L$ mode or a suppression of the others.
