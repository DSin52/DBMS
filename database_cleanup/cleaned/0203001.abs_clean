We present a new approach for generating solutions in heterotic string theorycompactified down to three dimensions on a torus with d+n>2, where d and nstand for the number of compactified space--time dimensions and Abelian gaugefields, respectively. It is shown that in the case when d=2k+1 and n isarbitrary, one can apply a solution--generating procedure starting fromsolutions of the stationary Einstein theory with k Maxwell fields; our approachleads to classes of solutions which are invariant with respect to the totalgroup of three-dimensional charging symmetries. We consider a particularextension of the stationary Einstein--multi-Maxwell theory obtained on thebasis of the Kerr--multi-Newman--NUT special class of solutions and establishthe conditions under which the resulting multi--dimensional metric is free ofDirac string peculiarities.
