Motivated by the possibility that physics may be effectively five-dimensionalover some range of distance scales, we study the possible gaugings offive-dimensional N=2 supergravity. Using a constructive approach, we derive theconditions that must be satisfied by the scalar fields in the vector, tensorand hypermultiplets if a given global symmetry is to be gaugeable. We classifyall those theories that admit the gauging of a compact group that is eitherAbelian or semi-simple, or a direct product of a semi-simple and an Abeliangroup. In the absence of tensor multiplets, either the gauge group must besemi-simple or the Abelian part has to be U(1)_R and/or an Abelian isometry ofthe hyperscalar manifold. On the other hand, in the presence of tensormultiplets the gauge group cannot be semi-simple. As an illustrative exercise,we show how the Standard Model SU(3) X SU(2) X U(1) group may be gauged infive-dimensional N=2 supergravity. We also show how previous special resultsmay be recovered within our general formalism.
