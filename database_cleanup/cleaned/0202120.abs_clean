We propose a scenario for particle-mass generation, assuming the existence ofa physical regime where, firstly, physical particles can be considered aspoint-like objects moving in a background space-time and, secondly, their merepresence spoils the invariance under the local diffeomorphism group, resultingin an anomalous realization of the latter. Under these hypotheses, we describemass generation starting from the massless free theory. The mechanism is notsensitive to the detailed description of the underlying theory at higherenergies, leaning only on general structural features of it, specificallydiffeomorphism invariance.
