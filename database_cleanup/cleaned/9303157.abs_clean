We study the two-matrix model which represents the sum over closed and openrandom surfaces coupled to an Ising Model. The boundary conditions arecharacterized by the fact that the Ising spins sitting at the vertices of theboundaries are all in the same state. We obtain the string equation and discussthe results. (No change in physics, only some misprints are corrected)
