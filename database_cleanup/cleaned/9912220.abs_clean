Authors: Raimar Wulkenhaar (CPT Marseille)

Comments: 11 pages, LaTeX2e, 11 eps figures. Published in `Quantum groups,

noncommutative geometry and fundamental physical interactions', eds D.Kastler et al, Nova Science Publishers (1999) 233-242. (typos corrected andreferences updated; written in October 1998, somewhat out of date, buthopefully still useful)We review Kreimer's construction of a Hopf algebra associated to the Feynmangraphs of a perturbative quantum field theory.
