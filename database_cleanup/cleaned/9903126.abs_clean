Considering a class of (2,0)-super-Yang-Mills multiplets that accommodate apair of independent gauge potentials in connection with a single symmetrygroup, we present here their coupling to ordinary matter and to non-linear$\sigma$-models in (2,0)-superspace. The dynamics and the couplings of thegauge potentials are discussed and the interesting feature that comes out is asort of ``chirality'' for one of the gauge potentials once light-conecoordinates are chosen.
