Using examples of a D=2 chiral scalar and a duality-symmetric formulation ofD=4 Maxwell theory we study duality properties of actions for describing chiralbosons. In particular, in the D=4 case, upon performing a duality transform ofan auxiliary scalar field, which ensures Lorentz covariance of the action, wearrive at a new covariant duality-symmetric Maxwell action, which contains atwo-form potential as an auxiliary field. When the two-form field is gaugefixed this action reduces to a duality-symmetric action for Maxwell theoryconstructed by Zwanziger. We consider properties of this new covariant actionand discuss its coupling to external dyonic sources. We also demonstrate thatthe formulations considered are self-dual with respect to a dualization of thefield-strengths of the chiral fields.
