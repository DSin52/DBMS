We use the method of the tensor product graph to construct rational (Yangianinvariant) solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation in fundamental representationsof $c_n$ and thence the full set of $c_n$-invariant factorized $S$-matrices.Brief comments are made on their bootstrap structure and on Belavin's scalarYangian conserved charges.
