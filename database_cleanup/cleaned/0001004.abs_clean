Quantum fields responding to "moving mirrors" have been predicted to giverise to thermodynamic paradoxes. I show that the assumption in such work thatenergy-transfer effects necessary to the paradoxes are well below the scales atwhich the model is credible. For a first-quantized point-particle mirror, itappears that exotic energy-transfers are lost in the quantum uncertainty in themirror's state. An accurate accounting of these energies will require a modelwhich recognizes the mirror's finite reflectivity, and almost certainly a modelwhich allows for the excitation of internal mirror modes, that is, asecond-quantized model.
