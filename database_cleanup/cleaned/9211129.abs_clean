We present the (1+1)-dimensional description of the algebraically specialclass of space-times of 4-dimensions. It is described by the (1+1)-dimensionalYang-Mills action interacting with matter fields, with diffeomorphisms of2-surface as the gauge symmetry. Parts of the constraints are identified as thegauge fixing condition. We also show that the representations of$w_{\infty}$-gravity appear naturally as special cases of this description, anddiscuss the geometry of $w_{\infty}$-gravity in term of the fibre bundle.
