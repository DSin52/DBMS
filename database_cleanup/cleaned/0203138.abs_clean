Title: Aspects of Spontaneous N=2 -> N=1 Breaking in Supergravity

Authors: Jan Louis

Comments: 11 pages, Latex. Talk given at the ``Workshop on special geometric

structures in string theory'', Bonn, September 8-11, 2001We discuss some issues related to spontaneous N=2-> N=1 supersymmetrybreaking. In particular, we state a set of geometrical conditions which arenecessary that such a breaking occurs. Furthermore, we discuss the low energyN=1 effective Lagrangian and show that it satisfies non-trivial consistencyconditions which can also be viewed as conditions on the geometry of the scalarmanifold.
