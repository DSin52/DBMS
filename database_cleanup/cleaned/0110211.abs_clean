It has been argued by some authors that the parent action approach cannot beused in order to establish the duality between the 2+1 Abelian and non-AbelianSelf-Dual (SD) and Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons (YMCS) models for all the couplingregimes. We propose here an alternative (perturbative) point of view, and showthat this equivalence can be achieved with the parent action approach.
