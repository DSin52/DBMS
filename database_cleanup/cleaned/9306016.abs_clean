The observation that $n$ pairs of para-Bose (pB) operators generate theuniversal enveloping algebra of the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra$osp(1/2n)$ is used in order to define deformed pB operators. It is shown thatthese operators are an alternative to the Chevalley generators. On thisbackground $U_q[osp(1/2n)]$, its "Cartan-Weyl" generators and their"supercommutation" relations are written down entirely in terms of deformed pBoperators. An analog of the Poincare- Birkhoff-Witt theorem is formulated.
