The tachyon-free nonsupersymmetric string theories in ten dimensions havedilaton tadpoles which forbid a Minkowski vacuum. We determine the maximallysymmetric backgrounds for the $USp(32)$ Type I string and the $SO(16)\timesSO(16)$ heterotic string. The static solutions exhibit nine dimensionalPoincar\'e symmetry and have finite 9D Planck and Yang-Mills constants. The lowenergy geometry is given by a ten dimensional manifold with two boundariesseparated by a finite distance which suggests a spontaneous compactification ofthe ten dimensional string theory.
