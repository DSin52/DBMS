We show that the noncommutativity of space-time destroys therenormalizability of the 1/N expansion of the O(N) Gross-Neveu model. A similarstatement holds for the noncommutative nonlinear sigma model. However, we showthat, up to the subleading order in 1/N expansion, the noncommutativesupersymmetric O(N) nonlinear sigma model becomes renormalizable in D=3. Wealso show that dynamical mass generation is restored and there is nocatastrophic UV/IR mixing. Unlike the commutative case, we find that theLagrange multiplier fields, which enforce the supersymmetric constraints, arealso renormalized. For D=2 the divergence of the four point function of thebasic scalar field, which in D=3 is absent, cannot be eliminated by means of acounterterm having the structure of a Moyal product.
