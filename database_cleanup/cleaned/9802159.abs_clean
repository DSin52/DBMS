The large distance behavior of the Maxwell- Chern-Simons (MCS) equations isanalyzed, and it is found that the pure Chern-Simons limit, (when the Maxwellterm is dropped from the equations), does not describe the large distance limitof the MCS model. This necessitates the solution of the original problem. TheMCS gauge theory coupled to a nonrelativistic matter field, (governed by thegauged non-linear Schr\"odinger equation), is studied. It turns out, that thereare no regular self-dual solutions as in the pure Chern-Simons case, but themodel admits interesting, though singular self-dual solutions. The propertiesof these solutions, and their large distance limits are analyzed.
