We study the process of relaxation back to thermal equilibrium in$(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theory at finite temperature. When the sizeof the system is much larger than the inverse temperature, perturbations decayexponentially with time. On the other hand, when the inverse temperature islarge, the relaxation is oscillatory with characteristic period set by the sizeof the system. We then analyse the intermediate regime in two specific models,namely free fermions, and a strongly coupled large $\tt k$ conformal fieldtheory which is dual to string theory on $(2+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitterspacetime. In the latter case, there is a sharp transition between the tworegimes in the ${\tt k}=\infty$ limit, which is a manifestation of thegravitational Hawking-Page phase transition. In particular, we establish adirect connection between quasinormal and normal modes of the gravity system,and the decaying and oscillating behaviour of the conformal field theory.
