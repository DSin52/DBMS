The gauge equivalence between basic KP hierarchies is discussed. The firsttwo Hamiltonian structures for KP hierarchies leading to the linear andnon-linear $\Winf$ algebras are derived. The realization of the correspondinggenerators in terms of two boson currents is presented and it is shown to berelated to many integrable models which are bi-Hamiltonian. We can also realizethose generators by adding extra currents, coupled in a particular way,allowing for instance a description of multi-layered Benney equations ormulti-component non-linear Schroedinger equation. In this case we can have asecond Hamiltonian bracket structure which violates Jacobi identity. Weconsider the reduction to one-boson systems leading to KdV and mKdVhierarchies. A Miura transformation relating these two hierarchies is obtainedby restricting gauge transformation between corresponding two-bosonhierarchies. Connection to Drinfeld-Sokolov approach is also discussed in the$SL(2,\IR)$ gauge theory. (Lectures presented at the VII J.A. Swieca SummerJanuary/93)
