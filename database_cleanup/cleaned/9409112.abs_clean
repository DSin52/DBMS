We show that heavy fermions decouple from the low energy physics also innon-perturbative instanton effects. Provided the heavy fermions are lighterthan the symmetry breaking scale, all the instanton effects should be expressedas local operators in the effective Lagrangian. The effective theory itselfdoesn't admit instantons. We present the mechanism which suppresses instantonsin the effective theory.
