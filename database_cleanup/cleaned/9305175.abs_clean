To overcome the difficulties with the energy indefiniteness in field theorieswith higher derivatives, it is supposed to use the mechanical analogy, theTimoshenko theory of the transverse flexural vibrations of beams or rods wellknown in mechanical engineering. It enables one to introduce the notion of a"mechanical" energy in such field models that is wittingly positive definite.This approach can be applied at least to the higher derivative models whicheffectively describe the extended localized solutions in usual first orderfield theories (vortex solutions in Higgs models and so on). Any problems witha negative norm ghost states and unitarity violation do not arise here.
