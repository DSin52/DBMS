The Casimir effect is investigated in light-cone quantization. It is shownthat for spacelike separation of the walls enclosing the system the standardresult for the pressure exerted on the walls is obtained. For walls separatedin light-cone space direction no regularization of the quantum fluctuationsexists which would yield a finite pressure. The origin of this failure and itsimplications for other vacuum properties are discussed by analyzing the Casimireffect as seen from a moving observer approaching the speed of light. Thepossibility for calculation of thermodynamic quantities in light-conequantization via the Casimir effect is pointed out.
