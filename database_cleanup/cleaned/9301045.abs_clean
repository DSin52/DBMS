Braiding matrices in rational conformal field theory are considered. Thebraiding matrices for any two block four point function are computed, ingeneral, using the holomorphic properties of the blocks and the holomorphicproperties of rational conformal field theory. The braidings of $SU(N)_k$ withthe fundamental are evaluated and are used as examples. Solvable interactionround the face lattice models are constructed from these braiding matrices, andtheir Boltzmann weights are given. This allows, in particular, for thederivation of the Boltzmann weights of such solvable height models.
