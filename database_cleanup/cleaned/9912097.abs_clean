Title: Finite One-Loop Calculations in Quantum Gravity

Perturbative Gauge Invariance and Slavnov-Ward IdentitiesAuthors: Nicola Grillo

Comments: 44 pages, latex, no figures, some typos corrected, appendix 4 added,

references addedIn this paper we show that the one-loop graviton self-energy contribution isultraviolet finite, without introducing counterterms, and cutoff-free in theframework of causal perturbation theory. In addition, it satisfies thegravitational Slavnov-Ward identities for the two-point connected Greenfunction. The condition of perturbative gauge invariance to second order forloop graphs is proved. Corrections to the Newtonian potential are also derived.
