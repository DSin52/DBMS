We present sum representations for all characters of the unitary Virasorominimal models. They can be viewed as fermionic companions of the Rocha-Caridisum representations, the latter related to the (bosonic) Feigin-Fuchs-Felderconstruction. We also give fermionic representations for certain characters ofthe general $(G^{(1)})_k \times (G^{(1)})_l \over (G^{(1)})_{k+l}}$ cosetconformal field theories, the non-unitary minimal models ${\cal M}(p,p+2)$ and${\cal M}(p,kp+1)$, the $N$=2 superconformal series, and the$\ZZ_N$-parafermion theories, and relate the $q\to 1$ behaviour of all thesefermionic sum representations to the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz.
