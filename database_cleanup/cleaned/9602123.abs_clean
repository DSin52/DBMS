Title: Wilsonian vs. 1PI renormalization group flow irreversibility

Authors: Jordi Comellas and Jose I. Latorre

Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX, no figures. An error in section 2 (which does not

affect sections 3 and 4) invalidates the flow equation for $c_W$. The paperhas been temporarily withdrawn from publicationWe present a line of reasoning based on the analysis of scale variations ofthe Wilsonian partition function and the trace of the stress tensor in a curvedmanifold which results in a statement of irreversibility of Wilsonianrenormalization group flow for unitary theories. We also analyze subtletiesrelated to subtractions in the case of the 1PI effective action flow.
