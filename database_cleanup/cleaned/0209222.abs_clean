In this paper we compute the radiation of the massless closed string statesdue to the non-vanishing coupling to the rolling open string tachyon withco-dimensions larger than 2, and discuss the effect of back reaction to themotion of the rolling tachyon. We find that for small string coupling, thetachyonic matter remains in the late time, but it will completely evaporateaway over a short time of few string scales if the string coupling is huge.Comment on the implication of our results to the g-theorem of boundaryconformal field theory is given.
