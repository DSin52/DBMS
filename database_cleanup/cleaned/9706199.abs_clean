Poisson-Lie T-duality in N=2 superconformal WZNW models on the real Liegroups is considered. It is shown that Poisson-Lie T-duality is governed by thecomplexifications of the corresponding real groups endowed withSemenov-Tian-Shansky symplectic forms, i.e. Heisenberg doubles. ComplexHeisenberg doubles are used to define on the group manifolds of the N=2superconformal WZNW models the natural actions of the isotropic complexsubgroups forming the doubles. It is proved that with respect to these actionsN=2 superconformal WZNW models admit Poisson-Lie symmetries. Poisson-LieT-duality transformation maps each model into itself but acts nontrivialy onthe space of classical solutions.
