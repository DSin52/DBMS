In this paper we construct a new quantum double by endowing the l-statebosonalgebra with a non-trivial Hopf algebra structure,which is not aq-deformation of the Lie algebra or superalgebra.The universal R-matrix for theYang-Baxter equation associated with this new quantum group structure isobtained explicitly.By building the representations of this quantum double,weget some R-matrices ,which can result in new representations of the braidgroup.
