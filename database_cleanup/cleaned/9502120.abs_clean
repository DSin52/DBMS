Massive neutrinos can be accommodated into the noncommutative geometryreinterpretation of the Standard Model. The constrained Standard ModelLagrangian is computed anew under the assumption of nonzero neutrino masses.This gives the ``prediction" of a mass for the Higgs particle somewhat higherthan in the vanishing neutrino mass case.
