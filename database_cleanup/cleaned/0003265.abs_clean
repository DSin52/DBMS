We investigate the low-energy effective action in N=4 super Yang-Mills theorywith gauge group SU(n) spontaneously broken down to its maximal torus. Usingharmonic superspace technique we prove an absence of any three- and four-loopcorrections to non-holomorphic effective potential depending on N=2 superfieldstrengths. A mechanism responsible for vanishing arbitrary loop corrections tolow-energy effective action is discussed.
