A detailed study is made of super elliptic curves, namely super Riemannsurfaces of genus one considered as algebraic varieties, particularly theirrelation with their Picard groups. This is the simplest setting in which tostudy the geometric consequences of the fact that certain cohomology groups ofsuper Riemann surfaces are not freely generated modules. The divisor theory ofRosly, Schwarz, and Voronov gives a map from a supertorus to its Picard group,but this map is a projection, not an isomorphism as it is for ordinary tori.The geometric realization of the addition law on Pic via intersections of thesupertorus with superlines in projective space is described. The isomorphismsof Pic with the Jacobian and the divisor class group are verified. All possibleisogenies, or surjective holomorphic maps between supertori, are determined andshown to induce homomorphisms of the Picard groups. Finally, the solutions tothe new super Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (super KP) hierarchy of Mulase-Rabin whicharise from super elliptic curves via the Krichever construction are exhibited.
