Title: Temporal-gauge String Field with Open Strings

Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX

Journal-ref: Phys. Lett. B351 (1995) 439

A string field theory including open string fields is constructed in thetemporal gauge. It consists of string interaction vertices similar to thelight-cone gauge string field theory. A slight modification of the definitionof the time coordinate is needed because of the existence of the open stringend points.
