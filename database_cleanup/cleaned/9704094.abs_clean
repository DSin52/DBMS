In the large N limit, we show that the Local Potential Approximation to theflow equation for the Legendre effective action, is in effect no longer anapproximation, but exact - in a sense, and under conditions, that we determineprecisely. We explain why the same is not true for the Polchinski or Wilsonflow equations and, by deriving an exact relation between the Polchinski andLegendre effective potentials (that holds for all N), we find the correct largeN limit of these flow equations. We also show that all forms (and all parts) ofthe renormalization group are exactly soluble in the large N limit, choosing asan example, D dimensional O(N) invariant N-component scalar field theory.
