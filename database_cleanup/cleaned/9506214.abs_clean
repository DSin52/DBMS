The string equations of motion and constraints are solved near the horizonand near the singularity of a Schwarzschild black hole. In a conformal gaugesuch that $\tau = 0$ ($\tau$ = worldsheet time coordinate) corresponds to thehorizon ($r=1$) or to the black hole singularity ($r=0$), the stringcoordinates express in power series in $\tau$ near the horizon and in powerseries in $\tau^{1/5}$ around $r=0$. We compute the string invariant size andthe string energy-momentum tensor. Near the horizon both are finite andanalytic. Near the black hole singularity, the string size, the string energyand the transverse pressures (in the angular directions) tend to infinity as$r^{-1}$. To leading order near $r=0$, the string behaves as two dimensionalradiation. This two spatial dimensions are describing the $S^2$ sphere in theSchwarzschild manifold.
