New CP1-soliton behaviour on a flat torus is reported. Defined by theWeierstrass elliptic function and numerically-evolved from rest, each solitonsplits up in two lumps which eventually reunite, divide and get back togetheragain, etc.. This result invites speculation on the question of fractionaltopological charge.
