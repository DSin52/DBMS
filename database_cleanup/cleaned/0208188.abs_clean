Title: On T-Duality in Brane Gas Cosmology

Authors: Timon Boehm and Robert Brandenberger

Comments: 7 pages, no figures

In the context of homogeneous and isotropic superstring cosmology, theT-duality symmetry of string theory has been used to argue that for abackground space-time described by dilaton gravity with strings as mattersources, the cosmological evolution of the Universe will be nonsingular. Inthis Letter we discuss how T-duality extends to brane gas cosmology, anapproximation in which the background space-time is again described by dilatongravity with a gas of branes as a matter source. We conclude that the argumentsfor nonsingular cosmological evolution remain valid.
