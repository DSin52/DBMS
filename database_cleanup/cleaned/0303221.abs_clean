Title: Correlators in Timelike Bulk Liouville Theory

Authors: Andrew Strominger and Tadashi Takayanagi

Comments: 10 pages, Latex

Liouville theory with a negative norm boson and no screening chargecorresponds to an exact classical solution of closed bosonic string theorydescribing time-dependent bulk tachyon condensation. A simple expression forthe two point function is proposed based on renormalization/analyticcontinuation of the known results for the ordinary (positive-norm) Liouvilletheory. The expression agrees exactly with the minisuperspace result for theclosed string pair-production rate (which diverges at finite time). Puzzlesconcerning the three-point function are presented and discussed.
