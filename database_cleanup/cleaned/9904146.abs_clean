The reduction of 4d matter-gravity theory to $S_2$, $H_2$ or $R_2$ leads toeffective 2d dilatonic gravity with dilaton coupled matter. Spinors give theexceptional example of the theory which is conformally invariant in 4d as wellas in 2d, after reduction. We find 4d and 2d conformal anomaly inducedeffective action (EA) for Majorana spinor. It is expected for some time thats-wave EA (i.e. the one for dilaton coupled 2d matter) is some (s-wave)approximation to 4d EA. We compare such 2d and 4d spinor EAs on the samegravitational background and argue that s-wave EA indeed qualitativelycorresponds to no higher derivatives approximation for 4d EA.
