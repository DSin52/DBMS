The screening nature of the potential between external quarks in massless$SU(N_c)$ $QCD_2$ is derived using an expansion in $N_f$- the number offlavors. Applying the same method to the massive model, we find a confiningpotential. We consider the N=1 super Yang Mills theory, reveal certainproblematic aspects of its bosonized version and show the associated screeningbehavior by applying a point splitting method to the scalar current.
