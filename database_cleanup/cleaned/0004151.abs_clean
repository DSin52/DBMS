We generalize the results of Polchinski and Strassler regarding theN=1-preserving mass deformation of N=4 SU(N) SYM theories and its string theorydual to SO(N) and USp(2N) gauge groups. The string theory duals involve5-branes wrapped on RP^2. In order to match with the field theoryclassification of vacua, the 3-brane charge carried by such 5-branes must beshifted by a half, and this follows from a conjectured generalization ofresults of Freed and Witten. Our results provide an elegant physical picturefor the classification of classically massive vacua in the mass-deformed N=4theories.
