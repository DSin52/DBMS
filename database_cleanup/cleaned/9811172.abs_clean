Four-point functions of gauge-invariant operators in D=4, N=4 supersymmetricYang-Mills theory are studied using N=2 harmonic superspace perturbationtheory. The results are expressed in terms of differential operators acting ona scalar two loop integral. The leading singular behaviour is obtained in thelimit that two of the points approach one another. We find logarithmicsingularities which do not cancel out in the sum of all diagrams. It isconfirmed that Green's functions of analytic operators are indeed analytic atthis order in perturbation theory.
