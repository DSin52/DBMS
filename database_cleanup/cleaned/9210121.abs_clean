We show that O(2,2) transformation of SU(2) WZNW model gives rise to marginaldeformation of this model by the operator $\int d^2 z J(z)\bar J(\bar z)$ where$J$, $\bar J$ are U(1) currents in the Cartan subalgebra. Generalization ofthis result to other WZNW theories is discussed. We also consider O(3,3)transformation of the product of an SU(2) WZNW model and a gauged SU(2) WZNWmodel. The three parameter set of models obtained after the transformation isshown to be the result of first deforming the product of two SU(2) WZNWtheories by marginal operators of the form $\sum_{i,j=1}^2 C_{ij} J_i \barJ_j$, and then gauging an appropriate U(1) subgroup of the theory. Our analysisleads to a general conjecture that O(d,d) transformation of any WZNW modelcorresponds to marginal deformation of the WZNW theory by combination ofappropriate left and right moving currents belonging to the Cartan subalgebra;and O(d,d) transformation of a gauged WZNW model can be identified to thegauged version of such marginally deformed WZNW models.
