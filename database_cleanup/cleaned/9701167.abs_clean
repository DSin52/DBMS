Euclidean field theory on 4-dimensional sphere is suggested for the study ofhigh energy multiparticle production. The singular classical fieldconfigurations are found in scalar and SU(2)-gauge theories and the crosssection of 2->n processes is calculated. It is shown,that the cross section hasa maximum at the energy compared to the sphaleron mass.
