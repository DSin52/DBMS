We derive the conditions that the coupling constants of the GeneralizedThirring Model have to satisfy in order for the model to admit an infinitenumber of commuting classical conserved quantities. Our treatment uses thebosonized version of the model, with periodic boundary conditions imposed onthe space coordinate. Some explicit examples that satisfy these conditions arediscussed. We show that, with a different set of boundary conditions, thereexist additional conserved quantities, and we find the Poisson Bracket algebrasatisfied by them.
