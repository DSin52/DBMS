In the No-boundary Universe with $d=11$ supergravity, under the $S_n \timesS_{11-n}$ Kaluza-Klein ansatz, the only seed instanton for the universecreation is a $S_7 \times S_4$ space. It is proven that for the Freund-Rubin,Englert and Awada-Duff-Pope models the macroscopic universe in which we areliving must be 4- instead of 7-dimensional without appealing to the anthropicprinciple.
