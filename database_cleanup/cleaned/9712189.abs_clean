We discuss dyons, charge quantization and electric-magnetic duality forself-interacting, abelian, p-form theories in the spacetime dimensions D=2(p+1)where dyons can be present. The corresponding quantization conditions andduality properties are strikingly different depending on whether p is odd oreven. If p is odd one has the familiar eg'-ge'= 2nh, whereas for even p onefinds the opposite relative sign, eg'+ge'= 2nh. These conditions are obtainedby introducing Dirac strings and taking due account of the multipleconnectedness of the configuration space of the strings and the dyons. Atwo-potential formulation of the theory that treats the electric and magneticsources on the same footing is also given.Our results hold for arbitrary gauge invariant self-interaction of the fieldsand are valid irrespective of their duality properties.
