Title: Relativistic Dynamics of Spin in Strong External Fields

Authors: J.W. van Holten

Comments: 11 pages, NIKHEF-H/93-06

The dynamics of relativistic spinning particles in strong externalelectromagnetic or gravitational fields is discussed. Spin-orbit coupling isshown to affect such relativistic phenomena as time-dilation and perihelionshift. Possible applications include muon decay in a magnetic field and thedynamics of neutron stars in binary systems.
