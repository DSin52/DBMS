We relate various black hole solutions in the near-horizon region to blackhole solutions in two-dimensional dilaton gravity theories in order to arguethat thermodynamics of black holes in D>=4 can be effectively described bythermodynamics of black holes in two-dimensional dilaton gravity theories. Weshow that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropies of single-charged dilatonic blackholes and dilatonic p-branes with an arbitrary dilaton coupling parameter inarbitrary spacetime dimensions are exactly reproduced by the Bekenstein-Hawkingentropy of the two-dimensional black hole in the associated two-dimensionaldilaton gravity model. We comment that thermodynamics of non-extreme stringyfour-dimensional black hole with four charges and five-dimensional black holewith three charges may be effectively described by thermodynamics of the blackhole solutions with constant dilaton field in two-dimensional dilaton gravitytheories.
