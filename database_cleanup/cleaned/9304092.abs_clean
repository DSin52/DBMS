We consider a self-interacting scalar field theory in a slowly varyinggravitational background field. Using zeta-function regularization andheat-kernel techniques, we derive the one-loop effective Lagrangian up tosecond order in the variation of the background field and up to quadratic termsin the curvature tensors. Specializing to different spacetimes of physicalinterest, the influence of the curvature on the phase transition is considered.
