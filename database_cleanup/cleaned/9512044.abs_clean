Extensions (modifications) of the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle arederived within the framework of the theory of Special Scale-Relativity proposedby Nottale. In particular, generalizations of the Stringy Uncertainty Principleare obtained where the size of the strings is bounded by the Planck scale andthe size of the Universe. Based on the fractal structures inherent with twodimensional Quantum Gravity, which has attracted considerable interestrecently, we conjecture that the underlying fundamental principle behind Stringtheory should be based on an extension of the Scale Relativity principle whereboth dynamics as well as scales are incorporated in the same footing.
