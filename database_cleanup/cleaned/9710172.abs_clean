Recently derived results for the exact induced parity-breaking term in 2+1dimensions at finite temperature are shown to be relevant to the determinationof the free energy for fixed-charge ensembles. The partition functions forfixed total charge corresponding to massive fermions in the presence of Abelianand non-Abelian magnetic fields are discussed. We show that the presence of theinduced Chern-Simons term manifests itself in that the free energy dependsstrongly on the relation between the external magnetic flux and the value ofthe fixed charge.
