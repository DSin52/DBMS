We find exactly solvable N=2-supersymmetric flows whose infrared fixed pointsare the N=2 minimal models. The exact S-matrices and the Casimir energy (ac-function) are determined along the entire renormalization group trajectory.The c-function runs from c=3 (asymptotically) in the UV to the N=2 minimalmodel values of the central charge in the IR, leading us to interpret thesetheories as the Landau-Ginzburg models with superpotential $X^{k+2}$.Consideration of the elliptic genus gives further support for thisinterpretation. We also find an integrable model in this hierarchy which hasspontaneously-broken supersymmetry and superpotential $X$, and a series ofintegrable models with (0,2) supersymmetry. The flows exhibit interestingbehavior in the UV, including a relation to the N=2 super sine-Gordon model. Wespeculate about the relation between the kinetic term and the cigartarget-space metric.
