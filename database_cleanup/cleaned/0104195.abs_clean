We study the structure of the tenacious (existing for all values of masses ofthe matter fields) BPS domain walls interpolating between different chirallyasymmetric vacua in supersymmetric QCD in the limit of large masses.form a ``coat'' with the characteristic size determined by \Lambda_{SYM} andthere is also the core with width of order of inverse mass. The core alwayscarries a significant fraction of the total wall energy. This fraction dependson $N_f$ and on the ``windings'' of the matter fields.
