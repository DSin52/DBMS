We present a new lattice integrable system in one dimension of theHaldane-Shastry type. It consists of spins positioned at the static equilibriumpositions of particles in a corresponding classical Calogero system andinteracting through an exchange term with strength inversely proportional tothe square of their distance. We achieve this by viewing the Haldane-Shastrysystem as a high-interaction limit of the Sutherland system of particles withinternal degrees of freedom and identifying the same limit in a correspondingCalogero system. The commuting integrals of motion of this system are foundusing the exchange operator formalism.
