We use a perturbative method to evaluate the effective action of a freescalar field propagating in the Bianchi type I spacetime with large spaceanisotropy. The zeta- function regularization method is used to evaluate theaction to the second order in the Schwinger perturbative formula. As thequantum corrections contain fourth derivative in the metric we apply the methodof iterative reduction to reduce it to the second-order form to obtain theself-consistent solution of the semiclassical gravity theory, The reducedEinstein equation shows that the space anisotropy, which will be smoothed outduring the evolution of universe, may play an important role in the dynamics ofearly universe. We quantize the corresponding minisuperspace model toinvestigate the behavior of the space anisotropy in the initial epoch. From thewavefunction of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation we see that the probability for theBianchi type I spacetime with large anisotropy is less then that with a smallanisotropy.
