Some aspects of the rotating three-dimensional Einstein-Anti-de-Sitter blackhole solution, constructed recently by Banados, Teitelboim and Zanelli arediscussed. It is shown explicitly that this black hole represents the mostgeneral black hole type solution of the Einstein-Anti-de-Sitter theory. Theinterpretation of one of the integrals of motion as the spin is discussed. Itsphysics relies on the topological structure of the black hole manifold, and thenotion of simultaneity of space-like separated intervals. The relationship ofthe black hole solution to string theory on a $2 + 1$ dimensional target spaceis examined, and it is shown that the black hole can be understood as a part ofthe full axion-dilaton-gravity, realized as a WZWN $\sigma $ model. Inconclusion, the pertinence of this solution to four-dimensional black stringsand topologically massive gravity is pointed out.
