We calculate the spin dependent static force between two D0-branes in Matrixtheory. Supersymmetry relates velocity dependent potentials to spin dependentpotentials. The well known v^4/r^7 term is related to a theta^8/r^11 term,where theta is the relative spin of the D0-branes. We calculate this term,confirming that it is the lowest order contribution to the static potential,and find its structure consistent with supergravity.
