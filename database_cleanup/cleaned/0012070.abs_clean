The A_{N - 1} (2, 0) superconformal theory has an observable associated withevery two-cycle in six dimensions. We make a natural guess for the commutationrelations of these operators, which reduces to the commutation relations ofWilson and 't Hooft lines in four-dimensional SU(N) N = 4 super Yang-Millstheory upon compactification on a two-torus. We then verify these commutationrelations by considering the theory at a generic point of its moduli space andincluding in the surface operators only contributions from the light degrees offreedom, which amount to N - 1 (2, 0) tensor multiplets.
