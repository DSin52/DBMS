Title: Phase transition in Wilson loop correlator from AdS/CFT correspondence

Authors: P. Olesen, K. Zarembo

Comments: 9 pages, 2 figures

A previous calculation of the phase transition in the Wilson loop correlatorin the zero temperature AdS/CFT correspondence is extended to the case wherethe loops are concentric circles of unequal radii. This phase transition occursdue to the instability of the classical string stretched between the loops. Wecompute the string action and its expansion in the distance h between the loopsfor small h. We also find that the connected minimal surface is subleading ordoes not even exist when h=0 and the radii are considerably different. Thisfeature has no analogue in flat space.
