We construct the second quantized action for sub-critical closed string fieldtheory with zero cosmological constant in dimensions $ 2 \leq D < 26$,generalizing the non-polynomial closed string field theory action proposed bythe author and the Kyoto and MIT groups for $D = 26$. The proof of gaugeinvariance is considerably complicated by the presence of the Liouville field$\phi$ and the non-polynomial nature of the action. However, we explicitly showthat the polyhedral vertex functions obey BRST invariance to all orders. Bypoint splitting methods, we calculate the anomaly contribution due to theLiouville field, and show in detail that it cancels only if $D - 26 + 1 + 3 Q ^2 = 0 $, in both the bosonized and unbosonized polyhedral vertex functions. Wealso show explicitly that the four point function generated by this actionreproduces the shifted Shapiro-Virasoro amplitude found from $c=1$ matrixmodels and Liouville theory in two dimensions.
