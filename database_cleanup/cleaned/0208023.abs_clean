We consider issues related to tachyonic inflation with inverse-power-lawpotential. We find the solution of the evolution equations in the slow rolllimit in FRW as well as in the brane cosmology. Using the holographic entropybound, we estimate the quantum-gravitational discreteness of tachyonicinflation perturbations.
