We discuss the 't Hoof ansatz for instanton solutions in noncommutative U(2)Yang-Mills theory. We show that the extension of the ansatz leading to singularsolutions in the commutative case, yields to non self-dual (or self-antidual)configurations in noncommutative space-time. A proposal leading to selfdualsolutions with Q=1 topological charge (the equivalent of the regular BPSTansatz) can be engineered, but in that case the gauge field and the curvatureare not Hermitian (although the resulting Lagrangian is real).
