By utilizing a new procedure (the RADIO method) for deriving on-shell 2D,2N-extended multiplets from off-shell 2D, N-extended multiplets, we derive anew on-shell 2D, N = 8 representation; the ultra-multiplet. By twisting withrespect to parity, we show that many variant versions of this supermultipletalso exist.
