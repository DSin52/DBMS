Massive spin s>=3/2 fields can become partially massless in cosmologicalbackgrounds. In the plane spanned by m^2 and \Lambda, there are lines where newgauge invariances permit intermediate sets of higher helicities, rather thanthe usual flat space extremes of all 2s+1 massive or just 2 masslesshelicities. These gauge lines divide the (m^2,\Lambda) plane into unitarilyallowed or forbidden intermediate regions where all 2s+1 massive helicitiespropagate but lower helicity states can have negative norms. We derive theseconsequences for s=3/2,2 by studying both their canonical (anti)commutators andthe transmutation of massive constraints to partially massless Bianchiidentities. For s=2, a Hamiltonian analysis exhibits the absence of zerohelicity modes in the partially massless sector. For s=5/2,3 we derive Bianchiidentities and their accompanying gauge invariances for the various partiallymassless theories with propagating helicities (+/-5/2,+/-3/2) and (+/-3,+/-2),(+/-3,+/-2,+/-1), respectively. Of these, only the s=3 models are unitary. Tothese ends, we also provide the half integer generalization of the integer spinwave operators of Lichnerowicz. Partial masslessness applies to all higherspins in (A)dS as seen by their degree of freedom counts. Finally a derivationof massive d=4 constraints by dimensional reduction from their d=5 masslessBianchi identity ancestors is given.
