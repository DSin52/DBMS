Dirac's contour representation is extended to parabose and parafermi systemsby use of deformed algebra techniques. In this analytic representation theaction of the paraparticle annihilation operator is equivalent to a deformeddifferentiation which encodes the statistics of the paraparticle. In theparafermi case, the derivative's ket-domain is degree $p$ polynomials.
