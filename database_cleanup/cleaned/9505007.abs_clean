Title: Three-Dimensional Vertex Model Related BCC Model in Statistical

MechanicsComments: 15 pages, latex, no figures

In this paper, a three-dimensional vertex model is obtained. It is a dualityof the three-dimensional integrable lattice model with $N$ states proposed byBoos, Mangazeev, Sergeev and Stroganov. The Boltzmann weight of the model isdependent on four spin variables, which are the linear combinations of thespins on the corner sites of the cube, and obeys the modified vertex typetetrahedron equation. This vertex model can be regard as a deformation of theone related the three-dimensional Baxter-Bazhanov model. The constrainedconditions of the spectrums are discussed in detail and the symmetry propertiesof weight functions of the vertex model are presented.
