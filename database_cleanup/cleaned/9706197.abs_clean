Title: The M Theory Five-Brane

Comments: 22 pages, latex, no figures; lecture presented at the APCPT--ICTP

Joint International Conference '97 (AIJIC97). This is an extended version ofhep-th/9705092BPS saturated p-branes play an important role in recent progress inunderstanding superstring theory and M theory. One approach to understandingthe dynamics of p-branes is to formulate an effective (p+1)-dimensionalworld-volume theory. The construction of such brane actions involves a numberof interesting issues. One such issue is how to formulate the action fortheories that contain chiral bosons. The two main examples, which are the Mtheory five-brane and the heterotic string, are described in this lecture.Also, double dimensional reduction of the M theory five-brane on K3 is shown togive the heterotic string.
