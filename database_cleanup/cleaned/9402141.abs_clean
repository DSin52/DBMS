Being inspired by Kaplan's proposal for simulating chiral fermions on alattice, we examine the continuum analog of his domain-wall construction fortwo-dimensional chiral Schwinger models. Adopting slightly unusual dimensionalregularization, we explicitly evaluate the one-loop effective action in thelimit that the domain-wall mass goes to infinity. For anomaly-free cases, theeffective action turns out to be gauge invariant in two-dimensional sense.
