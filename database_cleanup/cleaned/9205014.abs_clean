The critical behaviour of the $D=0$ matrix model with potential perturbed bynonlocal term generating touchings between random surfaces is studied. It isfound that the phase diagram of the model has many features of the phasediagram of discretized Polyakov's bosonic string with higher order curvatureterms included. It contains the phase of smooth (Liouville) surfaces, theintermediate phase and the phase of branched polymers. The perturbation becomesirrelevant at the first phase and dominates at the third one.
