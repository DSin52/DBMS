We show that the modified Cardy-Verlinde formula without the Casimir effectterm is satisfied by asymptotically flat charged black holes in arbitrarydimensions. Thermodynamic quantities of the charged black holes are shown tosatisfy the energy-temperature relation of a two-dimensional CFT, whichsupports the claim in our previous work (Phys. Rev. D61, 044013,hep-th/9910244) that thermodynamics of charged black holes in higher dimensionscan be effectively described by two-dimensional theories. We also check theCardy formula for the two-dimensional black hole compactified from a dilatoniccharged black hole in higher dimensions.
