We study perturbative noncommutative quantum gravity by expanding thegravitational field about a fixed classical background. A calculation of theone loop gravitational self-energy graph reveals that only the non-planargraviton loops are damped by oscillating internal momentum dependent factors.The noncommutative quantum gravity perturbation theory is not renormalizablebeyond one loop for matter-free gravity and all loops for matter interactions.Comments are made about the nonlocal gravitational interactions produced by thenoncommutative spacetime geometry.
