432-443The classical theory of non-relativistic charged particle interacting withU(1) gauge field is reformulated as the Schr\"odinger wave equation modified bythe de-Broglie-Bohm quantum potential nonlinearity. For, (1 - $\hbar^2$)deformed strength of quantum potential the model is gauge equivalent to thestandard Schr\"odinger equation with Planck constant $\hbar$, while for thestrength (1 + $\hbar^2$), to the pair of diffusion-anti-diffusion equations.Specifying the gauge field as Abelian Chern-Simons (CS) one in 2+1 dimensionsinteracting with the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger field (the Jackiw-Pi model), werepresent the theory as a planar Madelung fluid, where the Chern-Simons Gausslaw has simple physical meaning of creation the local vorticity for the fluidflow. For the static flow, when velocity of the center-of-mass motion (theclassical velocity) is equal to the quantum one (generated by quantum potentialvelocity of the internal motion), the fluid admits N-vortex solution. Applyingthe Auberson-Sabatier type gauge transform to phase of the vortex wave functionwe show that deformation parameter $\hbar$, the CS coupling constant and thequantum potential strength are quantized. Reductions of the model to 1+1dimensions, leading to modified NLS and DNLS equations with resonance solitoninteractions are discussed.
