Title: (0,2) Theory and String Baryon in M-Theory on $AdS_7\times S^4$

Comments: 7 pages, Latex

In this article we consider some properties of the (0,2) theory using AdS/CFT correspondence. We also consider the "string baryonic state" of the theory.We will show that stable baryon states for $k$ string exist provided $2/3 N\leq k \leq N$. The (0,2) theory in the finite temperature is also consideredusing Schwarzshild geometry, giving information about the five dimensionaltheory obtained at higher temperature in this background. One can also see thatthere are two descriptions of a four dimensional gauge theory which becomeequivalent at strong coupling and approach this five dimensional theory.
