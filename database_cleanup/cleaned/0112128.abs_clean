By considering a simplified but exact model for realizing the ekpyroticscenario, we clarify various assumptions that have been used in the literature.In particular, we discuss the new ekpyrotic prescription for passing theperturbations through the singularity which we show to provide a spectrumdepending on a non physical normalization function. We also show that thisprescription does not reproduce the exact result for a sharp transition. Then,more generally, we demonstrate that, in the only case where a bounce can beobtained in Einstein General Relativity without facing singularities and/orviolation of the standard energy conditions, the bounce cannot be madearbitrarily short. This contrasts with the standard (inflationary) situationwhere the transition between two eras with different values of the equation ofstate can be considered as instantaneous. We then argue that the usuallyconserved quantities are not constant on a typical bounce time scale. Finally,we also examine the case of a test scalar field (or gravitational waves) wheresimilar results are obtained. We conclude that the full dynamical equations ofthe underlying theory should be solved in a non singular case before anyconclusion can be drawn.
