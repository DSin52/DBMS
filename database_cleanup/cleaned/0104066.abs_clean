Using the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence, we relate theshear viscosity \eta of the finite-temperature N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Millstheory in the large N, strong-coupling regime with the absorption cross sectionof low-energy gravitons by a near-extremal black three-brane. We show that inthe limit of zero frequency this cross section coincides with the area of thehorizon. From this result we find \eta=\pi/8 N^2T^3. We conjecture that forfinite 't Hooft coupling (g_YM)^2N the shear viscosity is \eta=f((g_YM)^2N)N^2T^3, where f(x) is a monotonic function that decreases fromO(x^{-2}\ln^{-1}(1/x)) at small x to \pi/8 when x\to\infty.
