We evaluate the exact $QED_{2+1}$ effective action for fermions in thepresence of a family of static but spatially inhomogeneous magnetic fieldprofiles. This exact result yields an all-orders derivative expansion of theeffective action, and indicates that the derivative expansion is an asymptotic,rather than a convergent, expansion.
