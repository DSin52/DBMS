Generalizing the noncommutative harmonic oscillator construction, we proposea new extension of quantum field theory based on the concept of "noncommutativefields". Our description permits to break the usual particle-antiparticledegeneracy at the dispersion relation level and introduces naturally anultraviolet and an infrared cutoff. Phenomenological bounds for these newenergy scales are given.
