Title: De Sitter Entropy and Strings

Comments: 9 pages in phyzzx.tex, minor corrections and additions, one reference

addedWe show that the entropy of de Sitter space in any dimension can beunderstood as the entropy of a highly excited string located near the horizon.The string tension is renormalized to $T \sim \Lambda$ due to the largegravitational redshift near the horizon. The de Sitter temperature is given bythe Hagedorn temperature of the string.
