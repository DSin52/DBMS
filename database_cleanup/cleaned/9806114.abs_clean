A new type of quantum master equation is presented which is expressed interms of a recently introduced quantum antibracket. The equation involves onlycharge. It is proposed to determine the generalized quantum Maurer-Cartanequations for arbitrary open groups. These groups are the integration ofconstraints in arbitrary involutions. The only condition for this is that theconstraint operators may be embedded in an odd nilpotent operator, the BFV-BRSTcharge. The proposal is verified at the quasigroup level. The integrationformulas are also used to construct a generating operator for quantumantibrackets of operators in arbitrary involutions.
