I review the arguments in favor of/against the traditional hypothesis thatthe Planck, string and compactification scales are all within a couple oforders of magnitude from each other. I explain how the extreme brane-worldscenario, with TeV type I scale and two large (near millimetric) transversedimensions, creates conditions analogous to those of the energy desert and isthus naturally singled out. I comment on the puzzle of gauge couplingunification in this context.
