We develop an unambiguous and practical method to calculate one-loop quantumcorrections to the energies of classical time-independent field configurationsin renormalizable field theories. We show that the standard perturbativerenormalization procedure suffices here as well. We apply our method to asimplified model where a charged scalar couples to a neutral "Higgs" field, andcompare our results to the derivative expansion.
