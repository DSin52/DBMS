Some quantum mechanical potentials, singular at short distances, lead toultraviolet divergences when used in perturbation theory. Exactly as in quantumfield theories, but much simpler, regularization and renormalization lead tofinite physical results, which compare correctly to the exact ones. The Diracdelta potential, because of its relevance to triviality, and the Aharonov-Bohmpotential, because ot its relevance to anyons, are used as examples here.
