When it comes to the topological aspects, gravity may have profound effectseven at the level of particle physics despite its negligibly small relativestrength well below the Planck scale. In spite of this intriguing possibility,relatively little attempt has been made toward the exhibition of thisphenomenon in relevant physical systems. In the present work, perhaps thesimplest and the most straightforward new algorithm for generating solutions to(anti) self-dual Yang-Mills (YM) equation in the typical gravitationalinstanton backgrounds is proposed and then applied to find the solutionspractically in all the gravitational instantons known. Solutions thus obtainedturn out to be some kind of instanton-meron hybrids possessing mixed featuresof both. Namely, they are rather exotic type of configurations obeying firstorder (anti) self-dual YM equation which are everywhere non-singular and havefinite Euclidean YM actions on one hand while exhibiting meron-like largedistance behavior and carrying generally fractional topological charge valueson the other. Close inspection, however, reveals that the solutions are morelike instantons rather than merons in their generic natures.
