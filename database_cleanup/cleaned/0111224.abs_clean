From first principles, I present a concrete realization of Carlip's idea onthe black hole entropy from the conformal field theory on the horizon in anydimension. New formulation is free of inconsistencies encountered in Carlip's.By considering a correct gravity action, whose variational principle is welldefined at the horizon, I $derive$ a correct $classical$ Virasoro generator forthe surface deformations at the horizon through the canonical method. Theexistence of the classical Virasoro algebra is crucial in obtaining an operatorVirasoro algebra, through canonical quantization, which produce the rightcentral charge and conformal weight $\sim A_+/\hbar G$ for the semiclassicalblack hole entropy. The coefficient of proportionality depends on the choice ofground state, which has to be put in by hand to obtain the correct numericalfactor 1/4 of the Bekenstein-Hawking (BH) entropy. The appropriate ground stateis different for the rotating and the non-rotating black holes but otherwise ithas a $universality$ for a wide variety of black holes. As a byproduct of myresults, I am led to conjecture that {\it non-commutativity of taking the limitto go to the horizon and computing variation is proportional to the Hamiltonianand momentum constraints}. It is shown that almost all the known unchargedblack hole solutions satisfy the conditions for the universal entropy formula.
