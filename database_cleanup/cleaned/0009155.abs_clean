Title: The Low Energy Dynamics of Non-BPS Branes

Authors: N.D. Lambert and I. Sachs

Comments: 6 pages and 3 figures, JHEP.cls. Talk given at the Conference

"Nonperturbative Quantum Effects 2000", ParisIn this talk we will discuss the low energy dynamics of non-BPS branesconstructed as stable brane/anti-brane pairs at an orbifold. In particular wewill determine the effective field theory and compare its predictions withthose of the full open string theory. While the position and vector degrees offreedom have the familiar form found in supersymmetric gauge theories, themassless modes orginating in the tachyonic sector display novel non-commutingflat directions. We will show that these flat directions persist to al ordersin alpha'. Finally we will briefly report on the open string loop corrections.
