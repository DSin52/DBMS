We observe that the ratio of determinants of $2d$ Laplacians which appear inthe duality transformation relating two sigma models with abelian isometriescan be represented as a torsion of an elliptic (DeRham) complex. As a result,this ratio can be computed exactly and is given by the exponential of a localfunctional of $2d$ metric and target space metric. In this way the well knowndilaton shift under duality is reproduced. We also present the exactcomputation of the determinant which appears in the duality transformation inthe path integral.
