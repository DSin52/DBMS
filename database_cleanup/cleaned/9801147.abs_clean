We present a general framework for Matrix theory compactified on a quotientspace R^n/G, with G a discrete group of Euclidean motions in R^n. The generalsolution to the quotient conditions gives a gauge theory on a noncommutativespace. We characterize the resulting noncommutative gauge theory in terms ofthe twisted group algebra of G associated with a projective regularrepresentation. Also we show how to extend our treatments to incorporateorientifolds.
