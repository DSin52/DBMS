Generalizations of the *-product (e.g. n-ary *_n operations) appear invarious places in the discussion of noncommutative gauge theories. Theseinclude the one-loop effective action of noncommutative gauge theories, thecouplings between massless closed and open string modes, and the Seiberg-Wittenmap between the ordinary and noncommutative Yang-Mills fields. We propose thatthe natural way to understand the *_n operations is through the expansion of anopen Wilson line. We establish the connection between an open Wilson line andaction for the one-loop F^4 terms in the noncommutative N=4 SYM theory; (II)find the gauge invariant couplings between the noncommutative SYM modes and themassless closed string modes in flat space; (III) propose a closed form for theSeiberg-Witten map in the U(1) case.
