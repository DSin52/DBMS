I investigate a class of dynamical systems in which finite pieces ofspacetime contain finite amounts of information. Most of the guiding principlesdeterministic; spacetime may be foliated into Cauchy surfaces; the law ofevolution is local (there is a light-cone structure); and the geometry evolveslocally (curvature may be present; big bangs are possible). However, thesystems differ from general relativity in that spacetime is a combinatorialobject, constructed by piecing together copies of finitely many types ofallowed neighborhoods in a prescribed manner. Hence at least initially there isno metric. The role of diffeomorphism is played by a combinatorial equivalencemap which is local and preserves information content. Most of my results comein the 1+1-dimensional oriented case. There sets of spaces may be describedequivalently by matrices of nonnegative integers, directed graphs, or symmetrictensors; local equivalences between space sets are generated by simple matrixtransformations. These equivalence maps turn out to be closely related to theflow equivalence maps between subshifts of finite type studied in symbolicdynamics. Also, the symmetric tensor algebra generated by equivalencetransformations turns out to be isomorphic to the abstract tensor algebragenerated by commutative cocommutative bialgebras. In higher dimensions I studythe case where space is a special type of colored graph (discovered by Pezzana)which may be interpreted as an n-dimensional pseudomanifold. Finally, I showhow one may study the behavior of combinatorial spacetimes by searching forconstants of motion, which typically are associated with local flows and oftenmay be interpreted in terms of particles.
