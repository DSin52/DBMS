requestWe argue that the gauge-fermion interaction in multiflavour quantumelectrodynamics in $(2 + 1)$-dimensions is responsible for non-fermi liquidbehaviour in the infrared, in the sense of leading to the existence of anon-trivial (quasi) fixed point that lies between the trivial fixed point (atinfinite momenta) and the region where dynamical symmetry breaking and massgeneration occurs. This quasi-fixed point structure implies slowly varying,rather than fixed, couplings in the intermediate regime of momenta, a situationwhich resembles that of (four-dimensional) `walking technicolour' models ofparticle physics. The inclusion of wave-function renormalization yieldsmarginal $O(1/N)$-corrections to the `bulk' non-fermi liquid behaviour causedby the gauge interaction in the limit of infinite flavour number. Suchcorrections lead to the appearance of modified critical exponents. Inparticular, at low temperatures there appear to be logarithmic scalingviolations of the linear resistivity of the system of order $O(1/N)$.Connection with the anomalous normal-state properties of certain condensedmatter systems relevant for high-temperature superconductivity is brieflydiscussed. The relevance of the large (flavour) $N$ expansion to thefermi-liquid problem is emphasized. As a partial result of our analysis, wepoint out the absence of Charge-Density-Wave Instabilities from the effectivelow-energy theory, as a consequence of gauge invariance.
