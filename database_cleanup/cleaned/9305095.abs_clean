We propose $N=2$ holomorphic Yang-Mills theory on compact K\"{a}hlermanifolds and show that there exists a simple mapping from the $N=2$topological Yang-Mills theory. It follows that intersection parings on themoduli space of Einstein-Hermitian connections can be determined by examiningthe small coupling behavior of the $N=2$ holomorphic Yang-Mills theory. Thispaper is a higher dimensional generalization of the Witten's work on physicalYang-Mills theory in two dimensions.
