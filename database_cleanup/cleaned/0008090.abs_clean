We present a rigorous proof of the convergence theorem for the Feynman graphsin arbitrary massive Euclidean quantum field theories on non-commutative R^d(NQFT). We give a detailed classification of divergent graphs in some massiveNQFT and demonstrate the renormalizability of some of these theories.
