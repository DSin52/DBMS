We build and investigate a pure gauge theory on arbitrary discrete groups. Asystematic approach to the construction of the differential calculus ispresented. We discuss the metric properties of the models and introduce theaction functionals for unitary gauge theories. A detailed analysis of twosimple models based on $\z_2$ and $\z_3$ follows. Finally we study the methodof combining the discrete and continuous geometry.
