We give an overview of various composite BPS configurations of string theoryand M-theory p-branes represented as classical supergravity solutions. Type IIstring backgrounds can be obtained by S- and T- dualities from NS-NS string -5-brane configurations corresponding to exact conformal sigma models. Thesingle-center solutions can be also generated from the Schwarzschild solutionby applying a sequence of boosts, dualities and taking the extremal limit.Basic `marginal' backgrounds representing threshold BPS bound states of branesare parametrised by a number of independent harmonic functions. `Non-marginal'BPS configurations in D=10 can be constructed from marginal ones by usingU-duality and thus depend also on a number of O(d,d) and SL(2,R) parameters. Wepresent a new more general class of configurations in which some of the branesor their intersections are localised on other branes. In particular, we findthe type IIB supergravity background describing the BPS configuration of a3-brane, RR 5-brane and NS-NS 5-brane, and related `localised' 2-5-5 D=11solution. We also consider the classical action for a 3-brane probe moving insuch backgrounds and determine the structure of the corresponding moduli spacemetrics.
