The present paper is devoted to the study of geometry of Batalin-Vilkoviskyquantization procedure. The main mathematical objects under consideration areP-manifolds and SP-manifolds (supermanifolds provided with an odd symplecticstructure and, in the case of SP-manifolds, with a volume element). TheBatalin-Vilkovisky procedure leads to consideration of integrals of thesuperharmonic functions over Lagrangian submanifolds. The choice of Lagrangiansubmanifold can be interpreted as a choice of gauge condition; Batalin andVilkovisky proved that in some sense their procedure is gauge independent. Weprove much more general theorem of the same kind. This theorem leads to aconjecture that one can modify the quantization procedure in such a way as toavoid the use of the notion of Lagrangian submanifold. In the next paper wewill show that this is really so at least in the semiclassical approximation.Namely the physical quantities can be expressed as integrals over some set ofcritical points of solution S to the master equation with the integrandexpressed in terms of Reidemeister torsion. This leads to a simplification ofquantization procedure and to the possibility to get rigorous results also inthe infinite-dimensional case. The present paper contains also a competeclassification of P-manifolds and SP-manifolds. The classification isinteresting by itself, but in this paper it plays also a role of an importanttool in the proof of other results.
