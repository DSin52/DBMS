A naive dimensional reduction of the $N=1, D=10$ supergravity theory thatnaturally arises in five-brane models is used to determine the r\^ole of twomoduli, the breathing mode. It is shown that, under the duality transformationthat relates five-branes and strings, these two fields exchange the r\^oles of10-dimensional dilaton and radius of the compact manifold. A description ofthis phenomenon in terms of the linear multiplets of the 4-dimensionalsupergravity is also presented.
