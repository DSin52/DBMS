We study chiral induced gravity in the light-cone gauge and show that thetheory is consistent for a particular choice of chiralities. The correspondingKac--Moody central charge has no forbidden region of complex values.Generalized analysis of the critical exponents is given and their relation tothe $SL(2,R)$ vacuum states is elucidated. All the parameters containinginformation about the theory can be traced back to the characteristics of thegroup of residual symmetry in the light--cone gauge.
