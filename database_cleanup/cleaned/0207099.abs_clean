We consider N=1 supersymmetric sine-Gordon theory (SSG) with supersymmetricintegrable boundary conditions (boundary SSG = BSSG). We find two possible waysto close the boundary bootstrap for this model, corresponding to two differentchoices for the boundary supercharge. We argue that these two bootstrapsolutions should correspond to the two integrable Lagrangian boundary theoriesconsidered recently by Nepomechie.
