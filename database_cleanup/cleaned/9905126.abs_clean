This paper studies the dual form of Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde (WDVV)equations in N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory by applying a dualitytransformation to WDVV equations. The dual WDVV equations called in this paperare non-linear differential equations satisfied by dual prepotential and arefound to have the same form with the original WDVV equations. However, incontrast with the case of weak coupling calculus, the perturbative part of dualprepotential itself does not satisfy the dual WDVV equations. Nevertheless, itis possible to show that the non-perturbative part of dual prepotential can bedetermined from dual WDVV equations, provided the perturbative part is given.As an example, the SU(4) case is presented. The non-perturbative dualprepotential derived in this way is consistent to the dual prepotentialobtained by D'Hoker and Phong.
