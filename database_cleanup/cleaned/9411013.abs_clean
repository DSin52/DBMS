We construct a random surface model with a string susceptibility exponent onequarter by taking an Ising model on a random surface and introducing anadditional degree of freedom which amounts to allowing certain outgrowths onthe surfaces. Fine tuning the Ising temperature and the weight factor foroutgrowths we find a triple point where the susceptibility exponent is onequarter. At this point magnetized and nonmagnetized gravity phases meet abranched polymer phase.
