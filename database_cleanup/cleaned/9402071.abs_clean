The generally accepted ``triviality'' of $\lambda\Phi^4$ theories does notforbid Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking but implies a trivially free shifted fieldwhich becomes effectively governed by a quadratic hamiltonian. As aconsequence, one expects the one-loop potential to be exact . We present alattice computation of the effective potential for massless $\lambda\Phi^4$theory which nicely confirms the expectations based on ``triviality''. Ourresults imply that the magnitude of the Higgs boson mass, beyond perturbationtheory, does not represent a measure of the observable interactions in thescalar sector of the standard model.
