1993We consider a simplified model of particles with effectively distancedependent statistics, that is particles coupled to a gauge field the Lagrangianof which contains the Chern-Simons term. We analyze the low-lying states of thetwo-particle system and show that under certain conditions they can exhibitnegative compressibility, hinting on a possible \`a la van der Vaals picture.
