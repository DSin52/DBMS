We present a maximally supersymmetric IIB string background. The geometry isthat of a conformally flat lorentzian symmetric space G/K with solvable G, witha homogeneous five-form flux. We give the explicit supergravity solution,compute the isometries, the 32 Killing spinors, and the symmetry superalgebra,and then discuss T-duality and the relation to M-theory.
