Static spherically symmetric asymptotically flat solutions to the U(1)Born-Infeld theory coupled to gravity and to a dilaton are investigated. Thedilaton enters in such a way that the theory is $SL(2,R)$- symmetric for a unitvalue of the dilaton coupling constant. We find globally regular solutions forany value of the effective coupling which is the ratio of the gravitational anddilaton couplings; they form a continuous sequence labeled by the sole freeparameter of the local solution near the origin. The allowed values of thisparameter are bounded from below, and, as the limiting value is approached, themass and the dilaton charge rise indefinitely and tend to a strict equality (insuitable units). Together with the electric charge they saturate the BPS boundof the corresponding linear U(1) theory. Beyond this boundary the solutionsbecome compact (singular), while the limiting solution at the exact boundaryvalue is non-compact and non-asymptotically flat. The black holes in thistheory exist for any value of the event horizon radius and also form a sequencelabelled by a continuously varying parameter restricted to a finite interval.The singularity inside the black hole exhibits a power-law mass inflation.
