A general non-relativistic field theory on the plane with couplings to anarbitrary number of abelian Chern-Simons gauge fields is considered. Elementaryexcitations of the system are shown to exhibit fractional and mutualstatistics. We identify the self-dual systems for which certain classical andquantal aspects of the theory can be studied in a much simplified mathematicalsetting. Then, specializing to the general self-dual system with twoChern-Simons gauge fields (and non-vanishing mutual statistics parameter), wepresent a systematic analysis for the static vortexlike classical solutions,with or without uniform background magnetic field. Relativistic generalizationsare also discussed briefly.
