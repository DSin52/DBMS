Certain limits of the duality between M-theory on ${T^5/Z_2}$ and IIB on K3are analyzed in Matrix theory. The correspondence between M-theory five-branesand ALE backgrounds is realized as three dimensional mirror symmetry.Non-critical strings dual to open membranes are explicitly described as gaugetheory excitations. We also comment on Type IIA on K3 and the appearance ofgauge symmetry enhancement at special points in the moduli space.
