An analysis of errors in measurement yields new insight into the penetrationof quantum particles into classically forbidden regions. In addition to``physical" values, realistic measurements yield ``unphysical" values which, weshow, can form a consistent pattern. An experiment to isolate a particle in aclassically forbidden region obtains negative values for its kinetic energy.These values realize the concept of a {\it weak value}, discussed in previousworks.
