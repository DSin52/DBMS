In the framework of a five-dimensional model with one 3-brane and an infiniteextra dimension, we discuss a process in which matter escapes from the braneand propagates into the bulk to arbitrarily large distances. An example is adecay of a particle of mass $2m$ residing on the brane into two particles ofmass $m$ that leave the brane and accelerate away. We calculate, in thelinearized theory, the metric induced by these particles on the brane. Thismetric does not obey the four-dimensional Einstein equations and corresponds toa spherical gravity wave propagating along the four-dimensional future lightcone. The four-dimensional space-time left behind the spherical wave is flat,so the gravitational field induced in the brane world by matter escaping fromthe brane disappears in a causal way.
