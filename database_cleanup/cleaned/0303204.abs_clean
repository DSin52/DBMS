We provide a simple low energy description of recombination of intersectingD-branes using super Yang-Mills theory. The recombination is realized bycondensation of an off-diagonal tachyonic fluctuation localized at theintersecting point. The recombination process is equivalent to brane-antibraneannihilation, thus our result confirms Sen's conjecture on tachyoncondensation, although we work in the super Yang-Mills theory whose energyscale is much lower than alpha'. We also discuss the decay width ofnon-parallelly separated D-branes.
