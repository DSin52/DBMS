The $N=2$ supersymmetric {\it self-dual} Yang-Mills theory and the$N=4$ and $N=2$ {\it self-dual} supergravities in $2+2$ space-timedimensions are formulated for the first time. These formulations utilizesolutions of the Bianchi identities subject to the super-Yang-Mills orsupergravity constraints in the relevant $N$-extended superspace with thespace-time signature $(2,2)$.
