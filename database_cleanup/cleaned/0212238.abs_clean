We study the synchrotron radiation in noncommutative electrodynamics at firstorder in theta. There are two main results. On the theoretical side, we find anacausal behavior for the electromagnetic field in the form of time-derivativeshigher than two. This effect naturally arises even if only theta^(12) isdifferent from zero, and is due to the presence in the theory of two differentspeeds of light. On the phenomenological side, we find that the synchrotronradiation is a very promising candidate to search for experimental evidences ofthe effects of noncommutativity or, conversely, to establish tight bounds onthe magnitude of theta.
