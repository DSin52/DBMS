Conference on the Foundations of Quantum Field TheoryOver the past five years, there has been significant progress on the problemof quantization of diffeomorphism covariant field theories with {\it local}degrees of freedom. The absence of a background space-time metric in thesetheories gives rise to a host of conceptual and technical difficulties becausemost of the familiar methods from axiomatic, constructive and perturbativequantum field theory are no longer applicable. Perhaps the most strikingexamples of these problems arise in the construction of a quantum field theoryof geometry. We show that these problems can be tackled using newnon-perturbative methods. In particular, one can rigorously define certaingeometric operators and show that their spectrum is discrete. Thus, there is aprecise sense in which the geometry is quantized at the Planck scale and thecontinuum picture is only a coarse-grained approximation.
