The cyclic evolutions and associated geometric phases induced bytime-independent Hamiltonians are studied for the case when the evolutionoperator becomes the identity (those processes are called {\it evolutionloops}). We make a detailed treatment of systems having equally-spaced energylevels. Special emphasis is made on the potentials which have the same spectrumas the harmonic oscillator potential (the generalized oscillator potentials)and on their recently found coherent states.
