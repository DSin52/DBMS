Turning on background fields in string theory sometimes has an alternativeinterpretation as a deformation of the target space geometry. A particularlywell-known case is the NS-NS two form B, which gives rise to space-timenon-commutativity. In this note we point out that this phenomenon extends toten-dimensional superspace when employing a covariant quantization of thesuperstring, generalizing an observation by Ooguri and Vafa in four dimensions.In particular, we will find that RR field strengths give rise to a non-zero$\{\theta,\theta\}$ anti-commutator, just as in four dimensions, whereas thegravitino yields a non-zero value for $[x,\theta]$.
