We present dyonic BPS static black hole solutions for general d=4, N=2supergravity theories coupled to vector and hypermultiplets. These solutionsare generalisations of the spherically symmetric Majumdar-Papapetrou black holesolutions of Einstein-Maxwell gravity and are completely characterised by a setof constrained harmonic functions. In terms of the underlying special geometry,these harmonic functions are identified with the imaginary part of theholomorphic sections defining the special K\"ahler manifold and the metric isexpressed in terms of the symplectic invariant K\"ahler potential. Therelations of the holomorphic sections to the harmonic functions constitute thegeneralised stabilisation equations for the moduli fields. In addition toasymptotic flatness, the harmonic functions are also constrained by therequirement that the K\"ahler connection of the underlying Hodge-K\"ahlermanifold has to vanish in order to obtain static solutions. The behaviour ofthese solutions near the horizon is also explained.
