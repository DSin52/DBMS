We report here the status of different gauge conditions in the canonicalformulation of quantum electrodynamics on light-front surfaces. We start withthe massive vector fields as pedagogical models where all basic concepts andpossible problems manifestly appear. Several gauge choices are considered forboth the infinite and the finite volume formulation of massless gauge fieldelectrodynamics. We obtain the perturbative Feynman rules in the first approachand the quantum Hamiltonian for all sectors in the second approach. Differentspace-time dimensions are discussed in all models where they crucially changethe physical meaning. Generally, fermions are considered as the charged matterfields but also one simple 1+1 dimensional model is discussed for scalarfields. Finally the perspectives for further research projects are discussed.
