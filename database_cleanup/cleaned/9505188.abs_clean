Title: New Gauge Invariant Variables for Yang-Mills Theory

Comments: 9pp., LaTeX

A new set of gauge invariant variables is defined to describe the physicalHilbert space of $d = 3 + 1$ $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory in the fixed-timecanonical formalism. A natural geometric interpretation arises due to the$GL(3)$ covariance found to hold for the basic equations and commutators of thetheory in the canonical formalism. We emphasize, however, that we are notinterested in and do not consider the coupling of the theory to gravity. Weconcentrate here on a technical difficulty of this approach, the calculation ofthe electric field energy. This in turn hinges on the well-definedness of thetransformation of variables, an issue which is settled through degenerateperturbation theory arguments.
