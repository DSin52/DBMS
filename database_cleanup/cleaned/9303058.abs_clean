We extend the theory of the gauging of classical quadratically nonlinearalgebras without a central charge but with a coset structure, to the quantumlevel. Inserting the minimal anomalies into the classical transformation rulesof the currents introduces further quantum corrections to the classicaltransformation rules of the gauge fields and currents which additivelyrenormalize the structure constants. The corresponding Ward identities are thec -> infinity limit of the full quantum Ward identities, and reveal that the cTwo examples are given.
