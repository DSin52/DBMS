We present a systematic study of the constraints coming from target-spaceduality and the associated duality anomaly cancellations on orbifold-like 4-Dstrings. A prominent role is played by the modular weights of the masslessfields. We present a general classification of all possible modular weights ofmassless fields in Abelian orbifolds. We show that the cancellation of modularanomalies strongly constrains the massless fermion content of the theory, inclose analogy with the standard ABJ anomalies. We emphasize the validity ofthis approach not only for (2,2) orbifolds but for (0,2) models with andwithout Wilson lines. As an application one can show that one cannot build a${\bf Z}_3$ or ${\bf Z}_7$ orbifold whose massless charged sector with respectto the (level one) gauge group $SU(3)\times SU(2) \times U(1)$ is that of theminimal supersymmetric standard model, since any such model would necessarilyhave duality anomalies. A general study of those constraints for Abelianorbifolds is presented. Duality anomalies are also related to the computationof string threshold corrections to gauge coupling constants. We present ananalysis of the possible relevance of those threshold corrections to thecomputation of $\sin^2\theta_W$ and $\alpha_3$ for all Abelian orbifolds. Someparticular {\it minimal} scenarios, namely those based on all ${\bf Z}_N$orbifolds except ${\bf Z}_6$
