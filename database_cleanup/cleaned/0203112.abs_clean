Title: Milne Universe, Tachyons, and Quantum Group

Comments: harvmac, 14pp

We analyze the spectrum of the bosonic and superstring on the orbifold of thespace-time by a boost, leading to the cosmological singularity. We show thatthe modular invariance leads to the spectrum where the twisted sector tachyon,together with all other twisted sector fields, present in the Euclidean versionof the orbifold, is absent. This makes impossible to resolve the singularity bya marginal deformation of the worldsheet CFT. We also establish a relationbetween the resolution of rotational orbifolds in Euclidean and Lorentziansetups, and quantum groups. The analysis confirms the impossibility ofresolving the cosmological orbifold singularity.
