We consider constructing a canonical quantum theory of the light-cone gauge($A_-$=0) Schwinger model in the light-cone representation. Quantizationconditions are obtained by requiring that translational generators $P_+$ and$P_-$ give rise to Heisenberg equations which, in a physical subspace, areconsistant with the field equations. A consistent operator solution withresidual gauge degrees of freedom is obtained by solving initial value problemson the light-cones. The construction allows a parton picture although we have aphysical vacuum with nontrivial degeneracies in the theory.
