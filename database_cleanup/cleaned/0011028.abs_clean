Authors: H. Itoyama

Comments: 13 pages, Latex

This is a summary of a series of papers hep-th/9910263,0005283,0010066written with B. Chen, T. Matsuo and K. Murakami on a p-p', (p<p^{\prime}) openstring with B_{ij} field, which has led us to the explicit identification ofthe Dp-brane with the noncommutative projector soliton via the gaussian dampingfactor. A lecture given at Summer Institute 2000, FujiYoshida, Yamanashi,Japan, at August 7-14, 2000.
