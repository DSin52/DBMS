Self-dual gravity may be reformulated as the two dimensional principal chiralmodel with the group of area preserving diffeomorphisms as its gauge group.Using this formulation, it is shown that self-dual gravity contains an infinitedimensional hidden symmetry whose generators form the Affine (Kac-Moody)algebra associated with the Lie algebra of area preserving diffeomorphisms.This result provides an observable algebra and a solution generating techniquefor self-dual gravity.
