We give a recipe relating holomorphic quantities in supersymmetric fieldtheory to their descendants in non-supersymmetric Z_2 orbifold field theories.This recipe, consistent with a recent proposal of Strassler, gives exactresults for bifermion condensates, domain wall tensions and gauge couplingconstants in the planar limit of the orbifold theories.
