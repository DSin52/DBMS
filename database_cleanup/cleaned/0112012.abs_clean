Quantum non-perturbative geometry of the universal hypermultiplet isinvestigated. We consider the simple case when the D-instantons, originatingfrom the Calabi-Yau wrapped D2-branes, preserve a U(1)xU(1) symmetry of theuniversal hypermultiplet moduli space. The cluster decomposition ofD-instantons is proved to be valid in a curved spacetime. We find an SL(2,Z)duality-invariant quaternionic solution to the effective NLSM metric of theuniversal hypermultiplet, which is governed by a modular-invariant function.This function appears to be the same function found by Green and Gutperle, anddescribing the modular invariant completion of the R^4 term by the D-instantoneffects in the type-II superstring/M-theory. We argue that our solutioninterpolates between the perturbative (large CY volume) region and thesuperconformal (Landau-Ginzburg) region in the universal hypermultiplet modulispace. We also calculate a non-perturbative scalar potential in thehyper-K\"ahler limit, when an abelian isometry of the universal hypermultipletmoduli space is gauged in the presence of D-instantons.
