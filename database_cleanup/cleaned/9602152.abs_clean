We discuss the algebraic renormalization of the Yang--Mills gauge fieldtheory in the presence of translations. Due to the translations the algebrabetween Sorella's $\d$--operator, the exterior derivative and theBRST--operator closes. Therefore, we are able to derive an integrated parameterformula collecting in an elegant and compact way all nontrivial solutions ofthe descent equations.
