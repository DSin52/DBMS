An $N = 1$ supersymmetric version of two dimensional dilaton gravity coupledto matter is considered. It is shown that the linear dilaton vacuumspontaneously breaks half the supersymmetries, leaving broken a linearcombination of left and right supersymmetries which squares to timetranslations. Supersymmetry suggests a spinorial expression for the ADM energy$M$, as found by Witten in four-dimensional general relativity. Using thisexpression it is proven that ${M}$ is non-negative for smooth initial dataasymptotic (in both directions) to the linear dilaton vacuum, provided that the(not necessarily supersymmetric) matter stress tensor obeys the dominant energycondition. A {\it quantum} positive energy theorem is also proven for thesemiclassical large-$N$ equations, despite the indefiniteness of the quantumstress tensor. For black hole spacetimes, it is shown that $M$ is bounded frombelow by $e^{- 2 \phi_H}$, where $\phi_H$ is the value of the dilaton at theapparent horizon, provided only that the stress tensor is positive outside theapparent horizon. This is the two-dimensional analogue of an unprovenconjecture due to Penrose. Finally, supersymmetry is used to prove positiveenergy theorems for a large class of generalizations of dilaton gravity whicharise in consideration of the quantum theory.
