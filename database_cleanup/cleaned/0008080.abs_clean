We use the finite temperature AdS/CFT approach to demonstrate logarithmicbroadening of the confining QCD3 flux tube as a function of quark separation.This behavior indicates that, unlike lattice QCD, there is no rougheningtransition in the AdS/CFT formulation, which raises the interesting possibilityof extrapolating strong coupling results to weak couplings by the use ofresummation techniques. In the zero-temperature non-confining limit, we findthat this logarithmic broadening of the field strength distribution is absent.Our results are obtained numerically at strong couplings, in the supergravityapproximation.
