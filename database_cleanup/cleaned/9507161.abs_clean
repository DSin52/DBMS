A recently introduced model describing the folding of the triangular latticeis generalized allowing for defects in the lattice and written as an Isingmodel with nearest-neighbor and plaquette interactions on the honeycomblattice. Its phase diagram is determined in the hexagon approximation of thecluster variation method and the crossover from the pure Ising to the purefolding model is investigated, obtaining a quite rich structure with severalmulticritical points. Our results are in very good agreement with the availableexact ones and extend a previous transfer matrix study.
