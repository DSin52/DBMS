Space-TimeAuthors: V.Ch.Zhukovsky, V.V.Khudyakov, I.V.Mamsurov

Comments: 6 pages, LATEX Talk presented at the Fourth International Workshop on

Quantum Theory under the Influence of External Conditions, LeipzigUniversity, Leipzig, September 1998Different models with nonabelian homogeneous condensate fields are consideredin the one-loop approximation. Effective action in a model of gluodynamics incurved space is calculated. Free energy and its minimum in a (2+1)-dimensionalmodel of QCD are investigated. Photon polarization operator (PO) is obtained.
