It is argued that the type IIA 10-dimensional superstring theory is actually acompactified 11-dimensional supermembrane theory in which the fundamentalsupermembrane is identified with the the solitonic membrane of 11-dimensionalsupergravity. The charged extreme black holes of the 10-dimensional type IIAstring theory are interpreted as the Kaluza-Klein modes of 11-dimensionalsupergravity and the dual sixbranes as the analogue of Kaluza-Klein monopoles.All other p-brane solutions of the type IIA superstring theory are derived fromthe 11-dimensional membrane and its magnetic dual fivebrane soliton.
