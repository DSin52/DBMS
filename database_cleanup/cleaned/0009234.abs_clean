We analyze a broad class of stationary solutions with residual N=1supersymmetry of four-dimensional N=2 supergravity theories with termsquadratic in the Weyl tensor. These terms are encoded in a holomorphicfunction, which determines the most relevant part of the action and which playsa central role in our analysis. The solutions include extremal black holes androtating field configurations, and may have multiple centers. We prove thatthey are expressed in terms of harmonic functions associated with the electricand magnetic charges carried by the solutions by a proper generalization of theso-called stabilization equations. Electric/magnetic duality is manifestthroughout the analysis.We also prove that spacetimes with unbroken supersymmetry are fullydetermined by electric and magnetic charges. This result establishes theso-called fixed-point behavior according to which the moduli fields must flowtowards certain prescribed values on a fully supersymmetric horizon, but now ina more general context with higher-order curvature interactions. We brieflycomment on the implications of our results for the metric on the moduli spaceof extremal black hole solutions.
