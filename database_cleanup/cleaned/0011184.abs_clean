We discuss a new feature of the 5d Kaluza-Klein cosmology. For that purpose,we obtain the simplest x^5-dependent solution which, in the reduceddescription, is associated with a radiation-dominated Robertson-Walkeruniverse, and also can be regarded as an extension of the Schwarzschildsolution. This solution enables us to deduce an important result that anevolving universe is related with a static universe by the gaugetransformation, i.e., they are gauge equivalent. This means that having adifferent universe simply corresponds to choosing a different gauge
