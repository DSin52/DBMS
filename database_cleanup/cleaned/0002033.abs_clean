In order to reconcile the non conventional character of brane cosmology withstandard Friedmann cosmology, we introduce in this paper a slowly-varyingquintessence scalar field in the brane and analyse the cosmological solutionscorresponding to some equations of state for the scalar field. Differentcompensation mechanisms between the cosmological constant in the bulk and theconstant tension resulting from the combined effect of ordinary matter and thequintessence scalar field are derived or assumed. It has been checked that theRandall-Sundrum approach is not necessarily the best procedure to reconcilebrane and standard cosmologies, and that there exists at least anothercompensating mechanism that reproduces a rather conventional behaviour for anaccelerating universe.
