Rev. DA new presentation of the Borchers-Buchholz result of the Lorentz-invarianceof the energy-momentum spectrum in theories with broken Lorentz symmetry isgiven in terms of properties of the Green's functions of microcausal Bose andFermi-fields. Strong constraints based on complex geometry phenomenons areshown to result from the interplay of the basic principles of causality andall Lorentz frames are satisfied, then it is unavoidable that all stableparticles of the theory be governed by Lorentz-invariant dispersion laws; inall the field sectors, discrete parts outside the continuum as well as thethresholds of the continuous parts of the energy-momentum spectrum, withpossible holes inside it, are necessarily represented by mass-shellhyperboloids (or the light-cone). No violation of this geometrical fact can beproduced by spontaneous breaking of the Lorentz symmetry, even if thefield-theoretical framework is enlarged so as to include short-distancesingularities wilder than distributions.
