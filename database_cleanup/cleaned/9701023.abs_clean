We investigate topological properties of Calabi-Yau fourfolds and consider awide class of explicit constructions in weighted projective spaces and, moregenerally, toric varieties. Divisors which lead to a non-perturbativesuperpotential in the effective theory have a very simple description in thetoric construction. Relevant properties of them follow just by counting latticepoints and can be also used to construct examples with negative Euler number.We study nets of transitions between cases with generically smooth ellipticfibres and cases with ADE gauge symmetries in the N=1 theory due todegenerations of the fibre over codimension one loci in the base. Finally weinvestigate the quantum cohomology ring of this fourfolds using Frobeniusalgebras.
