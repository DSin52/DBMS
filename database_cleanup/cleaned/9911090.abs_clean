We write down charged macroscopic string solutions in type II stringtheories, compactified on torii, and present an explicit solution of the spinorKilling equations to show that they preserve 1/2 of the type IIsupersymmetries. The S-duality symmetry of the type IIB string theory inten-dimensions is used to write down the SL(2,Z) multiplets of such strings andthe corresponding 1/2 supersymmetry conditions. Finally we present examples ofplanar string networks, using charged macroscopic (p,q)-strings. An interestingfeature of some of these networks, which preserve 1/4 supersymmetry, is arequired alignment among three parameters, namely the orientation of strings, aU(1) phase associated with the maximal compact subgroup of SL(2, Z), and an(angular) parameter associated with a solution generating transformation, whichis responsible for creating charges and currents on the strings.
