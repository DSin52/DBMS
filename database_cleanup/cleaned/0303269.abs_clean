Brane inflation in superstring theory predicts that cosmic strings (but notdomain walls or monopoles) are produced towards the end of the inflationaryepoch. Here, we discuss the production, the spectrum and the evolution of suchcosmic strings, properties that differentiate them from those coming from anabelian Higgs model. As D-branes in extra dimensions, some type of cosmicstrings will dissolve rapidly in spacetime, while the stable ones appear with aspectrum of cosmic string tensions. Moreover, the presence of the extradimensions reduces the interaction rate of the cosmic strings in somescenarios, resulting in an order of magnitude enhancement of the number/energydensity of the cosmic string network when compared to the field theory case.
