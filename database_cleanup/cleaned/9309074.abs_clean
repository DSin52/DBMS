Two sets of identities between unitary minimal Virasoro characters at levels$m=3,4,5$ are presented and proven. The first identity suggests a connectionbetween the Ising and tricritical Ising models since the $m=3$ Virasorocharacters are obtained as bilinears of $m=4$ Virasoro characters. The secondidentity gives the tricritical Ising model characters as bilinears in the Isingmodel characters and the six combinations of $m=5$ Virasoro characters which donot appear in the spectrum of the three state Potts model. The implication ofthese identities on the study of the branching rules of $N=4$ superconformalcharacters into $\widehat{SU(2)} \times \widehat{SU(2)}$ characters isdiscussed.
