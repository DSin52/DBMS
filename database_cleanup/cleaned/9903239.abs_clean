The propagator is calculated on a noncommutative version of the flat planeand the Lobachevsky plane with and without an extra (euclidean) time parameter.In agreement with the general idea of noncommutative geometry it is found thatthe limit when the two `points' coincide is finite and diverges only when thegeometry becomes commutative. The flat 4-dimensional case is also considered.This is at the moment less interesting since there has been no curved casedeveloped with which it can be compared.
