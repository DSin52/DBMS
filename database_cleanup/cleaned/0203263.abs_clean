In modern physics, one of the greatest divides is that between space-time andquantum fields, as the fiber bundle of the Standard Model indicates. However onthe operational grounds the fields and space-time are not very different. Todescribe a field in an experimental region we have to assign coordinates to thepoints of that region in order to speak of "when" and "where" of the fielditself. But to operationally study the topology and to coordinatize the regionof space-time, the use of radars (to send and receive electromagnetic signals)is required. Thus the description of fields (or, rather, processes) and thedescription of space-time are indistinguishable at the fundamental level.Moreover, classical general relativity already says -- albeit preserving thefiber bundle structure -- that space-time and matter are intimately related.All this indicates that a new theory of elementary processes (out of which allthe usual processes of creation, annihilation and propagation, and consequentlythe topology of space-time itself would be constructed) has to be devised.In this thesis I present the foundations of such a finite, discrete,algebraic, quantum theory and apply it to the description of spin-1/2 quanta ofthe Standard Model.
