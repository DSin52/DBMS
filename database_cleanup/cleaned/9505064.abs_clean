The equations of motion for a Lagrangian ${\cal L}(k_1)$, depending on thecurvature $k_1$ of the particle worldline, embedded in a space--time ofconstant curvature, are considered and reformulated in terms of the principalcurvatures. It is shown that for arbitrary Lagrangian function ${\cal L}(k_1)$the general solution of the motion equations can be obtained by integrals. Byanalogy with the flat space--time case, the constants of integration areinterpreted as the particle mass and its spin. As examples, we completelyinvestigate Lagrangians linear and quadratic in $(k_1)$ and the model ofrelativistic particle with maximal proper acceleration, in a space--time withconstant curvature.
