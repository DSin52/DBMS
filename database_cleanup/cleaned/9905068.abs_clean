The Born-Infeld theory of a toroidal D3-brane has an SL(5,Z) U-dualitysymmetry. We investigate how this symmetry is reflected in the supersymmetryalgebra. We propose an action of the group on the gauge theory fields in theBPS sector by introducing an extra field together with an additional symmetry,and argue for the U-invariance of the degeneracies of the BPS spectrum.
