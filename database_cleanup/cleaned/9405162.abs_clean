Black hole entropy is studied for an exactly solvable model oftwo-dimensional gravity\cite{rst1}, using recently developed Noether chargetechniques\cite{wald1}. This latter approach is extended to accomodate thenon-local form of the semiclassical effective action. In the two-dimensionalmodel, the final black hole entropy can be expressed as a local quantityevaluated on the horizon. This entropy is shown to satisfy an increase theoremon either the global or apparent horizon of a two-dimensional black hole.
