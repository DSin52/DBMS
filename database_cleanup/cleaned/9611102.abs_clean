We derive the Holstein-Primakoff oscillator realization on the coadjointorbits of the $SU(N+1)$ and $SU(1,N)$ group by treating the coadjoint orbits asa constrained system and performing the symplectic reduction. By using theaction-angle variables transformations, we transform the original variablesinto Darboux variables. The Holstein-Primakoff expressions emerge afterquantization in a canonical manner with a suitable normal ordering. Thecorresponding Dyson realizations are also obtained and some related issues arediscussed.
