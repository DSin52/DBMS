Black hole evaporation may lead to massive or massless remnants, or nakedsingularities. This paper investigates this process in the context of two quitedifferent two dimensional black hole models. The first is the original CGHSmodel, the second is another two dimensional dilaton-gravity model, but withproperties much closer to physics in the real, four dimensional, world.Numerical simulations are performed of the formation and subsequent evaporationof black holes and the results are found to agree qualitatively with theexactly solved modified CGHS models, namely that the semiclassicalapproximation breaks down just before a naked singularity appears.
