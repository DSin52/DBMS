Title: Classifying algebras for boundary conditions and traces on spaces of

conformal blocksAuthors: C. Schweigert, J. Fuchs

Comments: 7 pages, LaTeX. Slightly extended version of a talk given by C.

Schweigert at the 31st International Symposium Ahrenshoop on the Theory ofElementary Particles, Buckow, Germany, September 1997The boundary conditions of a non-trivial string background are classified. Tothis end we need traces on various spaces of conformal blocks, for whichgeneralizations of the Verlinde formula are presented.
