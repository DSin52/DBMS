It is shown that $SL(n,R)$ KdV hierarchy can be expressed as definitenonpolynomials in Kac Moody currents and their derivatives by the action ofBorel subgroup of $SL(n,R)$ on the phase space of centrally extended $sl(n,R)$Kac Moody currents. Construction of Lax pair is shown, confirming DrinfeldSokolov type Hamiltonian reduction. This suggests an example of a moduli spacewith symplectic structure corresponding to extended conformal symmetries.
