$SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory in three dimensions, with a Chern-Simons term oflevel $k$ (an integer) added, has two dimensionful coupling constants, $g^2 k$and $g^2 N$; its possible phases depend on the size of $k$ relative to $N$. For$k \gg N$, this theory approaches topological Chern-Simons theory with noYang-Mills term, and expectation values of multiple Wilson loops yield Jonespolynomials, as Witten has shown; it can be treated semiclassically. For $k=0$,the theory is badly infrared singular in perturbation theory, anon-perturbative mass and subsequent quantum solitons are generated, and Wilsonloops show an area law. We argue that there is a phase transition between thesetwo behaviors at a critical value of $k$, called $k_c$, with $k_c/N \approx 2calculation shows that the perturbative theory has tachyonic problems if $k\leq 29N/12$.The theory becomes sensible only if there is an additional dynamicsource of gauge-boson mass, just as in the $k=0$ case. Second, we study in arough approximation the free energy and show that for $k \leq k_c$ there is anon-trivial vacuum condensate driven by soliton entropy and driving agauge-boson dynamical mass $M$, while both the condensate and $M$ vanish for $k\geq k_c$. Third, we study possible quantum solitons stemming from an effectiveaction having both a Chern-Simons mass $m$ and a (gauge-invariant) dynamicalmass $M$. We show that if $M \gsim 0.5 m$, there are finite-action quantumsphalerons, while none survive in the classical limit $M=0$, as shown earlierby D'Hoker and Vinet. There are also quantum topological vortices smoothlyvanishing as $M \rightarrow 0$.
