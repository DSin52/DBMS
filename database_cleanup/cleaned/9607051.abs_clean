We study T-duality for open strings in various $D$-manifolds in the approachof canonical transformations. We show that this approach is particularly usefulto study the mapping of the boundary conditions since it provides an explicitrelation between initial and dual variables. We consider non-abelian dualitytransformations and show that under some restrictions the dual is a curved$(d-{\rm dim}G-1)$ D-brane, where $d$ is the dimension of the space-time and$G$ the non-abelian symmetry group. The generalization to $N=1$ supersymmetricsigma models with abelian and non-abelian isometries is also considered.
