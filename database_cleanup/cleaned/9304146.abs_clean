Title: A Few Projects in String Theory

Authors: A.M. Polyakov

Comments: 18 pages, latex (references added)

In these lectures I discuss various unsolved problems of string theory andtheir relations to quantum gravity, 3d Ising model, large N QCD, and quantumcosmology. No solutions are presented but some new and perhaps usefulapproaches are suggested.
