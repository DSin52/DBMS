The hypothesis of brane-embedded matter appears to gain increasingcredibility in astrophysics. However, it can only be truly successful if itsimplications on particle interaction are consistent with existing knowledge.This letter focuses on the issue of optical interference, and shows that atleast one brane-world model can offer plausible interpretations for bothYoung's double-slit experiment, and the experiments that fit less neatly withit. The basic assumption is that particles can interact at a distance throughthe vibrations induced by their motion on the brane. The qualitative analysisof this mechanism suggests that fringe visibility in single photon interferencedepends on the energy levels and the interval between interacting particles. Adouble-slit experiment, performed with coherent single red photons shouldreveal the disappearance of interference when the time delay between individualparticles is increased over 2.18 seconds. In the case of infrared photons withthe frequency of $9\cdot 10^{13}$ Hz, interference must vanish already at theinterval of one second.
