String propagation on a cone with deficit angle $2\pi (1- \frac{1}{N} ) $ isdescribed by constructing a non-compact orbifold of a plane by a $Z_{N}$subgroup of rotations. It is modular invariant and has tachyons in the twistedsectors that are localized to the tip of the cone. A possible connection withthe quantum corrections to the black hole entropy is outlined. The entropycomputed by analytically continuing in N would receive contribution only fromthe twisted sectors and be naturally proportional to the area of the eventhorizon. Evidence is presented for a new duality for these orbifolds similar tothe ${\scriptstyle R} \rightarrow {1\over R} $ duality.
