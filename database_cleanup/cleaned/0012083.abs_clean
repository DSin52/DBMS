This paper is a revised version of our recent publication Faber et al., Phys.Rev. D62 (2000) 025019, hep-th/9907048. The main revision concerns theexpansion into group characters that we have used for the evaluation of pathintegrals over gauge degrees of freedom. In the present paper we apply theexpansion recommended by Diakonov and Petrov in hep-lat/0008004. Our formerexpansion was approximate and in the region of the particular values ofparameters violated the completeness condition by 1.4%. We show that by usingthe expansion into characters recommended by Diakonov and Petrov inhep-lat/0008004 our previous results are retained and the path integral overgauge degrees of freedom for Wilson loops derived by Diakonov and Petrov (Phys.Lett. B224 (1989) 131 and hep-lat/0008004) by using a special regularization iserroneous and predicts zero value for the Wilson loop. We give comments on thepaper hep-lat/0008004.
