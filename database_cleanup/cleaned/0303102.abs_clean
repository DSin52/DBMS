We derive the actions for type II Green-Schwarz strings up to second order inthe fermions, for general bosonic backgrounds. We base our work on theso-called normal coordinate expansion. The resulting actions are$\kappa$-symmetric and, for the case of surviving background supersymmetries,supersymmetric. We first obtain the type IIa superstring action from the 11Dsupermembrane by double dimensional reduction. Then, by means of ageneralization of T-duality we derive the type IIb superstring action. Theresulting actions are surprisingly simple and elegant.
