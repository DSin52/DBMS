We study the gauge coupling evolution of a unified theory in the compactRandall-Sundrum model with gauge bosons propagating in the bulk. One-loopcorrections in AdS are interpreted in the 4d dual theory as the sum of twoadditional particles coupled to the CFT. We have calculated the scalar loopcorrection to the low energy gauge couplings both in scenarios where the GUTsymmetry is broken by boundary conditions and with the Higgs mechanism. In eachcase our results are what expected from the holographic dual theory.
