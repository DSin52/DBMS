We have developed N=1 supersymmetric nonlinear realization methods, whichrealize global symmetry breaking in N=1 supersymmetric theories. The targetspace of nonlinear sigma models with a linear model origin is a G^C-orbit,which is a non-compact non-homogeneous K"ahler manifold. We show that, if andonly if the orbit is open, it includes a compact homogeneous K"ahler manifoldas a submanifold, and a class of strictly G-invariant K"ahler potentialsreduces to a K"ahler potential G-invariant up to a K"ahler transformation onthe submanifold. Hence, in the case of an open orbit, the most generallow-energy effective K"ahler potential can be written as the sum of those ofthe compact submanifolds and an arbitrary function of strictly G-invariants.
