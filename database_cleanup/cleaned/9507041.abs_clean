We propose a new formulation of the space-time interpretation of the $c=1$matrix model. Our formulation uses the well-known leg-pole factor that relatesthe matrix model amplitudes to that of the 2-dimensional string theory, butincludes fluctuations around the fermi vacuum on {\sl both sides} of theinverted harmonic oscillator potential of the double-scaled model, even whenthe fluctuations are small and confined entirely within the asymptotes in thephase plane. We argue that including fluctuations on both sides of thepotential is essential for a consistent interpretation of the leg-poletransformed theory as a theory of space-time gravity. We reproduce the knownresults for the string theory tree level scattering amplitudes for flat spaceand linear dilaton background as a special case. We show that the generic casecorresponds to more general space-time backgrounds. In particular, we identifythe parameter corresponding to background metric perturbation in string theory(black hole mass) in terms of the matrix model variables. Possible implicationsof our work for a consistent nonperturbative definition of string theory aswell as for quantized gravity and black-hole physics are discussed.
