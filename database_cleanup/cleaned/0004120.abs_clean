A set of on shell duality equations is proposed that leads to a map betweenstrings moving on symmetric spaces with opposite curvatures. The transformationmaps "waves" on a riemannian symmetric space to "waves" on its dual riemanniansymmetric space. This transformation preserves the energy momentum tensorthough it is not a canonical transformation. The preservation of the energymomentum tensor has a natural geometrical interpretation. The transformationmaps "particle-like solutions" into static "soliton-like solutions". Theresults presented here generalize earlier results of E. Ivanov.
