In this paper, we examine a generic theory of 1+1-dimensional gravity withcoupling to a scalar field. Special attention is paid to a class of models thathave a power-law form of dilaton potential and can capably admit black holesolutions. The study focuses on the formulation of a Lorentzian partitionfunction. We incorporate the principles of Hamiltonian thermodynamics, as wellas black hole spectroscopy, and find that the partition function can beexpressed in a well-defined, calculable form. We then go on to extract theblack hole entropy, including the leading-order quantum correction. Asanticipated, this correction can be expressed as the logarithm of the classicalentropy. Interestingly, the prefactor for this logarithmic correctiondisagrees, in both magnitude and sign, with the findings from a prior study (onthe very same model). We comment on this discrepancy and provide a possiblerationalization.
