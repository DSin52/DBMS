Affine Toda field theories in two dimensions constitute families ofintegrable, relativistically invariant field theories in correspondence withthe affine Kac-Moody algebras. The particles which are the quantum excitationsof the fields display interesting patterns in their masses and coupling andwhich have recently been shown to extend to the classical soliton solutionsarising when the couplings are imaginary. Here these results are extended fromthe untwisted to the twisted algebras. The new soliton solutions and theirmasses are found by a folding procedure which can be applied to the affineKac-Moody algebras themselves to provide new insights into their structures.The relevant foldings are related to inner automorphisms of the associatedfinite dimensional Lie group which are calculated explicitly and related towhat is known as the twisted Coxeter element. The fact that the twisted affineKac-Moody algebras possess vertex operator constructions emerges naturally andis relevant to the soliton solutions.
