Monopole in the Global Monopole BackgroundAuthors: A. L. Cavalcanti de Oliveira and E. R. Bezerra de Mello

Comments: 10 pages. Contribution to the Proceedings of "2nd International

Londrina Winter School Mathematical Methods in Physics". August 26-30, 2002,Londrina, PR, BrazilWe analyze the nonrelativistic quantum scattering problem of a chargedparticle by an Abelian magnetic monopole in the background of a globalmonopole. In addition to the magnetic and geometric effects, we consider theinfluence of the electrostatic self-interaction on the charged particle.Moreover, for the specific case where the electrostatic self-interactionbecomes attractive, charged particle-monopole bound system can be formed andthe respective energy spectrum is hydrogen-like one.
