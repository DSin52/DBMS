The supersymmetry properties of the asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holesof Einstein theory in 2+1 dimensions are investigated. It is shown that (i) thezero mass black hole has two exact super- symmetries; (ii) extreme $lM=|J|$black holes with $M \not= 0$ have only one; and (iii) generic black holes donot have any. It is also argued that the zero mass hole is the ground state of(1,1)-adS supergravity with periodic (``Ramond") boundary conditions on thespinor fields.
