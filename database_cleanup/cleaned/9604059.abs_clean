We discuss N=2 SU(2) Yang-Mills gauge theories coupled with N_f (=2,3)massive hypermultiplets in the weak coupling limit. We determine the exactmassive prepotentials and the monodromy matrices around the weak couplinglimit. We also study that the double scaling limit of these massive theoriesand find that the massive N_f -1 theory can be obtained from the massive N_ftheory. New formulae for the massive prepotentials and the monodromy matricesare proposed. In these formulae, N_f dependences are clarified.
