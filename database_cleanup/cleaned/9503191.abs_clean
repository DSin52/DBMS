The free field realization of irreducible representations of $\os$ isconstructed, by a unified and systematic scheme. The $q$-analog of this unifiedscheme is used to construct $q$-free field realization of irreduciblerepresentations of $\uos$. By using these realization, the two point functionof $N=1$ superconformal (q-superconformal) model based on $\os$ ($\uos$)symmetry have been calculated.
