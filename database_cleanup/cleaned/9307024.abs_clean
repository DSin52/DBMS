Title: The Renormalisation Group Equation As An Equation For Lie Transport Of

AmplitudesComments: 8 pages Typeset in PlainTeX, C Version 3.141

It is shown that the renormalisation group (RG) equation can beviewed as an equation for Lie transport of physical amplitudes along theintegral curves generated by the $\beta$-functions of a quantum field theory.The anomalous dimensions arise from Lie transport of basis vectors on the spaceof couplings. The RG equation can be interpreted as relating a particulardiffeomorphism of flat space-(time), that of dilations, to a diffeomorphism onthe space of couplings generated by the vector field associated with the$\beta$-functions.
