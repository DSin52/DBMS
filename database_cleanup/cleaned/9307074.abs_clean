We derive curvature counterterms in two-dimensional gravity coupled toconformal matter up to infinite order. By construction the higher-order actionis equivalent to a finite first-order theory with auxiliary scalar. Due to thisgravitational dressing of the cosmological constant, quantization is consistentfor any conformal anomaly $c$ of the coupled matter system, and if the coupledmatter system is a $c=d~$-dimensional string theory in a Euclidean backgroundthen the effective string theory is $D=d+2~$-dimensional with Minkowskisignature $(1,D-1)$. The resulting quantum theory favours flat geometries andsuppresses both parabolic and hyperbolic singularities.
