Title: Monopoles, Duality, and String Theory

Authors: Joseph Polchinski

Comments: Presented at the Dirac Centennial Symposium, Tallahassee, Dec. 6-7,

2002Dirac showed that the existence of magnetic monopoles would implyquantization of electric charge. I discuss the converse, and propose two`principles of completeness' which I illustrate with various examples.
