We present a systematic construction of classical extended superconformalalgebras from the hamiltonian reduction of a class of affine Lie superalgebras,which include an even subalgebra $sl(2)$. In particular, we obtain the doublyextended $N=4$ superconformal algebra $\tilde{A}_{\gamma}$ from the hamiltonianreduction of the exceptional Lie superalgebra $D(2|1;\gamma/(1-\gamma))$. Wealso find the Miura transformation for these algebras and give the free fieldrepresentation. A $W$-algebraic generalization is discussed.
