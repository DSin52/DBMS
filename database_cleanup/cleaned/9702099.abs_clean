We interpret instantons on a torus with twisted boundary conditions, in termsof bound states of branes. The interplay between the SU(N) and U(1) partsof the U(N) theory of N 4-branes allows the construction of a variety ofbound states. The SU(N) and U(1) parts can contribute fractional amounts tothe total instanton number which is integral. The geometry of non-selfintersecting two-cycles in $T^4$ sheds some light on a number of properties ofthese solutions.
