A generalization of BRST field theory is presented, based on wave operatorsfor the fields constructed out of, but different from the BRST operator. Wediscuss their quantization, gauge fixing and the derivation of propagators. Weshow, that the generalized theories are relevant to relativistic particletheories in the Brink-Di Vecchia-Howe-Polyakov (BDHP) formulation, and arguethat the same phenomenon holds in string theories. In particular it is shown,that the naive BRST formulation of the BDHP theory leads to trivial quantumfield theories with vanishing correlation functions.
