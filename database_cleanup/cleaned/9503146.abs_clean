Title: PATH INTEGRAL BOSONIZATION OF THREE FLAVOUR QUARK DYNAMICS

Comments: 10 pages

Chiral symmetry breaking due to instanton-produced fermion zero modes in theconfining vacuum is considered. Zero modes provide 'tHooft-type determinantquark interaction, which is bosonized by introduction of auxiliary fields. Forthree flavours this procedure becomes nontrivial and a method is suggestedwhich allows to derive effective Lagrangian for massless Nambu--Goldstonemodes.
