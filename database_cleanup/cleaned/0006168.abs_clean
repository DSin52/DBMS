We review and extend recent work on the application of the non-commutativegeometric framework to an interpretation of the moduli space of vacua ofcertain deformations of N=4 super Yang-Mills theories. We present a simpleworldsheet calculation that reproduces the field theory results and sheds somelight on the dynamics of the D-brane bubbles. Different regions of moduli spaceare associated with D5-branes of various topologies; singularities in themoduli space are associated with topology change. T-duality on toroidaltopologies maps between mirror string realizations of the field theory.
