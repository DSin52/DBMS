We study a class of non-protected local composite operators which occur inthe R symmetry singlet channel of the OPE of two stress-tensor multiplets in{\cal N}=4 SYM. At tree level these are quadrilinear scalar dimension fouroperators, two single-traces and two double-traces. In the presence ofinteraction, due to a non-trivial mixing under renormalization, they split intolinear combinations of conformally covariant operators. We resolve the mixingby computing the one-loop two-point functions of all the operators in an {\calN}=1 setup, then diagonalizing the anomalous dimension matrix and identifyingthe quasiprimary operators. We find one operator whose anomalous dimension isnegative and suppressed by a factor of 1/N^2 with respect to the anomalousdimensions of the Konishi-like operators. We reveal the mechanism responsiblefor this suppression and argue that it works at every order in perturbationtheory. In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence such an operator should bedual to a multiparticle supergravity state whose energy is less than the sum ofthe corresponding individual single-particle states.
