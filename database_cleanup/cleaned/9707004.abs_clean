Dynamics has been generalized to a noncommutative phase space. Thenoncommuting phase space is taken to be invariant under the quantum group$GL_{q,p}(2)$. The $q$-deformed differential calculus on the phase space isformulated and using this, both the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian forms ofdynamics have been constructed. In contrast to earlier forms of $q$-dynamics,our formalism has the advantage of preserving the conventional symmetries suchas rotational or Lorentz invariance.
