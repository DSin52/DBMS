Title: Generalized Ray-Singer conjecture. I. A manifold with a smooth boundary

Comments: 120 pages

This paper is devoted to a proof of a generalized Ray-Singer conjecture for amanifold with boundary (the Dirichlet and the Neumann boundary conditions areindependently given on each connected component of the boundary and thetransmission boundary condition is given on the interior boundary). TheRay-Singer conjecture \cite{RS} claims that for a closed manifold thecombinatorial and the analytic torsion norms on the determinant of thecohomology are equal. For a manifold with boundary the ratio between theanalytic torsion and the combinatorial torsion is computed. Some new generalproperties of the Ray-Singer analytic torsion are found. The proof does~not useany computation of eigenvalues and its asymptotic expansions or explicitexpressions for the analytic torsions of any special classes of manifolds.
