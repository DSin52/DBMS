Canada and the $7^{th}~C^2GR^2A$ in Calgary, AB, Canada, May 31 - June 7,1997In this article we review a recent calculation of the two-loop $\sigma$-modelcorrections to the T-duality map in string theory. Using the effective actionapproach, and focusing on backgrounds with a single Abelian isometry, we givethe $O(\alpha')$ modifications of the lowest-order duality transformations. Thetorsion plays an important role in the theory to $O(\alpha')$, because of theChern-Simons couplings to the gauge fields that arise via dimensionalreduction.
