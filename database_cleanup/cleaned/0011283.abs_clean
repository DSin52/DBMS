We construct Spin(p+1,p+1) covariant Dp-brane bound states by using that thepotentials in the RR sector of toroidically compactified type II supergravitytransform as a chiral spinor of the T-duality group. As an application, we showthe invariance of the zero-force condition for a probe D-brane undernoncommutative deformations of the background, which gives a holographic proofof the stability of the corresponding field theory ground state undernoncommutative deformations. We also identify the Spin(p+1,p+1) transformationlaws by examining the covariance of the D-brane Lagrangians.
