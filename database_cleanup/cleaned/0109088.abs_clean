In this paper, the analog of Maxwell electromagnetism for hydrodynamicturbulence, the metafluid dynamics, is extended in order to reformulate themetafluid dynamics as a gauge field theory. That analogy opens up thepossibility to investigate this theory as a constrained system. Having thispossibility in mind, we propose a Lagrangian to describe this new theory ofturbulence and, subsequently, analyze it from the symplectic point of view.From this analysis, a hidden gauge symmetry is revealed, providing a clearinterpretation and meaning of the physics behind the metafluid theory. Further,the geometrical interpretation to the gauge symmetries is discussed and thespectrum for 3D turbulence computed.
