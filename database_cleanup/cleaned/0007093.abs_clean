The phase transition of the Gross-Neveu model with N fermions is investigatedby means of a non-perturbative evolution equation for the scale dependence ofthe effective average action. The critical exponents and scaling amplitudes arecalculated for various values of N in d=3. It is also explicitely verified thatthe Neveu-Yukawa model belongs to the same universality class as theGross-Neveu model.
