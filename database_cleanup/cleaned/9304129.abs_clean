A strong-weak coupling duality symmetry of the string equations of motion hasbeen suggested in the literature. This symmetry implies that vacua occur inpairs. Since the coupling constant is a dynamical variable in string theory,tunneling solutions between strong and weak coupling vacua may exist. Suchsolutions would naturally lead to nonperturbative effects with anomalouscoupling dependence. A highly simplified example is given.
