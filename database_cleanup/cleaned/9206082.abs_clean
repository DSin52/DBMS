Canonical forms are given for the nilpotent BRS operator $\d$ and thecovariant `loop space' derivative ${\cal D}_{\m}$ for the p-brane fields forall odd p. The defining characteristic of ${\cal D}_{\m}$ is that it is afunctional derivative operator which generalizes the ordinary functionalderivative and also commutes with $\d$. Methods of construction for thecanonical forms are discussed.
