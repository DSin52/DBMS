For a large class of gauge theories a nilpotent BRS-operator $s$ isconstructed and its cohomology in the space of local functionals of theoff-shell fields is shown to be isomorphic to the cohomology of $\4s=s+d$ onfunctions $f(\4C,\PH)$ of tensor fields $\PH$ and of variables $\4C$ which areconstructed of the ghosts and the connection forms. The result allows generalstatements about the structure of invariant classical actions and anomalycandidates whose BRS-variation vanishes off-shell. The assumptions under whichthe result holds are thoroughly discussed.
