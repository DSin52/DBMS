Authors: R. Shaisultanov

Comments: 14 pages,Revtex,no figures

Using the Schwinger-Keldysh (closed time path or CTP) and Feynman-Vernoninfluence functional formalisms we obtain an expression for the influencefunctional in terms of Bogoliubov coefficients for the case of spinor quantumelectrodynamics. Then we derive a CTP effective action in semiclassicalapproximation and its cumulant expansion. Using it we obtain a equation for thedescription of the charged particle creation in electric field and ofbackreaction of charged quantum fields and their fluctuations on time evolutionof this electric field. Also an intimate connection between CTP effectiveaction and decoherence functional will allow us to analyze how macroscopicelectromagnetic fields are ``measured'' through interaction with charges andthereby rendered classical.
