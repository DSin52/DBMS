Within the Euclidean path integral and mass perturbation theory we derive,from the Dyson-Schwinger equations of the massive Schwinger model, a generalformula that incorporates, for sufficiently small fermion mass, all thebound-state mass poles of the massive Schwinger model. As an illustration weperturbatively compute the masses of the three lowest bound states.
