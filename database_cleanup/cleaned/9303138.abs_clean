CouplingAuthors: Yu. Makeenko

I show that the strong coupling solution of the Kazakov--Migdal model with ageneral interaction potential $V(\Phi)$ in $D$ dimensions coincides at large$N$ with that of the hermitean one-matrix model with the potential$$ whose solution is known. The proof is given for an even potential$V(\Phi)=V(-\Phi)$ by solving loop equations.
