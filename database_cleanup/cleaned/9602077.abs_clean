The Born--Infeld-like effective world-volume theory of a single 3-brane isdeduced from a manifestly space-time supersymmetric description of thecorresponding $D$-brane.This is shown to be invariant under $SL(2,R)$ transformations that act on theabelian gauge field as well as the bulk fields. The effective theory of twonearby parallel three-branes involves massive world-volume supermultipletswhich transform under $SL(2,Z)$ into the dyonic solitons of four-dimensional$N=4$ spontaneously broken $SU(2)$ Yang--Mills theory.
