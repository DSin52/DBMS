Recently proposed mechanism of the black hole condensation at conifoldsingularity in type II string is an interesting idea from which we caninterpret the phase of the universal moduli space of the string vacua. It mightalso be expected that the true physics is on the conifold singularity aftersupersymmetry breaking. We derive a mass formula for the extreme black holescaused by the self-dual 5-form field strength, which is stable andsupersymmetric. It is shown that the formula can be written by the moduliparameters of Calabi-Yau manifold and can be calculated explicitly.
