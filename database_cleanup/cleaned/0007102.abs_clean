We consider the gauging of space translations with time-dependent gaugefunctions. Using fixed time gauge of relativistic theory, we consider thegauge-invariant model describing the motion of nonrelativistic particles. Whenwe use gauge-invariant nonrelativistic velocities as independent variables thetranslation gauge fields enter the equations through a d\times (d+1) matrix ofvielbein fields and their Abelian field strengths, which can be identified withthe torsion tensors of teleparallel formulation of relativity theory. Weconsider the planar case (d=2) in some detail, with the assumption that theaction for the dreibein fields is given by the translational Chern-Simons term.We fix the asymptotic transformations in such a way that the space part of themetric becomes asymptotically Euclidean. The residual symmetries are (local intime) translations and rigid rotations. We describe the effective interactionof the d=2 N-particle problem and discuss its classical solution for N=2. Thephase space Hamiltonian H describing two-body interactions satisfies anonlinear equation H={\cal H}(\vec x,\vec p;H) which implies, afterquantization, a nonstandard form of the Schr\"odinger equation with energydependent fractional angular momentum eigenvalues. Quantum solutions of thetwo-body problem are discussed. The bound states with discrete energy levelscorrespond to a confined classical motion (for the planar distance between twoparticles r\le r_0) and the scattering states with continuum energy correspondto the classical motion for r>r_0. We extend our considerations by introducingan external constant magnetic field and, for N=2, provide the classical andquantum solutions in the confined and unconfined regimes.
