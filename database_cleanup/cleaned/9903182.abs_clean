Comments: \documentstyle[12pt,a4,eclepsf]{article}, 2 figures, Note based on

the talk presented in the colloquia in mathematics at RIMS, February 24(Wed), 1999This note reviews the progress on the low energy dynamics of N=2supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories after the works of Seiberg and Witten.Specifically, the theory of prepotential for non-specialists is reviewed.
