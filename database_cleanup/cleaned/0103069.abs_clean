We propose a physical interpretation of the perturbative breakdown ofunitarity in time-like noncommutative field theories in terms of production oftachyonic particles. These particles may be viewed as a remnant of a continuousspectrum of undecoupled closed-string modes. In this way, we give a unifiedview of the string-theoretical and the field-theoretical no-go argumentsagainst time-like noncommutative theories. We also perform a quantitative studyof various locality and causality properties of noncommutative field theoriesat the quantum level.
