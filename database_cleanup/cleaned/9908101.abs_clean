In this paper we sum over the spherical modes appearing in the expression forthe Casimir energy of a conducting sphere and of a dielectric ball (assumingthe same speed of light inside and outside), before doing the frequencyintegration. We derive closed integral expressions that allow the calculationsto be done to all orders, without the use of regularization procedures. Thetechnique of mode summation using a contour integral is critically examined.
