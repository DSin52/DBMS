Title: Linear equations of motion for massless particles of any spin in any

even dimensional spacesAuthors: Bojan Gornik, N. Mankoc Borstnik

Comments: 17 pages, two tables

It is proven that the Poincare symmetry determines equations of motion, whichare for massless particles of any spin in d-dimensional spaces linear in themomentum. The proof is made only for even d and for fields with no gaugesymmetry. We comment on a few examples. We pay attention only to spin degreesof freedom.
