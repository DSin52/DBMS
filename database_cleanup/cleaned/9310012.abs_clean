We introduce the Virasoro symmetry in the BV formalism and give an explicitconstruction of the anti-bracket, which is Virasoro invariant. It is shown thatthe master equation with this anti-bracket has an infinite number of solutions.The base space of the BV formalism is a fermionic version of the Virasoromanifold $Diff(S^1)/S^1$. We discuss also the Ricci tensor of this fermionicmanifold.
