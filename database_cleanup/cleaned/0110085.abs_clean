We investigate the transition between singular and non-singular geometriesfrom the vantage point of perturbative field dynamics. In particular, we obtainthe closed-form absorption probability for minimally-coupled massless scalarspropagating in the background of a heterotic 5-brane on a Taub-NUT instanton.This is an exact calculation for arbitrary incident frequencies. For thesingular geometry, the absorption probability vanishes when the frequency isbelow a certain threshold, and for the non-singular case it vanishes for allfrequencies. We discuss the connection between this phenomenon and the behaviorof geodesics in this background. We also obtain exact quasinormal modes.
