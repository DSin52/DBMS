The world volume theory on $N$ regular and $M$ fractional D3-branes at theconifold singularity is a non-conformal ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric$SU(N+M)\times SU(N)$ gauge theory. In previous work the extremal Type IIBsupergravity dual of this theory at zero temperature was constructed.reflection of the chiral symmetry breaking. To study the non-zero temperaturegeneralizations non-extremal solutions have to be considered, and in the hightemperature phase the chiral symmetry is expected to be restored. Such asolution is expected to have a regular Schwarzschild horizon. We construct anansatz necessary to study such non-extremal solutions and show that thesimplest possible solution has a singular horizon. We derive the system ofsecond order equations in the radial variable whose solutions may have regularhorizons.
