The Wigner phase-space distribution function provides the basis for Moyal'sdeformation quantization alternative to the more conventional Hilbert space andpath integral quantizations. General features of time-independent Wignerfunctions are explored here, including the functional ("star") eigenvalueequations they satisfy; their projective orthogonality spectral properties;their Darboux ("supersymmetric") isospectral potential recursions; and theircanonical transformations. These features are illustrated explicitly throughPoeschl-Teller potential, and the Liouville potential.
