Charged dilaton black hole solutions have recently been found for an actionwith two $U(1)$ gauge fields and a dilaton field. I investigate new exactsolutions of this theory analogous to the C-metric and Ernst solutions ofclassical general relativity. The parameters in the latter solution may berestricted so that it has a smooth Euclidean section with topology $S^2 \timesS^2 - \{pt\}$, which gives an instanton describing pair production of thecharged dilaton black holes. These instantons generalise those found recentlyby Dowker {\it et al}.
