Title: Old Puzzles

In this talk I first briefly review how far we have come in answering oldquestions about the most fundamental building blocks of matter. I begin withthings we know, which is the Standard Model, and then talk about things we canguess, which is superstring theory. After this review I discuss a key point atsupersymmetry breaking and the cosmological constant. I explain in whichdirection I imagine a way out. This way out predicts gravitinos and dilatonswith masses of order milli-eV.
