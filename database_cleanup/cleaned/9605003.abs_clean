We give a derivation of the Dirac operator on the noncommutative $2$-spherewithin the framework of the bosonic fuzzy sphere and define Connes' triple. Itturns out that there are two different types of spectra of the Dirac operatorand correspondingly there are two classes of quantized algebras. As a result weobtain a new restriction on the Planck constant in Berezin's quantization. Themap to the local frame in noncommutative geometry is also discussed.
