We construct supergravity theories in twelve and thirteen dimensions with therespective signatures (10,2) and (11,2) with some technical details. Startingwith N=1 supergravity in 10+2 dimensions coupled to Green-Schwarz superstring,we give N=2 chiral supergravity in 10+2 dimensions with its couplings to super(2+2)-brane. We also build an N=1 supergravity in 11+2 dimensions, coupled tosupermembrane. All of these formulations utilize scalar (super)fields intactunder supersymmetry, replacing the null-vectors introduced in their originalformulations. This method makes all the equations SO(10,2) or SO(11,2) Lorentzcovariant, up to modified Lorentz generators. We inspect the internalconsistency of these formulations, in particular with the usage of the modifiedLorentz generators for the extra coordinates.
