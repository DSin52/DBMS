Title: The Quark-Meson Model and the Phase Diagram of Two-Flavour QCD

Comments: 29 pages, 9 figures

We study the qualitative features of the QCD phase diagram in the context ofthe linear quark-meson model with two flavours, using the exact renormalizationgroup. We identify the universality classes of the second-order phasetransitions and calculate critical exponents. In the absence of explicitchiral-symmetry breaking through the current quark masses, we discuss in detailthe tricritical point and demonstrate that it is linked to the Gaussian fixedpoint. In its vicinity we study the universal crossover between the Gaussianand O(4) fixed points, and the weak first-order phase transitions. In thepresence of explicit chiral-symmetry breaking, we study in detail the criticalendpoint of the line of first-order phase transitions. We demonstrate thedecoupling of pion fluctuations and identify the Ising universality class asthe relevant one for the second-order phase transition.
