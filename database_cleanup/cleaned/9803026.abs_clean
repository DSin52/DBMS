Title: Duality in supersymmetric $N=2,4$ gauge theories

Comments: 85 pages, Latex, minor corrections, references added

In these lectures we present a detailed description of various aspects ofgauge theories with extended N=2 and N=4 supersymmetry that are at the basis ofrecently found exact results. These results include the exact calculation ofthe low energy effective action for the light degrees of freedom in the N=2super Yang-Mills theory and the conjecture, supported by some checks, that theN=4 super Yang-Mills theory is dual in the sense of Montonen-Olive.
