Title: Holography and trace anomaly

The holographic principle relates (classical) gravitational waves in the bulkto quantum fluctuations and the Weyl anomaly of a conformal field theory on theboundary (the brane). One can thus argue that linear perturbations in the bulkof static black holes located on the brane be related to the Hawking flux andthat (brane-world) black holes are therefore unstable. We try to gain someinformation on such instability from established knowledge of the Hawkingradiation on the brane. In this context, the well-known trace anomaly is usedas a measure of both the validity of the holographic picture and of theinstability for several proposed static brane metrics. In light of the aboveanalysis, we finally consider a time-dependent metric as the (approximate)representation of the late stage of evaporating black holes which ischaracterized by decreasing Hawking temperature, in qualitative agreement withwhat is required by energy conservation.
