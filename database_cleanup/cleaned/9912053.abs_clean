The supersymmetric flow equations describing the flow of moduli from infinityto the black hole horizon, and vice versa, are derived in the five-dimensionaltheories where the moduli space of the very special geometry has disjointbranches. The multiple solutions are derived from the `off the horizon'attractor equation. Within each branch, the black hole entropy, as usual,depends only on the near horizon attractor values of moduli, i.e. the entropydepends on the charges and on coefficients of the cubic polynomial. It does notdepend on the values of the moduli fields at infinity. However, the entropy, aswell as the near horizon values of the moduli fields, are shown to depend onthe choice of the branch specified by the choice of the set of moduli atinfinity. We present examples of BPS black hole solutions with the same Q_I andC_{IJK}, whose entropies differ significantly.
