We use a Hodge decomposition and its generalization to non-abelian flatvector bundles to calculate the partition function for abelian and non- abelianBF theories in $n$ dimensions. This enables us to provide a simple proof thatthe partition function is related to the Ray-Singer torsion defined on flatvector bundles for all odd-dimensional manifolds, and is equal to unity foreven dimensions.
