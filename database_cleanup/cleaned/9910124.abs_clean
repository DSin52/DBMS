Flat SpacesAuthors: Jeongwon Ho

Comments: 16 pages, no figures, A misconception for logarithmic divergent terms

in boundary action value on asymptotically flat spacetime was corrected.References addedCounterterm actions are constructed along the ADM formalism. It is shown thatthe counterterm action can be intrinsically written in terms of intrinsicboundary geometry. Using the expression of counterterm action, we obtain ageneral form of the counterterm action available for any $d$-dimensionalspherical boundary. In the description, we also derive {\it arbitrary}dimensional holographic conformal anomaly. It is also shown that countertermactions for AF spaces can be obtained from the AdS description just as takingthe limit of $\ell \to \infty$. An asymptotically flat spacetime withnon-spherical boundary is speculated. In the example, additional countertermsto eliminate (leading) divergent terms due to deviation of boundary from roundsphere are imagined by observing (4-dimensional) holographic anomalyproportional to $\Box R$. Argument of the deceptive-like anomaly is given bycomparing with the holographic description of 5-dimensional Kerr-AdS spacetime.
