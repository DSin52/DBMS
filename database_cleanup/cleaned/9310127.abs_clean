Report PAR-LPTHE 93/50We study a dynamically broken U(1) "left" gauge theory endowed with acomposite scalar doublet (one scalar and one pseudoscalar); its Lagrangian onlydiffers from that of an abelian `Standard Model' by the addition of aderivative coupling between a Wess-Zumino field, linked to the previousscalars, and the fermionic current. Yet, in the Feynman path integral, the nonindependence of the fermionic and scalar variables of integration requires theintroduction of constraints. When the gauge symmetry is broken by the vacuumexpectation value of the scalar field, they freeze all degrees of freedom butthose of a massive gauge field, including a (abelian) pion. The anomalydisappears and the gauge current is conserved. This is shown, andrenormalizability studied, in the `Nambu-Jona-Lasinio approximation'. Unitarityis demonstrated on general grounds.
