Authors: Jin Bai-Qi and Ma Zhong-Qi (Institute of High Energy Physics, Beijing,

P. R. of China)The quantum Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and the explicit form of the$\breve{R}_{q}$ matrix related with the minimal representation of the quantumenveloping algebra $U_{q}E_{7}$ are calculated in this paper.
