Version to appear in Phys. Lett. BWe use path integral methods and topological quantum field theory techniquesto investigate a generic classical Hamiltonian system. In particular, we showthat Floer's instanton equation is related to a functional Euler character inthe quantum cohomology defined by the topological nonlinear $\sigma$--model.This relation is an infinite dimensional analog of the relation betweenPoincar\'e--Hopf and Gauss--Bonnet--Chern formul\ae$~$ in classical Morsetheory, and can also be viewed as a loop space generalization of the Lefschetzfixed point theorem. By applying localization techniques to path integrals wethen show that for a K\"ahler manifold our functional Euler character coincideswith the Euler character determined by the finite dimensional de Rhamcohomology of the phase space. Our results are consistent with the Arnoldconjecture which estimates periodic solutions to classical Hamilton's equationsin terms of de Rham cohomology of the phase space.
