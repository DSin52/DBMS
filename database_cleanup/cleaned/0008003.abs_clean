In the imaginay-time formalism of thermal field theory, and also in thereal-time formalism but by means of some redefined physical propagators forscalar bound states by diagonalization of four-point function matrices, wereexamine the Nambu-Goldstone mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking in aone-generation fermion condensate scheme, based on the Schwinger-Dyson equationin the fermion bubble diagram approximation, and compare the obtained results.We have reached the conclusion that in both the formalisms, the Goldstonetheorem of spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking is rigorously true for thecase of mass-degenerate two flavors of fermions and only approximately valid atlow energy scales for the mass-nondegenerate case, in spite of existence ofsome difference between the two formalisms in the imaginary parts of thedenominators of the propagators for scalar bound states. When the two flavorsof fermions have unequal nonzero masses, the induced possible fluctuationeffect for the Higgs particle is negligible if the momentum cut-off in the zerotemperature loops is large enough. All the results show physical equivalence ofthe two formalisms in the present discussed problems.
