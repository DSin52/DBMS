A vector space G is introduced such that the Galilei transformations areconsidered linear mappings in this manifold. The covariant structure of theGalilei Group (Y. Takahashi, Fortschr. Phys. 36 (1988) 63; 36 (1988) 83) isderived and the tensor analysis is developed. It is shown that the Euclideanspace is embedded the (4,1) de Sitter space through in G. This is aninteresting and useful aspect, in particular, for the analysis carried out forthe Lie algebra of the generators of linear transformations in G.
