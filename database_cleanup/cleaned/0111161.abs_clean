We study an N=1 two-dimensional non-linear sigma model with boundariesrepresenting, e.g., a gauge fixed open string. We describe the full set ofboundary conditions compatible with N=1 superconformal symmetry. The problem isaction, and by studying the conserved supercurrent. We present the target spaceinterpretation of these results, and identify the appearance of partiallyintegrable almost product structures.
