We study codimension one branes, i.e. p-branes in (p+2)-dimensions, in thesuperembedding approach for the cases where the worldvolume superspace isembedded in a minimal target superspace with half supersymmetry breaking. Thissingles out the cases p=1,2,3,5,9. For p=3,5,9 the superembedding geometrynaturally involves a fundamental super 2-form potential on the worldvolumewhose generalised field strength obeys a constraint deducible from consideringan open supermembrane ending on the p-brane. This constraint, together with theembedding constraint, puts the system on-shell for p=5 but overconstrains the9-brane in D=11 such that the Goldstone superfield is frozen. For p=3 these twoconstraints give rise to an off-shell linear multiplet on the worldvolume. Analternative formulation of this case is given in which the linear multiplet isdualised to an off-shell scalar multiplet. Actions are constructed for bothcases and are shown to give equivalent equations of motion. After gauge fixinga local Sp(1) symmetry associated with shifts in the Sp(1)_R Goldstone modes,we find that the auxiliary fields in the scalar multiplet parametrise atwo-sphere. For completeness we also discuss briefly the cases p=1,2 where theequations of motion (for off-shell multiplets) are obtained from an actionprinciple.
