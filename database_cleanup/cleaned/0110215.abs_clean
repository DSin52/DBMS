In noncommutative field theories, it was known that one-loop effective actiondescribes propagation of non-interacting open Wilson lines, obeying the flyingdipole's relation. We show that two-loop effective action describes cubicinteraction among `closed string' states created by open Wilson lines. Takingd-dimensional noncommutative [\Phi^3] theory as the simplest setup, we computenonplanar contribution at low-energy and large noncommutativity limit. We findthat the contribution is expressible in a remarkably simple cubic interactioninvolving scalar open Wilson lines only and nothing else. We show that theinteraction is purely geometrical and noncommutative in nature, depending onlyon sizes of each open Wilson line.
