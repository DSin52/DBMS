Calogero-Moser models and Toda models are well-known integrablemulti-particle dynamical systems based on root systems associated with Liealgebras. The relation between these two types of integrable models isinvestigated at the levels of the Hamiltonians and the Lax pairs. The Lax pairsof Calogero-Moser models are specified by the representations of thereflection groups, which are not the same as those of the corresponding Liealgebras. The latter specify the Lax pairs of Toda models. The Hamiltonians ofthe elliptic Calogero-Moser models tend to those of Toda models as one of theperiods of the elliptic function goes to infinity, provided the dynamicalvariables are properly shifted and the coupling constants are scaled. On theother hand most of Calogero-Moser Lax pairs, for example, the root type Laxpairs, do not a have consistent Toda model limit. The minimal type Lax pairs,which corresponds to the minimal representations of the Lie algebras, tend tothe Lax pairs of the corresponding Toda models.
