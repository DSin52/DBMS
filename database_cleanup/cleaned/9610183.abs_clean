Einstein's $E = mc^{2}$ unifies the momentum-energy relations for massive andmassless particles. According to Wigner, the internal space-time symmetries ofmassive and massless particles are isomorphic to $O(3)$ and $E(2)$respectively. According to Inonu and Wigner, $O(3)$ can be contracted to $E(2)$in the large-radius limit. It is noted that the $O(3)$-like little group formassive particles can be contracted to the $E(2)$-like little group formassless particles in the limit of large momentum and/or small mass. It is thusshown that transverse rotational degrees of freedom for massive particlesbecome contracted to gauge degrees of freedom for massless particles.
