Title: SPACETIME PROPERTIES OF (1,0) STRING VACUA

Comments: 6 pages, LaTeX, one encapsulated figure

We discuss one of the generic spacetime consequences of having (1,0)worldsheet supersymmetry in tachyon-free string theory, namely the appearanceof a ``misaligned supersymmetry'' in the corresponding spacetime spectrum.Misaligned supersymmetry is a universal property of (1,0) string vacua whichdescribes how the arrangement of bosonic and fermionic states at all stringenergy levels conspires to preserve finite string amplitudes, even in theabsence of full spacetime supersymmetry. Misaligned supersymmetry alsoconstrains the degree to which spacetime supersymmetry can be broken withoutbreaking modular invariance, and is responsible for the vanishing of variousmass supertraces evaluated over the infinite string spectrum.[Talk delivered at Strings '95, based on material drawn from hep-th/9402006and hep-th/9409114.
