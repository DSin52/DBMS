Renormalization Group 2002 (High Tatra Mountains, Slovakia, 10-16 March 2002)Large order asymptotic behaviour of renormalization constants in the minimalsubtraction scheme for the $\phi ^4$ $(4-\epsilon)$ theory is discussed.Well-known results of the asymptotic $4-\epsilon $ expansion of criticalindices are shown to be far from the large order asymptotic value. A {\emconvergent} series for the model $\phi ^4$ $(4-\epsilon)$ is then considered.Radius of convergence of the series for Green functions and for renormalisationgroup functions is studied. The results of the convergent expansion of criticalindices in the $4-\epsilon $ scheme are revalued using the knowledge of largeorder asymptotics. Specific features of this procedure are discussed.
