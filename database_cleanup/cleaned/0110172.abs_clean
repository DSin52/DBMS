We study the dynamics of fuzzy two-spheres in a matrix model which representsstring theory in the presence of RR flux. We analyze the stability of knownstatic solutions of such a theory which contain commuting matrices and SU(2)representations. We find that irreducible as well as reducible representationsare stable. Since the latter are of higher energy, this stability poses apuzzle. We resolve this puzzle by noting that reducible representations havemarginal directions corresponding to non-spherical deformations. We obtain newstatic solutions by turning on these marginal deformations. These solutions nowhave instability or tachyonic directions. We discuss condensation of thesetachyons which correspond to classical trajectories interpolating frommultiple, small fuzzy spheres to a single, large sphere. We briefly discussspatially independent configurations of a D3/D5 system described by the samematrix model which now possesses a supergravity dual.
