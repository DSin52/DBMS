We investigate chiral anomaly for fermions in fundamental representation onnoncommutative (fuzzy) 2-sphere. In spite that this system is realized byfinite dimensional matrices and no regularization is necessary for either UV orIR, we can reproduce the correct chiral anomaly which is consistent with thecalculations done in flat noncommutative space. Like the flat case, there areambiguities to define chiral currents. We define chiral currents in agauge-invariant way and a gauge-covariant way, and show that the correspondinganomalous chiral Ward--Takahashi identities take different forms. TheWard--Takahashi identity for the gauge-invariant current contains explicitnonlocality while that for the covariant one is given by a local expression.
