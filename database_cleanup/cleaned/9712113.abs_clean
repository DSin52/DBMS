4x4 Dirac (gamma) matrices (irreducible matrix representations of theClifford algebras C(3,1), C(1,3), C(4,0)) are an essential part of manycalculations in quantum physics. Although the final physical results do notdepend on the applied representation of the Dirac matrices (e.g. due to theinvariance of traces of products of Dirac matrices), the appropriate choice ofthe representation used may facilitate the analysis. The present paperintroduces a particularly symmetric real representation of 4x4 Dirac matrices(Majorana representation) which may prove useful in the future. As a byproduct,a compact formula for (transformed) Pauli matrices is found. The considerationis based on the role played by isoclinic 2-planes in the geometry of the realClifford algebra C(3,0) which provide an invariant geometric frame for it. Itcan be generalized to larger Clifford algebras.
