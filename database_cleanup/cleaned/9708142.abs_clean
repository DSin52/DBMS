the proceedings of the 7th Canadian Conference on General Relativity andRelativistic Astrophysics, June 5-7, 1997The black hole solutions to Einstein's vacuum field equations are alsosolutions to the equations of motion of the low energy limit of superstringtheory. At the same time, string theory boasts a much broader and richercollection of black hole solutions. Fortunately, string theories also possess aremarkable set of duality symmetries relating states within and betweendifferent string theories. These duality symmetries can be exploited toconstruct new black hole solutions from known solutions, giving us powerfultools with which to explore the black hole solutions of string theory. Here weintroduce and demonstrate these techniques of solution generating.
