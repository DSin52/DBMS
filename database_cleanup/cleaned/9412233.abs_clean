A manifestly gauge invariant formulation of chiral theories with fermions onthe lattice is developed. It combines SLAC lattice derivative \cite{DWY},\cite{ACS}, \cite{S} and generalized Pauli-Villars regularization \cite{FS}.The theory is free of fermion doubling, requires only local gauge invariantcounterterms and produces correct results when applied to exactly solvable twodimensional models.
