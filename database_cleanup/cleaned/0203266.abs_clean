Starting from the geometrical construction of special Lagrangian submanifoldsof a toric variety, we identify a certain subclass of A-type D-branes in thelinear sigma model for a Calabi-Yau manifold and its mirror with the A- andB-type Recknagel-Schomerus boundary states of the Gepner model, by reproducingtopological properties such as their labeling, intersection, and therelationships that exist in the homology lattice of the D-branes. In thenon-linear sigma model phase these special Lagrangians reproduce an oldconstruction of 3-cycles relevant for computing periods of the Calabi-Yau, andprovide insight into other results in the literature on special Lagrangiansubmanifolds on compact Calabi-Yau manifolds. The geometrical construction ofrational boundary states suggests several ways in which new Gepner modelboundary states may be constructed.
