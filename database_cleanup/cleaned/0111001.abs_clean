We compute leading order corrections to the entropy of any thermodynamicsystem due to small statistical fluctuations around equilibrium. When appliedto black holes, these corrections are shown to be of the form $-k\ln(Area)$.For BTZ black holes, $k=3/2$, as found earlier. We extend the result to anti-deSitter Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in arbitrarydimensions. Finally we examine the role of conformal field theory in black holeentropy and its corrections.
