D-instanton calculus has proved to be able to probe the AdS near horizongeometry for $N$ D-branes systems which, when decoupled from gravity, yieldfour dimensional superconformal gauge theories with various matter content. Inthis work we extend previous analysis to encompass fractional brane modelswhich give rise to non conformal N=2 Super Yang-Mills theories. Via D-instantoncalculus we study the geometry of such models for finite $N$ and recover the$\beta$ function of the gauge coupling constants which is expected in nonconformal gauge theories. We also give a topological matrix theory formulationfor the D-instanton action of these theories. Finally, we revisit the relatedsystem where the D3-branes wrap a ${\real}^4/{\zet}_p$ orbifold singularity andthe D(-1) branes are associated to instanton solutions of four-dimensionalgauge theories in the blown down ALE space.
