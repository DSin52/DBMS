String modes in a pp-wave background are generically massive, and theworldvolume description of the branes is to be given by `massive' gaugetheories. In this paper, we present a five dimensional super Yang-Mills actionwith the Kahler-Chern-Simons term plus the Myers term as a low energyworldvolume description of the longitudinal five branes in a maximallysupersymmetric pp-wave background. We derive the action from the M-theorymatrix model on the pp-wave. We utilize the previously found 4/32 BPS solutionof rotating five branes with stacks of membranes, but, to obtain the staticconfiguration, we reformulate the matrix model in a rotating coordinate systemwhich provides the inertial frame for the branes. Expanding the matrix modelaround the solution, we first obtain a non-commutative field theory actionnaturally equipped with the full sixteen dynamical supersymmetries. In thecommutative limit, we show only four supersymmetries survive, resulting in anovel five dimensional "N=1/2" theory.
