BRST formulation of cohomological Hamiltonian mechanics is presented. In thepath integral approach, we use the BRST gauge fixing procedure for thepartition function with trivial underlying Lagrangian to fix symplecticdiffeomorphism invariance. Resulting Lagrangian is BRST and anti-BRST exact andthe Liouvillian of classical mechanics is reproduced in the ghost-free sector.The theory can be thought of as a topological phase of Hamiltonian mechanicsand is considered as one-dimensional cohomological field theory with the targetspace a symplectic manifold. Twisted (anti-)BRST symmetry is related to globalN=2 supersymmetry, which is identified with an exterior algebra.Landau-Ginzburg formulation of the associated $d=1$, N=2 model is presented andSlavnov identity is analyzed. We study deformations and perturbations of thetheory. Physical states of the theory and correlation functions of the BRSTinvariant observables are studied. This approach provides a powerful tool toinvestigate the properties of Hamiltonian systems.
