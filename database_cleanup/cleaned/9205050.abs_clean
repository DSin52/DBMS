The calculation of the effective potential for fixed-end and toroidal rigid$p$-branes is performed in the one-loop as well as in the $1/d$ approximations.The analysis of the involved zeta-functions (of inhomogeneous Epstein type)which appear in the process of regularization is done in full detail.Assymptotic formulas (allowing only for exponentially decreasing errors oforder $\leq 10^{-3}$) are found which carry all the dependences on the basicparameters of the theory explicitly. The behaviour of the effective potential(specified to the membrane case $p=2$) is investigated, and the extrema of thiseffective potential are obtained.
