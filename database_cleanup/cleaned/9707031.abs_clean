Title: More on Screening and Confinement in 2D QCD

Authors: J. Sonnenschein

Comments: 12 pages,latex, l-school.sty . Talk presented at ``New

non-perturbative methods and Quantification on the light-cone", Les HouchesWe provide further evidence for the screening behavior of massless SU(N_c)bosonized QCD by (i) computing the potential between external quarks, (ii)bosonizing also the external sources and analyzing the states of the combinedsystem and (iii) using an expansion in N_f- the number of flavors. We writedown novel "non-abelian Schwinger like" solutions of the equations of motion,compute their masses and argue that an exchange of massive modes of this typeis associated with the screening mechanism. Confinement for massive dynamicalfermions is shown using (ii) and (iii). We show the screening behavior of theN=1 super Yang Mills theory, by applying a point splitting method to the scalarcurrent.
