We show that the Higgs branch of a four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, withgauge and matter content summarised by an ADE quiver diagram, is identical tothe generalised Coulomb branch of a four-dimensional superconformal stronglycoupled gauge theory with ADE global symmetry. This equivalence suggests theexistence of a mirror symmetry between the quiver theories and the stronglycoupled theories.
