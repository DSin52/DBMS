Dimensions D \le 8Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Subhash Rajpoot

Comments: 14 pages, no figures. Very minor corrections in eq. (2.14), and in

the last paragraph in Concluding RemarksWe establish N=(1,0) supersymmetric Yang-Mills vector multiplet withgeneralized self-duality in Euclidian eight-dimensions with the original fullSO(8) Lorentz covariance reduced to SO(7). The key ingredient is the usage ofoctonion structure constants made compatible with SO(7) covariance andchirality in 8D. By a simple dimensional reduction together with extraconstraints, we derive N=1 supersymmetric self-dual vector multiplet in 7D withthe full SO(7) Lorentz covariance reduced to G_2. We find that extraconstraints needed on fields and supersymmetry parameter are not obtained froma simple dimensional reduction from 8D. We conjecture that other self-dualsupersymmetric theories in lower dimensions D =6 and 5 with respective reducedglobal Lorentz covariances such as SU(3) \subset SO(6) and SU(2) \subset SO(5)can be obtained in a similar fashion.
