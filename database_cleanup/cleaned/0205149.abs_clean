Orbifold compactifications of 10D heterotic strings do allow different setsof chiral fermions at different fixed points. Even if the effective 4D theoryis anomaly free by including the bulk fermions, there arise abelian andnonabelian fixed point anomalies from these chiral fermions. As the underlyingstring theory is well defined these localized fixed point anomalies of thechiral fermions are to be cancelled by a variant of the Green-Schwarzmechanism.
