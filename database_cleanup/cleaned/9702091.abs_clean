Title: Wilson Loop on a Light-Cone Cylinder

Comments: 7 pages, RevTex

QCD without matter and quantized on a light-cone spatial cylinder isconsidered. For the gauge group SU(N) the theory has N-1 quantum mechanicaldegrees of freedom, which describe the color fux that circulates around the thespatial cylinder. In 1+1 dimensions this problem can be solved analytically. Iuse the solution for SU(2) to compute the Wilson loop phase on the surface ofthe cylinder and find that it is equal to g^2 area/4. This result is differentfrom the well known result for flat space. I argue that for SU(N) the Wilsonloop phase for a contour on a light-cone spatial cylinder is g^2(area) (N-1)/4.The underlying reason for this result is that only the N-1 dimensional Cartansubgroup of SU(N) is dynamical in this problem.
