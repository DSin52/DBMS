The six-dimensional (2,0) field theory admits a generalized``noncommutative'' deformation associated with turning on a large null 3-formfield strength. This theory is studied using its discrete light-coneformulation as quantum mechanics on a blow-up of the ADHM moduli space. We showhow to interpret the ADHM manifold as configurations of open membranes, andcheck our results against basic space-time considerations.
