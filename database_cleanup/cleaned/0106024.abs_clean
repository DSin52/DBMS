We show that an infinite subset of the higher-derivative alpha' correctionsto the DBI and Chern-Simons actions of ordinary commutative open-string theorycan be determined using noncommutativity. Our predictions are compared to somelowest order alpha' corrections that have been computed explicitly by Wyllard(hep-th/0008125), and shown to agree.
