We study the gauge transformation of the recently computed one-loopfour-point function of {\cal N}=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gaugegroup U(N). The contributions from nonplanar diagrams are not gauge invariant.We compute their gauge variation and show that it is cancelled by the variationfrom corresponding terms of the one-loop five-point function. This mechanism iseffective action.
