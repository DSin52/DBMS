Boulatov and Ooguri have generalized the matrix models of 2d quantum gravityto 3d and 4d, in the form of field theories over group manifolds. We show thatthe Barrett-Crane quantum gravity model arises naturally from a theory of thistype, but restricted to the homogeneous space S^3=SO(4)/SO(3), as a term in itsFeynman expansion. From such a perspective, 4d quantum spacetime emerges as aFeynman graph, in the manner of the 2d matrix models. This formalism provides aprecise meaning to the ``sum over triangulations'', which is presumablynecessary for a physical interpretation of a spin foam model as a theory ofgravity. In addition, this formalism leads us to introduce a naturalalternative model, which might have relevance for quantum gravity.
