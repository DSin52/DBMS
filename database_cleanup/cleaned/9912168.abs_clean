We consider the harmonic superspaces associated to SU(2,2/N) superconformalalgebras. For arbitrary N, we show that massless representations, other thanthe chiral ones, correspond to [N/2] ``elementary'' ultrashort analyticsuperfields whose first component is a scalar in the k antisymmetric irrep ofSU(N) (k=1... [N/2]) with top spin $J_{\rm\scriptsize top}= (N/2-k/2,0)$. ForN=2n we analyze UIR's obtained by tensoring the self-conjugate ultrashortmultiplet $J_{\rm\scriptsize top}$= (n/2,0) and show that N-1 different basicproducts give rise to all possible UIR's with residual shortening.
