We study exact renormalization group (RG) in O(4) gauged supergravity usingthe effective average action formalism. The nonperturbative RG equations forcosmological and newtonian coupling constants are found. It is shown theexistence of (nonstable) fixed point of these equations. The solution of RGequation for newtonian coupling constant is qualitatively the same as inEinstein gravity(i.e. it is growing at large distances).
