The exact renormalization group equation for pure quantum gravity is used toderive the non-perturbative $\Fbeta$-functions for the dimensionless Newtonconstant and cosmological constant on the theory space spanned by theEinstein-Hilbert truncation. The resulting coupled differential equations areevaluated for a sharp cutoff function. The features of these flow equations arecompared to those found when using a smooth cutoff. The system of equationswith sharp cutoff is then solved numerically, deriving the completerenormalization group flow of the Einstein-Hilbert truncation in $d=4$. Theresulting renormalization group trajectories are classified and their physicalrelevance is discussed. The non-trivial fixed point which, if present in theexact theory, might render Quantum Einstein Gravity nonperturbativelyrenormalizable is investigated for various spacetime dimensionalities.
