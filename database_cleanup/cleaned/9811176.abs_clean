Authors: R S Ward

Comments: 9 pages, plainTeX, to appear in Nonlinearity

The Skyrme-Faddeev system, a modified O(3) sigma model in three spacedimensions, admits topological solitons with nonzero Hopf number. One may learnsomething about these solitons by considering the system on the 3-sphere ofradius R. In particular, the Hopf map is a solution which is unstable for R >\sqrt{2}.
