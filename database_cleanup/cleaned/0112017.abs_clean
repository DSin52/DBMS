The covariant light-front equations have been solved exactly for a twofermion system with different boson exchange ladder kernels. We present amethod to study the cutoff dependence of these equations and to determinewhether they need to be regularized or not. Results are presented for scalarand pseudo-scalar exchange. This latter furthermore exhibits some strangeparticularities which will be discussed.
