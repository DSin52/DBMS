The quantum corrections to the entropy of charged black holes are calculated.The Reissner-Nordstrem and dilaton black holes are considered. The appearanceof logarithmically divergent terms not proportional to the horizon area isdemonstrated. It is shown that the complete entropy which is sum of classicalBekenstein-Hawking entropy and the quantum correction is proportional to thearea of quantum-corrected horizon.
