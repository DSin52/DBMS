We develop techniques for calculating the ground state wave functional andthe geometric entropy for some simple field theories. Special attention isdevoted to fermions, which present special technical difficulties in thisregard. Explicit calculations are carried through for free mass bosons andfermions in two dimensions, using an adaptation of Unruh's technique to treatblack hole radiance.
