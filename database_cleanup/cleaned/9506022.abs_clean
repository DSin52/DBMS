We derive a minimal set of Feynman rules for the loop amplitudes in unitarymodels of closed strings, whose target space is a simply laced (extended)Dynkin diagram. The string field Feynman graphs are composed of propagators,vertices (including tadpoles) of all topologies, and leg factors for themacroscopic loops. A vertex of given topology factorizes into a fusioncoefficient for the matter fields and an intersection number associated withthe corresponding punctured surface. As illustration we obtain explicitexpressions for the genus-one tadpole and the genus-zero four-loop amplitude.
