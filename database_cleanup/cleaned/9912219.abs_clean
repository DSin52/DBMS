theoriesAuthors: Dirk Schlingemann

The construction of the known interacting quantum field theory models ismostly based on euclidean techniques. The expectation values of interestingquantities are usually given in terms of euclidean correlation functions fromwhich one should be able to extract information about the behavior of thecorrelation functions of the Minkowskian counterpart.We think that the C*-algebraic approach to euclidean field theory gives anappropriate setup in order to study structural aspects model independently. Aprevious paper deals with a construction scheme which relates to each euclideanfield theory a Poincar\'e covariant quantum field theory model in the sense ofR. Haag and D. Kastler.Within the framework of R. Haag and D. Kastler, the physical concept of PCTsymmetry and spin and statistics is related to the Tomita-Takesaki theory ofvon Neumann algebras and this important aspects has been studied by severalauthors.We express the PCT symmetry in terms of euclidean reflexions and weexplicitly identify the corresponding modular operator and the modularconjugation of the related Tomita-Takesaki theory. Locality, wedge duality, anda geometric action of the modular group of the von Neumann algebra ofobservables, localized within a wedge region in Minkowski space, are directconsequences.
