We investigate the effects of the external gravitational and constantmagnetic fields to the dynamical symmetrybreaking. As simple models of thedynamical symmetry breaking we consider the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model andthe supersymmetric Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (SUSY NJL) model non-minimallyinteracting with the external gravitational field and minimally interactingwith constant magnetic field. The explicit expressions for the scalar andspinor Green functions are found up to the linear terms on the spacetimecurvature and exactly for a constant magnetic field. We obtain the effectivepotential of the above models from the Green functions in the magnetic field incurved spacetime. Calculating the effective potential numerically with thevarying curvature and/or magnetic fields we show the effects of the externalgravitational and magnetic fields to the phase structure of the theories. Inparticular, increase of the curvature in the spontaneously broken chiralsymmetry phase due to the fixed magnetic field makes this phase to be lessbroken. On the same time strong magnetic field quickly induces chiral symmetrybreaking even at the presence of fixed gravitational field within nonbrokenphase.
