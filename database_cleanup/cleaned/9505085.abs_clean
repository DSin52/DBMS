Title: Yangians, Integrable Quantum Systems and Dorey's rule

Authors: Vyjayanthi Chari and Andrew Pressley

Comments: We have made corrections to the results for the Yangians associated

to the non--simply laced algebrasJournal-ref: Commun.Math.Phys. 181 (1996) 265

We study tensor products of fundamental representations of Yangians and showthat the fundamental quotients of such tensor products are given by Dorey'srule.
