A Brane evolving in the background of a charged AdS black-hole displays ingeneral a bouncing behaviour with a smooth transition from a contracting to anexpanding phase. We examine in detail the conditions and consequences of thisbehaviour in various cases. For a cosmological-constant-dominated Brane, weobtain a singularity-free, inflationary era which is shown to be compatibleonly with an intermediate-scale fundamental Planck mass. For aradiation-dominated Brane, the bouncing behaviour can occur only forbackground-charge values exceeding those allowed for non-extremal black holes.For a matter-dominated Brane, the black-hole mass affects the proper volume orthe expansion rate of the Brane. We also consider the Brane evolving in anasymmetric background of two distinct charged AdS black hole spacetimes beingbounded by the Brane and find that, in the case of an empty critical Brane,bouncing behaviour occurs only if the black-hole mass difference is smallerthan a certain value. The effects of a Brane curvature term on the bounce atearly and late times are also investigated.
