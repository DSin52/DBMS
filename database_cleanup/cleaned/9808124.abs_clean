We describe the structure of the moduli space of $\sigma$-model couplings forthe worldsheet description of a system of $N$ D-particles, in the case that thecouplings are represented by a pair of logarithmic recoil operators. We deriveexpressions for the canonical momenta conjugate to the D-particle couplings andthe Zamolodchikov metric to the first few orders in $\sigma$-model perturbationtheory. We show, using only very general properties of the operator productexpansion in logarithmic conformal field theories, that the canonical dynamicson moduli space agree with the predictions of the non-abelian generalization ofthe Born-Infeld effective action for D-particles with a symmetrized tracestructure. We demonstrate that the Zamolodchikov metric naturally encodes theshort-distance structure of spacetime, and from this we derive uncertaintyrelations for the D-particle coordinates directly from the quantum stringtheory. We show that the moduli space geometry naturally leads to new forms ofspacetime indeterminancies involving only spatial coordinates of target spaceand illustrate the manner in which the open string interactions betweenD-particles lead to a spacetime quantization. We also derive appropriatenon-abelian generalizations of the string-modified Heisenberg uncertaintyrelations and the space--time uncertainty principle. The non-abelianuncertainties exhibit decoherence effects suggesting the interplay of quantumgravity in multiple D-particle dynamics.
