A consistent local approach to the study of interacting relativistic fermionsystems with a condensation of bare particles in its ground or vacuum state,which may has a finite matter density, is developed. The attention is payed tosome of the not so well explored quantum aspects that survive the thermodynamiclimit. A 4-vector local field, called the primary statistical gauge field, anda statistical blocking parameter are introduced for a consistent treatment ofthe problem. The effects of random fluctuations of the fields on localobservables are discussed. It is found that quasiparticle contributions are notsufficient to saturate local observables. The property of the primarystatistical gauge field are discussed in some detail. Two models for the stronginteraction are then introduced and studied using the general frameworkdeveloped. Four possible phases for these models are found. The possibility ofspontaneous CP violation and local fermion creation in two of the four phasesis revealed. The implications of the finding on our understanding of some ofthe strong interaction processes are discussed.
