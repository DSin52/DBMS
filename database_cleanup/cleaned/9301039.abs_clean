We prove that the dimensions of coinvariants of certain nilpotent subalgebrasof the Virasoro algebra do not change under deformation in the case ofirreducible representations of (2,2r+1) minimal models. We derive acombinatorial description of these representations and the Gordon identitiesfrom this result.
