The paper is devoted to the formulation of quantum field theory for an earlyuniverse in General Relativity considered as the Dirac general constrainedsystem. The main idea is the Hamiltonian reduction of the constrained system intime, cosmic scale factor, and the density of matter. We define " particles" asfield variables in the holomorphic representation which diagonalize themeasurable density. The Bogoliubov quasiparticles are determined bydiagonalization of the equations of motion (but not only of the initialHamiltonian) to get the set of integrals of motion (or conserved quantumnumbers, in quantum theory). This approach is applied to describe particlecreation in the models of the early universe where the Hubble parameter goes toinfinity.
