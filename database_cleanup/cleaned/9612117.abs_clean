We show that non-perturbative fixed points of the exact renormalizationgroup, their perturbations and corresponding massive field theories can all bedetermined directly in the continuum -- without using bare actions or anytuning procedure. As an example, we estimate the universal couplings of thenon-perturbative three-dimensional one-component massive scalar field theory inthe Ising model universality class, by using a derivative expansion (and noother approximation). These are compared to the recent results from othermethods. At order derivative-squared approximation, the four-point coupling atzero momentum is better determined by other methods, but factoring this outappropriately, all our other results are in very close agreement with the mostpowerful of these methods. In addition we provide for the first time, estimatesof the n-point couplings at zero momentum, with n=12,14, and the ordermomentum-squared parts with n=2 ... 10.
