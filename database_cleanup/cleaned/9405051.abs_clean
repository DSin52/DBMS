Within the framework of second order derivative (one dimensional) SUSYQM wediscuss particular realizations which incorporate large energy shifts betweenthe lowest states of the spectrum of the superhamiltonian (of Schr\"odingertype). The technique used in this construction is based on the "gluing"procedure. We study the limit of infinite energy shift for the charges of theHigher Derivative SUSY Algebra, and compare the results with those of thestandard SUSY Algebra. We conjecture that our results can suggest aconstruction of a toy model where large energy splittings between fermionic andbosonic partners do not affect the SUSY at low energies.
