We show how the double cohomology of the String and Felder BRST chargesnaturally leads to the ring structure of $c<1$ strings. The chiral ring is aring of polynomials in two variables modulo an equivalence relation of the form$x^p \simeq y^{p+1}$ for the (p+1,p) model. We also study the statescorresponding to the edges of the conformal grid whose inclusion is crucial forthe closure of the ring. We introduce candidate operators that correspond tothe observables of the matrix models. Their existence is motivated by therelation of one of the screening operators of the minimal model to the zeromomentum dilaton.
