We use the quantum symmetries present in string compactification onLandau-Ginzburg orbifolds to prove the existence of a large class of exactlymarginal (0,2) deformations of (2,2) superconformal theories. Analogous methodsapply to the more general (0,2) models introduced in \DK, lending furthercredence to the fact that the corresponding \LG\ models represent bona-fide(0,2) SCFTs. We also use the large symmetry groups which arise when theworldsheet superpotential is turned off to constrain the dependence of certaincorrelation functions on the untwisted moduli. This allows us to approach theproblem of what happens when one tries to deform away from the \LG\ point. Inparticular, we find that the masses and three-point couplings of the massless$E_{6}$ singlets related to ${\rm H^{1}}(\ET)$ vanish at all points in thequintic \Ka\ moduli space. Putting these results together, and invoking someplausible dynamical assumptions about the corresponding linear \sm s, we showthat one can deform these \LG\ theories to arbitrary values of the \Ka\ moduli.
