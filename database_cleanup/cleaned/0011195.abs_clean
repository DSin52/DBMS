We study the brane world motion in non-static bulk by generalizing the secondRandall-Sundrum scenario Explicitly, we take the bulk to be a Vaidya-AdSmetric, which describes the gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetricnull dust fluid in Anti-de Sitter spacetime. We point out that during aninflationary phase on the brane, black holes will tend to be thermallynucleated in the bulk We analyze the thermodynamical properties of thisbrane-world.We point out that during an inflationary phase on the brane, blackholes will tend to be thermally nucleated in the bulk. Thermal equilibrium ofthe system is discussed. We calculate the late time behavior of this system,including 1-loop effects. We argue that at late times a sufficiently largeblack hole will relax to a point of thermal equilibrium with the brane-worldenvironment. This result has interesting implications for early-universecosmology.
