In this work the quantum theory of two dimensional dilaton black holes isstudied using the Wheeler De Witt equation. The solutions correspond to wavefunctions of the black hole. It is found that for an observer inside thehorizon, there are uncertainty relations for the black hole mass and aparameter in the metric determining the Hawking flux. Only for a particularvalue of this parameter, can both be known with arbitrary accuracy. In thegeneric case there is instead a relation which is very similar to the so calledstring uncertainty relation.
