Title: Duality Transformations in the Ten-Dimensional Action and New

Superstring TheoriesComments: Talk presented at the Cern workshop on ``STU-Dualities and

Non-perturbative phenomena in Superstrings and Supergravity'' December 1995.Tex fileJournal-ref: Fortsch.Phys. 44 (1996) 507-514

Type II superstring theory with mixed Dirichlet and Neumann boundaryconditions admit antisymmetric tensors with varying degrees in the spectrum. Weshow that there exists a family of dual supergravity lagrangians to the $N=2$type IIA action in ten dimensions. The duality transformations and theresulting actions are constructed explicitely.
