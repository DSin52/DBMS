Black hole formation/evaporation in two-dimensional dilaton gravity can bedescribed, in the limit where the number $N$ of matter fields becomes large, bya set of second-order partial differential equations. In this paper we solvethese equations numerically. It is shown that, contrary to some previoussuggestions, black holes evaporate completely a finite time after formation. Aboundary condition is required to evolve the system beyond the nakedsingularity at the evaporation endpoint. It is argued that this may benaturally chosen so as to restore the system to the vacuum. The analysis alsoapplies to the low-energy scattering of $S$-wave fermions by four-dimensionalextremal, magnetic, dilatonic black holes.
