We study the spectrum of the spinless-Salpeter Hamiltonian H = \beta\sqrt{m^2 + p^2} + V(r), where V(r) is an attractive central potential in threedimensions. If V(r) is a convex transformation of the Coulomb potential -1/rand a concave transformation of the harmonic-oscillator potential r^2, thenupper and lower bounds on the discrete eigenvalues of H can be constructed,which may all be expressed in the form E = min_{r>0} [ \beta \sqrt{m^2 +P^2/r^2} + V(r) ] for suitable values of P here provided. At the critical pointthe relative growth to the Coulomb potential h(r)=-1/r must be bounded by dV/dh< 2\beta/\pi.
