Rapidly moving sources create pairs in the vacuum and lose energy. Inconsequence of this, the velocity of a charged body cannot approach the speedof light closer than a certain limit which depends only on the couplingconstant. The vacuum back-reaction secures the observance of the conservationlaws. A source can lose up to 50% of energy and charge because of the vacuuminstability.
