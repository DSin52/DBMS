We study the D-brane spectrum on a two-parameter Calabi-Yau model. Thewrapped brane configurations on elliptic fibrations near the large radiuslimit, and SCFT boundary states at the Gepner point. We develop an explicitcorrespondence between these two classes of objects, suggesting that boundarystates are natural quantum generalizations of bundles. We also find interestingD-brane dynamics in deep stringy regimes. The most striking example is,perhaps, that nonsupersymmetric D6-D0 and D4-D2 large radius configurationsbecome stable BPS states at the Gepner point.
