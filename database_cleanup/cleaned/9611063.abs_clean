We construct and analyze dual N=4 supersymmetric gauge theories in threedimensions with unitary and symplectic gauge groups. The gauge groups and thefield content of the theories are encoded in quiver diagrams. The dualityexchanges the Coulomb and Higgs branches and the Fayet-Iliopoulos and massparameters. We analyze the classical and the quantum moduli spaces of thetheories and construct an explicit mirror map between the mass parameters andthe the Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters of the dual. The results generalize therelation between ALE spaces and moduli spaces of SU(n) and SO(2n) instantons.We interpret some of these results from the string theory viewpoint, for SU(n)by analyzing T-duality and extremal transitions in type II stringcompactifications, for SO(2n) by using D-branes as probes. Finally, we make aproposal for the moduli space of vacua of these theories in the absence ofmatter.
