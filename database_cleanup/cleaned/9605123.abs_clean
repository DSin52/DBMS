Presented is an integral formula for solutions to the quantumKnizhnik--Zamolodchikov equation of level $0$ associated with the vectorrepresentation of $U_q (\widehat{ sl_n})$. This formula gives a generalizationof both our previous work for $U_q (\widehat{ sl_2})$ and Smirnov's formula forform factors of $SU(n)$ chiral Gross-Neveu model.
