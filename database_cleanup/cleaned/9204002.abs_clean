The two-dimensional theory of gravity describing a graviton-dilaton system isconsidered. The graviton-dilaton coupling can be fixed such that the quantumtheory remains free of the conformal anomaly for any conformal dimension of thecoupled matter system, even if the dilaton does not appear as Lagrangemultiplier. Interaction terms are introduced and the system is analyzed andsolutions are given at the classical level and at the quantum level by usingcanonical quantization.
