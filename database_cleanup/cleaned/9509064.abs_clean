We discuss lowering the order of the two-dimensional scalar-tensor $R^2$quantum gravity, by mapping the most general version of the model to amulti-dilaton gravity, which is essentially the sigma-model coupled withJackiw-Teitelboim-like gravity. In the continuation of our previous research,we calculate the divergent part of the one-loop effective action in a 2Dscalar-tensor (dilatonic) gravity with Ra2-term, which belongs to a specificdegenerate case and cannot be obtained from the general expression. Thecorresponding finiteness conditions are found.
