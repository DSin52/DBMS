We derive a universal thermal effective potential, which describes allpossible high-temperature instabilities of the known N=4 superstrings, usingthe properties of gauged N=4 supergravity. These instabilities are due to threenon-perturbative thermal dyonic modes, which become tachyonic in a region ofthe thermal moduli space. The latter is described by three moduli, s,t,u, whichare common to all non-perturbative dual-equivalent strings with N=4K3xS^1, the type IIB on K3xS^1 and the type I on T^4x S^1. The non-perturbativeinstabilities are analysed. These strings undergo a high-temperature transitionto a new phase in which five-branes condense. This phase is described indetail, using both the effective supergravity and non-critical string theory insix dimensions. In the new phase, supersymmetry is perturbatively restored butbroken at the non-perturbative level. In the infinite-temperature limit thetheory is topological with an N=2 supersymmetry based on a topologicallynon-trivial hyper-Kahler manifold.
