Title: Quark Confinement and Deconfinement Transition in Large Flavor QCD

Authors: Kei-Ichi Kondo (Chiba Univ.)

Comments: 10 pages, 1 figure, Invited talk presented at TMU-Yale Symposium on

Dynamics of Gauge Fields, held on December 13-15, 1999We give a new criterion of quark confinement/deconfinement by deriving alow-energy effective theory of QCD. The effective theory can explain Abeliandominance in low-energy physics of QCD, especially, quark confinement. Finally,we apply the above criterion to the large flavor QCD and discuss its phasestructure. The result suggests the existence of conformal phase.
