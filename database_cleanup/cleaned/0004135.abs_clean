Title: On an effective action of monopoles in Abelian projections of Yang-Mills

theoryAuthors: Sergei V. Shabanov

Comments: A talk given at ``Frontiers of Matter'', Blois, France (summer'99);

to appear in the proceedings; plain Latex, 6 pagesA path integral description of an effective action of monopoles in Abelianprojections of Yang-Mills theories is discussed and used to establish aprojection independence of the effective action. A dynamic regime in which theeffective dynamics may contain massive solitonic excitations is described.
