We discuss a phase structure of compact QED in four dimensions by consideringthe theory as a perturbed topological model. In this scenario we use thesingular configuration with an appropriate regularization, and so obtain theresults similar to the lattice gauge theory due to the effect of topologicalobjects. In this paper we calculate the thermal pressure of the topologicalmodel by the use of a one-dimensional Coulomb gas approximation, which leads toa phase structure of full compact QED. Furthermore the critical-line equationis explicitly evaluated. We also discuss relations between the monopolecondensation in compact QED in four dimensions and the chiral symmetryrestoration in the massive Thirring model in two dimensions.
