We study RR charge cancellation consistency conditions in stringcompactifications with open string sectors, by introducing D-brane probes inthe configuration. We show that uncancelled charges manifest as chiral gaugeanomalies in the world-volume of suitable probes. RR tadpole cancellation cantherefore be described as the consistency of the effective compactified theorynot just in the vacuum, but also in all topological sectors (presence ofD-brane probes). The result explains why tadpole cancellation is usually muchstronger than anomaly cancellation of the compactified theory (in the vacuumsector). We use the probe criterion to construct consistent six-dimensionalorientifolds of curved K3 spaces, where usual CFT techniques to computetadpoles are not valid. As a last application, we consider compactificationswhere standard RR charge cancels but full K-theory charge does not. We show theinconsistency of such models manifests as a global gauge anomaly on theworld-volume of suitable probes.
