The most relevant thermal perturbation of the continuous d=2 minimalconformal theory with c=7/10 (Tricritical Ising Model) is treated here. Thismodel describes the scaling region of the phi^6 universality class near thetricritical point. The problematic IR divergences of the naive perturbativeexpansion around conformal theories are dealt within the OPE approach developedat all orders by the authors. The main result is a description of the shortdistance behaviour of correlators that is compared with existing long distanceexpansion (form factors approach) related to the integrability of the model.
