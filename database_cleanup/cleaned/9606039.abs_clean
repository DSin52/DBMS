Title: Evidence for String Substructure

Comments: Latex file, 21 pages, 11 postscript figures

We argue that the behavior of string theory at high temperature and highlongitudinal boosts, combined with the emergence of p-branes as necessaryingredients in various string dualities, point to a possible reformulation ofstrings, as well as p-branes, as composites of bits. We review the string-bitmodels, and suggest generalizations to incorporate p-branes.
