It is shown that generally the consistency equation for anomalies of quantumfield theories has solutions which depend nontrivially on the sources of the(generalized) BRS-transformations of the fields. Explicit previously unknownexamples of such solutions are given for Yang-Mills and super Yang-Millstheories.
