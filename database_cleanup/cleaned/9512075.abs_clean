The Legendre transform and its generalizations, originally found insupersymmetric sigma-models, are techniques that can be used to giveconstructions of hyperkahler metrics. We give a twistor space interpretation tothe generalizations of the Legendre transform construction. The Atiyah-Hitchinmetric on the moduli space of two monopoles is used as a detailed example.
