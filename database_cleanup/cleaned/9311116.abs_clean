A large class of Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations governing theRenormalization Group evolution of the Casimir energy of the vacuum on thecylinder for an integrable two-dimensional field theory, can often be encodedon a tensor product of two graphs. We demonstrate here that in this case thetwo graphs can only be of $ADE$ type. We also give strong numerical evidencefor a new large set of Dilogarithm sum Rules connected to $ADE\times ADE$ and asimple formula for the ultraviolet perturbing operator conformal dimensionsonly in terms of rank and Coxeter numbers of $ADE\times ADE$. We conclude withsome remarks on the curious case $ADE\times D$. [Talk given by F.R. at theCargese Workshop "New Developments in String Theory, Conformal Models andTopological Field Theory" (May 1993)]
