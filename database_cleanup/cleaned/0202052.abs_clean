Title: Cardy-Verlinde Formula and asymptotically flat rotating Charged black

holesComments: 15 pages, 2 figures

The Cardy-Verlinde formula is generalized to the asymptotically flat rotatingcharged black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell theory and low-energy effectivefield theory describing string by using some typical spacetimes, such as theKerr-Newman, Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion, Kaluza-Klein, and Sen black holes.For the Kerr-Newman black hole, the definition of the Casimir energy takes thesame form as that of the Kerr-Newman-AdS$_4$ and Kerr-Newman-dS$_4$ blackholes, while the Cardy-Verlinde formula possesses different from since theCasimir energy does not appear in the extensive energy. TheEinstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion, Kaluza-Klein, and Sen black holes have specialto that of the Kerr-Newman black hole, but the Cardy-Verlinde formula takes thesame form as that of the Kerr black hole. Furthermore, we also study theentropy bounds for the systems in which the matters surrounds these blackholes. We find that the bound for the case of the Kerr-Newman black hole isrelated to its charge, and the bound for the cases of the EMDA, Kaluza-Klein,and Sen black holes can be expressed as a unified form. A surprising result isthat the entropy bounds for the Kaluza-Klein and Sen black holes are tighterthan the Bekenstein one.
