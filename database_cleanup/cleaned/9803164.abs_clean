We construct multimonopole solutions containing N-1 distinct fundamentalmonopoles in SU(N) gauge theory. When the gauge symmetry is spontaneouslybroken to U(1)^{N-1}, the monopoles are all massive, and we show that thefields can be written in terms of elementary function for all values of themonopole positions and phases. In the limit of unbroken U(1) X SU(N-2) X U(1)symmetry, the configuration can be viewed as containing a pair of massivemonopoles, each carrying both U(1) and SU(N-2) magnetic charges, together withN-3 massless monopoles that condense into a cloud of non-Abelian fields. Weobtain explicit expressions for the fields in the latter case and use these toanalyze the properties of the non-Abelian cloud.
