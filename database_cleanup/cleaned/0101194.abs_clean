We establish an exact connection between the Choptuik scaling parameter forthe three-dimensional BTZ black hole, and the imaginary part of the quasinormalfrequencies for scalar perturbations. Via the AdS/CFT correspondence, thisleads to an interpretation of Choptuik scaling in terms of the timescale forreturn to equilibrium of the dual conformal field theory.
