We show with two numerical examples that the conventional expansion in powersof the field for the critical potential of 3-dimensional O(N) models in thelarge-N limit, does not converge for values of phi^2 larger than some criticalvalue. This can be explained by the existence of conjugated branch points inthe complex phi^2 plane. Pade approximants [L+3/L] for the critical potentialapparently converge at large phi^2. This allows high-precision calculation ofthe fixed point in a more suitable set of coordinates. We argue that thesingularities are generic and not an artifact of the large-N limit. We showthat ignoring these singularities may lead to inaccurate approximations.
