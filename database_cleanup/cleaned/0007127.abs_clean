Here we construct a map from the algebra of fields in two-dimensionalnoncommutative of U(1) Yang-Mills fields interacting with Kaluza-Klein scalarsto a D-dimensional one, as a solution in the two-dimensional model. This provesthe equivalence of noncommutative models in various (even) dimensions.Physically this map describes condensation of D1-branes.
