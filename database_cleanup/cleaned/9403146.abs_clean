The effective action for hard thermal loops in QCD is related to a gaugedWZNW theory. Some of the technical issues of this approach are clarified andthe Hamiltonian formulation is presented. The two-point correlation functionfor the induced current in QCD is obtained; some simplifications of thedynamics of the longitudinal modes are also pointed out.
