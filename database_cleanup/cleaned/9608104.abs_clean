Global geometry of $K3$-fibration Calabi-Yau threefolds, with Hodge number$h_{2,1}=r+1$, is used to define $N=4$ softly broken $SU(r+1)$ gauge theories,with the bare coupling constant given by the dual heterotic dilaton, and themass of the adjoint hypermultiplet given by the heterotic string tension. The$U(r+1)$ Donagi-Witten integrable model is also derived from the $K3$-fibrationstructure, with the extra $U(1)$ associated to the heterotic dilaton. The caseof $SU(2)$ gauge group is analyzed in detail. String physics beyond theheterotic point particle limit is partially described by the $N=4$ softlybroken theory.
