We study M-theory fivebranes wrapped on Special Lagrangian submanifolds($\S_n$) in Calabi-Yau three- and fourfolds. When the M5 wraps a four-cycle,the resulting theory is a two-dimensional domain wall embedded inthree-dimensional bulk with four supercharges. The theory on the wall isspecified in terms of the geometry of the CY manifold and the cycle $\S_4$. Itis chiral and anomalous, however the presence of a three-dimensionalgravitational Chern-Simons terms with a coefficient that jumps when crossingthe wall allows to cancel the anomaly by inflow. Kahler manifolds of specialtype, where the potential depends only on the real part of the complexcoordinate, are shown to emerge as the target spaces of two-dimensionalsigma-models when the M5 is wrapped on $\S_3 \times S^1$, thus providing aphysical realization of some recent symplectic construction by Hitchin.
