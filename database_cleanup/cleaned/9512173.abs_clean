It is shown that classical nonsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in 4dimensions is symmetric under a generalized dual transform which reduces to theusual dual *-operation for electromagnetism. The parallel phase transport$\tilde{A}_\mu(x)$ constructed earlier for monopoles is seen to function alsoas a potential in giving full description of the gauge field, playing thus anentirely dual symmetric role to the usual potential $A_\mu(x)$. Sources of $A$are monopoles of $\tilde{A}$ and vice versa, and the Wu-Yang criterion formonopoles is found to yield as equations of motion the standard Wong andYang-Mills equations for respectively the classical and Dirac point charge;this applies whether the charge is electric or magnetic, the two cases beingrelated just by a dual transform. The dual transformation itself is explicit,though somewhat complicated, being given in terms of loop space variables ofthe Polyakov type.
