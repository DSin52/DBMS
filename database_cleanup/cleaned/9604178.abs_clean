We construct several examples of compactification of Type IIB theory onorientifolds and discuss their duals. In six dimensions we obtain models with$N=1$ supersymmetry, multiple tensor multiplets, and different gauge groups. Innine dimensions we obtain a model that is dual to M-theory compactified on aKlein bottle.
