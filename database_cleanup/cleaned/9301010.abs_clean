It is shown that the previously known $N=3$ and $N=4$ superconformal algebrascan be contracted consistently by singular scaling of some of the generators.For the later case, by a contraction which depends on the central term, weobtain a new $N=4$ superconformal algebra which contains an $SU(2)\times{U(1)}^4$ Kac-Moody subalgebra and has nonzero central extension.
