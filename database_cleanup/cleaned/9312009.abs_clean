Title: Classical Field Theory and Analogy Between Newton's and Maxwell's

EquationsComments: 27 pages

A bivertical classical field theory include the Newtonian mechanics andMaxwell's electromagnetic field theory as the special cases. This unificationallows to recognize the formal analogies among the notions of Newtonianmechanics and Maxwell's electrodynamics.
