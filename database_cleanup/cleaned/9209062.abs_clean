The hamiltonian BRST-anti-BRST theory is developed in the general case ofarbitrary reducible first class systems. This is done by extending the methodsof homological perturbation theory, originally based on the use of a singleresolution, to the case of a biresolution. The BRST and the anti-BRSTgenerators are shown to exist. The respective links with the ordinary BRSTformulation and with the $ sp(2) $-covariant formalism are also established.
