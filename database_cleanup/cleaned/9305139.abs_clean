We study toroidal compactifications of string theories which includecompactification of a timelike coordinate. Some new features in the theory oftoroidal compactifications arise. Most notably, Narain moduli space does notexist as a manifold since the action of duality on background data is ergodic.For special compactifications certain infinite dimensional symmetries,analogous to the infinite dimensional symmetries of the $2D$ string areunbroken. We investigate the consequences of these symmetries and search for auniversal symmetry which contains all unbroken gauge groups. We define a flatconnection on the moduli space of toroidally compactified theories. Paralleltransport by this connection leads to a formulation of broken symmetry Wardidentities. In an appendix this parallel transport is related to a definitionof conformal perturbation theory.
