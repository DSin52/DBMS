We consider test strings and test branes ending on D$p$-branes ($p\le 6$) andNS5-branes in the background, for a heuristic understanding of the dynamics.Whenever some supersymmetry is preserved, a simple BPS bound appears, but thecentral charge in question is measured by certain isotropic coordinate system,rather than by the actual spacetime geometry. This way, the ground state energyis independent of the gravitational radii of the solitonic background.Furthermore, a perturbation around the supersymmetric ground states revealsthat the appropriate Dirichlet boundary condition is dynamically induced.
