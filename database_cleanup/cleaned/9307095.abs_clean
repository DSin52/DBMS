We study the gravitational interaction involving the dilaton and theanti-symmetrical $B_{\mu\nu}$ fields that arises in the low-energy limit ofstring theory. It is shown that such interaction can be derived from ageometrical action principle, with the scalar of curvature of a non-Riemannian,but {\em metric-compatible}, connection as the lagrangian, and with anon-parallel volume-element. This action is contrasted with the recentlyproposed geometrical action for the 4-dimensional axi-dilaton gravity.
