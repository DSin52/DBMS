In two recent papers, a new method was developed for calculatingten-dimensional superstring amplitudes with an arbitrary number of loops andexternal massless particles, and for expressing them in manifestlyLorentz-invariant form. By explicitly checking for divergences when the Riemannsurface degenerates, these amplitudes are proven to be finite. By choosinglight-cone moduli for the surface and comparing with the light-coneGreen-Schwarz formalism, these amplitudes are proven to be unitary.
