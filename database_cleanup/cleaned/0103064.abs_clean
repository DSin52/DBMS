There exist logarithmic CFTs(LCFTs) such as the $c_{p,1}$ models. It is alsowell known that it generally contains Jordan cell structure. In this paper, weobtain the boundary Ishibashi state for a rank-2 Jordan cell structure and,with these states in $c=-2$ rational LCFT, we derive boundary states in theclosed string picture, which correspond to boundary conditions in the openstring picture. We also discuss the Verlinde formula for LCFT and possibleapplications to string theory.
