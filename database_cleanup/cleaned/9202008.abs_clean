We analyze topological string theory on a two dimensional torus, focusing onsymmetries in the matter sector. Even before coupling to gravity, thetopological torus has an infinite number of point-like physical observables,which give rise via the BRST descent equations to an infinite symmetry algebraof the model. The point-like observables of ghost number zero form atopological ground ring, whose generators span a spacetime manifold; thesymmetry algebra represents all (ground ring valued) diffeomorphisms of thespacetime. At nonzero ghost numbers, the topological ground ring is extended toa superring, the spacetime manifold becomes a supermanifold, and the symmetryalgebra preserves a symplectic form on it. In a decompactified limit ofcylindrical target topology, we find a nilpotent charge which behaves like aspacetime topological BRST operator. After coupling to topological gravity,this model might represent a topological phase of $c=1$ string theory. We alsopoint out some analogies to two dimensional superstrings with the chiral GSOprojection, and to string theory with $c=-2$.
