A brief review of the confrontation between black hole physics andquantum-mechanical unitarity is presented. Possibile reconciliations aremodifying the laws of physics to allow fundamental loss of information, escapeof information during the Hawking process, or black hole remnants. Each ofthese faces serious objections. A better understanding of the problem and itspossible solutions can be had by studying two-dimensional models of dilatongravity. Recent developments in these investigations are summarized. (Linearsuperposition of talks presented at the 7th Nishinomiya Yukawa MemorialSymposium and at the 1992 YITP Workshop on Quantum Gravity, November 1992.)
