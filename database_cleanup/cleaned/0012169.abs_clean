Authors: M. Bertolini and A. Lerda

Comments: 12 pages, latex. To appear in the proceedings of the IX Marcel

Grossman Meeting (Rome, July 2000) and of the RTN conference ``The QuantumStructure of Spacetime and the Geometric Nature of Fundamental Interactions''(Berlin, October 2000)Journal-ref: Fortsch.Phys. 49 (2001) 441-448

We review how to describe the stable non-BPS D-branes of type II stringtheory from a classical perspective, and discuss the properties of thespace-time geometry associated to these configurations. This is relevant inorder to see whether and how the gauge/gravity correspondence can be formulatedin non-conformal and non-supersymmetric settings.
