of Beyond the Desert 99 - Accelerator and non Accelerator Approaches, CastleRingberg, Tegernsee, Germany, 6-12 June 1999In the first part of this paper I review the construction of the realisticfree fermionic models, as well as current attempts to study aspects of thesemodels in the nonperturbative framework of M- and F-theories. I discuss therecent demonstration of a Minimal Superstring Standard Model, which contains inthe observable sector, below the string scale, solely the MSSM chargedspectrum, and provides further support to the assertion that the true stringvacuum is connected to the Z_2 X Z_2 orbifold in the vicinity of the freefermionic point in the Narain moduli space. In the second part I review therecent formulation of quantum mechanics from an equivalence postulate, whichoffers a new perspective on the synthesis of gravity and quantum mechanics, andcontemplate possible relations with string theory and beyond.
