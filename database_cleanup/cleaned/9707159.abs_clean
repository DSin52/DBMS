The massive phase of two-layer integrable systems is studied by means of RSOSrestrictions of affine Toda theories. A general classification of all possibleintegrable perturbations of coupled minimal models is pursued by an analysis ofthe (extended) Dynkin diagrams. The models considered in most detail arecoupled minimal models which interpolate between magnetically coupled Isingmodels and Heisenberg spin-ladders along the $c<1$ discrete series.
