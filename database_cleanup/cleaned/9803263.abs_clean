We use the recently proposed supergravity approach to large $N$ gaugetheories to calculate ordinary and spatial Wilson loops of gauge theories invarious dimensions. In this framework we observe an area law for spatial Wilsonloops in four and five dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills at finitetemperature. This can be interpreted as the area law of ordinary Wilson loopsin three and four dimensional non-supersymmetric gauge theories at zerotemperature which indicates confinement in these theories. Furthermore, we showthat super Yang Mills theories with 16 supersymmetries at finite temperature donot admit phase transitions between the weakly coupled super Yang Mills andsupergravity regimes. This result is derived by analyzing the entropy andspecific heat of those systems as well as by computing ordinary Wilson loops atfinite temperature. The calculation of the entropy was carried out in alldifferent regimes and indicates that there is no first order phase transitionin these systems. For the same theories at zero temperature we also compute thedependence of the quark anti-quark potential on the separating distance.
