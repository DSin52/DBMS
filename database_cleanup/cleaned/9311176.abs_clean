Title: Cosmic Censorship Violation for a Class of Supersymmetric Solitons

Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Donam Youm

Comments: 11pg., UPR-593-T (The statement that such supersymmetric solitons

provide counter-examples to the conjecture that supersymmetry acts as a(strong) cosmic censorship conjecture within a supersymmetric theory.)We study vacuum domain walls in a class of four-dimensional $N=1$supergravity theories where along with the matter field, forming the wall,there is more than one ``dilaton'', each respecting $SU(1,1)$ symmetry in theirsub-sector. We find {\it supersymmetric} (planar, static) walls, interpolaingbetween Minkowski vacuum and a new class of supersymmetric vacua which have anaked (planar) singularity. Such walls provide the first example ofsupersymmetric classical ``solitons'' with naked singularities, and thusviolate the (strong) cosmic censorship conjecture within a supersymmetrictheory.
