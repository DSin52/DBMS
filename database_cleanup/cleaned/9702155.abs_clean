postscript format. Lectures given at TASI96These lectures are devoted to introducing some of the basic features ofquantum geometry that have been emerging from compactified string theory overthe last couple of years. The developments discussed include new geometricfeatures of string theory which occur even at the classical level as well asthose which require non-perturbative effects. These lecture notes are based onan evolving set of lectures presented at a number of schools but most closelyfollow a series of seven lectures given at the TASI-96 summer school onStrings, Fields and Duality.
