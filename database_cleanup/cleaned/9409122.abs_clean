Title: A Perturbative Approach to the Chiral Potts Model

Comments: plain TeX, 48 pages + 3 PostScript figures, (various improvements and

corrections - for details see beginning of the file)The massive high-temperature phase of the chiral Potts quantum chain isstudied using perturbative methods. For the Z_3-chain we presenthigh-temperature expansions for the groundstate energy and the dispersionrelations of the two single-particle states as well as two-particle states atgeneral values of the parameters. We also present a perturbative argumentshowing that a large class of massive Z_n-spin quantum chains havequasiparticle spectra with n-1 fundamental particles. It is known from earlierinvestigations that -at special values of the parameters- some of thefundamental particles exist only for limited ranges of the momentum. In theseregimes our argument is not rigorous as one can conclude from a discussion ofthe radius of convergence of the perturbation series. We also derivecorrelation functions from a perturbative evaluation of the groundstate for theZ_3-chain. In addition to an exponential decay we observe an oscillatingcontribution. The oscillation length seems to be related to the asymmetry ofthe dispersion relations. We show that this relation is exact at special valuesof the parameters for general Z_n using a form factor expansion.
