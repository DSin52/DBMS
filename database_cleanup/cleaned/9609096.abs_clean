The boundary effects in the screening of an applied magnetic field in acharged anyon fluid at finite temperature and density are investigated. Byanalytically solving the extremum equations of the sytem and minimizing thefree energy density, we find that in a sample with only one boundary (the halfplane), a total Meissner effect takes place; while the sample with twoboundaries (the infinite strip) exhibits a partial Meissner effect. Theshort-ranges modes of propagation of the magnetic field inside the fluid arecharacterized by two temp erature dependent penetration lengths.
