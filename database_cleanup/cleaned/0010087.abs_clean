Title: An M-Theory Perspective on Heterotic K3 Orbifold Compactifications

Authors: M. Faux, D. Lust and B.A. Ovrut

Comments: 58 pages, LaTeX

We analyze the structure of heterotic M-theory on K3 orbifolds by presentinga comprehensive sequence of M-theoretic models constructed on the basis oflocal anomaly cancellation. This is facilitated by extending the technologydeveloped in our previous papers to allow one to determine "twisted" sectorstates in non-prime orbifolds. These methods should naturally generalize tofour-dimensional models, which are of potential phenomenological interest.
