We study the geometric interpretation of two dimensional rational conformalfield theories, corresponding to sigma models on Calabi-Yau manifolds. Weperform a detailed study of RCFT's corresponding to T^2 target and identify theCardy branes with geometric branes. The T^2's leading to RCFT's admit ``complexmultiplication'' which characterizes Cardy branes as specific D0-branes. Wepropose a condition for the conformal sigma model to be RCFT for arbitraryCalabi-Yau n-folds, which agrees with the known cases. Together with recentconjectures by mathematicians it appears that rational conformal theories arenot dense in the space of all conformal theories, and sometimes appear to befinite in number for Calabi-Yau n-folds for n>2. RCFT's on K3 may be dense. Wespeculate about the meaning of these special points in the moduli spaces ofCalabi-Yau n-folds in connection with freezing geometric moduli.
