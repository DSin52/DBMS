Journal-ref: Annals Phys. 232 (1994) 1

As compared to the previous version, the example of Gupta-Bleulerquantization of massive electrodynamics was added, and the derivation of pathintegral for anomalous theories is further elaborated. This is the finalversion to be published in Annals of Physics.
