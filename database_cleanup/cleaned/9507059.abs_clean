We give a class of explicit solutions for the stationary and cylindricallysymmetric vortex configurations for a ``cool'' two-component superfluid (i.e.superfluid with an ideal gas of phonons). Each solution is characterized onlyby a set of (true) constants of integration. We then compute the effectiveasymptotic contribution of the vortex to the stress energy tensor by comparisonwith a uniform reference state without vortex.
