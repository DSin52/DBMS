Cosmological consequences of the brane world scenario are reviewed in apedagogical manner. According to the brane world idea, the standard modelparticles are confined on a hyper--surface (a so--called brane), which isembedded in a higher--dimensional spacetime (the so--called bulk). We begin ourin a five--dimensional Anti-de Sitter space--time. Then we include a scalarfield in the bulk and discuss in detail the difference with the Anti-de Sittercase. The geometry of the bulk space--time is also analysed in some depth.Finally, we investigate the cosmology of a system with two branes and a bulkscalar field. We comment on brane collisions and summarize some open problemsof brane world cosmology.
