Title: Critical RSOS and Minimal Models II

Virasoro Algebra and FieldsAuthors: Giovanni Feverati and Paul A. Pearce

We consider sl(2) minimal conformal field theories and the dual parafermionmodels. Guided by results for the critical A_L Restricted Solid-on-Solid (RSOS)models and its Virasoro modules expressed in terms of paths, we propose ageneral level-by-level algorithm to build matrix representations of theVirasoro generators and chiral vertex operators (CVOs). We implement our schemefor the critical Ising, tricritical Ising, 3-state Potts and Yang-Lee theorieson a cylinder and confirm that it is consistent with the known two-pointfunctions for the CVOs and energy-momentum tensor. Our algorithm employs adistinguished basis which we call the L_1-basis. We relate the states of thiscanonical basis level-by-level to orthonormalized Virasoro states.
