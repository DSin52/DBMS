By defining a prepotential function for the stationary Schr\"odinger equationwe derive an inversion formula for the space variable $x$ as a function of thewave-function $\psi$. The resulting equation is a Legendre transform thatrelates $x$, the prepotential ${\cal F}$, and the probability density. Weinvert the Schr\"odinger equation to a third-order differential equation for${\cal F}$ and observe that the inversion procedure implies a $x$-$\psi$duality. This phenomenon is related to a modular symmetry due to thesuperposition of the solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation. We propose thatin quantum mechanics the space coordinate can be interpreted as a macroscopicvariable of a statistical system with $\hbar$ playing the role of a scalingparameter. We show that the scaling property of the space coordinate withrespect to $\tau=\partial_{\psi}^2{\cal F}$ is determined by the``beta-function''. We propose that the quantization of the inversion formulais a natural way to quantize geometry. The formalism is extended to higherdimensions and to the Klein-Gordon equation.
