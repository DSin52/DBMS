We present and study a new chain of 10-d T duality related solutions andtheir 11-d parents whose existence had been predicted in the literature basedin U duality requirements in 4 d. The first link is the S dual of the D7-brane.The next link has 6 spatial worldvolume dimensions, it is charged w.r.t. the RR7-form but depends only on 2 transverse dimensions since the third has to becompactified in a circle and is isometric and hence is similar in this respectto the KK monopole. The next link has 5 spatial worldvolume dimensions, it ischarged w.r.t. the RR 6-form but depends only on 2 transverse dimensions sincethe 3rd and 4th have to be compactified in circles and are isometric and so on.All these solutions are identical when reduced over the p spatial worldvolumedimensions and preserve a 1/2 on the supersymmetries. Their masses depend onthe square of the radii of the isometric directions, just as for the KKmonopole. We give a general map of these branes and their duality relations andshow how they must appear in the supersymmetry algebra.
