Title: Introducing Quarks in Confining Strings via the Fermionic Wilson Loop

Authors: Vikram Vyas

Comments: 16 pages, LaTeX

In the world line representation of the fermionic effective action for QCDthe interaction between Fermions and the gauge field is contained in thefermionic Wilson loop, namely the Wilson loop for a spin-half particle. It isargued that a string representation of the fermionic Wilson loop can provide alink connecting QCD with a dual description of a meson as a quark and anantiquark connected by a string. This is illustrated by obtaining such arepresentation in compact U(1) gauge theories. The resulting descriptioncontains information about the interaction of the spin of the quark with theworld sheet degrees of freedom. Such interactions may be of importance in therealization of chiral symmetry in the string picture of QCD, and fordelineating the possible presence of a world sheet supersymmetry in QCDstrings.
