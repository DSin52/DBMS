In order to study the thermodynamic properties of brane-antibrane systems, wecompute the finite temperature effective potential of tachyon T in this systemon the basis of boundary string field theory. At low temperature, the minimumof the potential shifts towards T=0 as the temperature increases. In theD9-antiD9 case, the sign of the coefficient of |T|^2 term of the potentialchanges slightly below the Hagedorn temperature. This means that a phasetransition occurs near the Hagedorn temperature. On the other hand, thecoefficient is kept negative in the Dp-antiDp case with p <= 8, and thus aphase transition does not occur. This leads us to the conclusion that only aD9-antiD9 pair and no other (lower dimensional) brane-antibrane pairs arecreated near the Hagedorn temperature. We also discuss a phase transition inNS9B-antiNS9B case as a model of the Hagedorn transition of closed strings.
