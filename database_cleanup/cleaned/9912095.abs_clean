I study variations of the fermionic determinant for a nonabelian Diracfermion with external vector and axial vector sources. I consider differentregularizations, leading to different chiral anomalies when the variations arechiral transformations. For these different regularizations, I then considervariations associated with Poincare transformations. I find that both Lorentzand translational invariance are anomalously violated in general, but that theyare respected when the variations of the determinant are regularized to give aWess-Zumino consistent anomaly (the Bardeen anomaly). If the variations areregularized to give a covariant anomaly, then Poincare invariance is notrespected. Following Manohar in an investigation of Poincare anomalies in achiral gauge theory, this gives an alternative way to understand the need for aconsistent regularization of the variations of the fermionic determinant.
