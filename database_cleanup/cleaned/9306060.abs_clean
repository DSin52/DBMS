We use separation of variables as a tool to identify and to analyze exactlysoluble time-dependent quantum mechanical potentials. By considering the mostgeneral possible time-dependent re-definition of the spatial coordinate, aswell as general transformations on the wavefunctions, we show that separationof variables applies and exact solubility occurs only in a very restrictedclass of time-dependent models. We consider the formal structure underlying ourfindings, and the relationship between our results and other work ontime-dependent potentials. As an application of our methods, we apply ourresults to the calculations of propagators.
