We consider BRST quantized 2D gravity coupled to conformal matter witharbitrary central charge $c^M = c(p,q) < 1$ in the conformal gauge. We apply aLian-Zuckerman $SO(2,\bbc)$ ($(p,q)$ - dependent) rotation to Witten's $c^M =1$ chiral ground ring. We show that the ring structure generated by the(relative BRST cohomology) discrete states in the (matter $\otimes$ Liouville$\otimes$ ghosts) Fock module may be obtained by this rotation. We give alsoexplicit formulae for the discrete states. For some of them we use new formulaefor $c <1$ Fock modules singular vectors which we present in terms of Schurpolynomials generalizing the $c=1$ expressions of Goldstone, while the rest ofthe discrete states we obtain by finding the proper $SO(2,\bbc)$ rotation. Ourformulae give the extra physical states (arising from the relative BRSTcohomology) on the boundaries of the $p \times q$ rectangles of the conformallattice and thus all such states in $(1,q)$ or $(p,1)$ models.
