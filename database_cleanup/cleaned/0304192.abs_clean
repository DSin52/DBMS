Sen has recently drawn attention to an exact time-dependent BoundaryConformal Field Theory with the space-time interpretation of brane creation andannihilation. An interesting limit of this BCFT is formally equivalent to anthe meaning of D-branes in imaginary time? The answer we propose is thatD-branes in imaginary time define purely closed string backgrounds. Inparticular we prove that the disk scattering amplitude of m closed strings offan arbitrary configuration of imaginary branes is equivalent to a sphereamplitude with m+1 closed string insertions. The extra puncture is a specificclosed string state, generically normalizable, that depends on the details ofthe brane configuration. We study in some detail the special case of the arrayof imaginary D-branes related to Sen's BCFT and comment on its space-timeinterpretation. We point out that a certain limit of our set-up allows to studyclassical black hole creation and suggests a relation between Choptuik'scritical behavior and a phase-transition a` la Gregory-Laflamme. We speculatethat open string field theory on imaginary D-branes is dual to string theory onthe corresponding closed string background.
