We propose modified action which is equivalent to N=1 Green-Schwarzsuperstring and which allows one to realize the supplementation trick [26].Fermionic first and second class constraints are covariantly separated, thefirst class constraints (1CC) turn out to be irreducible. We discuss alsoequations of motion in the covariant gauge for $\kappa$-symmetry. It is shownhow the usual Fock space picture can be obtained in this gauge.
