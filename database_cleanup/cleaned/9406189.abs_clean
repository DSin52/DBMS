Worldsheet supersymmetric string action is written in duality invariant formfor flat as well as curved backgrounds. First the action in flat backgrounds iswritten by introducing auxiliary fields. We also give the superfield form ofthis action and obtain the offshell supersymmetry algebra. The action has amodified Lorentz invariance and supersymmetry and reduces to the usual formwhen the auxiliary fields are eliminated using their equations of motion.Supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model in curved backgrounds is also written inmanifestly duality invariant form when the background metric and tortion fieldsare independent of some of the coordinates.
