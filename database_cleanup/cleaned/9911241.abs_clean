The first half is a rapid review of 30 years of work on physics in anti-DeSitter space, with heavy emphasis on singletons. Principal topics are thekinematical basis for regarding singletons as the constituents of masslessparticles, and the effect of (negative) curvature in the infrared domain. Ideasthat lead to an alternative to Big Bang cosmology are merely sketched. Thesecond half presents new ideas inspired by experimental results on neutrinooscillations. Since leptons are massless before symmetry breaking it is naturalto view them as composite states consisting of one Bose singleton (the Rac) andone Fermi singleton (the Di). This gives rise to a particular formulation ofthe phenomenology of electroweak physics, and strong suggestions for anexpansion of the Standard model. An expansion of the Higgs sector seemsinevitable, and flavor changing symmetry, complete with a new set of heavyvector mesons, is a very attractive possibility.
