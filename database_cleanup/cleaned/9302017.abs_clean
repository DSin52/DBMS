The submitted paper regards the example of the Conformal Field Theory on a 2dmanifold which metric has a point-like singularity.Since this manifold is notconformally equivalent to that with the flat space-time metric,it's naturallyto expect that the theory cannot be trivially reduced to the well-knownconsideration of the CFT on a plane,and some modifications areneeded.Particularly,this paper shows how the vacuum of the theory on a singularsurface differs from the vacuum of the BPZ theory.Namely,this vacuum would notbe SL(2,C)-invariant and the expressions for the correlation functions shouldbe modified. As a consequence of that,some "effective mass" is brought to thetheory.
