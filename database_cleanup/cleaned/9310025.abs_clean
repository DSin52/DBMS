We discuss general properties of the conservation law associated with a localsymmetry. Using Noether's theorem and a generalized Belinfante symmetrizationprocedure in 3+1 dimensions, a symmetric energy-momentum (pseudo) tensor forthe gravitational Einstein-Hilbert action is derived and discussed in detail.In 2+1 dimensions, expressions are obtained for energy and angular momentumarising in the $ISO(2,1)$ gauge theoretical formulation of Einstein gravity. Inaddition, an expression for energy in a gauge theoretical formulation of thestring-inspired 1+1 dimensional gravity is derived and compared with the ADMdefinition of energy.
