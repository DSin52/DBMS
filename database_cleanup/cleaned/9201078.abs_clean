We state and prove various new identities involving the Z_K parafermioncharacters (or level-K string functions) for the cases K=4, K=8, and K=16.generalizations of the famous Jacobi theta-function identity (which is the K=2special case), identities in another class relate the level K>2 characters tothe Dedekind eta-function, and identities in a third class relate the K>2characters to the Jacobi theta-functions. These identities play a crucial rolein the interpretation of fractional superstring spectra by indicating spacetimesupersymmetry and aiding in the identification of the spacetime spin andstatistics of fractional superstring states.
