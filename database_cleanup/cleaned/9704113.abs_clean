Using the bosonic supercurrent (or covariant lattice) formalism, we reviewhow to compute scattering amplitudes in asymmetric orbifold string models. Thismethod is particularly useful for calculating scattering of multipleasymmetrically twisted string states, where the twisted states are rewritten asordinary momentum states. We show how to reconstruct some of the 3-family grandunified string models in this formalism, and identify the quantum numbers ofthe massless states in their spectra. The discrete symmetries of these modelsare rather intricate. The superpotentials for the 3-family E_6 model and aclosely related SO(10) model are discussed in some detail. The forms of thesuperpotentials of the two 3-family SU(6) models (with asymptotically-freehidden sectors SU(3) and SU(2) \otimes SU(2)) are also presented.
