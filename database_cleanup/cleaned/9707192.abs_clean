Type IIA brane configurations are used to construct N=2 supersymmetric gaugetheories in two dimensions. Using localization of chiral multiplets inten-dimensional spacetime, supersymmetric non-linear sigma models with targetspace such as $\CP^{n-1}$ and the Grassmann manifolds are studied in detail.The quantum properties of these models are realized in $M$ theory by taking thestrong Type IIA coupling limit. The brane picture implies an equivalencebetween the parameter space of N=2 supersymmetric theories in two dimensionsand the moduli space of vacua of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories in fourdimensions. Effects like level-rank duality are interpreted in the branepicture as continuation past infinite coupling. The BPS solitons of the$\CP^{n-1}$ model are identified as topological excitations of a membrane andtheir masses are computed. This provides the brane realization of higher ranktensor representations of the flavor group.
