After setting up a general model for supersymmetric classical mechanics inmore than one dimension we describe systems with centrally symmetric potentialsand their Poisson algebra. We then apply this information to the investigationand solution of the supersymmetric Coulomb problem, specified by an 1/|x|repulsive bosonic potential.
