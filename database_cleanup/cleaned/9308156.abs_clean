models and the Grand String SymmetryAuthors: H. Gasparakis

Preliminary investigations of the topological phase of string theory alongthe lines of a (restricted) $\dot{w}_{\infty}$ non-linear sigma model areprovided. Gauge fixing the w gravity gauge fields by preserving a geometricidentity Lorenz covariantizes the w-particle and gauge covariantizes the YM.The notion of foliation ghosts is introduced. Connection between$\dot{w}_{\infty}$ and homotopy associative algebras is indicated. The secondquantized twistor space of string theory is constructed and compared with thefirst quantised one. Speculations about the relevance of the massive stringfields to the compactification of the bosonic string down to four dimensionstimes the standard model group as well as to the solution of the backgroundindependence problem and the integration over moduli space problem are alsoprovided.
