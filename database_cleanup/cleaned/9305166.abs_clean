In this letter we present an operator formalism for Closed String FieldTheory based on closed half-strings. Our results indicate that the restrictedpolyhedra of the classical non-polynomial string field theory, can berepresented as traces of infinite matrices, with operator insertions thatreparametrise the half-strings.
