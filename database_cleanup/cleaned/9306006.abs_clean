We study the interactions of non-abelian vortices in two spatial dimensions.These interactions have novel features, because the Aharonov-Bohm effectenables a pair of vortices to exchange quantum numbers. The cross section forvortex-vortex scattering is typically a multi-valued function of the scatteringangle. There can be an exchange contribution to the vortex-vortex scatteringamplitude that adds coherently with the direct amplitude, even if the twovortices have distinct quantum numbers. Thus two vortices can be``indistinguishable'' even though they are not the same.
