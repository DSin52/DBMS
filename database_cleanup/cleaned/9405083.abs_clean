Title: On gauge invariance and the path integral

Authors: Silvio J. Rabello and Carlos Farina

Comments: 4 pages, Latex, IF-UFRJ-94

Using a gauge covariant operator technique we deduce the path integral for acharged particle in a stationary magnetic field, verifying the "midpoint rule"for the discrete form of the interaction term with the vector potential.
