In this paper we view the sigma-model couplings of appropriate vertexoperators describing the interaction of string matter with a certain type ofstring solitons (0-branes) as the quantum phase space of a point particle. Thesigma-model is slightly non critical, and therefore one should dress it witha Liouville mode. Quantization is achieved by summing over world-sheet genera(in the pinched approximation). To leading order in the coupling constantexpansion, the quantization reproduces the usual quantum mechanical commutator.We attempt to go beyond leading order and we reproduce the generalized stringuncertainty principle.
