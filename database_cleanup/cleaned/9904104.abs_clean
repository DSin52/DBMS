We consider perturbative Type II superstring theory in the covariant NSRformalism in the presence of NSNS and RR backgrounds. A concrete example thatwe have in mind is the geometry of D3-branes which in the near-horizon regionis AdS_5 x S_5, although our methods may be applied to other backgrounds aswell. We show how conformal invariance of the string path integral ismaintained order by order in the number of holes. This procedure makes uses ofthe Fischler-Susskind mechanism to build up the background geometry. A simpleformal expression is given for a \sigma-model Lagrangian. This suggests aperturbative expansion in 1/g^2N and 1/N. As applications, we consider atleading order the mixing of RR and NSNS states, and the realization of thespacetime supersymmetry algebra.
