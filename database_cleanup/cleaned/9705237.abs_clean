We use the effective action of the $E_n$ non-critical strings to study itsBPS spectrum for $0 \le n \le 8$. We show how to introduce mass parameters, orWilson lines, into the effective action, and then perform the appropriateasymptotic expansions that yield the BPS spectrum. The result is the $E_n$character expansion of the spectrum, and is equivalent to performing the mirrormap on a Calabi-Yau with up to nine K\"ahler moduli. This enables a much moredetailed examination of the $E_n$ structure of the theory, and providesextensive checks on the effective action description of the non-criticalstring. We extract some universal ($E_n$ independent) information concerningthe degeneracies of BPS excitations.
