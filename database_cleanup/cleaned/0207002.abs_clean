We show how allowing non-local terms in the field equations of symmetrictensors uncovers a neat geometry that naturally generalizes the Maxwell andEinstein cases. The end results can be related to multiple traces of thegeneralized Riemann curvatures R_{alpha_1 ... alpha_s; beta_1 > ... beta_s}introduced by de Wit and Freedman, divided by suitable powers of theD'Alembertian operator \Box. The conventional local equations can be recoveredby a partial gauge fixing involving the trace of the gauge parametersLambda_{alpha_1 ... alpha_{s-1}}, absent in the Fronsdal formulation. The samegeometry underlies the fermionic equations, that, for all spins s+(1/2), can belinked via the operator (not hskip 1pt pr)/(\Box) to those of the spin-sbosons.
