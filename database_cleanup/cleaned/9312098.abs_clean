pages, latex, preprint YITP/K-1041, RCNP-065An algebraic treatment of shape-invariant potentials is discussed. Byintroducing an operator which reparametrizes wavefunctions, theshape-invariance condition can be related to a generalized Heisenberg- Weylalgebra. It is shown that this makes it possible to define a coherent stateassociated with the shape-invariant potentials.
