The Demazure character formula is applied to the Verlinde formula for affinefusion rules. We follow Littelmann's derivation of a generalizedLittlewood-Richardson rule from Demazure characters. A combinatorial rule foraffine fusions does not result, however. Only a modified version of theLittlewood-Richardson rule is obtained that computes an (old) upper bound onthe fusion coefficients of affine $A_r$ algebras. We argue that this is becausethe characters of simple Lie algebras appear in this treatment, instead of thecorresponding affine characters. The Bruhat order on the affine Weyl group mustbe implicated in any combinatorial rule for affine fusions; the Bruhat order onsubgroups of this group (such as the finite Weyl group) does not suffice.
