The straightforward description of q-deformed systems leads to transitionamplitudes that are not numerically valued. To give physical meaning to theseexpressions without introducing {\it ad hoc} remedies, one may exploit an"internal" Fock space already defined by the q-algebra. This internal space maybe interpreted in terms of internal degrees of freedom of the deformed systemor alternatively in terms of non-locality. It is shown that the $q$-deformationmay give stringy characteristics to a Yang-Mills theory.
