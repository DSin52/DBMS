We express the infinite sum of D-fivebrane instanton corrections to ${\calR}^2$ couplings in ${\cal N}=4$ type I string vacua, in terms of an ellipticindex counting 1/2-BPS excitations in the effective $Sp(N)$ brane theory. Wecompute the index explicitly in the infrared, where the effective theory isargued to flow to an orbifold CFT. The form of the instanton sum agreescompletely with the predicted formula from a dual one-loop computation in typeIIA theory on $K3\times T^2$. The proposed CFT provides a proper description ofthe whole spectrum of masses, charges and multiplicities for 1/2- and 1/4- BPSstates, associated to bound states of D5-branes and KK momenta. These resultsare applied to show how fivebrane instanton sums, entering higher derivativecouplings which are sensitive to 1/4-BPS contributions, also match theperturbative results in the dual type IIA theory.
