Title: On the analogy between electromagnetism and turbulent hydrodynamics

Comments: 14 pages

In this note, we propose an exegesis of the Maxwell equations forelectromagnetism. We begin with an analogy between the homogeneous Maxwellequations and the equations needed to describe the vorticity field of anincompressible inviscid fluid. We suggest that the inhomogeneous equations areanalogous to two equations valid in turbulent hydrodynamics. Once the analogyis completed we give the mechanical analogue of the Poynting vector and weexplain the influence of a long solenoid on the motion of a charged particle.
