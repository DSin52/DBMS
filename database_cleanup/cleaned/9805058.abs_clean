We study topological A-model disk amplitudes with Calabi-Yau target spaces bymirror symmetries. This allows us to calculate holomorphic instantons ofRiemann surfaces with boundaries that are mapped into susy cycles in Calabi-Yaud-folds. Also we analyse disk amplitudes in Fano manifold cases by consideringfusion relations between A-model operators.
