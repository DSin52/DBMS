We discuss phase structure of chiral symmetry breaking of the $D$-dimensional($2\leq D\leq3$) Gross-Neveu model at finite temperature, density and constantcurvature. We evaluate the effective potential in a weak backgroundapproximation to thermalize the model as well as in the leading order of the$1/N$-expansion. A third order critical line is observed similarly to the $D=2$case.
