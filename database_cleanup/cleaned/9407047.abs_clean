(2.8), and Lemma 3.9 were correctedWe describe vector valued conjugacy equivariant functions on a group K in twocases -- K is a compact simple Lie group, and K is an affine Lie group.We construct such functions as weighted traces of certain intertwiningoperators between representations of K. For a compact group $K$, Peter-Weyltheorem implies that all equivariant functions can be written as linearcombinations of such traces. Next, we compute the radial parts of the Laplaceoperators of $K$ acting on conjugacy equivariant functions and obtain a comple-tely integrable quantum system with matrix coefficients, which in a specialcase coincides with the trigonometric Calogero-Sutherland-Moser multi-particlesystem. In the affine Lie group case, we prove that the space of equivariantfunctions having a fixed homogeneity degree with respect to the action of thecenter of the group is finite-dimensional and spanned by weighted traces ofintertwining operators. This space coincides with the space ofWess-Zumino-Witten conformal blocks on an elliptic curve. We compute the radialpart of the second order Laplace operator on the affine Lie group acting onequivariant functions, and find that it is a certain parabolic partialdifferential operator, which degenerates to the ellipticCalogero-Sutherland-Moser hamiltonian as the central charge tends to minus thedual Coxeter number (the critical level). Quantum integrals of this hamiltonianare obtained as radial part of the higher Sugawara operators which are centralat the critical level.
