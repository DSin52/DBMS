Comments: Extended talk at the International Workshop ``Heat Kernel Techniques

and Quantum Gravity'', Winnipeg, Canada, 2---6 August, 1994), published in``Heat Kernel Techniques and Quantum Gravity'', ed. by S. A. Fulling,Discourses in Mathematics and Its Applications, No. 4, Texas A\&M Univ.,College Station, Texas, 1995, pp. 423--449The four-dimensional bosonic effective action of the toroidally compactifiedheterotic string incorporating a dilaton, an axion and one $U(1)$ vector fieldis studied on curved space-time manifolds with one and two commuting Killingvectors. In the first case the theory is reduced to a three-dimensional sigmamodel possessing a symmetric pseudoriemannian target space isomorphic to thecoset $SO(2,3)/(SO(3)\times SO(2))$. The ten-parameter group $SO(2,3)$ oftarget space isometries contains embedded both $S$ and $T$ classical dualitysymmetries of the heterotic string. With one more ignorable coordinate, thetheory reduces to a two-dimensional chiral model built on the above coset, andtherefore belongs to the class of completely integrable systems. This entailsinfinite-dimensional symmetries of the Geroch--Kinnersley--Chitre type. Purelydilatonic theory is shown to be two-dimensionally integrable only for twoparticular values of the dilaton coupling constant. In the static case(diagonal metrics) both theories essentially coincide; in this case theintegrability property holds for all values of the dilaton coupling.
