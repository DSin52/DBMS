Arguments presented in an earlier paper, demonstrating the breakdown ofglobal supersymmetry in Hawking radiation from a generic four dimensional blackhole with infalling massless scalar and spinor particles, are reexamined.Careful handling of the Grassmann-valued spinorial parameter is shown to leadto a situation wherein supersymmetry may not actually break. A comparativeanalysis in flat spacetime at a finite temperature, is also presented.
