Title: A Bohmian Interpretation for Noncommutative Quantum Field Theory and

Quantum MechanicsAuthors: G. Dourado Barbosa

Comments: improved English, references added, some changes in Section 5

We develop Bohmian interpretations for noncommutative quantum field theoryand quantum mechanics. The conditions for the classical and commutative limitsfor both theories are derived and applied for a formal discussion of thequantum/classical and noncommutative/commutative passages. Classical fieldtheory and Newtonian mechanics are obtained as limit cases of noncommutativequantum field theory and noncommutative quantum mechanics. Some advantages ofthe Bohmian interpretation against the orthodox one are underlined. Anapplication of the theory for the noncommutative harmonic oscillator ispresented and worked out in detail
