A brane universe moving in a curved higher dimensional bulk space isconsidered. The motion induces a cosmological evolution on the universe branethat is indistiguishable from a similar one induced by matter density on thebrane. The phenomenological implications of such an idea are discussed. Variousmirage energy densities are found, corresponding to dilute matter driving thecosmological expansion, many having superluminal properties $|w|>1$ orviolating the positive energy condition. It is shown that energy density due tothe world-volume fields is nicely incorporated into the picture. It is alsopointed out that the initial singularity problem is naturally resolved in thiscontext.
