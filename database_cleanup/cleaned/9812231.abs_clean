It is shown that Connes' generalized gauge field in non-commutative geometryis derived by simply requiring that Dirac lagrangian be invariant under localtransformations of the unitary elements of the algebra, which define the gaugegroup. The spontaneous breakdown of the gauge symmetry is guaranteed providedthe chiral fermions exist in more than one generations as first observed byConnes-Lott. It is also pointed out that the most general gauge invariantlagrangian in the bosonic sector has two more parameters than in the originalConnes-Lott scheme.
