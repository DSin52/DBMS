In the weak field expansion of euclidean quantum gravity, an analysis of theWilson loops in terms of the gauge group, $SO(4)$, shows that the correspondentstatistical system does not develope any configuration with localized curvatureat low temperature. Such a ``non-local'' behavior contrasts strongly with thatof usual gauge fields. We point out a possible relation between this result andthose of the numerical simulations of quantum Regge Calculus. We also give ageneral quantum formula for the static potential energy of the gravitationalinteraction of two masses, which is compatible with the mentioned vacuumstructure.
