Recent development in noncommutative geometry generalization of gauge theoryis reviewed. The mathematical apparatus is reduced to minimum in order to allowthe non-mathematically oriented physicists to follow the development in theinteresting field of research. (Lectures presented at the Silesian School of1993.)
