Kink dynamics in spatially discrete nonlinear Klein-Gordon systems isconsidered. For special choices of the substrate potential, such systemssupport continuous translation orbits of static kinks with no (classical)Peierls-Nabarro barrier. It is shown that these kinks experience, nevertheless,a lattice-periodic confining potential, due to purely quantum effects anaolgousto the Casimir effect of quantum field theory. The resulting ``quantumPeierls-Nabarro potential'' may be calculated in the weak couplingapproximation by a simple and computationally cheap numerical algorithm, whichis applied, for purposes of illustration, to a certain two-parameter family ofsubstrates.
