Effective critical exponents for the \lambda \phi^4 scalar field theory arecalculated as a function of the renormalization group block size k_o^{-1} andinverse critical temperature \beta_c. Exact renormalization group equations arepresented up to first order in the derivative expansion and numerical solutionsare obtained with and without polynomial expansion of the blocked potential.For a finite temperature system in d dimensions, it is shown that \bar\beta_c =\beta_c k_o determines whether the d-dimensional (\bar\beta_c << 1) or(d+1)-dimensional (\bar\beta_c >> 1) fixed point governs the phase transition.The validity of a polynomial expansion of the blocked potential nearcriticality is also addressed.
