The discrete model of the real symmetric one-matrix ensemble is analyzed witha cubic interaction. The partition function is found to satisfy a recursionrelation that solves the model. The double-scaling limit of the recursionrelation leads to a Miura transformation relating the contributions to the freeenergy coming from oriented and unoriented random surfaces. This transformationis the same kind as found with a cuartic interaction.
