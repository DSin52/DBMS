Title: Ultra-Relativistic Hamiltonian with Various Singular Potentials

Authors: Atsushi Yoshida

Comments: 7 pages

It is shown from a simple scaling invariance that the ultra-relativisticHamiltonian (mu=0) does not have bound states when the potential is Coulombic.This supplements the application of the relativistic virial theorem derived byLucha and Schoeberl which shows that bound states do not exist for potentialsmore singular than the Coulomb potential.
