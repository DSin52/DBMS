Title: On the Topological Charges of Affine Toda Solitons

Authors: Jonathan Underwood

Comments: 6 pages, Imperial/TP/92-93/38

We provide a proof of a formula conjectured in \cite{OU93} for somecoefficients relevant in the principal vertex operator construction of asimply-laced affine algebra $\gh$. These coefficients are important for thestudy of the topological charges of the solitons of affine Toda theories, andthe construction of representations of non-simply-laced $\gh$ and theirassociated Toda solitons.
