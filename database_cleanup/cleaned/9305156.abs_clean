Starting from the characteristic polynomial for ordinary matrices we give acombinatorial deduction of the Mandelstam identities and viceversa, thusshowing that the two sets of relations are equivalent. We are able to extendthis construction to supermatrices in such a way that we obtain the Mandelstamidentities in this case, once the corresponding characteristic equation isknown.
