We analyze the new states that have recently been discovered in 2D stringtheory by E. Witten and B. Zwiebach. Since the Liouville direction isuncompactified, we show that the deformations by the new ghost number twostates generate equivalent classical solutions of the string fields. We arguethat the new ghost number one states are responsible for generatingtransformations which relate such equivalent solutions. We also discuss thepossible interpretation of higher ghost number states of those kinds.
