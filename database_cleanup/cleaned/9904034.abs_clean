Title: Some Speculations on the Gauge Coupling in the AdS/CFT Approach

Comments: 6 pages, no figures, LaTex. Some minor misprints have been corrected

We propose the principle that the scale of the glueball masses in the AdS/CFTapproach to QCD should be set by the square root of the string tension. It thenturns out that the strong bare coupling runs logarithmically with theultraviolet cutoff T if first order world sheet fluctuations are included. Wealso point out that in the end, when all corrections are included, one shouldobtain an equation for the coupling running with T which has some similaritywith the equation for the strong bare coupling.
