Ahrenshoop Symposium on the Theory of Elementary Particles, Buckow, Germany,September 1997We discuss a scenario of ``the path to physics at the Planck scale'' wheretodays theory of the interactions of elementary particles, the so calledStandard Model (SM), emerges as a low energy effective theory describing thelong distance properties of a sub--observable medium existing at the Planckscale, which we call ``ether''. Properties of the ether can only be observableto the extent that they are relevant to characterize the universality class ofthe totality of systems which exhibit identical low energy behavior. In such apicture the SM must be embedded into a ``Gaussian extended SM'' (GESM), aquantum field theory (QFT) which includes the SM but is extended in such a waythat it exhibits a quasi infrared (IR) stable fixed point in all its couplings.Some phenomenological consequences of such a scenario are discussed.
