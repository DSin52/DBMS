A physical and geometrical interpretation of previously introduced tensoroperator algebras of U(2,2) in terms of algebras of higher-conformal-spinquantum fields on the anti-de Sitter space AdS_5 is provided. These arehigher-dimensional W-like algebras and constitute a potential gauge guideprinciple towards the formulation of induced conformal gravities(Wess-Zumino-Witten-like models) in realistic dimensions. Some remarks onquantum (Moyal) deformations are given and potentially tractable versions ofnoncommutative AdS spaces are also sketched. The role of conformal symmetry inthe microscopic description of Unruh and Hawking's radiation effects isdiscussed.
