We investigate the variation of the string field action under changes of thestring field vertices giving rise to different decompositions of the modulispaces of Riemann surfaces. We establish that any such change in the stringaction arises from a field transformation canonical with respect to theBatalin-Vilkovisky (BV) antibracket, and find the explicit form of thegenerator of the infinitesimal transformations. Two theories using differentdecompositions of moduli space are shown to yield the same gauge fixed actionupon use of different gauge fixing conditions. We also elaborate on recent workon the covariant BV formalism, and emphasize the necessity of a measure in thespace of two dimensional field theories in order to extend a recent analysis ofbackground independence to quantum string field theory.
