We clarify the role of gauge invariance for the theory of an AdS4 braneembedded in AdS5. The presence of a nonvanishing mass parameter even for thelightest KK mode of the graviton indicates that all of the spin-2 modespropagate five polarization states. Despite this fact, it was shown earlierthat the classical theory has a smooth limit as the mass parameter is taken tozero. We argue that locality in the fifth dimension ensures that this propertysurvives at the quantum level.
