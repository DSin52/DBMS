JINR, Dubna, Russia; 8-12 December 1996The (3+d)-dimensional Einstein-Kalb-Ramond theory reduced to two dimensionsis considered. It is shown that the theory allows two different Ernst-like $dHermitian dualized non-target space ones. The O(d, d) symmetry is written in aSL(2,R) matrix-valued form in both cases. The Kramer-Neugebauer transformation,which algebraically maps the non-dualized Ernst potential into the dualizedone, is presented.
