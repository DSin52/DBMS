We introduce a class of supersymmetric cycles in spacetimes of the form AdStimes a sphere or $T^{1,1}$ which can be considered as generalizations of thegiant gravitons. Branes wrapped on these cycles preserve $1\over 2$, $1\over 4$or $1\over 8$ of the supersymmetry. On the CFT side these configurationscorrespond to superpositions of the large number of BPS states.
