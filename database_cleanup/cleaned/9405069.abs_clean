postscript, 1994We argue that string theory should have a formulation for which stability andcausality are evident. Rather than regard strings as fundamental objects, wesuggest they should be regarded as composite systems of more fundamentalpoint-like objects. A tentative scheme for such a reinterpretation is describedalong the lines of 't Hooft's $1/N$ expansion and the light-coneparametrization of the string.
