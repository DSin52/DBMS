We discuss special perturbations of the gauged level $k$ WZNW model inspiredby the $\sigma$-model perturbation of the nonunitary WZNW model. In the large$k$ limit there is a second conformal point in the vicinity of the ultarvioletfixed point. At the second critical point the conformal model has a rationalVirasoro central charge which no longer corresponds to a coset construction. Inspite of this fact the perturbative conformal model appears to be a unitarysystem as long as the underlying coset construction at the ultraviolet criticalpoint is unitary.
