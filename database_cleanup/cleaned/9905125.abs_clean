Due to the non-commutative nature of quaternions we introduce the concept ofleft and right action for quaternionic numbers. This gives the opportunity tomanipulate appropriately the $H$-field. The standard problems arising in thedefinitions of transpose, determinant and trace for quaternionic matrices areovercome. We investigate the possibility to formulate a new approach toQuaternionic Group Theory. Our aim is to highlight the possibility of lookingat new quaternionic groups by the use of left and right operators asfundamental step toward a clear and complete discussion of Unification Theoriesin Physics.
