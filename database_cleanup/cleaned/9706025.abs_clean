We analyze the vector multiplet prepotential of d=4, N=2 type IIAcompactifications. We find that the worldsheet instanton corrections have anatural interpretation as one-loop corrections in five dimensions, with theextra dimension being compactified on a circle of radius $g_{s}\ell_{s}$. Weargue that the relation between spacetime and worldsheet instantons is naturalfrom this point of view. We also discuss the map between the type IIAworldsheet instantons and the spacetime instantons in the heterotic dual.
