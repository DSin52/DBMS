pages, KCL-TH-93-1We review our work on the relation between integrability andinfinite-dimensional algebras. We first consider the question of what sets ofcommuting charges can be constructed from the current of a \mbox{\sf U}(1)Kac-Moody algebra. It emerges that there exists a set $S_n$ of such charges foreach positive integer $n>1$; the corresponding value of the central charge inthe Feigin-Fuchs realization of the stress tensor is $c=13-6n-6/n$. The chargesin each series can be written in terms of the generators of an exceptional\W-algebra. We show that the \W-algebras that arise in this way are symmetriesof Liouville theory for special values of the coupling. We then exhibit arelationship between the \nls equation and the KP hierarchy. From this itfollows that there is a relationship between the \nls equation and the algebra\Wi. These examples provide evidence for our conjecture that the phenomenon ofintegrability is intimately linked with properties of infinite dimensionalalgebras.
