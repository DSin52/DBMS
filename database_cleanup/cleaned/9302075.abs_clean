We present a static solution for $d = 2$ critical string theory including thetachyon $T$ but not its potential $V(T)$. This solution thus incorporatestachyon back reaction and, when $T = 0$, reduces to the black hole solution.When $T \neq 0$ one finds that (1) the Schwarzschild horizon of the above blackhole splits into two, resembling Reissner-Nordstrom horizons and (2) thecurvature scalar develops new singularities at the horizons. These features, aswe argue, will persist even with $V(T)$ present. Some possible methods forremoving these singularities are discussed.
