We critically review the use of the exact renormalization group equations(ERGE) in the framework of the scalar theory. We lay emphasis on the existencethe derivative expansion. The leading order of this expansion appears as anexcellent textbook example to underline the nonperturbative features of theWilson renormalization group theory. We limit ourselves to the consideration ofthe scalar field (this is why it is an introductory review) but the reader willfind (at the end of the review) a set of references to existing studies on morecomplex systems.
