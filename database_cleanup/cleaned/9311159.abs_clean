Title: Effective action for high energy scattering in QCD

Comments: based on joint work with L.N. Lipatov and L. Szymanowski, 5 pages,

Latex, 1 figure uses package FEYNMANThe effective action for the multi-Regge asymptotics is considered as a firststep in calculating the unitarity correction to the perturbative pomeron. Itcan be derived from the original QCD action by intgrating out certain modes ofthe fields in the functional integral. The derivation is described for the casewithout fermions.
