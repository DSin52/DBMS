We study the equivalence between a nonlinear self-dual model (NSD) with theBorn-Infeld-Chern-Simons (BICS) models using an iterative gauge embeddingprocedure that produces the duality mapping, including the case where the NSDmodel is minimally coupled to dynamical, U(1) charged fermionic matter. Theduality mapping introduces a current-current interaction term while at the sametime the minimal coupling of the original nonlinear self-dual model is replacedby a non-minimal magnetic like coupling in the BICS side.
