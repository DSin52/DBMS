The Hamiltonian BRST quantization of the null spinning string for differentnumber of supersymmetries is given. A null spinning string with manifestspace-time conformal invariance is constructed. Its Brst quantization givesnegative critical dimension for $N\neq 0$ and reproduces previous results for$N=0$.
