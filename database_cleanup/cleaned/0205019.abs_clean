The Ekpyrotic scenario assumes that our visible Universe is a boundary branein a five-dimensional bulk and that the hot Big Bang occurs when a nearlysupersymmetric five-brane travelling along the fifth dimension collides withour visible brane. We show that the generation of isocurvature perturbations isa generic prediction of the Ekpyrotic Universe. This is due to the interactionsin the kinetic terms between the brane modulus parametrizing the position ofthe five-brane in the bulk and the dilaton and volume moduli. We show how toseparate explicitly the adiabatic and isorcuvature modes by performing arotation in field space. Our results indicate that adiabatic and isocurvaturepertubations might be cross-correlated and that curvature perturbations mightbe entirely seeded by isocurvature perturbations.
