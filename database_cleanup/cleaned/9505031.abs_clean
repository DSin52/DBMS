We apply the time-dependent variational principle of Balian and V\'en\'eronito the $ \Phi^4$ theory. An appropriate parametrization for the variationalobjects allows us to write coupled dynamical equations from which we deriveapproximations for the two-time correlation functions involving two, three orfour field operators.
