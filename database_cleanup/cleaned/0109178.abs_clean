A discrete total variation calculus with variable time steps is presented inthis letter. Using this discrete variation calculus, we generalize Lee'sdiscrete mechanics and derive variational symplectic-energy-momentumintegrators by Kane, Marsden and Ortiz. The relationship among discrete totalvariation, Lee's discrete mechanics and Kane-Marsden-Ortiz's integrators isexplored.
