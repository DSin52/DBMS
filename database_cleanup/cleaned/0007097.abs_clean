We study the classical geometry produced by a stack of stable (i.e. tachyonfree) non-BPS D-branes present in K3 compactifications of type II stringtheory. This classical representation is derived by solving the equations ofmotion describing the low-energy dynamics of the supergravity fields whichcouple to the non-BPS state. Differently from what expected, this configurationsingularity. This fact suggests that the simplest setting, namely a set ofcoinciding non-interacting D-branes, is not acceptable. We finally discuss thepossible existence of other acceptable configurations corresponding to morecomplicated bound states of these non-BPS branes.
