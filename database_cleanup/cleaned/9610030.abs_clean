We study charge k SU(2) BPS monopoles which are symmetric under the cyclicgroup of order k. Approximate twistor data (spectral curves and Nahm data) isconstructed using a new technique based upon a Painleve analysis of Nahm'sequation around a pole. With this data both analytical and numericalapproximate ADHMN constructions are performed to study the zeros of the Higgsfield and the monopole energy densities. The results describe, via the modulispace approximation, a novel type of low energy k monopole scattering.
