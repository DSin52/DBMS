Title: Supersymmetric Gauge Theories and Gravitational Instantons

Authors: Sergey A. Cherkis (Cal Tech)

Comments: 4pp. Talk given at 6th International Symposium on Particles, Strings

and Cosmology (PASCOS 98), Boston, MA, 22-27 Mar 1998Various string theory realizations of three-dimensional gauge theories relatethem to gravitational instantons, Nahm equations and monopoles. We use thiscorrespondence to model self-dual gravitational instantons of $D_k$-type asmoduli spaces of singular monopoles, find their twistor spaces and metrics.
