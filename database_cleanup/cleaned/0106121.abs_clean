Open Wilson line operators and generalized star product have been studiedextensively in noncommutative gauge theories. We show that they also show up innoncommutative scalar field theories as universal structures. We first pointout that dipole picture of noncommutative geometry provides an intuitiveargument for robustness of the open Wilson lines and generalized star productstherein. We calculate one-loop effective action of noncommutative scalar fieldtheory with cubic self-interaction and show explicitly that the generalizedstar products arise in the nonplanar part. It is shown that, at low-energy,large noncommutativity limit, the nonplanar part is expressible solely in termsof the {\sl scalar} open Wilson line operator and descendants.
