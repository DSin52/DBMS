For any manifold $M$, we introduce a $\ZZ $-graded differential algebra$\Xi$, which, in particular, is a bi-module over the associative algebra$C(M\cup M)$. We then introduce the corresponding covariant differentials andshow how this construction can be interpreted in terms of Yang-Mills and Higgsfields. This is a particular example of noncommutative geometry. It differsdoes not rely on a given Dirac-Yukawa operator acting on a space of spinors.
