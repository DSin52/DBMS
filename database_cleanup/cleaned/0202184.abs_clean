Solutions of D=7 maximal gauged supergravity are constructed with metricsthat are a product of a n-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, withn=2,3,4,5, and certain Einstein manifolds. The gauge fields have the same formas in the recently constructed solutions describing the near-horizon limits ofM5-branes wrapping supersymmetric cycles. The new solutions do not preserve anysupersymmetry and can be uplifted to obtain new solutions of D=11 supergravity,which are warped and twisted products of the D=7 metric with a squashedfour-sphere. Some aspects of the stability of the solutions are discussed.
