There are now in the literature two proposals of relativity theories withhere call "DSR1", proposed by Amelino-Camelia in gr-qc/0012051,hep-th/0012238and one, which we here call "DSR2", proposed by Magueijo and Smolin inhep-th/0112090. We argue that a key aspect of such theories are the kinematicalconditions for particle production in collision processes. We derive thesekinematical conditions for DSR2, which was originally formulated only in theone-particle sector. This result is then used to characterize the differencesbetween the two proposals; in particular, we find that, while experiments suchas AMS and GLAST can test some of the predictions of DSR1, the effectspredicted by DSR2 are much weaker and none of them should be testable in theforeseeable future. We also show that if one interprets, as done inhep-th/0112090, the DSR2-boost parameter $v$ as the relative velocity betweenthe observers connected by the boost one is then forced to give up the"Hamiltonian" relation $v_{particle} =dE/dp$ between the speed of a particleand its momentum. We argue that, adopting an accordingly modifiedinterpretation of the DSR2-boost parameter $v$, one can maintain the relation$v_{particle} =dE/dp$ in DSR2.
