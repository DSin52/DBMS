The particular model of d5 higher derivative gravity which is dual to ${\calN}=2$ $Sp(N)$ SCFT is considered. A (perturbative) AdS black hole in suchtheory is constructed in the next-to-leading order of the AdS/CFTcorrespondence. The surface counterterms are fixed by the conditions requiredfor a well-defined variational procedure and the finiteness of AdS space (whenthe brane goes to infinity). A dynamical brane is realized at the boundary ofan AdS black hole with a radius that is larger than the horizon radius. TheAdS/CFT correspondence dictates the parameters of the gravitational dual insuch a way that the dynamical brane (the observable universe) always occursoutside the horizon.
