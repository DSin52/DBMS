Journal-ref: JHEP 0001 (2000) 018

Via T-duality, a stack of unwrapped type 0 NS5-branes is transformed into aKaluza-Klein monopole with A_n type singularity at its center. The spectrum oftwisted modes at the singularity contains tachyonic modes. We show that, incertain parameter region, this tachyonic spectrum is completely reproduced asmodes of the bulk tachyon field localized on a classical NS5-brane solution. Inpassing, we show how twisted modes at the singularity reproduce gauge fields onstacks of NS5-branes.
