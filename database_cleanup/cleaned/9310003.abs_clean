General covariance in quantum gravity is seen once one integrates over allpossible metrics. In recent years topological field theories have given us adifferent route to general covariance without integrating over all possiblemetrics. Here we argue that Einstein quantum gravity may be viewed as atopological field theory provided a certain constrant from the path integralmeasure is satisfied.
