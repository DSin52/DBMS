The quantum Wess-Zumino-Witten $\to$ Liouville reduction is formulated usingthe phase space path integral method of Batalin, Fradkin, and Vilkovisky,adapted to theories on compact two dimensional manifolds. The importance of thezero modes of the Lagrange multipliers in producing the Liouville potential andthe WZW anomaly, and in proving gauge invariance, is emphasised. A previousproblem concerning the gauge dependence of the Virasoro centre is solved.
