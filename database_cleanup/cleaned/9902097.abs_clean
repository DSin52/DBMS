Authors: G. Veneziano

Comments: Latex file, 17 pages, 5 figures, Based on two recent talks,

References updatedClassical and quantum gravitational instabilities, can, respectively, inflateand warm up a primordial Universe satisfying a superstring-motivated principleof "Asymptotic Past Triviality". A physically viable big bang is thus generatedwithout invoking either large fine-tunings or a long period of post-big banginflation. Properties of the pre-bangian Universe can be probed through itsgravitational-wave background; ii) a (possible) new mechanism for seeding thegalactic magnetic fields; iii) a (possible) new source of large-scale structureand CMB anisotropy.
