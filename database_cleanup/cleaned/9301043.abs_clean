We use mirror symmetry to establish the first concrete arena of spacetimetopology change in string theory. In particular, we establish that the{\it quantum theories\/} based on certain nonlinear sigma models withtopologically distinct target spaces can be smoothly connected even thoughclassically a physical singularity would be encountered.  We accomplish thisby rephrasing the description of these nonlinear sigma models in terms of theirmirror manifold partners---a description in which the full quantum theory canbe described exactly using lowest order geometrical methods.We establish that, for the known class of mirror manifolds, the moduli spaceof the corresponding conformal field theory requires not just two but{\it numerous\/}  topologically distinct Calabi-Yau manifolds for its geometricinterpretation.  A {\it single\/} family of continuously connected conformaltheories thereby probes a host of topologically distinct geometrical spacesgiving rise to {\it multiple mirror manifolds}.
