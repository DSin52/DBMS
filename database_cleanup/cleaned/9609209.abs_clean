We study strong coupling effects in four-dimensional heterotic string modelswhere supersymmetry is spontaneously broken with large internal dimensions,consistently with perturbative unification of gauge couplings. These effectsM-theory. In the case of one large dimension, we find that these thresholdsappear close to the field-theoretical unification scale $\sim 10^{16}$ GeV,offering an appealing scenario for unification of gravitational and gaugeinteractions. We also identify the inverse size of the eleventh dimension ofM-theory with the energy at which four-fermion effective operators becomeimportant.
