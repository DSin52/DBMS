We study the system of the Dp'-brane with Dp-brane (p<p') inside, in the casewhere B_{ij} field is a nonvanishing constant. In order to understand how theDp-brane is viewed from the Dp'-brane worldvolume theory, we investigate theprocess in which the Dp-brane is probed with p'-p' open string. We calculatethe scattering amplitudes among p-p' open strings and p'-p' open strings andshow that not only the Weyl transform of the projection operator onto theground state but also those onto higher excited states emerge as multiplicativefactors of the amplitudes.
