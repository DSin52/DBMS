We propose a new version of the superfield action for a closed D=10, N=1superstring where the Lorentz harmonics are used as auxiliary superfields. Theincorporation of Lorentz harmonics into the superfield action makes possible toobtain superfield constraints of the induced worldsheet supergravity asequations of motion. Moreover, it becomes evident that a so-called 'Wess-Zuminopart' of the superfield action is basically a Lagrangian form of thegeneralized action principle. We propose to use the second Noether theorem tohandle the essential terms in the transformation lows of hidden gaugesymmetries, which remove dynamical degrees of freedom from the Lagrangemultiplier superfield.
