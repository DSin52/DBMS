Title: New modular representations and fusion algebras from quantized SL(2,R)

Chern-Simons theoryComments: 17 pages

We consider the quantum-mechanical algebra of observables generated bycanonical quantization of $SL(2,R)$ Chern-Simons theory with rational charge ona space manifold with torus topology. We produce modular representationsgeneralizing the representations associated to the $SU(2)$ WZW models and weexhibit the explicit polynomial representations of the corresponding fusionalgebras. The relation to Kac-Wakimoto characters of highest weight$\widehat{sl}(2)$ representations with rational level is illustrated.
