of UnityAuthors: Daniel Arnaudon

Comments: 13 pages. This is a contribution to the Vth Conference on

Mathematical Physics, Edirne, Turkey 15-22 Dec. 1991We recall the classification of the irreducible representations of $SL(2)_q$,and then give fusion rules for these representations. We also consider theproblem of $\cR$-matrices, intertwiners of the differently ordered tensorproducts of these representations, and satisfying altogether Yang--Baxterequations.
