Title: Towards Covariant Matrix Theory

Authors: Djordje Minic

Comments: LaTeX, 9 pages; talk given at the Fradkin Memorial Conference,

Moscow, June 2000We review an approach towards a covariant formulation of Matrix theory basedon a discretization of the 11d membrane. Higher dimensional algebraicstructures, such as the quantum triple Nambu bracket, naturally appear in thisapproach. We also discuss a novel geometric understanding of the space-timeuncertainty relation which points towards a more geometric formulation ofMatrix theory.
