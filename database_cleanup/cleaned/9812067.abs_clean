We analyze short and long multiplets which appear in the OPE expansion of``chiral'' primary operators in N=4 Super Yang--Mills theory. Among them,higher spin long and new short multiplets appear, having the interpretation, inthe AdS/CFT correspondence, of string states and supergravity multiparticlestates respectively. We also analyze the decomposition of long multiplets underN=1 supersymmetry, as a possible tool to explore other supersymmetricdeformations of IIB string on AdS_5 x S_5.
