We construct N=1 supersymmetric versions of four-dimensionalFreedman-Townsend models and generalizations thereof found recently by Henneauxand Knaepen, with couplings between 1-form and 2-form gauge potentials. Themodels are presented both in a superfield formulation with linearly realizedsupersymmetry and in WZ gauged component form. In the latter formulation thesupersymmetry transformations are nonlinear and do not commute with all thegauge transformations. Among others, our construction yields N=1 counterpartsof recently found N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories involving vector-tensormultiplets with gauged central charge.
