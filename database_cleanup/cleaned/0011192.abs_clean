Without recourse to the sophisticated machinery of twisted group algebras,projective character tables and explicit values of 2-cocycles, we here presenta simple algorithm to study the gauge theory data of D-brane probes on ageneric orbifold G with discrete torsion turned on. We show in particular thatthe gauge theory can be obtained with the knowledge of no more than theordinary character tables of G and its covering group G*. Subsequently wepresent the quiver diagrams of certain illustrative examples of SU(3)-orbifoldswhich have non-trivial Schur Multipliers. The paper serves as a companion tocomputationally convenient study of discrete torsion.
