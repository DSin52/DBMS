We discuss a systematic way to dimensionally regularize divergent sumsarising in field theories with an arbitrary number of physical compactdimensions or finite temperature. The method preserves the same symmetries ofthe action as the conventional dimensional regularization and allows an easyseparation of the regulated divergence from the finite term that depends on thecompactification radius (temperature).
