Title: Chiral solitons from dimensional reduction of Chern-Simons gauged

coupled non-linear Schr\"{o}dinger modelComments: 13 pages, LaTeX

The soliton structure of a gauge theory proposed to describe chiralexcitations in the multi-Layer Fractional Quantum Hall Effect is investigated.A new type of derivative multi-component nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equationemerges as effective description of the system that supports novel chiralsolitons. We discuss the classical properties of the solutions and studyrelations to integrable systems.
