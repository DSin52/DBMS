It has been proposed that the geometry of an extra dimension couldautomatically adjust itself to compensate for an arbitrary energy density onthe 3-D brane which we are presumed to inhabit, such that a static solution toEinstein's equation results. This would solve the long-standing cosmologicalconstant problem, of why our universe is not overwhelmed by the enormous energyof the quantum vacuum fluctuations predicted by quantum field theory. I willreview some of the attempts along these lines, and present a no-go theoremshowing that these attempts are doomed, at least within one of the mostpromising classes of models.
