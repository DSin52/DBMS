The $N\to\infty$ limit of the edges of finite planar electron densities isdiscussed for higher Landau levels. For full filling, the particle number iscorrelated with the magnetic flux, and hence with the boundary location, makingthe $N\to\infty$ limit more subtle at the edges than in the bulk. In the$n^{\rm th}$ Landau level, the density exhibits $n$ distinct steps at the edge,in both circular and rectangular samples. The boundary characteristics forindividual Landau levels, and for successively filled Landau levels, arecomputed in an asymptotic expansion.
