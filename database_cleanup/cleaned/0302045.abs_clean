Title: Topological Q-Solitons

Authors: R. S. Ward

Comments: 12 pages, 2 figures

Static topologically-nontrivial configurations in sigma-models, for spatialdimension D \geq 2, are unstable. The question addressed here is whether suchsigma-model solitons can be stabilized by steady rotation in internal space;that is, rotation in a global SO(2) symmetry. This is the mechanism whichstabilizes Q-balls (non-topological solitons). The conclusion is that theQ-mechanism can stabilize topological solitons in D=2 spatial dimensions, butnot for D=3.
