We derive the supersymmetric collective field theory for the Marinari-Parisimodel. For a specific choice of the superpotential, to leading order we find aone parameter family of ground states which can be connected via instantons. Atthis level of analysis the instanton size implied by the underlying matrixmodel does not appear.
