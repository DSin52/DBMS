We reveal a novel mathematical structure in physical observables, the mass oftachyon fluctuation mode and the energy density, associated with a classicalsolution of vacuum string field theory constructed previously [hep-th/0108150].We find that they are expressed in terms of quantities which apparently vanishidentically due to twist even-odd degeneracy of eigenvalues of a Neumanncoefficient matrix defining the three-string interactions. However, they cangive non-vanishing values because of the breakdown of the degeneracy at theedge of the eigenvalue distribution. We also present a general prescription ofcorrectly simplifying the expressions of these observables. Numericalcalculation of the energy density following our prescription indicates that thepresent classical solution represents the configuration of two D25-branes.
