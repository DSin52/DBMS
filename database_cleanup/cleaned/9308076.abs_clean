The equivalence between the covariant and the non-covariant version of aconstrained system is shown to hold after quantization in the framework of thefield-antifield formalism. Our study covers the cases of Electromagnetism andYang-Mills fields and sheds light on some aspects of the Faddeev-Popov method,for both the coratiant and non-covariant approaches, which had not been fullyclarified in the literature.
