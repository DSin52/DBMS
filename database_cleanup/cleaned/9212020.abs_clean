Non-extreme walls (bubbles with two insides) and ultra-extreme walls (bubblesof false vacuum decay) are discussed. Their respective energy densities arehigher and lower than that of the corresponding extreme (supersymmetric),planar domain wall. These singularity free space-times exhibit non-trivialcausal structure analogous to certain non-extreme black holes. We focus onanti-de~Sitter--Minkowski walls and comment on Minkowski--Minkowski walls withtrivial extreme limit, as well as walls adjacent to de~Sitter space-times withno extreme limit.
