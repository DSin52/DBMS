Title: Very Extended $E_8$ and $A_8$ at low levels, Gravity and Supergravity

Authors: P. West

Comments: 16 pages, plain tex (equation 3.3 modified and one reference

expanded)We define a level for a large class of Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras. Usingthis we find the representation content of very extended $A_{D-3}$ and $E_8$(i.e. $E_{11}$) at low levels in terms of $A_{D-1}$ and $A_{10}$representations respectively. The results are consistent with the conjecturedvery extended $A_8$ and $E_{11}$ symmetries of gravity and maximal supergravitytheories given respectively in hep-th/0104081 and hep-th/0107209. We explainhow these results provided further evidence for these conjectures.
