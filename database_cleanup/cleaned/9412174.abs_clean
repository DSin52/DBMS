Title: Zero-mode, Winding Number and Quantization of Abelian Sigma Model in

(1+1) DimensionsComments: Latex 31 pages. Three helpful, but not essential, figures can be

obtained from the authorWe consider the $ U(1) $ sigma model in the two dimensional space-time whichis a field-theoretical model possessing a nontrivial topology. It is pointedout that its topological structure is characterized by the zero-mode and thewinding number. A new type of commutation relations is proposed to quantize themodel respecting the topological nature. Hilbert spaces are constructed to berepresentation spaces of quantum operators. It is shown that there are aninfinite number of inequivalent representations as a consequence of thenontrivial topology. The algebra generated by quantum operators is deformed bythe central extension. When the central extension is introduced, it is shownthat the zero-mode variables and the winding variables obey a new commutationrelation, which we call twist relation. In addition, it is shown that thecentral extension makes momenta operators obey anomalous commutators. Wedemonstrate that topology enriches the structure of quantum field theories.
