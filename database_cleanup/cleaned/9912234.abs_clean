The SU(2) Skyrme model,expanding in the collective coordinates variables,gives rise to second-class constraints. Recently this system was embedded in amore general Abelian gauge theory using the BFFT Hamiltonian method. In thiswork we quantize this gauge theory computing the Noether current anomaly usingthe non-local BV quantization coupled with the Fujikawa regularizationprocedure.
