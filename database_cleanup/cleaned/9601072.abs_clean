We study realizations of the exceptional non-linear (quadratically generated,or W-type) N=8 and N=7 superconformal algebras with Spin(7) and G_2 affinesymmetry currents, respectively. Both the N=8 and N=7 algebras admit unitaryhighest-weight representations in terms of a single boson and free fermions in8 of Spin(7) and 7 of G_2, with the central charges c_8=26/5 and c_7=5,respectively. Furthermore, we show that the general coset Ans"atze for the N=8and N=7 algebras naturally lead to the coset spaces SO(8)xU(1)/SO(7) andSO(7)xU(1)/G_2, respectively, as the additional consistent solutions forcertain values of the central charge. The coset space SO(8)/SO(7) is theseven-sphere S^7, whereas the space SO(7)/G_2 represents the seven-sphere withtorsion, S^7_T. The division algebra of octonions and the associated trialityproperties of SO(8) play an essential role in all these realizations. We alsocomment on some possible applications of our results to string theory.
