If the gravitino is light and all the other supersymmetric particles areheavy, we can consider the effective theory describing the interactions of itsgoldstino components with ordinary matter. To discuss the model-dependence ofthese interactions, we take the simple case of spontaneously brokensupersymmetry and only two chiral superfields, associated with the goldstinoand a massless matter fermion. We derive the four-point effective couplinginvolving two matter fermions and two goldstinos, by explicit integration ofthe heavy spin-0 degrees of freedom in the low-energy limit. Surprisingly, ourresult is not equivalent to the usual non-linear realization of supersymmetry,where a pair of goldstinos couples to the energy-momentum tensor of the matterfields. We solve the puzzle by enlarging the non-linear realization to includea second independent invariant coupling, and we show that there are no otherindependent couplings of this type up to this order in the low-energyexpansion. We conclude by commenting on the interpretation of our results andon their possible phenomenological implications.
