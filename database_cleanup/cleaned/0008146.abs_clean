We study the issue of defining the discrete light-cone quantization (DLCQ) inperturbative string theory as a light-like limit. While this limit isunproblematic at the classical level, it is non-trivial at the quantum leveldue to the divergences by the zero-mode loops. We reconsider this problem inbosonic string theory. We construct the multi-loop scattering amplitudes inboth open and closed string theories by using the method of Kikkawa, Sakita andVirasoro (KSV), and then we show that these scattering amplitudes are perfectlywell-defined in this limit. We also discuss the vacuum amplitudes of the stringtheory. They are, however, ill-defined in the light-like limit due to thezero-mode loop divergences, and hence we want supersymmetry to cure thosepathological divergences even in string theory.
