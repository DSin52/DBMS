We study the cosmological solutions of the two-dimensional Brans-Dickeequations considering a gas of $c=1$ strings in $S^{1}\times \mbox{\bf R}$ asthe source of the gravitational field. We also study the implications of the$R$-duality invariance on the solutions. To this purpose we conjecture that, asit happens for massless fields in finite boxes, the free energy of a gas ofmassless string excitations is not given by the corresponding toroidalcompactification.
