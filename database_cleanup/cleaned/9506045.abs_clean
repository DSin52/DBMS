Title: DILATON-DRIVEN INFLATION IN STRING COSMOLOGY

Comments: 11 pages, latex, 1 figure icluded as an epsf file

I present an outline for cosmological evolution in the framework of stringtheory with emphasis on a phase of dilaton-driven kinetic inflation. It isshown that a typical background of stochastic gravitational radiation isgenerated, with strength that may allow its detection in future gravity waveexperiments.
