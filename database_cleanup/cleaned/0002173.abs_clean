Comments: typos corrected, talk given at the VI International Wigner Symposium,

Istambul, Turkey, 16-22 August,1999A general construction of affine Non Abelian Toda models in terms of gaugedtwo loop WZNW model is discussed. In particular we find theLie algebraic condition defining a subclass of {\it T-selfdual torsionless NAToda models} and their zero curvature representation.
