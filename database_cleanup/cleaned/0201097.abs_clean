presented at the Second Meeting on CPT and Lorentz Symmetry, Bloomington, IN,August 2001The proof of one-loop renormalizability of the general Lorentz- andCPT-violating extension of quantum electrodynamics is described. Application ofthe renormalization-group method is discussed and implications for theory andexperiment are considered.
