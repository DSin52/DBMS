We investigate the light-cone quantization of $\phi^3$ theory in 1+1dimensions with a regularization of discretized light-cone momentum $k^+$.Solving a second-class constraint associated with the $k^+=0$ mode, we showthat the $k^+=0$ mode propagates along the internal lines of Feynman diagramsin any order of perturbation, hence our theory recovers the Lorentz invariance.
