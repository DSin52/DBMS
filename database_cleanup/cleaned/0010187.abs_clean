We construct a star product associated with an arbitrary two dimensionalPoisson structure using generalized coherent states on the complex plane. Fromour approach one easily recovers the star product for the fuzzy torus, and alsoone for the fuzzy sphere. For the latter we need to define the `fuzzy'stereographic projection to the plane and the fuzzy sphere integration measure,which in the commutative limit reduce to the usual formulae for the sphere.
