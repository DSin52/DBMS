Twisted sectors --solutions to the equations of motion with non-trivialmonodromies-- of three dimensional Euclidean gravity are studied. We argue thatupon quantization this new sector of the theory provides the necessary (and nomore) degrees of freedom to account for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
