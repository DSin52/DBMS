We study Abelian generalized deformations of the usual product of polynomialsintroduced in hep-th/9602016. We construct an explicit example for the case of$su/2$ which provides a tentative of a quantum-mechanical descriptionof Nambu Mechanics on $R^3$. By introducing the notions of strong andweak triviality of generalized deformations, we show that the Zariski productis never trivial in either sense, while the example constructed here in aquantum-mechanical context is only strongly non-trivial.
