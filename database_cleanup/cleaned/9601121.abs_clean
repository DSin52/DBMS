A tensor product generalisation of $B\wedge F$ theories is proposed to give aBogomol'nyi structure. Non-singular, stable, finite-energy particle-likesolutions to the Bogomol'nyi equations are studied. Unlike Yang-Mills(-Higgs)theory, the Bogomol'nyi structure does not appear as a perfect square in theLagrangian. Consequently, the Bogomol'nyi energy can be obtained in more thanone way. The added flexibility permits electric monopole solutions to the fieldequations.
