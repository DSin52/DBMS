Any regular quantum mechanical system may be cast into an abelian gaugetheory by simply reformulating it as a reparametrization invariant theory. Wepresent a detailed study of the BRST quantization of such reparametrizationinvariant theories within a precise operator version of BRST. The treatmentelucidates several intricate aspects of the BRST quantization ofreparametrization invariant theories like the appearance of physical time. Wepropose general rules for how physical wave functions and physical propagatorsare to be projected from the BRST singlets and propagators in the ghostextended BRST theory. These projections are performed by boundary conditionswhich are precisely specified by the operator BRST. We demonstrate explicitlythe validity of these rules for the considered class of models. Thecorresponding path integrals are worked out explicitly and compared with theconventional BFV path integral formulation.
