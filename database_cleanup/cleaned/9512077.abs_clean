Title: Branes within Branes

Comments: harvmac, 10 pp. (References added)

We discuss a set of universal couplings between superstring Ramond-Ramondgauge fields and the gauge fields internal to D-branes, with emphasis on theirtopological consequences, and argue that instanton solutions in these internaltheories are equivalent to D-branes. A particular example is the Dirichlet5-brane in type I theory, which Witten recently showed is the zero size limitof an SO(32) instanton. Its effective world-volume theory is an Sp(1) gaugetheory, unbroken in the zero size limit. We show that the zero size limit of aninstanton in this theory is a 1-brane, which can be described as a bound stateof the Dirichlet 1-brane with the 5-brane. Considering several 1 and 5-branesprovides a description of moduli spaces of Sp(N) instantons, and a type IIgeneralization is given which should describe U(N) instantons.
