We consider Randall-Sundrum(RS) model in generalized gravities and see thatthe localization of gravity happens in generic situations though itseffectiveness depends on the details of the configuration. It is shown that RSpicture is robust against quantum gravity corrections ($\phi \R$) as long asthe correction is reasonably small. We extend our consideration to the model ofscalar(dilaton) coupled gravity which leads us to the specific comparisonbetween RS model and inflation models. The exponential and power law hierarchyin RS model are shown to correspond to the exponential and power law inflationrespectively.
