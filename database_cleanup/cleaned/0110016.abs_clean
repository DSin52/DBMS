The Hamiltonian reduction of classical SU(2) Yang-Mills field theory to theequivalent unconstrained theory of gauge invariant local dynamical variables isgeneralized to the case of nonvanishing theta angle. It is shown that for anytheta angle the elimination of the pure gauge degrees of freedom leads to acorresponding unconstrained nonlocal theory of self-interacting second ranksymmetric tensor fields, and that the obtained classical unconstrainedgluodynamics with different theta angles are canonically equivalent as on theoriginal constrained level.
