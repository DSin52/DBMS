Aspects of superstring cosmology are reviewed with an emphasis on thecosmological implications of duality symmetries in the theory. The stringeffective actions are summarized and toroidal compactification to fourdimensions reviewed. Global symmetries that arise in the compactification arediscussed and the duality relationships between the string effective actionsare then highlighted. Higher-dimensional Kasner cosmologies are presented andinterpreted in both string and Einstein frames, and then given in dimensionallyreduced forms. String cosmologies containing both non-trivialNeveu-Schwarz/Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond-Ramond fields are derived by employingthe global symmetries of the effective actions. Anisotropic and inhomogeneouscosmologies in four-dimensions are also developed. The review concludes with adetailed analysis of the pre-big bang inflationary scenario. The generation ofprimordial spectra of cosmological perturbations in such a scenario isdiscussed. Possible future directions offered in the Horava-Witten theory areoutlined.
