I study the large-N reduction a la Eguchi--Kawai in the Kazakov--Migdallattice gauge model. I show that both quenching and twisting prescriptions leadto the coordinate-independent master field. I discuss properties of loopaverages in reduced as well as unreduced models and demonstrate those coincidein the large mass expansion. I derive loop equations for the Kazakov--Migdalmodel at large N and show they are reduced for the quadratic potential to aclosed set of two equations. I find an exact strong coupling solution of theseequations for any D and extend the result to a more general interactingpotential.
