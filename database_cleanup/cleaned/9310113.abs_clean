Int. Conf. in Beer Sheva, March 1993), LaTeX, 25 pages, BGU-93/22/October-PH(added discussion of generalized Miura transformation for multi-boson KPhierarchies)This is mainly a brief review of some key achievements in a `hot'' area oftheoretical and mathematical physics. The principal aim is to outline the basicstructures underlying {\em integrable} quantum field theory models with {\eminfinite-dimensional} symmetry groups which display a radically new type of{\em quantum group} symmetries. Certain particular aspects are elaborated uponreductions appearing in matrix models of strings; Hamiltonian approach toLie-Poisson symmetries; quantum field theory approach to two-dimensionalrelativistic integrable models with dynamically broken conformal invariance.All field-theoretic models in question are of primary relevance to diversebranches of physics ranging from nonlinear hydrodynamics to string theory offundamental particle interactions at ultra-high energies.
