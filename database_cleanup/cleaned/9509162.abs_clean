The exact solution of $N=2$ supersymmetric $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory isstudied in the framework of the Whitham hierarchies. The solution is identifiedwith a homogeneous solution of a Whitham hierarchy. This integrable hierarchy(Whitham-Toda hierarchy) describes modulation of a quasi-periodic solution ofthe (generalized) Toda lattice hierarchy associated with the hyperellipticcurves over the quantum moduli space. The relation between the holomorphicpre-potential of the low energy effective action and the $\tau$ function of the(generalized) Toda lattice hierarchy is also clarified.
