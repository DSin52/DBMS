Title: Noncommutative Tachyons And String Field Theory

Authors: E. Witten

Comments: 10 pp

It has been shown recently that by turning on a large noncommutativityparameter, the description of tachyon condensation in string theory can bedrastically simplified. We reconsider these issues from the standpoint ofstring field theory, showing that, from this point of view, the key fact isthat in the limit of a large B-field, the string field algebra factors as theproduct of an algebra that acts on the string center of mass only and analgebra that acts on all other degrees of freedom carried by the string.
