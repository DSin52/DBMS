We discuss the limitations on space time measurement in the Schwarzchildmetric. We find that near the horizon the limitations on space time measurementare of the order of the black hole radius. We suggest that it indicates that alarge mass black hole cannot be described by means of local field theory evenat macroscopic distances and that any attempt to describe black hole formationand evaporation by means of an effective local field theory will necessarilylead to information loss. We also present a new interpretation of the blackhole entropy which leads to $S=cA$ , where $c$ is a constant of order $1$ whichdoes not depend on the number of fields.
