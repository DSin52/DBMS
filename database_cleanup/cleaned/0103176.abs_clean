We suggest that trialgebraic symmetries migth be a sensible starting pointfor a notion of integrability for two dimensional spin systems. For a simpletrialgebraic symmetry we give an explicit condition in terms of matrices whicha Hamiltonian realizing such a symmetry has to satisfy and give an example ofsuch a Hamiltonian which realizes a trialgebra recently given by the authors inanother paper. Besides this, we also show that the same trialgebra can berealized on a kind of Fock space of q-oscillators, i.e. the suggestedintegrability concept gets via this symmetry a close connection to a kind ofnoncommutative quantum field theory, paralleling the relation between theintegrability of spin chains and two dimensional conformal field theory.
