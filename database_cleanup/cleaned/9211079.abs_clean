(Lecture at the workshop "Basic Problems in String Theory", Yukawa Institutefor Theoretical Physics, Kyoto, October 19-21) In this talk, we first reviewthe possibility of matrix models toward a nonperturbative (critical) stringtheory. We then discuss whether the $c=1$ matrix model can describe the blackhole solution of 2D critical string theory. We show that there exists a classof integral transformations which send the Virasoro condition for the tachyonfield around the 2D black hole to that around the linear dilaton vacuum. Inparticular, we construct an explicit integral formula wihich describes acontinuous deformation of the linear dilaton vacuum to the black holebackground.
