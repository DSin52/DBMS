references added in the discussionNoncommutative Chern-Simons theory can be classically mapped to commutativeChern-Simons theory by the Seiberg-Witten map. We provide evidence that theequivalence persists at the quantum level by computing two and three-pointfunctions of field strengths on the commutative side and their Seiberg-Wittentransforms on the noncommutative side to the first nontrivial order inperturbation theory.
