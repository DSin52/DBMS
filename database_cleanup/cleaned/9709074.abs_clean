Scalar fields at finite temperature are considered in four dimensionalultrastatic curved spacetime. One loop nonlocal effective action at finitetemperature is found up to the second order in curvature expansion. This actionis explicitly infrared finite. In the high temperature expansion of freeenergy, essentially nonlocal terms linear in temperature are derived.
