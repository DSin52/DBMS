Title: The Quantum Hall Fluid and Non-Commutative Chern Simons Theory

Authors: L. Susskind (Stanford U.)

Comments: 25 pages, references added, quasiparticle solutions given for

arbitrary filling fractionThe first part of this paper is a review of the author's work with S. Bahcallwhich gave an elementary derivation of the Chern Simons description of theQuantum Hall effect for filling fraction $1/n$. The notation has beenmodernized to conform with standard gauge theory conventions.In the second part arguments are given to support the claim that abeliannon-commutative Chern Simons theory at level $n$ is exactly equivalent to theLaughlin theory at filling fraction $1/n$. The theory may also be formulated asa matrix theory similar to that describing D0-branes in string theory. Finallyit can also be thought of as the quantum theory of mappings between twonon-commutative spaces, the first being the target space and the second beingthe base space.
