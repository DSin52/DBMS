appear in the proceedings of the 1997 Cargese Summer School "Strings, Branesand Dualities", May 26-June 14, 1997We discuss an alternative form of the supersymmetric D-$p$-brane action whichis quadratic in derivatives of $X$ and linear in $F_{\mu \nu}$. This actioninvolves an auxiliary worldvolume tensor and generalises the simplification ofthe Nambu-Goto action for $p$-branes using a symmetric metric. When theworldvolume gauge field is abelian, it appears as a Lagrange multiplier, andsolving the constraint gives the dual form of the ($p+1$)-dimensional actionwith a $p-2$ form gauge field instead of a vector gauge field. This isillustrated by the example of the dual D-2-brane action, for which the knownresult is recovered.
