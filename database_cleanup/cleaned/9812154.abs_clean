Title: On Heterotic/Type I Duality in d=8

Authors: K. Foerger (Ecole Polytechnique)

Comments: 9 pages, Latex, To appear in the proceedings of "Quantum Aspects of

Gauge Theories, Supersymmetries and Unification", Corfu, September 1998We discuss heterotic corrections to quartic internal U(1) gauge couplings andcheck duality by calculating one-loop open string diagrams and identifying theD-instanton sum in the dual type I picture. We also compute SO(8)^4 thresholdcorrections and finally R^2 corrections in type I theory.
