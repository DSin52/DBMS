Stability and instability bands in classical mechanics are well-studied inconnection with systems such as described by the Mathieu equation. We examinewhether such band structure can arise in classical field theory in the contextof an embedded kink in 1+1 dimensions. The static embedded kink is unstable toperturbations but we show that if the kink is dynamic it can exhibit stabilityin certain parameter bands. Our results are relevant for estimating thelifetimes of various embedded defects and, in particular, loops of electroweakZ-string.
