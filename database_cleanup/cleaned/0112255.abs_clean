We study the principles of the gauge symmetry and supersymmetry breaking dueto the local or global discrete symmetries on the extra space manifold. We showthat the gauge symmetry breaking by Wilson line is the special case of thediscrete symmetry approach where all the discrete symmetries are global and actfreely on the extra space manifold. As applications, we discuss the N=2supersymmetric SO(10) and $E_8$ breaking on the space-time $M^4\times A^2$ and$M^4\times D^2$, and point out that similarly one can study any N=2supersymmetric $SO(M)$ breaking. We also comment on the one-loop effectivepotential, the possible questions and generalization.
