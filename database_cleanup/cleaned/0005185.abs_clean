We discuss domain wall solutions of 5-dimensional supergravity correspondingto a cosine-superpotential, which is derived by a gauging of the two Abelianisometries of the scalar coset SU(2,1)/U(2). We argue that this potential canbe obtained from M-theory compactification in the presence of G-fluxes and anM5-brane instanton gas. If we decouple the volume scalar of the internal space,the superpotential allows for two extrema, which are either ultra-violet orinfra-red attractive. Asymptotically we approach therefore either the boundaryor the Killing horizon of an anti-deSitter space or flat spacetime for avanishing cosmological constant. If the volume scalar does not decouple, weobtain a run-away potential corresponding to dilatonic domain walls, whichalways run towards a vanishing cosmological constant.
