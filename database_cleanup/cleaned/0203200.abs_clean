We discuss the Equivalence Theorem (ET) in the BRST formalism. The existenceof a local inverse of the field transformation (at least as a formal powerexpansion) suggests a formulation of the ET, which allows a nilpotent BRSTsymmetry. This strategy cannot be implemented at the quantum level if theinverse is non-local. In this case we propose an alternative formulation of theET, where, by using Faddeev-Popov fields, this difficulty is circumvented. Westudy the quantum deformation of the associated ST identity, which turns out tobe anomaly free, and show that a selected set of Green functions, which in somecases can be identified with the physical observables of the model, does notdepend on the choice of the transformation of the fields. In general thetransformation of the fields yields a non-renormalizable theory. When theequivalence is established between a renormalizable and a non-renormalizabletheory, the ET provides a way to give a meaning to the last one by using theresulting ST identity. In this case the Quantum Action Principle cannot be ofany help in the discussion of the ET. We assume and discuss the validity of aQuasi Classical Action Principle, which turns out to be sufficient for thepresent work. As an example we study the renormalizability and unitarity ofmassive QED in Proca's gauge by starting from a linear Lorentz-covariant gauge.
