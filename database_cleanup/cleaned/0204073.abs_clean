Covariant quantization of self-dual strings in 2+2 flat dimensions reducesthem to their zero modes, a consequence of extended world-sheet supersymmetry.We demonstrate how to arrive at the same result more directly by employing a`double' light-cone gauge. An unconventional feature of this gauge is theremoval of anticommuting degrees of freedom by commuting symmetries and viceversa. The reducibility of the N=4 string and its equivalence with the N=2string become apparent.
