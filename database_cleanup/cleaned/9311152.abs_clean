Math. J. 6 (1995), No.3, 595--618We consider representations of quadratic $R$-matrix algebrasby means of certain first order ordinary differential operators.These operators turn out to act as parameter shifting operators onthe Gauss hypergeometric function and its limit cases and on classicalorthogonal polynomials. The relationship with W. Miller's treatment ofLie algebras of first order differential operators will be discussed.
