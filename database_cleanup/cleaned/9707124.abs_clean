Title: Black hole fermionic radiance and D brane decay

SarkarComments: Some errors corrected and a reference added. 4 pages

The semiclassical grey-body factor for massless fermion emission from thefour dimensional black hole described by an ensemble of intersecting tripletsof D- five-branes is shown to be consistent with the (statistical) decay rateof the branes (in the `long' D-string approximation) into massless fermionicclosed string states, subject to assumptions regarding the energy distributionof colliding open string states.
