We study large N dualities for a general class of N=1 theories realized ontype IIB D5 branes wrapping 2-cycles of local Calabi-Yau threefolds or aseffective field theories on D4 branes in type IIA brane configurations. Wecompletely solve the issue of the classical moduli space for N=2, U(N_1)x ... xU(N_n) theories deformed by a general superpotential for the adjoint andbifundamental fields. The N=1 geometries in type IIB and its T-dual braneconfigurations are presented and they agree with the field theory analysis. Weinvestigate the geometric transitions in the ten dimensional theories as wellas in M-theory. Strong coupling effects in field theory are analyzed in thedeformed geometry with fluxes. Gluino condensations are identified thenormalizable deformation parameters while the vacuum expectation values of thebifundamental fields are with the non-normalizable ones. By lifting to Mtheory, we get a transition from finite coverings of non-hyperelliptic curvesto non-hyperelliptic curves. We also discuss orientifold theories, Seibergdualities and mirror symmetries.
