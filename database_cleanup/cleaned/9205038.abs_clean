Title: Recent Developments in Classical and Quantum Theories of Connections,

Including General RelativityAuthors: Abhay Ashtekar

Comments: 13 pages

General relativity can be recast as a theory of connections by performing acanonical transformation on its phase space. In this form, its (kinematical)structure is closely related to that of Yang-Mills theory and topological fieldtheories. Over the past few years, a variety of techniques have been developedto quantize all these theories non-perturbatively. These developments aresummarized with special emphasis on loop space methods and their applicationsto quantum gravity.
