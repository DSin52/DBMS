We describe three different approaches to the extended (N=2)supersymmetrization of the multicomponent KP hierarchy. In the first one weutilize only superfermions while in the second only superbosons and in thethird superbosons as well as superfermions. It is shown that many solitonequations can be embedded in the supersymmetry theory by using the firstapproach even if we do not change these equations in the bosonic limit of thesupersymmetry. In the second or third approach we obtain a generalization ofthe soliton equations in the bosonic limit which remains in the class of theusual commuting functions. As the byproduct of our analysis we prove that forthe first procedure the bosonic part of the one--component supersym\-me\-tricKP hierarchy coincides with the usual classical two--component KP hierarchy.
