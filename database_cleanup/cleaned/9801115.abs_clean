The U(1) gauge field is usually induced from the gauge principle, that is,the extension of global U(1) phase transformation for matter field. However thephase itself is realized only for quantum theory. In this paper we introducethe U(1) gauge field and gauge coupling from the gauge principle classically.The gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken from the out set. The Higgsmechanism occurs and we obtain the London equation. The Hydrodynamicalinterpretation of classical field we utilized is given, and the relation tosuper conductivity is discussed.
