It is shown how magnetic fluxbrane, Fp-brane, solutions are related toelectric black p-branes by analytic continuation. Viewing the transverse spaceof branes as a warped cone, one finds that the cone base of the p-brane becomesthe world-volume of the F(D-p-3)-brane and the world volume of the p-branebecomes the cone base of the F(D-p-3)-brane. An explicit example of thecorrespondence is given for a 2-brane and F6-brane of 11D supergravity.
