A study of the gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten models is given focusing on theeffect of topologically non-trivial configurations of gauge fields. Acorrelation function is expressed as an integral over a moduli space ofholomorphic bundles with quasi-parabolic structure. Two actions of theinvariant local fields and the other on the moduli spaces. Applying these inthe integral expression, we obtain a certain identity which relates correlationfunctions for configurations of different topologies. It gives an importantinformation on the topological sum for the partition and correlation functions.
