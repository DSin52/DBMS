String amplitudes with an arbitrary number of world-sheet boundaries on whichthe coordinates satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions are analyzed in a pathintegral framework. Special attention is payed to the novel divergencesassociated with such conditions. Certain helicity amplitudes involving masslessclosed-string states are free of such divergences to all orders in perturbationtheory and their behavior can be analysed unambiguously. The high energyfixed-angle behavior of these amplitudes is discussed in the presence of one ortwo boundaries and the asymptotic behavior of the amplitudes is shown to bepower behaved.
