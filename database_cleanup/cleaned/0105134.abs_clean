We show that the Abelian Higgs field equations in the four dimensional antide Sitter spacetime have a vortex line solution. This solution, which hascylindrical symmetry in AdS$_4$, is a generalization of the flat spacetimeNielsen-Olesen string. We show that the vortex induces a deficit angle in theAdS$_4$ spacetime that is proportional to its mass density. Using the AdS/CFTcorrespondence, we show that the mass density of the string is uniform and dualto the discontinuity of a logarithmic derivative of correlation function of theboundary scalar operator.
