We discuss the quantization of the 2d gravity theory of Callan, Giddings,Harvey, and Strominger (CGHS), following the procedure of David, and of Distlerand Kawai. We find that the physics depends crucially on whether the number ofmatter fields is greater than or less than 24. In the latter case thesingularity pointed out by several authors is absent but the physicalinterpretation is unclear. In the former case (the one studied by CGHS) thequantum theory which gives CGHS in the linear dilaton semi-classical limit, isdifferent from that which gives CGHS in the extreme Liouville regime.
