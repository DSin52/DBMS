(Talk given at Strings '93, Berkeley, and at XXVII. Internationales Symposium\"uber Elementarteilchentheorie, Wendisch-Rietz, 1993) We review thesuperconformal properties of matter coupled to $2d$ gravity, and $W$-extensionsthereof. We show in particular how the \nex2 structure provides a direct linkbetween certain matter-gravity systems and matrix models. We also show thatmuch, probably all, of this can be generalized to $W$-gravity, and this leadsto an infinite class of new exactly solvable systems. These systems aregoverned by certain integrable hierarchies, which are generalizations of theusual KdV hierarchy and whose algebraic structure is given in terms of quantumcohomology rings of grassmannians.
