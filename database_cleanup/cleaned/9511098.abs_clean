We employ an algebraic approach for unifying perturbative andnon-perturbative superstring states on an equal footing, in the form ofU-duality multiplets, at all excited string levels. In compactified type-IIAsupertring theory we present evidence that the multiplet is labelled by twospaces, ``index'' space and ``base'' space, on which U acts without mixingthem. Both spaces are non-perturbative extensions of similar spaces that labelperturbative T-duality multiplets. Base space consists of all the centralcharges of the 11D SUSY algebra, while index space corresponds torepresetations of the maximal compact subgroup K in U. This structure predictsthe quantum numbers of the non-perturbative states. We also discuss whether andhow U-multiplets may coexist with 11-dimensional multiplets, that areassociated with an additional non-perturbative 11D structure that seems to belurking behind in the underlying theory.
