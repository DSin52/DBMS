Title: Recent Developments in String Theory

M-TheoryAuthors: Michael Haack (Martin-Luther-U., Halle-Wittenberg), Boris Kors, Dieter

Lust (Humboldt U., Berlin)Comments: Lectures delivered by D. Lust at Saalburg in September 1998, 58

pages, 10 figuresThese lectures intend to give a pedagogical introduction into some of thedevelopments in string theory during the last years. They include perturbativeT-duality and non perturbative S- and U-dualities, their unavoidable demand forD-branes, an example of enhanced gauge symmetry at fixed points of theT-duality group, a review of classical solitonic solutions in generalrelativity, gauge theories and tendimensional supergravity, a discussion oftheir BPS nature, Polchinski's observations that allow to view D-branes as RRcharged states in the non perturbative string spectrum, the application of allthis to the computation of the black hole entropy and Hawking radiation andfinally a brief survey of how everything fits together in M-theory.
