We study the equivariant cohomology of a class of multi-field topological LGmodels, and find that such systems carry intrinsic information about$W$-gravity. As a result, we can construct the gravitational chiral ring interms of LG polynomials. We find, in particular, that the spectrum of suchtheories seems to be richer than so far expected. We also briefly discuss theBRST operator for non-linear topological $W$-gravity.
