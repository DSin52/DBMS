Title: Superdualities

Authors: B. Julia

Comments: Based on talks delivered at Utrecht, Bures sur Yvette, Tel-Aviv and

Hidden symmetries are the backbone of Integrable two-dimensional theories.They provide classical solutions of higher dimensional models as well, theyseem to survive partially quantisation and their discrete remnants in M-theorycalled U-dualities, would provide a way to control infinities andnonperturbative effects in Supergravities and String theories. Starting fromEinstein gravity we discuss the building blocks of these large groups ofinternal symmetries, and embed them in superalgebras of dynamical symmetries.The classical field equations for all bosonic matter fields of all toroidallycompactified supergravities are invariant under such ``superdualities''.Possible extensions are briefly discussed.
