Title: On relations between vertex operators, quasiclassical operators, and

phase space coordinatesComments: 25 pages, latex (need only run once)

For certain situations we give a geometrical background for quasiclassical KPcalculations based on an explicit connection to quantum mechanics and thecollapse of coherent states to coadjoint orbits for classical operators.
