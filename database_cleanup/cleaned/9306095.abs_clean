Title: Supersymmetry and Black Holes

Authors: Renata Kallosh

Comments: 8 p., invited talk at SUSY 93, LaTeX (misprints in eqs. (11)-(13) are

improved)We consider static black holes, which are bosonic solutions of supersymmetrictheories. We will show that supersymmetry provides a natural framework for adiscussion of various properties of such static black holes. The mostfundamental property of simple global supersymmetry, non-negativeness of theenergy, is generalized in the black hole theory to cosmic censorship. The SUSYclassification of static black holes will be presented in terms of centralcharges of supersymmetry algebra. The mass, the temperature and the entropy ofthese black holes are simple functions of supersymmetry charges. The extremeblack holes have zero temperature and some unbroken supersymmetries.
