We study quantum dilaton coupled spinors in two and four dimensions. Makingclassical transformation of metric, dilaton coupled spinor theory istransformed to minimal spinor theory with another metric and in case of 4dspinor also in the background of the non-trivial vector field. This gives thepossibility to calculate 2d and 4d dilaton dependent conformal (or Weyl)anomaly in easy way. Anomaly induced effective action for such spinors isderived. In case of 2d, the effective action reproduces, without any extraterms, the term added by hands in the quantum correction for RST model, whichis exactly solvable. For 4d spinor the chiral anomaly which depends explicitlyfrom dilaton is also found. As some application we discuss SUSY Black Holes indilatonic supergravity with WZ type matter and Hawking radiation in the sametheory. As another application we investigate spherically reduced Einsteingravity with 2d dilaton coupled fermion anomaly induced effective action andshow the existence of quantum corrected Schwarszchild-de Sitter (SdS) (Nariai)BH with multiple horizon.
