The graviton self-energy at finite temperature depends on fourteen structurefunctions. We show that, in the absence of tadpoles, the gauge invariance ofthe effective action imposes three non-linear relations among these functions.The consequences of such constraints, which must be satisfied by the thermalgraviton self-energy to all orders, are explicitly verified in general lineargauges to one loop order.
