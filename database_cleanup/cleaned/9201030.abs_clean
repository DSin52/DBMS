A systematic construction of super W-algebras in terms of the WZNW modelbased on a super Lie algebra is presented. These are shown to be the symmetrystructure of the super Toda models, which can be obtained from the WZNW theoryby Hamiltonian reduction. A classification, according to the conformal spindefined by an improved energy-momentum tensor, is dicussed in general terms forall super Lie algebras whose simple roots are fermionic . A detailed discussionemploying the Dirac bracket structure and an explicit construction ofW-algebras for the cases of $OSP(1,2)$, $OSP(2,2)$ , $OSP(3,2)$ and $D(2,1 \mid\alpha )$ are given. The $N=1$ and $N=2$ super conformal algebras are discussedin the pertinent cases.
