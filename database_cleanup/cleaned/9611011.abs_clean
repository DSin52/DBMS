We formulate and solve a class of two-dimensional matrix gauge modelsdescribing ensembles of non-folding surfaces covering an oriented, discretized,two-dimensional manifold. We interpret the models as string theoriescharacterized by a set of coupling constants associated to worldsheetramification points of various orders. Our approach is closely related to, butsimpler than, the string theory describing two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory.Using recently developed character expansion methods we exactly solve themodels for target space lattices of arbitrary internal connectivity andtopology.
