The generic observable sector gaugino mass in the weakly-coupled heteroticstring compactified to four dimensions by the Scherk-Schwarz scheme (togetherwith hidden sector gaugino condensation inducing the super-Higgs effect with avanishing cosmological constant) is shown to be non-zero at tree level, beingof the order of the gravitino mass, modulo reasonable assumptions regarding themagnitude of the condensate and the Scherk-Schwarz mass parameters
