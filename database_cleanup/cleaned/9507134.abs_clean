The propagation of a localized wave packet in the conical space-time createdby a pointlike massive source in 2+1 dimensional gravity is analyzed. Thescattering amplitude is determined and shown to be finite along the classicalscattering directions due to interference between the scattered and thetransmitted wave functions. The analogy with diffraction theory is emphasized.
