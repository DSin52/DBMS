We consider new cosmological solutions with a collapsing, an intermediate andan expanding phase. The boundary between the expanding (collapsing) phase andthe intermediate phase is seen by comoving observers as a cosmological past(future) horizon. The solutions are naturally embedded in string and M-theory.In the particular case of a two-dimensional cosmology, space-time is flat withan identification under boost and translation transformations. We consider thecorresponding string theory orbifold and calculate the modular invariantone-loop partition function. In this case there is a strong parallel with theBTZ black hole. The higher dimensional cosmologies have a time-like curvaturesingularity in the intermediate region. In some cases the string coupling canbe made small throughout all of space-time but string corrections becomeimportant at the singularity. This happens where string winding modes becomelight which could resolve the singularity. The new proposed space-time casualstructure could have implications for cosmology, independently of stringtheory.
