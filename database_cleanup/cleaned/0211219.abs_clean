We provide a derivation for the particle number densities on phase space forscalar and fermionic fields in terms of Wigner functions. Our expressionsfermions it lies in the interval between zero and one, and both are consistentwith thermal field theory. As applications we consider the Bunch-Davies vacuumand fermionic preheating after inflation.
