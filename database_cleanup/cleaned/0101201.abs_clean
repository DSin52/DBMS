The lagrangian description of irreducible massless representations of thePoincare group with the corresponding Young tableaux having two rows along withsome explicit examples including the notoph and Weyl tensor is given. For thispurpose is used the method of the BRST constructions adopted to the systems ofsecond class constraints by the construction of an auxiliary representations ofthe algebras of constraints in terms of Verma modules.
