We show that the moduli space of supersymmetric black holes that arise in thefive-dimensional N=2 supergravity theory with any number of vector multipletsis a weak HKT manifold. The moduli metric is expressed in terms of a HKTpotential which is determined by the associated very special geometry of thesupergravity theory. As an example, we give explicitly the black hole modulimetric for the STU model.
