We discuss R-symmetries in locally supersymmetric N=2 gauge theories coupledto hypermultiplets which can be thought of as effective theories of heteroticsuperstring models. In this type of supergravities a suitable R-symmetry existscontaining the dilaton-axion field has different R-charge assignments withrespect to the other vector multiplets. Correspondingly a system of coupledinstanton equations emerges, mixing gravitational and Yang--Mills instantonswith triholomorphic hyperinstantons and axion-instantons. For the tree-levelclassical special manifolds $ST(n)=SU(1,1)/U(1)\times SO(2,n)/(SO(2)$ $\timesSO(n))$ R-symmetry with the specified properties is a continuous symmetry, butfor the quantum corrected manifolds ${\hat {ST}}(n)$ a discrete R--group ofelectric--magnetic duality rotations is sufficient and we argue that it exists.
