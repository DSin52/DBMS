We derive a closed expression for the SU(2) Born-Infeld action with thesymmetrized trace for static spherically symmetric purely magneticconfigurations. The lagrangian is obtained in terms of elementary functions.Using it, we investigate glueball solutions to the flat space NBI theory andtheir self-gravitating counterparts. Such solutions, found previously in theNBI model with the 'square root - ordinary trace' lagrangian, are shown topersist in the theory with the symmetrized trace lagrangian as well. Althoughthe symmetrized trace NBI equations differ substantially from those of thetheory with the ordinary trace, a qualitative picture of glueballs remainsessentially the same. Gravity further reduces the difference between solutionsin these two models, and, for sufficiently large values of the effectivegravitational coupling, solutions tends to the same limiting form. The blackholes in the NBI theory with the symmetrized trace are also discussed.
