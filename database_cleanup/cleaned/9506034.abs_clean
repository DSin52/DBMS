The dual of the four dimensional non-linear sigma model is constructed usingtechniques familiar to string theory. This construction necessitates theintroduction of a rank two antisymmetric tensor field whose properties areexamined. The physics of the dual theory and that of the original model arecompared. As an illustration we study in detail the SU(2) chiral model. We findthat the scattering amplitudes of the charged Goldstone bosons in the twotheories are in complete agreement at the one loop level.
