In this paper we continue the study of the three-layer Zamolodchikov modelstarted in our previous works. We analyse numerically the solutions to theBethe ansatz equations. We consider two regimes I and II which differ by thesigns of the spherical sides (a1,a2,a3)->(-a1,-a2,-a3). We accept the two-linehypothesis for the regime I and the one-line hypothesis for the regime II. Inthe thermodynamic limit we derive integral equations for distribution densitiesand solve them exactly. We calculate the partition function for the three-layerZamolodchikov model and check a compatibility of this result with thefunctional relations. We also do some numerical checkings of our results.
