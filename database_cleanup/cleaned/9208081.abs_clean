Title: c = 1 Two Dimensional Quantum Gravity

Authors: Norisuke Sakai

Comments: A talk given at the International Symposium on Quantum Physics and

the Universe, Waseda University, August 19-22, 1992 (revised adding areference in ref.8 and two references in ref.9) 16pages, TIT/HEP--205The continuum (Liouville) approach to the two-dimensional (2-D) quantumgravity is reviewed with particular attention to the $c=1$ conformal mattercoupling, and new results on a related problem of dilaton gravity are reported.After finding the physical states, we examine the procedure to computecorrelation functions. The physical states in the relative cohomology show upas intermediate state poles of the correlation functions. The states in theabsolute cohomology but not in the relative cohomology arise as auxiliaryfields in string field theory. The Liouville approach is applied also to thequantum treatment of the dilaton gravity. The physical states are obtained fromthe BRST cohomology and correlation functions are computed in the dilatongravity.
