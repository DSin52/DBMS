We investigate the possibility of constructing a locally supersymmetricextension of NGT (Nonsymmetric Gravitation Theory), based on the gradedextension of the Poincare group. In the framework of the simple model that wepropose, we end up with a no-go result, namely the impossibility of cancellingsome linear contribution in the gravitino field. This drawback seems toseriously undermine the construction of a supergravity based on NGT.
