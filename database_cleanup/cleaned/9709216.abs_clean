A direct link between a one-loop N-point Feynman diagram and a geometricalrepresentation based on the N-dimensional simplex is established by relatingthe Feynman parametric representations to the integrals over contents of(N-1)-dimensional simplices in non-Euclidean geometry of constant curvature. Inparticular, the four-point function in four dimensions is proportional to thevolume of a three-dimensional spherical (or hyperbolic) tetrahedron which canbe calculated by splitting into birectangular ones. It is also shown that theknown formula of reduction of the N-point function in (N-1) dimensionscorresponds to splitting the related N-dimensional simplex into N rectangularones.
