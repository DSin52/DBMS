We study a three dimensional analogue of the Wess--Zumino--Witten model,which describes the Goldstone bosons of three dimensional QuantumChromodynamics. The topologically non--trivial term of the action can also beviewed as a nonlinear realization of Chern--Simons form. We obtain the currentalgebra of this model by canonical methods. This is a three dimensionalgeneralization of the Kac--Moody algebra.
