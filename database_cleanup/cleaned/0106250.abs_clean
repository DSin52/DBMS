The correspondence between BRST-BFV, Dirac and projection operator approachesto quantize constrained systems is analyzed. It is shown that the component ofthe BFV wave function with maximal number of ghosts and antighosts in theSchrodinger representation may be viewed as a wave function in the projectionoperator approach. It is shown by using the relationship between differentquantization techniques that the Marnelius inner product for BRST-BFV systemsshould be in general modified in order to take into account the topology of thegroup; the Giulini-Marolf group averaging prescription for the inner product isobtained from the BRST-BFV method. The relationship between observables indifferent approaches is also found.
