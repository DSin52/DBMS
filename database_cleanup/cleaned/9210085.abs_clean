A novel representation ---in terms of a Laurent series--- for the free energyof string theory at non-zero temperature is constructed. The examples of openbosonic, open supersymmetric and closed bosonic strings are studied in detail.In all these cases the Laurent series representation for the free energy isobtained explicitly.It is shown that the Hagedorn temperature arises in this formalism as theconvergence condition (specifically, the radius of convergence) of thecorresponding Laurent series. Some prospects for further applications are alsodiscussed. In particular, an attempt to describe string theory above theHagedorn temperature ---via Borel analytical continuation of the Laurent seriesrepresentation--- is provided.
