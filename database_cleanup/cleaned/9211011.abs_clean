Extremal black holes are studied in a two dimensional model motivated by adimensional reduction from four dimensions. Their quantum corrected geometry iscalculated semiclassically and a mild singularity is shown to appear at thehorizon.Extensions of the geometry past the horizon are not unique but there arecontinuations free from malevolent singularities. A few comments are made aboutthe relevance of these results to four dimensions and to the study of blackhole entropy and information loss.
