The problems arising when quantizing systems with periodic boundaryconditions are analysed, in an algebraic (group-) quantization scheme, and the``failure" of the Ehrenfest theorem is clarified in terms of the alreadydefined notion of {\it good} (and {\it bad}) operators. The analysis of``constrained" Heisenberg-Weyl groups according to this quantization schemereveals the possibility for new quantum (fractional) numbers extending thoseallowed for Chern classes in traditional Geometric Quantization. This study isillustrated with the examples of the free particle on the circumference and thecharged particle in a homogeneous magnetic field on the torus, both examplesfeaturing ``anomalous" operators, non-equivalent quantization and the latter,fractional quantum numbers. These provide the rationale behind fluxquantization in superconducting rings and Fractional Quantum Hall Effect,respectively.
