Stability analysis of the Bianchi type I universe in pure gravity theory isstudied in details. We first derive the non-redundant field equation of thesystem by introducing the generalized Bianchi type I metric. This non-redundantequation reduces to the Friedmann equation in the isotropic limit. It is shownfurther that any unstable mode of the isotropic perturbation with respect to ade Sitter background is also unstable with respect to anisotropicperturbations. Implications to the choice of physical theories are discussed indetails in this paper.
