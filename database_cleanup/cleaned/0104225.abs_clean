It was recently proposed a novel discretization for nonlinear Klein-Gordonfield theories in which the resulting lattice preserves the topological(Bogomol'nyi) lower bound on the kink energy and, as a consequence, has noPeierls-Nabarro barrier even for large spatial discretizations (h~1.0). It wasthen suggested that these ``topological discrete systems'' are a natural choicefor the numerical study of continuum kink dynamics. Giving particular emphasisto the phi^4 theory, we numerically investigate kink-antikink scattering andbreather formation in these topological lattices. Our results indicate that,even though these systems are quite accurate for studying free kinks in coarselattices, for legitimate dynamical kink problems the accuracy is ratherrestricted to fine lattices (h~0.1). We suggest that this fact is related tothe breaking of the Bogomol'nyi bound during the kink-antikink interaction,where the field profile loses its static property as required by theBogomol'nyi argument. We conclude, therefore, that these lattices are notsuitable for the study of more general kink dynamics, since a standarddiscretization is simpler and has effectively the same accuracy for suchresolutions.
