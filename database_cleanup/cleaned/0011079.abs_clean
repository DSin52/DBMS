We consider a Dp brane within a D9 brane in the presence of a B-field whosepolarization is {\em transverse} to the Dp brane. To be definite, we take aD3-D9 system. It is observed that the system has the same pattern ofsupersymmetry breaking as that of a soliton of the six dimensionalnon-commutative gauge theory that is obtained by dimensional reduction of an{\cal N}=1, D=10 gauge theory. These results indicate that the soliton solutionis the low energy realization of a D3 brane in a D9 brane with a transverseB-field, hence can be viewed as a generalization of the previous results in theliterature where similar observations were made for lower codimensional cases.
