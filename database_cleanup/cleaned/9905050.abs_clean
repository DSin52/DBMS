In this note we derive an explicit modular invariant formula for the two loop4-point amplitude in superstring theory in terms of a multiple integral (7complex integration variables) over the complex plane which is shown to beconvergent. We consider in particular the case of the leading term forvanishing momenta of the four graviton amplitude, which would correspond to thetwo-loop correction of the R^4 term in the effective Action. The resultingexpression is not positive definite and could be zero, although we cannot seethat it vanishes.
