Title: Vortex distribution in neutron stars

Neutron stars are supposed to be mainly formed by a neutron superfluid. Theangular momentum is given by the vortex array within the fluid, and a goodaccount of the observable effects is determined by its coupling with the crust.In this article we show that the gravitational field introduces importantmodifications in the vortex distribution and shape. The inertial frame draggingon the quantum fluid produces a decrease in the vortex density, which forrealistic models is in the order of 15%. This effect is relevant for neutronstar rotation models and can provide a good framework for checking the quantumeffect of the frame dragging.
