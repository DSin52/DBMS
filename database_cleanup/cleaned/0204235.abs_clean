It is shown that negative tension branes in higher dimensions may lead to aneffective lower dimensional theory where the gauge-invariant vector fieldsassociated with the fluctuations of the metric are always massless andlocalized on the brane. Explicit five-dimensional examples of this phenomenonare provided. Furthermore, it is shown that higher dimensional gauge fields canalso be localized on these configurations with the zero mode separated from themassive tower by a gap.
