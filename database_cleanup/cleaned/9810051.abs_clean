We compute the imaginary part of scalar four-point functions in the AdS/CFTcorrespondence relevant to N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. Unitarity of the AdSsupergravity demands that the imaginary parts of the correlation functionsfactorize into products of lower-point functions. We include the exchangediagrams for scalars as well as gravitons and find explicit expressions for theimaginary parts of these correlators. In momentum space these expressionscontain only rational functions and logarithms of the kinematic invariants, insuch a manner that the correlator is not a free-field result. The simplicity ofthese results, however, indicate the possibility of additional symmetrystructures in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in the large $N_c$ limit at strongeffective coupling. The complete expressions may be computed from the integralresults derived here.
