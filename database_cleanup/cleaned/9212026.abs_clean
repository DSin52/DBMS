We compute the metric on moduli space for the Dabholkar-Harvey string solitonin $D=4$ to lowest nontrivial order in the string tension. The metric is foundto be flat, which implies trivial scattering of the solitons. This result isconsistent with an earlier test-string calculation of the leading orderdynamical force and a computation of the Veneziano amplitude for the scatteringof macroscopic strings.
