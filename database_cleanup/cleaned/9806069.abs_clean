We discuss some properties of the conjectured M-9-brane. We investigate boththe worldvolume action as well as the target space solution. The worldvolumeaction is given by a gauged sigma model which, via dimensional reduction andduality, is shown to be related to the worldvolume actions of the branes often- dimensional superstring theory. The effective tension of the M-9-branescales as (R_{11})^3, where R_{11} is the radius of an S^1-isometry direction.This isometry enables us to add a cosmological constant to eleven-dimensionalsupergravity. The target space solution corresponding to the M-9-brane is a(wrapped) domain wall of massive eleven-dimensional supergravity. This solutionbreaks half of the bulk supersymmetry. We consider both single M-9-branes aswell as a system of two M-9-branes. In both cases one can define regions inspacetime, separated by the domain walls, with zero cosmological constant. Inthese regions the limit R_{11}-> \infty can be taken in which case theM-9-brane is unwrapped and a massless eleven-dimensional supergravity isobtained.
