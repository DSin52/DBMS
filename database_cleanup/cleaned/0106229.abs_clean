We describe vacuum as a system of virtual particles, some of which havenegative energies. Any system of vacuum particles is a part of a keneme, i.e.of a system of n particles which can, without violating the conservation laws,annihilate in the strict sense of the word (transform into nothing). A kenemeis a homogeneous system, i.e. its state is invariant by all transformations ofthe invariance group. But a homogeneous system is not necessarily a keneme. Inthe simple case of a spin system, where the invariance group is SU(2), ahomogeneous system is a system whose total spin is unpolarized; a keneme is asystem whose total spin is zero. The state of a homogeneous system is describedby a statistical operator with infinite trace (von Neumann), to whichcorresponds a characteristic distribution. The characteristic distributions ofthe homogeneous systems of vacuum are defined and studied. Finally it is shownhow this description of vacuum can be used to solve the frame problem posed in(I).
