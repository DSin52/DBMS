An infra-red fixed point of ${\mathcal N}=1$ super-Yang-Mills theory isbelieved to be dual to a solution of five-dimensional gauged ${\mathcal N}=8$supergravity. We test this conjecture at next to leading order in the large $N$expansion by computing bulk one-loop corrections to the anomaly coefficient$a-c$. The one-loop corrections are non-zero for all values of the bulk mass,and not just special ones as claimed in previous work.
