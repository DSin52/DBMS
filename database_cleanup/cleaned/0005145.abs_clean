We investigate further the recent proposal for the form of the Matrix theoryaction in weak background fields. We perform DVV reduction to the multipleD0-brane action in order to find the Matrix string theory action for multiplefundamental strings in curved but weak NS-NS and R-R backgrounds. This matrixsigma model gives a definite prescription on how to deal with R-R fields withan explicit spacetime dependence in Type II string theory. We do this both viathe 9-11 flip and the chain of T and S dualities, and further check on theirequivalence explicitly. In order to do so, we also discuss the implementationof S-duality in the operators of the 2-dimensional world-volume supersymmetricgauge theory describing the Type IIB D-string. We compare the result to theknown Green-Schwarz sigma model action (for one string), and use thiscomparison in order to discuss about possible, non-linear background curvaturecorrections to the Matrix string action (involving many strings), and thereforeto the Matrix theory action. We illustrate the nonabelian character of ouraction with an example involving multiple fundamental strings in a non-trivialR-R flux, where the strings are polarized into a noncommutative configuration.This corresponds to a dielectric type of effect on fundamental strings.
