We derive and generalize the RR twisted tadpole cancellation conditionsnecessary to obtain consistent D=4, Z_N orbifold compactifications of Type IIBstring theory. At least two different types of branes (or antibranes withopposite RR charges) are introduced into the construction. The matter spectraand their contribution to the non-abelian gauge anomalies are computed. Theirrelation with the tadpole cancellation conditions is also reviewed. Thepresence of tachyons is a common feature for some of the non-supersymmetricsystems of branes.
