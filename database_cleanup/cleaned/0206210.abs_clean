We study an integrable deformation of the super-Liouville theory whichgenerates a RG flows to the critical Ising model as the IR fixed point. Thismodel turns out to be a supersymmetric sinh-Gordon model with spontaneouslybroken N=1 supersymmetry. The resulting massless Goldstino is the only stableon-shell particle which controls the IR behaviours. We propose the exact$S$-matrix of the Goldstino and compare associated thermodynamic Bethe ansatzequations with the quantization conditions derived from the reflectionamplitudes of the the super-Liouville theory to provide nonperturbative checksfor both the (NS) and the (R) sectors.
