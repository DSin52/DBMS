Invited talk given at the ``International Workshop on `Symmetry Methods inPhysics' in memory of Ya.\ A.\ Smorodinsky, 5--10 July 1993, Dubna, Russia; toappear in the proceedings. In this contribution I present further results onsteps towards a Table of Feynman Path Integrals. Whereas the usual pathintegral solutions of the harmonic oscillator (Gaussian path integrals), of theradial harmonic oscillator (Besselian path integrals), and the (modified)P\"oschl-Teller potential(s) (Legendrian path integrals) are well known and canbe performed explicitly by exploiting the convolution properties of the varioustypes, a perturbative method opens other possibilities for calculating pathintegrals. Here I want to demonstrate the perturbation expansion method forpoint interactions and boundary problems in path integrals.
