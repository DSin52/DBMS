Title: Nonsupersymmetric multibrane solutions

Authors: Marcin P. Flak, Krzysztof A. Meissner

Gravity coupled to an arbitrary number of antisymmetric tensors and scalarfields in arbitrary space-time dimensions is studied in a context of general,static, spherically symmetric solutions with many orthogonally intersectingbranes. Neither supersymmetry nor harmonic gauge is assumed. It is shown thatthe system reduces to a Toda-like system after an adequate redefinition oftransverse radial coordinate $r$. Duality $r \to 1/r$ in the set of solutionsis observed.
