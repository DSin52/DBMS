of workWe study the Casimir problem as the limit of a conventional quantum fieldtheory coupled to a smooth background. The Casimir energy diverges in the limitthat the background forces the field to vanish on a surface. We show that thisdivergence cannot be absorbed into a renormalization of the parameters of thetheory. As a result, the Casimir energy of the surface and other quantitieslike the surface tension, which are obtained by deforming the surface, cannotbe defined independently of the details of the coupling between the field andthe matter on the surface. In contrast, the energy density away from thesurface and the force between rigid surfaces are finite and independent ofthese complications.
