I discuss the general formalism of two-dimensional topological field theoriesdefined on open-closed oriented Riemann surfaces, starting from an extension ofSegal's geometric axioms. Exploiting the topological sewing constraints allowsfor the identification of the algebraic structure governing such systems. Igive a careful treatment of bulk-boundary and boundary-bulk correspondences,which are responsible for the relation between the closed and open sectors. Thefact that these correspondences need not be injective nor surjective hasinteresting implications for the problem of classifying `boundary conditions'.In particular, I give a clear geometric derivation of the (topological)boundary state formalism and point out some of its limitations. Finally, Iformulate the problem of classifying (on-shell) boundary extensions of a givenclosed topological field theory in purely algebraic terms and discussreducibility of boundary extensions.
