Title: Twisted Bundle on Noncommutative Space and U(1) Instanton

Authors: Pei-Ming Ho

Comments: Lecture at APCTP-KIAS winter school on Strings and D-branes 2000.

some mistakes correctedWe study the notion of twisted bundles on noncommutative space. Due to theexistence of projective operators in the algebra of functions on thenoncommutative space, there are twisted bundles with non-constant dimension.The U(1) instanton solution of Nekrasov and Schwarz is such an example. As amathematical motivation for not excluding such bundles, we find gaugetransformations by which a bundle with constant dimension can be equivalent toa bundle with non-constant dimension.
