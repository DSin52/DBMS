Explicit expressions for three series of $R$ matrices which are related to a``dilute'' generalisation of the Birman--Wenzl--Murakami are presented. Ofthose, one series is equivalent to the quantum $R$ matrices of the$D^{(2)}_{n+1}$ generalised Toda systems whereas the remaining two seriesappear to be new.
