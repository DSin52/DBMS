Fromjoint work with M. Henneaux and A. SevrinTwo issues regarding the interactions of the chiral two-forms are reviewed.First, the problem of constructing Lorentz-invariant self-couplings of a singlechiral two-form is investigated in the light of the Dirac-Schwinger conditionon the energy-momentum tensor commutation relations. We show how thePerry-Schwarz condition follows from the Dirac-Schwinger criterion and pointout that consistency of the gravitational coupling is automatic. Secondly, westudy the possible local deformations of chiral two-forms. This problem reducesto the study of the local BRST cohomological group at ghost number zero. Weproof that the only consistent deformations of a system of free chiraltwo-forms are (up to redefinitions) deformations that do not modify the abeliangauge symmetries of the free theory. The consequence of this result for asystem consisting of a number of parallel M5-branes is explained.
