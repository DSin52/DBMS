We consider geometric engineering of N=1 supersymmetric QFTs with matter interms of a local model for compactification of F-theory on Calabi-Yau fourfold.By bringing 3-branes near 7-branes we engineer N=1 supersymmetric $SU(N_c)$gauge theory with $N_f$ flavors in the fundamental. We identify the Higgsbranch of this system with the instanton moduli space on the compact fourdimensional space of the 7-brane worldvolume. Moreover we show that theEuclidean 3-branes wrapped around the compact part of the 7-brane worldvolumecan generate superpotential for $N_f=N_c-1$ as well as lead to quantumcorrections to the moduli space for $N_f=N_c$. Finally we argue that Seiberg'sduality for N=1 supersymmetric QCD may be mapped to T-duality exchanging7-branes with 3-branes.
