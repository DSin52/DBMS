Much has been learned about string theory over the last few years by studyingproperties of cycles and branes in a given background geometry. Here we discussthree situations (quantum volume, attractor flows/D-brane stability, anddynamical topology change) in which cycles in a Calabi-Yau background evolveand/or degenerate in some manner, yielding various insights into aspects ofquantum geometry. Based in part on talk given at Strings 2000.
