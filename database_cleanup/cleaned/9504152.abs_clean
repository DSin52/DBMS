The method of constructing of extended phase space for singular theorieswhich permits the consideration of covariant gauges without the introducing ofa ghost fields, is proposed. The extension of the phase space is carried out bythe identification of the initial theory with an equivalent theory with higherderivatives and applying to it the Ostrogradsky method of Hamiltoniandescription .
