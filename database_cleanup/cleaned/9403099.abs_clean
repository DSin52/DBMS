We present the exact and explicit solution of the principal chiral field intwo dimensions for an infinitely large rank group manifold. The energy of theground state is explicitly found for the external Noether's fields of anarbitrary magnitude. The exact Gell-Mann - Low function exhibits the asymptoticfreedom behaviour at large value of the field in agreement with perturbativecalculations. Coefficients of the perturbative expansion in the renormalizedcharge are calculated. They grow factorially with the order showing thepresence of renormalons. At small field we found an inverse logarithmicsingularity in the ground state energy at the mass gap which indicates that at$N=\infty$ the spectrum of the theory contains extended objects rather thenpointlike particles.
