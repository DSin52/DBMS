We calculate vacuum energy for twisted SUSY D-brane on toroidal backgroundwith constant magnetic or constant electric field. Its behaviour for toroidalD-brane (p=2) in constant electric field shows the presence of stable minimumfor twisted versions of the theory. That indicates such a background maybereasonable groundstate.
