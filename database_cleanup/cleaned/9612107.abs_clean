The explicit formulae for m-soliton solutions of (1+2)-dimensional matrixDavey-Stewartson equation are represented. They are found by means of knowngeneral solution of the matrix Toda chain with the fixed ends [1]. Thesesolutions are expressed trough m+m independent solutions of a pair of linearShrodinger equations with Hermitian potentials.
