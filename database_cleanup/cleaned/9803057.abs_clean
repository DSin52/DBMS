For massive and conformal quantum field theories in 1+1 dimensions with aglobal gauge group we consider soliton automorphisms, viz. automorphisms of thequasilocal algebra which act like two different global symmetry transformationson the left and right spacelike complements of a bounded region. We give aunified treatment by providing a necessary and sufficient condition for theexistence and Poincare' covariance of soliton automorphisms which is applicableto a large class of theories. In particular, our construction applies to theQFT models with the local Fock property -- in which case the latter property isthe only input from constructive QFT we need -- and to holomorphic conformalfield theories. In conformal QFT soliton representations appear as twistedsectors, and in a subsequent paper our results will be used to give a rigorousanalysis of the superselection structure of orbifolds of holomorphic theories.
