We explicitly construct BPS domain walls interpolating between neighboringchirally asymmetric vacua in a model for large N pure supersymmetric QCD. TheBPS equations for the corresponding ${\bf Z}_N$ symmetric order parametereffective Lagrangian reduce to those in the $A_N$ Landau-Ginsburg modelassuming that the higher derivative terms in the K{\"a}hler potential aresuppressed in the large N limit. These BPS domain walls, which have vanishingwidth in the large N limit, can be viewed as supermembranes embedded in a(3+1)-dimensional supersymmetric QCD background. The supermembrane couples to athree-form supermultiplet whose components we identify with the compositefields of supersymmetric QCD. We also discuss certain aspects of chromoelectricflux tubes (open strings) ending on these walls which appear to support theirinterpretation as D-branes.
