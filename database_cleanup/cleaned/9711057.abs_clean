We compute the microscopic spectrum of the QCD Dirac operator in the presenceof dynamical fermions in the framework of random-matrix theory for the chiralGaussian unitary ensemble. We obtain results for the microscopic spectralcorrelators, the microscopic spectral density, and the distribution of thesmallest eigenvalue for an arbitrary number of flavors, arbitrary quark masses,and arbitrary topological charge.
