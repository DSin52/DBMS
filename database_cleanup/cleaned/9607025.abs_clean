Title: Relativistic Quantum Mechanics of a Neutral Two-Body System in a

Constant Magnetic FieldAuthors: Philippe Droz-Vincent (Universite P. et M. Curie, Paris)

discussion of the eigenvalue problemA (globally) neutral two-body system is supposed to obey a pair of coupledKlein-Gordon equations in a constant homogeneous magnetic field. Consideringeigenstates of the pseudomomentum four-vector, we reduce these equations to athree-dimensional eigenvalue problem. The frame adapted to pseudomomentum hasin general a nonvanishing velocity with respect to the frames where the fieldis purely magnetic. This velocity plays a crucial role in the occurance ofmotional terms; these terms are taken into account within a manifestlycovariant framework. Perturbation theory is available when the mutualinteraction doesnot depend on the total energy; a weak-field-slow-motionapproximation is more specially tractable.
