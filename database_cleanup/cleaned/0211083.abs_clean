Title: Invariance of interaction terms in new representation of self-dual

electrodynamicsComments: Latex file, 8 pages, submitted to Proceedings of III international

Sakharov conference on physics (Moscow, June 24-29, 2002)A new representation of Lagrangians of 4D nonlinear electrodynamics isconsidered. In this new formulation, in parallel with the standard Maxwellfield strength F, an auxiliary bispinor (tensor) field V is introduced. Thegauge field strength appears only in bilinear terms of the full Lagrangian,while the interaction Lagrangian E depends on the auxiliary fields, E = E(V).Two types of self-duality inherent in the nonlinear electrodynamics modelsadmit a simple characterization in terms of the function E. The continuousSO(2) duality symmetry between nonlinear equations of motion and Bianchiidentities amounts to requiring E to be a function of the SO(2) invariantquartic combination |V|^4. The discrete self-duality (or self-duality underLegendre transformation) amounts to a weaker condition E(V)= E(iV). Thisapproach can be generalized to a system of n Abelian gauge fields exhibitingU(n) duality. The corresponding interaction Lagrangian should be U(n) invariantfunction of n bispinor auxiliary fields.
