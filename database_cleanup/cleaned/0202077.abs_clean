We investigate the nonlinear holomorphic supersymmetry for quantum-mechanicalsystems on Riemann surfaces subjected to an external magnetic field. Therealization is shown to be possible only for Riemann surfaces with constantcurvature metrics. The cases of the sphere and Lobachevski plane are elaboratedin detail. The partial algebraization of the spectrum of the correspondingHamiltonians is proved by the reduction to one-dimensional quasi-exactlysolvable sl(2,R) families. It is found that these families possess the"duality" transformations, which form a discrete group of symmetries of thecorresponding 1D potentials and partially relate the spectra of different 2Dsystems. The algebraic structure of the systems on the sphere and hyperbolicplane is explored in the context of the Onsager algebra associated with thenonlinear holomorphic supersymmetry. Inspired by this analysis, a generalalgebraic method for obtaining the covariant form of integrals of motion of thequantum systems in external fields is proposed.
