The vacuum expectation values of the so-called Q-operators of certainintegrable quantum field theories have recently been identified with spectraldeterminants of particular Schrodinger operators. In this paper we extend thecorrespondence to the T-operators, finding that their vacuum expectation valuesalso have an interpretation as spectral determinants. As byproducts we give asimple proof of an earlier conjecture of ours, proved by another route bySuzuki, and generalise a problem in PT symmetric quantum mechanics studied byBender and Boettcher. We also stress that the mapping between Q-operators andSchrodinger equations means that certain problems in integrable quantum fieldtheory are related to the study of Regge poles in non-relativistic potentialscattering.
