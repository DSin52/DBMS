I introduce a class of string constructions based on asymmetric orbifoldsleading to level two models. In particular, I derive in detail various modelswith gauge groups $E_6$ and SO(10), including a four generation $E_6$ modelwith two adjoint representations. The occurrence of multiple adjointrepresentations is a generic feature of the construction. In the course ofdescribing this approach, I will address the problem of twist phases in highertwisted sectors of asymmetric orbifolds.
