Authors: Z. Khviengia and E. Sezgin

Comments: 9 pages, plain tex, CTP TAMU-71/93. (Contribution to the Proceedings

of the Trieste Summer School in High Energy Physics and Cosmology, 14 June-30July 1993, Trieste, Italy.)We discuss the structure, realizations and quantum BRST operators of a classof nonlinear superconformal algebras with N > 4.
