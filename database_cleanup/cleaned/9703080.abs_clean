We apply the principles discussed in an earlier paper to the construction ofdiscrete time field theories. We derive the discrete time field equations ofmotion and Noether's theorem and apply them to the Schrodinger equation toillustrate the methodology. Stationary solutions to the discrete timeSchrodinger wave equation are found to be identical to standard energyeigenvalue solutions except for a fundamental limit on the energy. Then weapply the formalism to the free neutral Klein Gordon system, deriving theequations of motion and conserved quantities such as the linear momentum andangular momentum. We show that there is an upper bound on the magnitude oflinear momentum for physical particle-like solutions. We extend the formalismto the charged scalar field coupled to Maxwell's electrodynamics in a gaugeinvariant way. We apply the formalism to include the Maxwell and Dirac fields,setting the scene for second quantisation of discrete time mechanics anddiscrete time Quantum Electrodynamics.
