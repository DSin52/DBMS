Figures,Inspired by the usefulness of local scaling of time in the path integralformalism, we introduce a new kind of hamiltonian path integral in this paper.A special case of this new type of path integral has been earlier found usefulin formulating a scheme of hamiltonian path integral quantization in arbitrarycoordinates. This scheme has the unique feature that quantization in arbitraryco-ordinates requires hamiltonian path integral to be set up in terms of theclassical hamiltonian only, without addition of any adhoc $ O(\hbar ^2) $terms.In this paper we further study the properties of hamiltonian path integrals inarbitrary co-ordinates with and without local scaling of time and obtain theSchrodinger equation implied by the hamiltonian path integrals. As a simpleillustrative example of quantization in arbitrary coordinates and of exact pathintegration we apply the results obtained to the case of Coulomb problem in twodimensions.
