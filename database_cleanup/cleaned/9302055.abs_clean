A wide class of boundary problems in quantum mechanics is discussed by usingpath integrals. This includes motion in half-spaces, radial boxes, rings, andmoving boundaries. As a preparation the formalism for the incorporation of$\delta$-function perturbations is outlined, which includes the discussion ofmultiple $\delta$-function perturbations, $\delta$-function perturbations alongperpendicular lines and planes, and moving $\delta$-function perturbations. Thelimiting process, where the strength of the $\delta$-function perturbationsgets infinite repulsive, has the effect of producing impenetrable walls at thelocations of the $\delta$-function perturbations, i.e.\ a consistentdescription for boundary problems with Dirichlet boundary-condition emerges.Several examples illustrate the formalism.
