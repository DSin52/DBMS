Maldacena and Nunez [hep-th/0008001] identified a gravity solution describingpure N=1 Yang-Mills (YM) in the IR. Their (smooth) supergravity solutionexhibits confinement and the U(1)_R chiral symmetry breaking of the dual YMtheory, while the singular solution corresponds to the gauge theory phase withunbroken U(1)_R chiral symmetry. In this paper we discuss supersymmetric typeIIB compactifications on resolved conifolds with torsion. We rederive singularbackground of [hep-th/0008001] directly from the supersymmetry conditions. Thissolution is the relevant starting point to study non-BPS backgrounds dual tothe high temperature phase of pure YM. We construct the simplest black holesolution in this background. We argue that it has a regular Schwarzschildhorizon and provides a resolution of the IR singularity of the chirallysymmetric extremal solution as suggested in [hep-th/0011146].
