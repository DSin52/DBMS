We classify the moduli spaces of the four-dimensional topological half-flatgravity models by using the canonical bundle. For a K3-surface orfour-dimensional torus, they describe an equivalent class of a trio of theEinstein-Kahler forms ( the hyperkahler forms ). We calculate the dimensions ofthese moduli spaces by using the Atiyah-Singer Index theorem. We mention thepartition function and the possibility of the observables in the Witten-typetopological half-flat gravity model case.
