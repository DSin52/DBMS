SystemsBoundary conditions may change the phase diagram of non-equilibriumstatistical systems like the one-dimensional asymmetric simple exclusionprocess with and without particle number conservation. Using the quantumHamiltonian approach, the model is mapped onto an XXZ quantum chain and solvedusing the Bethe ansatz. This system is related to a two-dimensional vertexmodel in thermal equilibrium. The phase transition caused by a point-likeboundary defect in the dynamics of the one-dimensional exclusion model is inthe same universality class as a continous (bulk) phase transition of thetwo-dimensional vertex model caused by a line defect at its boundary.(hep-th/yymmnnn)
