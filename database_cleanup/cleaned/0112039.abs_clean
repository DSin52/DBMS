Title: Calculation of Nonperturbative Terms in Open String Models

Authors: Julie D. Blum

Journal-ref: Nucl.Phys. B634 (2002) 3-22

Nonperturbative corrections in type II string theory corresponding to Riemannsurfaces with one boundary are calculated in several noncompact geometries ofdesingularized orbifolds. One of these models has a complicated phase structurewhich is explored. A general condition for integrality of the numericalinvariants is discussed.
