5.2, references addedThe universal perturbative invariants of rational homology spheres can beextracted from the Chern-Simons partition function by combining perturbativeand nonperturbative results. We spell out the general procedure to computethese invariants, and we work out in detail the case of Seifert spaces. Byextending some previous results of Lawrence and Rozansky, the Chern-Simonspartition function with arbitrary simply-laced group for these spaces iswritten in terms of matrix integrals. The analysis of the perturbativeexpansion amounts to the evaluation of averages in a Gaussian ensemble ofrandom matrices. As a result, explicit expressions for the universalperturbative invariants of Seifert homology spheres up to order five arepresented.
