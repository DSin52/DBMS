The present article analyses the impact on cosmology, in particular on theevolution of cosmological perturbations, of the existence of extra-dimensions.The model considered here is that of a five-dimensional Anti-de Sitterspacetime where ordinary matter is confined to a brane-universe. Thehomogeneous cosmology is recalled. The equations governing the evolution ofrewritten in a form very close to the equations of standard cosmology with twohomogeneous solution, which change the background-dependent coefficients of theequations; b. corrections due to the curvature along the fifth dimension, whichact as source terms in the evolution equations.
