We discuss a magnetic black-hole solution to the equations of motion of thestring-loop-corrected effective action. At the string-tree level, this solutionis the extremal magnetic black hole described by the "chiral null model." Inthe extremal case, the string-loop correction is constant, and this fact isused to analytically solve the loop-corrected equations of motion. Indistinction to the tree-level solution, the resulting loop-corrected solutionhas the horizon at a finite distance from the origin; its location is afunction of the loop correction. The loop-corrected configuration is comparedwith a string-tree-level non-extremal magnetic black hole solution which alsohas the horizon at a finite distance from the origin. We find that for anappropriate choice of the free parameters of solutions, the loop-correctedmagnetic black hole can be approximated by a tree-level non-extremal solution.We compare the thermodynamic properties of the loop-corrrected and non-extremalsolutions.
