The spin-4/3 fractional superstring is characterized by a world-sheet chiralalgebra involving spin-4/3 currents. The discussion of the tree-levelscattering amplitudes of this theory presented in hepth/9310131 is expanded toinclude amplitudes containing two twisted-sector states. These amplitudes areshown to satisfy spurious state decoupling. The restriction to only twoexternal twisted-sector states is due to the absence of an appropriatedimension-one vertex describing the emission of a single twisted-sector state.This is analogous to the ``old covariant'' formalism of ordinary superstringamplitudes in which an appropriate dimension-one vertex for the emission of aRamond-sector state is lacking. Examples of tree scattering amplitudes arecalculated in a c=5 model of the spin-4/3 chiral algebra realized in terms offree bosons on the string world-sheet. The target space of this model isthree-dimensional flat Minkowski space-time and the twisted-sector physicalstates are fermions in space-time. Since the critical central charge of thespin-4/3 fractional superstring theory is 10, this c=5 model is not consistentat the string loop level.
