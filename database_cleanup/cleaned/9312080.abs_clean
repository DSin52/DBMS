The scalar functional determinants on sectors of the two-dimensional disc andspherical cap are determined for arbitrary angles (rational factors of $\pi$).The wholesphere and hemisphere expressions are also given, in low dimensions,for both the ordinary and the conformal Laplacian. Comparisons are made withother work.
