Title: More on counterterms in the gravitational action and anomalies

Comments: 18 pages, ReVTeX, references and section added, typos corrected

The addition of boundary counterterms to the gravitational action ofasymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes permits us to define the partitionfunction unambiguously without background subtraction. We show that theinclusion of p-form fields in the gravitational action requires the addition offurther counterterms which we explicitly identify. We also relate logarithmicdivergences in the action dependent on the matter fields to anomalies in thedual conformal field theories. In particular we find that the anomaly predictedfor the correlator of the stress energy tensor and two vector currents in fourdimensions agrees with that of the ${\cal{N}} = 4$ superconformal SU(N) gaugetheory.
