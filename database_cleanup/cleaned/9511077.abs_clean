In general bosonic closed string backgrounds the ghost-dilaton is not theonly state in the semi-relative BRST cohomology that can change thedimensionless string coupling. This fact is used to establish complete dilatontheorems in closed string field theory. The ghost-dilaton, however, is thestring coupling becomes an unobservable parameter of the string action. Forbackgrounds where the matter CFT includes free uncompactified bosons weintroduce a refined BRST problem by including the zero-modes "x" of the bosonsas legal operators on the complex. We argue that string field theory can bedefined on this enlarged complex and that its BRST cohomology capturesaccurately the notion of a string background. In this complex the ghost-dilatonappears to be the only BRST-physical state changing the string coupling.
