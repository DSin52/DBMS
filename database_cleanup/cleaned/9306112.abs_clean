modifications in the demonstrations and the referencesWe describe the $R$-matrix structure associated with integrable extensions,containing both one-body and two-body potentials, of the $A_N$ Calogero-Moser$N$-body systems. We construct non-linear, finite dimensional Poisson algebrasof observables. Their $N\rightarrow \infty$ limit realize the infinite Lie algebras Sdiff$({\Bbb R}\times S_1 )$ in the trigonometric case andSdiff$({\Bbb R }^2)$ in the rational case. It is then isomorphic to thealgebra of observables constructed in the two-dimensional collective stringfield theory.
