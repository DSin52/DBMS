We consider the possibility of using the hierarchical approximation tounderstand the continuum limit of a reformulation of the 3D Ising modelinitiated by Polyakov. We introduce several new formulations of thehierarchical model using dual or fermionic variables. We discuss severalaspects of the renormalization group transformation in terms of these newvariables. We mention a reformulation of the model closely related to stringmodels proposed by Zabrodin.
