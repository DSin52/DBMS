It is demonstrated that in the (2+1)-dimensional topologically massive gaugetheories an agreement of the Pauli-Villars regularization scheme with the otherschemes can be achieved by employing pairs of auxiliary fermions with theopposite sign masses. This approach does not introduce additional violation ofdiscrete (P and T) symmetries. Although it breaks the local gauge symmetry onlyin the regulator fields' sector, its trace disappears completely after removingthe regularization as a result of superrenormalizability of the model. It isshown also that analogous extension of the Pauli-Villars regularization in thevector particle sector can be used to agree the arbitrary covariant gaugeresults with the Landau ones. The source of ambiguities in the covariant gaugesis studied in detail. It is demonstrated that in gauges that are softer in theinfrared region (e.g. Coulomb or axial) nonphysical ambiguities inherent to thecovariant gauges do not arise.
