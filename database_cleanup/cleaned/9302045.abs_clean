The Poincare invariance in the temporal gauge canonical quantization of QCDis shown manifestly by verifying the energy-momentum-vector andangular-momentum-tensor satisfy the Poincare algebra in the physical Hilbertspace. Two different values of \(\theta\) for the $\theta$-term in QCDlagrangian lead to different representations of the Poincare group, which are,however, connected by an unitary transformation. Thus the parameter \(\theta\)becomes physically irrelevant unless we can further restrict the physicalHilbert space.
