We carry out the extension of the Ostrogradski method to relativistic fieldtheories. Higher-derivative Lagrangians reduce to second differential-orderwith one explicit independent field for each degree of freedom. We consider ahigher-derivative relativistic theory of a scalar field and validate a powerfulorder-reducing covariant procedure by a rigorous phase-space analysis. Thephysical and ghost fields appear explicitly. Our results strongly support theformal covariant methods used in higher-derivative gravity.
