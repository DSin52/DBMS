We have calculated interactions between two fuzzy spheres in 3 dimension. Itdepends on the distance r between the spheres and the radii rho_1, rho_2. Thereis no force between the spheres when they are far from each other (longdistance case). We have also studied the interaction for r=0 case. We find thatan attractive force exists between two fuzzy sphere surfaces.
