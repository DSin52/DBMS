The nonlinear realization of the superconformal symmetry in two dimensions isconsidered. The superconformal symmetry is realized by means of dimension$-1/2$\ Nambu-Goldstone fermion $\xi$\ and its dimension 3/2 conjugate $\eta$.A matter coupling of these Nambu- Goldstone fermions reproduce the realizationfound by Berkovits and Vafa to show the equivalence between the bosonic stringand a $N=1$\ superstring. This indicates that this equivalence is a result ofthe super Higgs mechanism as a two dimensional field theory, in which the NGfermions become unphysical.
