An expression for the curvature of the "covariant" determinant line bundle isgiven in even dimensional space-time. The usefulness is guaranteed by itsprediction of the covariant anomaly and Schwinger term. It allows a parallelderivation of the consistent anomaly and Schwinger term, and their covariantcounterparts, which clarifies the similarities and differences between them. Inparticular, it becomes clear that in contrary to the case for anomalies, thedifference between the consistent and covariant Schwinger term can not beextended to a local form on the space of gauge potentials.
