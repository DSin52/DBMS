We describe deformations of non-linear (birational) representations ofdiscrete groups generated by involutions, having their origin in the theory ofthe symmetric five-state Potts model. One of the deformation parameters can beseen as the number $q$ of states of a chiral Potts models. This analogy becomesexact when $q$ is a Fermat number. We analyze the stability of thecorresponding dynamics, with a particular attention to orbits of finite order.
