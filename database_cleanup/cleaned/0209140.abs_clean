A new, recursive method of calculating matrix elements of polynomialhamiltonians is proposed. It is particularly suitable for the recent algebraicstudies of the supersymmetric Yang-Mills quantum mechanics in any dimensions.For the D=2 system with the SU(2) gauge group, considered here, the techniquegives exact, closed expressions for arbitrary matrix elements of thehamiltonian and of the supersymmetric charge, in the occupation numberrepresentation. Subsequent numerical diagonalization provides the spectrum andrestricted Witten index of the system with very high precision (taking intoaccount up to $10^5$ quanta).Independently, the exact value of the restricted Witten index is derivedanalytically for the first time.
