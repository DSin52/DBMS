in the Proceedings of the NSERC-CAP Workshop on Quantum Groups, IntegrableModels and Statistical Systems, Kingston, Canada 13 -17 July 1992)We review how to obtain the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) equations forthe antiferromagnetic Heisenberg ring in an external magnetic field. We reviewhow to solve these equations for low temperature and small field, and calculatethe specific heat and magnetic susceptibility.
