Recently we showed that the spectral flow acting on the N=2 twistedtopological theories gives rise to a topological algebra automorphism. Here wepoint out that the untwisting of that automorphism leads to a spectral flow onthe untwisted N=2 superconformal algebra which is different from the usual one.This "other" spectral flow does not interpolate between the chiral ring and theantichiral ring. In particular, it maps the chiral ring into the chiral ringand the antichiral ring into the antichiral ring. We discuss the similaritiesand differences between both spectral flows. We also analyze their action onnull states.
