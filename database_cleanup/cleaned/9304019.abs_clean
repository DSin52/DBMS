We consider the $C_2$ Toda theory in the reduced WZNW framework. Analysingthe classical representation space of the symmetry algebra (which is thecorresponding $C_2$ $W$ algebra) we determine its classical highest weightrepresentations. We quantise the model promoting only the relevant quantitiesto operators. Using the quantised equation of motion we determine the selectionrules for the $u$ field that corresponds to one of the Toda fields and giverestrictions for its amplitude functions and for the structure of the Hilbertspace of the model.
