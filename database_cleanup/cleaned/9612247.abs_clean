Using a description of defects in solids in terms of three-dimensionalgravity, we study the propagation of electrons in the background ofdisclinations and screw dislocations. We study the situations where there arebound states that are effectively localized on the defect and hence can bedescribed in terms of an effective 1+1 dimensional field theory for the lowenergy excitations. In the case of screw dislocations, we find that theseexcitations are chiral and can be described by an effective field theory ofchiral fermions. Fermions of both chirality occur even for a given direction ofthe magnetic field. The ``net'' chirality of the system however is not alwaysthe same for a given direction of the magnetic field, but changes from one signof the chirality through zero to the other sign as the Fermi momentum or themagnitude of the magnetic flux is varied. On coupling to an externalelectromagnetic field, the latter becomes anomalous, and predicts novelconduction properties for these materials.
