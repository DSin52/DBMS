We show how to use quantum mechanics on the group manifold U(N) as a tool forproblems in U(N) representation theory. The quantum mechanics reduces to freefermions on the circle, which in the large N limit become relativistic. Thetheory can be bosonized giving the Das-Jevicki-Sakita collective field theory.The formalism is particularly suited to problems involving tensor productmultiplicity (Littlewood-Richardson) coefficients. As examples, we discuss thepartition function of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory on the sphere, and thezero magnetic field limit of D-dimensional Eguchi-Kawai Yang-Mills theory. Wegive the leading O(N^0) solution of the latter theory, using a method whichallows computing corrections. Largely (but not completely) superseded byhep-th/9311130.
