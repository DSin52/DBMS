Authors: M.V.Altaisky

Comments: 9 pages, AMS-LaTeX

The $\phi^4$ field model is generalized to the case when the field $\phi(x)$$d\mu(x)$ is the left-invariant measure on a locally compact group $G$. For theFeynman perturbation expansion for the Green functions is shown to have noultra-violet divergences for certain choice of $\lambda(a) \sim a^\nu$.
