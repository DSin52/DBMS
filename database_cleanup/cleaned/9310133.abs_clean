The sector of zero $Z_{N}$-charge is studied for the ferromagnetic (FM) andantiferromagnetic (AFM) version of the $Z_{N}\times Z_{2}$ invariantFateev-Zamolodchikov quantum spin chain. We conjecture that the relevant Betheansatz equations should admit, beside the usual string-like solutions,exceptional multiplets, and a number of non-physical solutions. Once thephysical ones are identified, we show how to get completeness and the gaplessexcitation spectrum. The central charge is computed from the specific heat andfound to be $c=2\frac{N-1}{N+2}$ (FM) and $c=1$ (AFM).
