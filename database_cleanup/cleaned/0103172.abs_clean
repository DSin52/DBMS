Title: Nonperturbative Operator Quantization of Strongly Nonlinear Fields

Authors: V. Dzhunushaliev

Comments: minor corrections

At present an algebra of strongly interacting fields is unknown. In thispaper it is assumed that the operators of strongly nonlinear field can form anon-associative algebra. It is shown that such algebra can be described as analgebra of some pairs. The comparison of presented techniques with the Green'sfunctions method in the superconductivity theory is made. A possibleapplication to the QCD and High-T$_c$ superconductivity theory is discussed.
