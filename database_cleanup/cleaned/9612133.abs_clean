We derive closed recursion equations for the symmetric polynomials occuringin the form factors of $D_n^{(1)}$ affine Toda field theories. These equationsfollow from kinematical- and bound state residue equations for the full formfactor. We also discuss the equations arising from second and third orderforward channel poles of the S-matrix. The highly symmetric case of $D_4^{(1)}$form factors is treated in detail. We calculate explicitly cases with a fewparticles involved.
