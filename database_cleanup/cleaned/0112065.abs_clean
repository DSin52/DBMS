We reanalyse the gravitational couplings of the perturbative orientifoldplanes $Op^-$, $Op^+$ (and D-branes). We first compute their $D_{-1}$instantonic corrections for $p=3$. Then, by using U-dualities, we obtain theWess-Zumino terms of orientifolds with RR flux for $p \leq 5$. The expressionsfor the effective actions can be partially checked via M-theory. We point out aprevious oversimplification and we show in fact that the difficulty stillstands in the way of the full computation of 7 Brane instanton corrections.
