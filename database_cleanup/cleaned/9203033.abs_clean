We discuss time - dependent solutions of the leading order string effectiveequations for a non-zero central charge deficit and curved maximally symmetricspace. Some regular solutions are found for the case of non-trivialantisymmetric tensor and vector backgrounds (in various dimensions) andnegative spatial curvature. It remains an open question which conformaltheories are exact generalisations of these solutions.
