We find a general principle which allows one to compute the area of thehorizon of N=2 extremal black holes as an extremum of the central charge. Oneconsiders the ADM mass equal to the central charge as a function of electricand magnetic charges and moduli and extremizes this function in the modulispace (a minimum corresponds to a fixed point of attraction). The extremalvalue of the square of the central charge provides the area of the horizon,which depends only on electric and magnetic charges. The doubling of unbrokensupersymmetry at the fixed point of attraction for N=2 black holes near thehorizon is derived via conformal flatness of the Bertotti-Robinson-typegeometry. These results provide an explicit model independent expression forthe macroscopic Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of N=2 black holes which ismanifestly duality invariant. The presence of hypermultiplets in the solutiondoes not affect the area formula. Various examples of the general formula aredisplayed. We outline the attractor mechanism in N=4,8 supersymmetries and therelation to the N=2 case. The entropy-area formula in five dimensions, recentlydiscussed in the literature, is also seen to be obtained by extremizing the 5dcentral charge.
