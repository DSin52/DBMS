The cylinder diagrams that determine the static interactions between pairs ofDp-branes in the type IIB plane wave background are evaluated. The resultingexpressions are elegant generalizations of the flat-space formulae that dependon the value of the Ramond-Ramond flux of the background in a non-trivialmanner. The closed-string and open-string descriptions consistently transforminto each other under a modular transformation only when each of theinteracting D-branes separately preserves half the supersymmetries. Theseresults are derived for configurations of euclidean signatureD(p+1)-instantons but also generalize to lorentzian signature Dp-branes.
