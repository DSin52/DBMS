This paper examines the causal structure of the commutator of two stringfields, in free light-cone string field theory. By treating the commutator as adistribution on infinite dimensional loop space, it is shown that thecommutator vanishes when $\int d\ss (\delta X(\ss))^2 <0$. Of more directphysical interest is the commutator of finite mass fields, obtained by smearingthe string fields with appropriate wave functions. This is shown to vanish atspacelike separations, reproducing the usual point particle field theoryresult. The implications of this for the information spreading mechanismproposed by Susskind to solve the black hole information problem are discussed.Finally, it is verified that the above conclusions also hold for thesuperstring.
