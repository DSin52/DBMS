The theory of the string in interaction with a dilaton background field isanalyzed. In the action considered, the metric in the world sheet of the stringis the induced metric, and the theory presents second order time derivatives.The canonical formalism is developed and it is showed that first and secondclass constraints appear. The degrees of freedoom are the same than for thefree bosonic string. The light cone gauge is used to reduce to the physicalmodes and to compute the physical hamiltonian.
