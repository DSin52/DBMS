The conditions under which noncommutative quantum mechanics and the Landauproblem are equivalent theories is explored. If the potential in noncommutativequantum mechanics is chosen as $V= \Omega \aleph$ with $\aleph$ defined in thetext, then for the value ${\tilde \theta} = 0.22 \times 10^{-11} cm^2$ (thatmeasures the noncommutative effects of the space), the Landau problem andnoncommutative quantum mechanics are equivalent theories in the lowest Landaulevel. For other systems one can find differents values for ${\tilde \theta}$and, therefore, the possible bounds for ${\tilde \theta}$ should be searched ina physical independent scenario. This last fact could explain the differentsbounds for $\tilde \theta$ found in the literature.
