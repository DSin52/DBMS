We study the `enhancon', a spherical hypersurface apparently made ofD-branes, which arises in string theory studies of large N SU(N) pure gaugetheories with eight supercharges. When the gauge theory is 2+1 dimensional, theenhancon is an S^2. A relation to charge N BPS multi-monopoles is exploited touncover many of its detailed properties. It is simply a spherical slice throughan Atiyah-Hitchin-like submanifold of the charge $N$ BPS monopole moduli space.In the form of Nahm data, it is built from the N dimensional irreduciblerepresentation of SU(2). In this sense the enhancon is a non-commutativesphere, reminiscent of the spherical `dielectric' branes of Myers.
