The equations of motion for the position and spin of a classical particlecoupled to an external electromagnetic and gravitational potential are derivedfrom an action principle. The constraints insuring a correct number ofindependent spin components are automatically satisfied. In general the spin isnot Fermi-Walker transported nor does the position follow a geodesic, althoughthe deviations are small for most situations.
