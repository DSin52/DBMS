It is shown that the matrix KP hierarchy can yield new integrable equationsin $(2+1)$-dimensions along with the corresponding Lax pair. For particulargauge choice this may result derivative and also a higher order nonlinearextension of the Devay-Stewartson equation (DSE),the higher order DSE being ahigher dimensional generalisation of the Kundu- Eckhaus equation. Such gaugetransformation is shown also to produce significant extensions to theconstrained matrix KP system.
