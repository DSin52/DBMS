We quantize the Maxwell Chern Simons theory in a geometric representationthat generalizes the Abelian Loop Representation of Maxwell theory. We findthat in the physical sector, the model can be seen as the theory of a masslesscalar field with a topological interaction that enforces the wave functionalto be multivalued. This feature allows to relate the Maxwell Chern Simonstheory with the quantum mechanics of particles interacting through a ChernSimons field
