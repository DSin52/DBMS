We re-examine three issues, the Hopf term, fractional spin and the solitonoperators, in the 2+1 dimensional O(3) nonlinear sigma model based on theadjoint orbit parameterization (AOP) introduced earlier. It is shown that theHopf Term is well-defined for configurations of any soliton charge $Q$ if weadopt a time independent boundary condition at spatial infinity. We thendevelop the Hamiltonian formulation of the model in the AOP and thereby arguethat the well-known $Q^2$-formula for fractional spin holds only for arestricted class of configurations. Operators which create states of givenclassical configurations of any soliton number in the (physical) Hilbert spaceare constructed. Our results clarify some of the points which are crucial forthe above three topological issues and yet have remained obscure in theliterature.
