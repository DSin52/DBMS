We study the manifestly covariant three-dimensional symmetric Chern-Simonsaction in terms of the Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization method. We find that theLorentz covariant gauge fixed version of this action is reduced to the usualChern-Simons type action after a proper field redefinition. Furthermore, therenormalizability of the symmetric Chern-Simons theory turns out to be the sameas that of the original Chern-Simons theory.
