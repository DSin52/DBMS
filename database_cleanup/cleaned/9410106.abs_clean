Title: Multiparameter quantum function algebra at roots of 1

Comments: 22 pages

We study the theory of representations of a multiparameter deformation of thefunction algebra of a simple algebraic group (as defined by Reshetikhin) whenthe quantum parameter is a root of unity. We extend the technics of DeConcini-Lyubashenko in the standard quantum case.
