We quantize the topological $\sigma$-model. The quantum master equation ofthe Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism $\Delta_\rho \Psi = 0$ appears as a conditionwhich eliminates the exact states from the BRST invariant states $\Psi$ definedby $Q \Psi = 0$. The phase space of the BV formalism is a supermanifold with aspecific symplectic structure, called the fermionic K\"ahler manifold.
