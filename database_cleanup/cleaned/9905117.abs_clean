We perform the gauge-fixing of the theory of a chiral two-form boson in sixdimensions starting from the action given by Pasti, Sorokin and Tonin. We usethe Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, introducing antifields and writing down anextended action satisfying the classical master equation. Then we gauge-fix thethree local symmetries of the extended action in two different ways.
