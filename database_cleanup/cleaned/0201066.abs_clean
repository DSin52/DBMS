We apply methods of dynamical systems to study the behaviour of theRandall-Sundrum models. We determine evolutionary paths for all possibleinitial conditions in a 2-dimensional phase space and we investigate the set ofaccelerated models. The simplicity of our formulation in comparison to some2-dimensional Hamiltonian system, and what is more advantageous, it is freefrom the degeneracy of critical points so that the system is structurallystable. The phase plane analysis of Randall-Sundrum models with isotropicFriedmann geometry clearly shows that qualitatively we deal with the same typesof evolution as in general relativity, although quantitatively there areimportant differences.
