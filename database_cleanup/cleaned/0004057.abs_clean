Title: Cosmological Constant and Fermi-Bose Degeneracy

Comments: 15 pages, Latex

We study some cases in D=4 and in infinite-volume high dimensional theorieswhen unbroken supersymmetry in the vacuum cannot guarantee Fermi-Bosedegeneracy among excited states. In 4D we consider an example in which bothsupersymmetry and $R$ symmetry are unbroken in the vacuum, and the cosmologicalconstant vanishes. However, theory admits solitons that do not allow existenceof conserved supercharges. These objects are magnetically charged globalmonopoles which in some respect behave as point-like particles, but create asolid angle deficit which eliminates asymptotically covariantly constantspinors and lifts Fermi-Bose degeneracy of the spectrum. The idea is that insome "dual" description monopoles with global topological number and gaugemagnetic charge may be replaced by electrically chaged particles with globalNoether charges, e.g., such as baryon number. Alternatively theories withinfinite volume extra dimensions may support unbroken bulk supersymmetrywithout Fermi-Bose degeneracy in the brane spectrum. We suggest a scenario inwhich brane is a source similar to a global monopole embedded in 3 infiniteextra dimensions. Brane produces a deficit angle at infinity and may localize ameta-stable 4D graviton. Although bulk cosmological constant is zero, conservedsupercharges can not be defined on such a background.
