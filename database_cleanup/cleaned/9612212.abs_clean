We consider a particular 4-dimensional generalization of the transition fromthe Heisenberg to the Schr\"odinger picture. The space-time independentexpansion with respect to the unitary irreducible representations of theLorentz group is applied, as Fourier transformation in the Heisenberg picture,to the states of a massive relativistic particle. A new Hamiltonian operatorhas been found for such a particle with spin one.
