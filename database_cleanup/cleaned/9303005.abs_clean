Higher-derivative generalization of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics isproposed. It is formally based on the standard superalgebra but superchargesinvolve differential operators of the order $n$. As a result, theiranticommutator entails polynomial of a Hamiltonian. The Witten index does notcharacterize spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in such models.
