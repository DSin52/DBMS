PhysA geometric relationship between loop quantum gravity and partitioned(triangulated) string theory is discussed. Combinatorial analysis reveals thatthree spatial and three curvature dimensions, intrinsic to the partitionedstring, are necessary to replicate Standard Model particles and interactions.This analysis has established that particulate mass is determined by afunctional relationship involving these six extra dimensions. The combinatorialanalysis involves non-commutative 3D-matrix algebra which forms themathematical underpinnings of Dirac notation. The functional relationship(symbolized by Beth) requires exponential, Randall-Sundrum, scaling to computemass. Through the proper interpretation of complex gravity a cycliccosmological model is developed. This formulation of cyclic cosmologyinherently involves observed dark energy. Thus, a comprehensive theory isconstructed from geometric fundamentals which models both massive, oscillatingneutrinos and the current epoch of mini-inflation.
