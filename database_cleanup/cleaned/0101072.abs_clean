Working in light-cone coordinates, we study the zero-modes and the vacuum ina 2+1 dimensional SU(3) gauge model. Considering the fields as independent ofthe tranverse variables, we dimensionally reduce this model to 1+1 dimensions.After introducing an appropriate su(3) basis and gauge conditions, we extractan adjoint field from the model. Quantization of this adjoint field and fieldequations lead to two constrained and two dynamical zero-modes. We link thedynamical zero-modes to the vacuum by writing down a Schrodinger equation andprove the non-degeneracy of the SU(3) vacuum provided that we neglect thecontribution of constrained zero-modes.
