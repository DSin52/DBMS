An analytical approximation of $<T_{\mu\nu}>$ for a quantized scalar field ina static spherically symmetric spacetime with a topology $S^2 \times R^2$ isobtained. The gravitational background is assumed slowly varying. The scalarfield is assumed to be both massive and massless, with an arbitrary coupling$\xi$ to the scalar curvature and in a zero temperature vacuum state. It isdemonstrated that for some values of curvature coupling the stress-energy hasthe properties needed to support the wormhole geometry.
