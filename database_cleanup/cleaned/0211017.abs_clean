Using N=1 superspace techniques in four dimensions we show how toperturbatively compute the superpotential generated for the glueball superfieldupon integrating out massive charged fields. The technique applies to arbitrarygauge groups and representations. Moreover we show that for U(N) gauge theoriesadmitting a large N expansion the computation dramatically simplifies and weprove the validity of the recently proposed recipe for computation of thisquantity in terms of planar diagrams of matrix integrals.
