IrreversibilityAuthors: S. Maxson

Comments: 31 pages

In this third of a series of articles, we continue the study of the dynamicaltransformations of systems of correlated quantized oscillators. By includinggeneralized wave function solutions to Schr{\"o}dinger's equation belonging toa rigged Hilbert space, and by considering the algebra of observables as awhole, the presence of hyperbolic quasi-invariant measures, torus actions,ergodicity and entropy generation associated to the non-invertible decay ofGamow vectors and associated to Breit-Wigner resonances is shown. A weak(local) form of the second law of thermodynamics is demonstrated through thedecay of resonances. Both coherence formation and decoherence (decay) areassociated with irreversibility and may be associated with entropy growth.Hilbert space is the manifold of non-ergodic stationary states. There is afractal structure associated with time evolution of resonances in the space ofgeneralized states, and the statistical nature of the exponential decay may beidentified with quasi-trapping. Equilibrium states may be regarded as strangeattractors with respect to dynamical time evolution.
