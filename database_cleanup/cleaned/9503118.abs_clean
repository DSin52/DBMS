We show that a wide class of $W$-(super)algebras, including $W_N^{(N-1)}$,$U(N)$-superconformal as well as $W_N$ nonlinear algebras, can be linearized byembedding them as subalgebras into some {\em linear} (super)conformal algebraswith finite sets of currents. The general construction is illustrated by theexample of $W_4$ algebra.
