Title: Higher dimensional black holes and supersymmetry

Authors: Harvey S. Reall

Comments: 25 pages, LaTeX. v2

It has recently been shown that the uniqueness theorem for stationary blackholes cannot be extended to five dimensions. However, uniqueness is animportant assumption of the string theory black hole entropy calculations. Thispaper justifies this assumption by proving a uniqueness theorem forsupersymmetric black holes in five dimensions. Some remarks concerning generalproperties of non-supersymmetric higher dimensional black holes are made. It isconjectured that there exist new families of stationary higher dimensionalblack hole solutions with fewer symmetries than any known solution.
