Title: D = 1 Supergravity and Spinning Particles

Comments: 18 pages, a4, no figures, references added

In this paper I review the multiplet calculus of $N = 1$, $D = 1$ localsupersymmetry with applications to the construction of models for spinningparticles in background fields, and models with space-time supersymmetry. Newfeatures include a non-linear realization of the local supersymmetry algebraand the coupling to anti-symmetric tensor fields of both odd and even rank. Thenon-linear realization allows the construction of a $D = 1$cosmological-constant term, which provides a mass term in the equations ofmotion.
