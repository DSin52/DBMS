revision to incorporate further refsThe standard quantum states of $n$ complex Grassmann variables with afree-particle Lagrangian transform as a spinor of SO(2n). However, the same`free-fermion' model has a non-linearly realized $SU(n|1)$ symmetry; it can beviewed as the mechanics of a `particle' on the Grassmann-odd coset space$SU(n|1)/U(n)$. We implement a quantization of this model for which the stateswith non-zero norm transform as a representation of $SU(n|1)$, therepresentation depending on the U(1) charge of the wave-function. For $n=2$ thewave-function can be interpreted as a BRST superfield.
