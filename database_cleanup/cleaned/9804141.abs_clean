We study a system of external particles of various charges in N =4 superYang-Mills in the large N limit at finite temperature. We demonstrate that athigh enough temperature partial or complete screening of the particles canoccur. At zero temperature the total electric or magnetic charge cannot bescreened, while higher multipole moments of these charges can be screened. Thespecific case of a quark, a monopole and a dyon is worked out and the aboveproperties are verified. We also discuss the free energy of isolated particlesand show that their entropy is independent of the temperature.
