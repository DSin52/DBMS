A system containing a pair of non-BPS D-strings of type IIA string theory onan orbifold, representing a single D2-brane wrapped on a nonsupersymmetric2-cycle of a Calabi-Yau 3-fold with $(h^{(1,1)},h^{(1,2)})$ = (11,11), isanalyzed. In certain region of the moduli space the configuration is stable. Weshow that beyond the region of stability the system can decay into a pair ofnon-BPS D3-branes. At one point on the boundary of the region of stability,there exists a marginal deformation which connects the system of non-BPSD-strings to the system of non-BPS D3-branes. Across any other point on theboundary of the region of stability, the transition from the system of non-BPSD-strings to the system of non-BPS D3-branes is first order. We discuss thephase diagram in the moduli space for these configurations.
