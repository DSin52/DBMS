In a tachyon model proposed by Minahan and Zwiebach and derived in theboundary string field theory, we construct various new solutions whichcorrespond to nontrivial brane configurations in string theory. Our solutionsinclude Dp-D(p-2) bound states, (F, Dp) bound states, string junctions,D(p-2)-branes ending on a Dp-brane, D(p-2)-branes suspended between parallelDp-branes and their non-commutative generalizations. We find the Bogomol'nyibounds and the BPS equations for some of our solutions, and check the physicalconsistency of our solutions with the D-brane picture by looking at thedistributions of their energies and RR-charges in space. We also giveconjectures for a few other brane configurations.
