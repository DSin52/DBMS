We discuss the restricted linear group in infinite dimensions modeled by theSchatten class of rank $2p=4$ which contains $(3+1)$-dimensional analog of theloop groups and is closely related to Yang-Mills theory with fermions in$(3+1)$-dimensions. We give an alternative to the construction of the ``highestweight'' representation of this group found by Mickelsson and Rajeev. Ourapproach is close to quantum field theory, with the elements of this groupregarded as Bogoliubov transformations for fermions in an external Yang-Millsfield. Though these cannot be unitarily implemented in the physically relevantrepresentation of the fermion field algebra, we argue that they can beimplemented by sesquilinear forms, and that there is a (regularized) product offorms providing an appropriate group structure. On the Lie algebra level, thisgives an explicit, non-perturbative construction of fermion current algebras in$(3+1)$ space-time dimensions which explicitly shows that the ``wave functionrenormalization'' required for a consistent definition of the currents andtheir Lie bracket naturally leads to the Schwinger term identical with theMickelsson-Rajeev cocycle. Though the explicit form of the Schwinger term isgiven only for the case $p=2$, our arguments apply also to the restrictedlinear groups modeled by Schatten classes of rank $2p=6,8,\ldots$ correspondingto current algebras in $(d+1)$- dimensions, $d=5,7,\ldots$.
