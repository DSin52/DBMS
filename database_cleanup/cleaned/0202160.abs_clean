Title: Stabilization of Hyperbolic Brane-World Scenarios

Authors: Pedro J. Silva

Comments: To appear in the Conference proceedings

Physics Conference SUNY Utica/Rome NY Fall 2001In this talk we consider the issue of stabilization of compact hyperbolicbrane-world scenarios from the point of view of 4-dimensional effectivetheories. The idea is to clarify the status of stabilization for these models.Possible ways to overcome a no-go theorem that appeared in a recent paper areshown invoking the holographic framework and type IIA*/IIB* theories. A briefdiscussion on supersymmetry is also given.
