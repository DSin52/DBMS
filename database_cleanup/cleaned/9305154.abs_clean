Affine Toda theory is a relativistic integrable theory in two dimensionspossessing solutions describing a number of different species of solitons whenthe coupling is chosen to be imaginary. These nevertheless carry real energyand momentum. To each species of soliton there has to correspond an antisolitonspecies. There are two different ways of realising the antisoliton whoseequivalence is shown to follow from a surprising identity satisfied within theunderlying affine Kac-Moody group. This is the classical analogue of thecrossing property of analytic S-matrix theory. Since a complex parameterrelated to the coordinate of the soliton is inverted, this identity implies asort of modular transformation property of the soliton solution. The resultssimplify calculations of explicit soliton solutions.
