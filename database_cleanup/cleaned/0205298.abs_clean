In the context of a toy model we discuss the phenomenon of collidingfive-branes, with two of the extra space dimensions compactified on tori. Inone of the branes (hidden world) the torus is magnetised. Assumingopposite-tension branes, we argue that the collision results eventually in a(time-dependent) cosmological vacuum energy, whose value today is tiny, lyingcomfortably within the standard bounds by setting the breaking of thefour-dimensional supersymmetry at a TeV scale. The small value of the vacuumenergy as compared with the supersymmetry-breaking scale is attributed totransient phenomena with relaxation times of order of the Age of the Universe.An interesting feature of the approach is the absence of a cosmic horizon,thereby allowing for a proper definition of an S-matrix.As a result of thestring non-criticality induced at the collision,our model does not provide analternative to inflation, given that arguments can be given supporting theoccurence of an inflationary phase early after the collision. The physicsbefore the collision is not relevant to our arguments on the cosmologicalconstant hierarchy, which are valid for asymptotically long times after it.
