Fractional superstrings are non-trivial generalizations of ordinarysuperstrings and heterotic strings, and have critical spacetime dimensionswhich are less than ten by virtue of a worldsheet fractional supersymmetryrelating worldsheet bosons to worldsheet parafermions. In this paper, I providea short non-technical survey of the fundamental issues involved in theserecently-proposed theories. After introducing the basic ideas which underliethese new string theories, I review their early successes and outline somerelated outstanding questions.( Talk given at the Internal Workshop on String Theory,Quantum Gravity, and the Unification of the FundamentalInteractions, held in Rome, Italy, 21-26 September 1992. )
