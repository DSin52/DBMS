We explicitly show that the Landau gauge supersymmetry of Chern-Simons theorydoes not have any physical significance. In fact, the difference between aneffective action both BRS invariant and Landau supersymmetric and an effectiveaction only BRS invariant is a finite field redefinition. Having establishedthis, we use a BRS invariant regulator that defines CS theory as the large masslimit of topologically massive Yang-Mills theory to discuss the shift $k \tok+\cv$ of the bare Chern-Simons parameter $k$ in conncection with the Landausupersymmetry. Finally, to convince ourselves that the shift above is not anaccident of our regularization method, we comment on the fact that all BRSinvariant regulators used as yet yield the same value for the shift.
