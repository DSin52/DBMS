We obtain the couplings of noncommutative branes of type II string theoriesto constant Ramond-Ramond backgrounds, for BPS as well as non-BPS branes, inthe background-independent description. For the BPS branes, we also generalizethese couplings to other descriptions, and thereby argue their equivalence tothe known couplings in the commutative description. The first part is a reviewof earlier work while the second part contains some additional observations.
