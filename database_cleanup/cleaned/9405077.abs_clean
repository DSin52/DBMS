We apply the methods of Field Theory to study the turbulent regimes ofstatistical systems. First we show how one can find their probabilitydensities. For the case of the theory of wave turbulence with four-waveinteraction we calculate them explicitly and study their properties. Usingthose densities we show how one can in principle calculate any correlationfunction in this theory by means of direct perturbative expansion in powers ofthe interaction. Then we give the general form of the corrections to thekinetic equation and develop an appropriate diagrammatic technique. Thistechnique, while resembling that of $\varphi^4$ theory, has many newdistinctive features. The role of the $\epsilon=d-4$ parameter is played hereby the parameter $\kappa=\beta + d - \alpha - \gamma$ where $\beta$ is thedimension of the interaction, $d$ is the space dimension, $\alpha$ is thedimension of the energy spectrum and $\gamma$ is the ``classical'' wave densitydimension. If $\kappa > 0$ then the Kolmogorov index is exact, and if $\kappa <0$ then we expect it to be modified by the interaction. For $\kappa$ a smallnegative number, $\alpha<1$ and a special form of the interaction we computethis modification explicitly with the additional assumption of the irrelevanceof the IR divergencies which still needs to be verified.
