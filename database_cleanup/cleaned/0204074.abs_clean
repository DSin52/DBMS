Towards the end of the brane inflationary epoch in the brane world, cosmicstrings (but not texture, domain walls or monopoles) are copiously producedduring brane collision. These cosmic strings are D$p$-branes with $(p-1)$dimensions compactified. We elaborate on this prediction of the superstringtheory description of the brane world. Using the data on the temperatureanisotropy in the cosmic microwave background, we estimate the cosmic stringtension $\mu$ to be around $G \mu \simeq 10^{-7}$. This in turn implies thatthe anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background comes mostly from inflation,but with a component (of order 10%) from cosmic strings. This cosmic stringeffect should also be observable in gravitational wave detectors and maybe evenpulsar timing measurements.Cosmology
