A new aspect of the vacuum structure of 2+1-dimensional Thirring model ispresented. Using the Fierz identity, we split the current-current four-Fermiinteraction in terms of a matrix valued auxiliary scalar field and compute itseffective potential. Energy consideration shows that contrary to earlierexpectations, parity in general is spontaneously broken at any finite order ofN, where N is the number of the two component spinors. In the large N limit,there does not exist a stable vacuum of the theory thereby making theapplication of the large N limit to Thirring model dangerous. A detailedanalysis for parity breaking solutions in N=2,3 cases is given.
