correctedThe problem of interpretation of the \hbar^0-order part of radiativecorrections to the effective gravitational field is considered. It is shownthat variations of the Feynman parameter in gauge conditions fixing the generalcovariance are equivalent to spacetime diffeomorphisms. This result is provedfor arbitrary gauge conditions at the one-loop order. It implies that thegravitational radiative corrections of the order \hbar^0 to the spacetimemetric can be physically interpreted in a purely classical manner. As anexample, the effective gravitational field of a black hole is calculated in thefirst post-Newtonian approximation, and the secular precession of a testparticle orbit in this field is determined.
