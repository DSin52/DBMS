Title: Some New/Old Approaches to QCD

Comments: 20 pages

This is a talk delivered at the Meeting on Integrable Quantum Field Theories,Villa Olmo and at STRINGS 1992, Rome, September 1992. I discuss some recentattempts to revive two old ideas regarding an analytic approach to QCD-thedevelopment of a string representation of the theory and the large N limit ofQCD.
