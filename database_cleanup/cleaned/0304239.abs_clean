We consider the thermal properties of IIA string theory on the pp-wave whichcomes from the circle compactification of the maximally supersymmetric elevendimensional pp-wave. The one-loop free energy is computed and Hagedorntemperature is found as a function of the RR-flux $\mu$. In the $\mu \to\infty$ limit, the free energy is shown to be identical with that of IIB stringtheory on maximally supersymmetric pp-wave. We use two complementaryapproaches, operator and path integral methods. Several points, including thezero point energy and the modular properties of the free energy, are moreilluminating and transparent in the path integral method. We find the completeagreement between those two approaches in the free energy expression and thedependency of the Hagedorn temperature on the RR-flux.
