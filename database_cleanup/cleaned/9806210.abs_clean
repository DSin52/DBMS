In some recent papers it is claimed that the physical significance of thevacuum angle theta for QCD-like theories depends on the chosen gauge condition.We criticise the arguments that were given in support of this claim, and showby explicit construction for the case of QED$_2$ that and why they fail,confirming thereby the commonly accepted point of view.
