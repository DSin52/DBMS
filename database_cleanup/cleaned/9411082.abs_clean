Title: $W_{\infty}$ Algebras and Incompressibility in the Quantum Hall Effect

Comments: 7 pages, plainTEX, talk presented in Mt. Sorak Summer School, Korea,

June 1994 and XXth Int. Colloquium on Group Theor. Methods in Physics, Osaka,Japan, July 1994We discuss how a large class of incompressible quantum Hall states can becharacterized as highest weight states of different representations of the\Winf algebra. Second quantized expressions of the \Winf generators areexplicitly derived in the cases of multilayer Hall states, the states proposedby Jain to explain the hierarchical filling fractions and the ones related byparticle-hole conjugation.
