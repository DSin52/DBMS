Authors: Egor Bugrij, Alexei Mishchenko, Yurii Sitenko (Bogolyubov Institute

for Theoretical Physics)Comments: Talk given at the International Workshop dedicated to the 70th

anniversary of Professor Walter Thirring's birth "Mathematical Physics --today, Priority Technologies -- for tomorrow", Kiev, Ukraine, May 12-17,1997, 11 pages, LaTeX209, added acknowledgmentsThe problem of the scattering of a charged test particle in the gravitationalbackground of axially symmetrical wormhole in the presence of the Aharonov-Bohmtype magnetic field is considered. It is shown that the natural mathematicalframework appropriate for the problem is the scattering theory in the pair ofHilbert spaces. Both relevant modified wave operators and $S$-matrices arefound.
