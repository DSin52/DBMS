The renormalization group approach towards the string representation of nonabelian gauge theories translates, in terms of the string sigma model betafunction equations, the renormalization group evolution of the gauge couplingconstant and Zamolodchikov`s $c$ function. Tachyon stability, glueball massgap, renormalization group evolution of the $c$ function and the area law forthe Wilson loop are studied for a critical bosonic string vacuum correspondingto a non abelian gauge theory in four dimensional space-time. We prove that thesame intrinsic geometry for the string vacuum is universal in some sense,reproducing the Yang-Mills beta function to arbitrary loop order inperturbation theory.
