We study aspects of confinement in the M theory fivebrane version of QCD(MQCD). We show heavy quarks are confined in hadrons (which take the form ofmembrane-fivebrane bound states) for N=1 and softly broken N=2 SU(Nc) MQCD. Weexplore and clarify the transition from the exotic physics of the latter to thestandard physics of the former. In particular, the many strings andquark-antiquark mesons found in N=2 field theory by Douglas and Shenker arereproduced. It is seen that in the N=1 limit all but one such meson disappearswhile all of the strings survive. The strings of softly broken N=2, N=1, andeven non-supersymmetric SU(Nc) MQCD have a common ratio for their tensions as afunction of the amount of flux they carry. We also comment on the almost BPSproperties of the Douglas-Shenker strings and discuss the brane picture formonopole confinement on N=2 QCD Higgs branches.
