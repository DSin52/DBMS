We introduce an orbifold induction procedure which provides a systematicconstruction of cyclic orbifolds, including their twisted sectors. Theprocedure gives counterparts in the orbifold theory of all thecurrent-algebraic constructions of conformal field theory and enables us tofind the orbifold characters and their modular transformation properties.
