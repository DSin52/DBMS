We construct an off-shell N=3 supersymmetric extension of the abelian D=4Born-Infeld action starting from the action of supersymmetric Maxwell theory inN=3 harmonic superspace. A crucial new feature of the N=3 super BI action isthat its interaction part contains only terms of the order 4k in the N=3superfield strengths. The correct component bosonic BI action arises as theresult of elimination of auxiliary tensor field which is present in theoff-shell N=3 vector multiplet in parallel with the gauge field strength. Inthis new Legendre-type representation, the bosonic BI action is fully specifiedby a real function of the single variable quartic in the auxiliary tensorfield. The generic choice of this function amounts to a wide set of self-dualnonlinear extensions of the Maxwell action. All of them admit an off-shell N=3supersymmetrization.
