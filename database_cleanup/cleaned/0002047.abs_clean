There are at least two serious moduli problems in string cosmology. The firstis the possibility that moduli dominate the energy density at the time ofnucleosynthesis. The second is that they may not find their minima alltogether. After reviewing some previously proposed solutions to these problems,symmetry. The dilaton has a potential similar to those of racetrack models; itis very massive and its dynamics do not break supersymmetry. The dilaton isable to find the minimum of its potential because the energy is dominated bynon-zero momentum modes. This energy need not be thermal. The effectivepotential for the dilaton is quite different from its flat space form. Ifcertain conditions are satisfied, the dilaton settles into the desired minimum;if not, it is forced to weak coupling.
