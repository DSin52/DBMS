Conference on Physics, June 2002, Moscow, RussiaBraneworld effective action for two-brane model is constructed by twodifferent methods based respectively on the Dirichlet and Neumann boundaryvalue problems. The equivalence of these methods is shown due to nontrivialduality relations between special boundary operators of these two problems.
