Levinson's theorem for the Dirac equation is known in the form of a sum ofpositive and negative energy phase shifts at zero momentum related to the totalnumber of bound states. In this letter we prove a stronger version ofLevinson's theorem valid for positive and negative energy phase shiftsseparately. The surprising result is, that in general the phase shifts for eachsign of the energy do not give the number of bound states with the same sign ofthe energy (in units of $\pi$), but instead, are related to the number of boundstates of a certain Schr\"odinger equation, which coincides with the Diracequation at zero momentum.
