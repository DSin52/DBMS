Actions for two-superparticle system in (10,2) dimensions andthree-superparticle systems in (11,3) dimensions are constructed. These actionshave worldline bosonic and fermionic local symmetries, and target space globalsupersymmety generalizing the reparametrization, kappa-symmetry and Poincaresupersymmetry of the usual superparticle. With the second particle, or thesecond and third particles on-shell, they describe a superparticle propagatingin the background of a second superparticle in (10,2) dimensions, or two othersuperparticles in (11,3) dimensions. Symmetries of the action are shown toexist in presence of super Yang-Mills background as well.
