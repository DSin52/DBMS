446-460We discuss the path integral representation for the fermionic particles andstrings and concentrate at the problems arising when some target-spacedimensions are compact. An example of partition function for fermionic particleat finite temperature or with one compact target-space dimension is consideredin detail. It is demonstrated that the first-quantized path integral requires,in general, presence of nonvanishing "Wilson loops" and modulo some commonproblems for real fermions in Grassmannian formulation one can try toreinterpret them in terms of condensates of the world-line fermions. Theproperties of corresponding path integrals in string theory are also discussed.
