We construct the general form of matter coupled N=4 gauged supergravity infive dimensions. Depending on the structure of the gauge group, these theoriesare found to involve vector and/or tensor multiplets. When self-dual tensorfields are present, they must be charged under a one-dimensional Abelian groupand cannot transform non-trivially under any other part of the gauge group. Ashort analysis of the possible ground states of the different types of theoriesis given. It is found that AdS ground states are only possible when the gaugegroup is a direct product of a one-dimensional Abelian group and a semi-simplegroup. In the purely Abelian, as well as in the purely semi-simple gauging, atmost Minkowski ground states are possible. The existence of such Minkowskiground states could be proven in the compact Abelian case.
