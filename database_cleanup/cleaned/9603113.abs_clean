It is shown that many of the conjectured dualities involving orbifoldcompactification of M-theory follow from the known dualities involving M-theoryand string theory in ten dimensions, and the ansatz that orbifolding procedurecommutes with the duality transformation. This ansatz also leads to a newduality conjecture, namely that M-theory compactified on $T^8/Z_2$ is dual totype I string theory on $T^7$. In this case the `twisted sector states' inM-theory live on sixteen membranes transverse to the internal manifold.
