Since the first attempts to quantize Gauge Theories and Gravity in the looprepresentation, the problem of the determination of the corresponding classicalactions has been raised. Here we propose a general procedure to determine theseactions and we explicitly apply it in the case of electromagnetism. Going tothe lattice we show that the electromagnetic action in terms of loops isequivalent to the Wilson action, allowing to do Montecarlo calculations in agauge invariant way. In the continuum these actions need to be regularized andthey are the natural candidates to describe the theory in a ``confiningphase''.
