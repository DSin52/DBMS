Title: Open Inflation, the Four Form and the Cosmological Constant

Comments: 11 pages, RevTex file. Replaced version contains major corrections,

including a crucial new surface term, and important additions. A connectionto eleven dimensional supergravity is made. The anthropic solution of thecosmological constant problem now holds with a real four form in theLorentzian region. The previously claimed solution to the empty universeproblem is shown to be incorrect, but a new solution is suggestedJournal-ref: Phys.Lett. B432 (1998) 271-278

Fundamental theories of quantum gravity such as supergravity include a fourform field strength which contributes to the cosmological constant. Theinclusion of such a field into our theory of open inflation (hep-th/9802030)allows an anthropic solution to the cosmological constant problem in which thecosmological constant gives a small but non-negligible contribution to thedensity of today's universe. We include a discussion of the role of thesingularity in our solution and a reply to Vilenkin's recent criticism(hep-th/9803084).
