SystemsMany new solitary wave solutions of the recently studied Lienard equation areobtained by mapping it to the field equation of the $\phi^6-$field theory.Further, it is shown that the exact solutions of the Lienard equation are alsothe exact solutions of the various perturbed soliton equations. Besides, wealso consider a one parameter family of generalised Lienard equations andobtain exact solitary wave solutions of these equations and show that these arealso the exact solutions of the various other generalised nonlinear equations.
