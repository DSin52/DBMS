Closed string field theory leads to a generalization of Lie algebra whicharose naturally within mathematics in the study of deformations of algebraicstructures. It also appeared in work on higher spin particles \cite{BBvD}.Representation theoretic analogs arose in the mathematical analysis of theBatalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky approach to constrained Hamiltonians. A major goalof this paper is to see the relevant formulas, especially in closed stringfield theory, as a generalization of those for a differential graded Liealgebra, hopefully describing the mathematical essentials in terms accessibleto {\it physicists}.
