We review in this lecture the relation between the Maldacena Conjecture, alsoknown as AdS/CFT correspondence, and the so called Holographic principle thatseems to be an essential ingredient for a quantum gravity theory. We alsoillustrate the idea of Holography by showing that the curvature of the anti-deSitter space reduces the number of degrees of freedom making it possible tofind a mapping between a quantum theory defined on the bulk and another definedon the corresponding boundary.
