Quantum superintegrable systems in two dimensions are obtained from theirclassical counterparts, the quantum integrals of motion being obtained from thecorresponding classical integrals by a symmetrization procedure. For eachquantum superintegrable systema deformed oscillator algebra, characterized by astructure function specific for each system, is constructed, the generators ofthe algebra being functions of the quantum integrals of motion. The energyeigenvalues corresponding to a state with finite dimensional degeneracy canthen be obtained in an economical way from solving a system of two equationssatisfied by the structure function, the results being in agreement to the onesobtained from the solution of the relevant Schrodinger equation. The methodshows how quantum algebraic techniques can simplify the study of quantumsuperintegrable systems, especially in two dimensions.
