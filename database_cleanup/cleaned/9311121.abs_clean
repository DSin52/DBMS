We discuss the differential algebras used in Connes' approach to Yang-Millstheories with spontaneous symmetry breaking. These differential algebrasgenerated by algebras of the form functions $\otimes$ matrix are shown to beskew tensorproducts of differential forms with a specific matrix algebra. Forthat we derive a general formula for differential algebras based on tensorproducts of algebras. The result is used to characterize differential algebraswhich appear in models with one symmetry breaking scale.
