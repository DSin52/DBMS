We derive the current algebra of supersymmetric principal chiral models witha Wess-Zumino term. At the critical point one obtains two commuting superKac-Moody algebra as expected, but in general there are intertwining fieldsconnecting both right and left sectors, analogously to the bosonic case.Moreover, in the present supersymmetric extension we have a quadratic algebra,rather than an affine Lie algebra, due to the mixing between bosonic andfermionic fields since the purely fermionic sector displays a Lie algebra aswell.
