A generalization of the Ferber-Shirafuji formulation of superparticlemechanics is considered. The generalized model describes the dynamics of asuperparticle in a superspace extended by tensorial central charge coordinatesand commuting twistor-like spinor variables. The D=4 model contains acontinuous real parameter $a\geq 0$ and at a=0 reduces to the SU(2,2|1)supertwistor Ferber-Shirafuji model, while at a=1 one gets an OSp(1|8)supertwistor model of ref. [1] (hep-th/9811022) which describes BPS states withall but one unbroken target space supersymmetries. When 0<a<1 the model admitsan OSp(2|8) supertwistor description, and when a>1 the supertwistor groupbecomes OSp(1,1|8). We quantize the model and find that its quantum spectrumconsists of massless states of an arbitrary (half)integer helicity. Theindependent discrete central charge coordinate describes the helicity spectrum.We also outline the generalization of the a=1 model to higher space-timedimensions and demonstrate that in D=3,4,6 and 10, where the quantum states aremassless, the extra degrees of freedom (with respect to those of the standardsuperparticle) parametrize compact manifolds. These compact manifolds can beassociated with higher-dimensional helicity states. In particular, in D=10 theadditional ``helicity'' manifold is isomorphic to the seven-sphere.
