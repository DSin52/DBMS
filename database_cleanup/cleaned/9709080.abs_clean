Starting from Nahm's equations, we explore BPS magnetic monopoles in theYang-Mills Higgs theory of gauge group $Sp(4)$ which is broken to $SU(2)\timesU(1)$. A family of BPS field configurations with purely Abelian magnetic chargedescribe two identical massive monopoles and one massless monopole. Weconstruct the field configurations with axial symmetry by employing the ADHMNconstruction, and find the explicit expression of the metrics for the12-dimensional moduli space of Nahm data and its submanifolds.
