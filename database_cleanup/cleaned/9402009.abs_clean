In the sigma model approach, the $\beta$-function equations for non criticalstrings contain a term which acts like a tree level cosmological constant,$\Lambda$. We analyse the static, spherically symmetric solutions to theseequations in $d = 4$ space time and show that the curvature scalar seen by thestrings is singular if $\Lambda \ne 0$. This singularity is naked. Requiringits absence in our universe imposes the constraint $| \Lambda | < 10^{- 120}$in natural units. {}From another point of view, our analysis implies that lowenergy $d = 4$ non critical strings lead to naked singularities.
