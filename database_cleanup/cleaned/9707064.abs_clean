Title: Zamolodchikov's C-theorem and phase transitions

Comments: 12 pages, LaTeX, Poster at Summer School ``Confinment, Duality and

Non-perturbative aspects of QCD'' June 24 - July 4, 1997, Cambridge, UKWe discuss the possibility of generalizing some aspects of the C-theoremwithin two different approaches, the conventional RG and the Wilson RG flows.We show that the original Zamolodchikov's theorem is related to the existenceof the phase transitions in finite temperature QFT. We present some argumentsrelated to the holomorphic property of the low energy Wilson effective action.
