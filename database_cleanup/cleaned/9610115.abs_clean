Title: Temperature Notion in a Curved Spacetime

Authors: Carlos E. Laciana

Comments: 12 pages

Scalar radiation, represented by a massless scalar field in aRobertson-Walker metric, is taken into account. By using a weak non minimumvacuum definition, the radiation temperature as a time dependent function isobtained. When the universe evolution is nearly but non equal to $t^{1/2}$, itis possible to fit the temperature of the microwave background. A particularmassive case is compared with the massless one. When the mass of the matterfield is next to the Planck one and the time is going to infinite, a similarresult to the Hawking radiation of the blackhole is obtained.
