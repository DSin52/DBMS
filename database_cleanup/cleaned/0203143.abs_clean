Title: A New Interpretation of the Seiberg Witten Map

Authors: Subir Ghosh (Indian Statistical Institute)

Comments: Introductory part at the beginning has been elaborated and reference

section has been enlargedIn an alternative interpretation, the Seiberg-Witten map is shown to beinduced by a field dependent co-ordinate transformation connectingnoncommutative and ordinary space-times. Furthermore, following our previousideas, it has been demonstrated here that the above (field dependentco-ordinate) transformation can occur naturally in the Batalin-Tyutin extendedspace version of the relativistic spinning particle model, (in a particulargauge). There is no need to postulate the space-time non-commutativity in an
