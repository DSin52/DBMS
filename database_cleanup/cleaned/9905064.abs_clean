The decoupling limit of the D1-D5 system compactified on T^4\times S^1 has arich spectrum of U(1) charged excitations. Even though these states are not BPSin the limit, BPS considerations determine the mass and the semiclassicalentropy for a given charge vector. The dependence of the mass formula on thecompactification moduli situates the symmetric orbifold Sym^N(T^4) x T^4conformal field theory in the moduli space. A detailed analysis of the globalidentifications of the moduli space yields a picture of multiple weak-couplinglimits - one for each factorization of N into D1 and D5 charges d1 and d5=N/d1
