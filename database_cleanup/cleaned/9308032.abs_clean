The even and odd coherent states are generalized for multimode case. Theexplicit forms for the photon distribution, Q-function and Wigner function arederived. In particular, it is shown that for two-mode case there exist strongcorrelations between these modes, under certain conditions, which areresponsible for two-mode squeezing in case of even coherent states
