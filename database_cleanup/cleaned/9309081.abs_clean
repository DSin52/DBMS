The symmetries of the topological Yang-Mills theory are studied in theHamiltonian formalism and the generators of the twisted N=2 superPoincar\'ealgebra are explicitly constructed. Noting that the twisted Lorentz generatorsdo not generate the Lorentz symmetry of the theory, we relate the two byextracting from the latter the twisted version of the internal SU(2) generator.The hermiticity properties of the various generators are also consideredthroughout, and the boost generators are found to be non-hermitian. We thenrecover the BRST cohomology condition on physical states from representationtheory arguments.
