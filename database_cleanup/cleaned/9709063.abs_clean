We study the spin dependence of D-brane dynamics in the Green-Schwarzformalism of boundary states. In particular we show how to interpret insertionof supercharges on the boundary state as sources of non-universal spin effectsin D-brane potentials. In this way we find for a generic (D)p-brane, potentialsgoing like $v^{4-n}/r^{7-p+n}$ corresponding to interactions between thedifferent components of the D-brane supermultiplet. From the eleven dimensionalpoint of view, these potentials arise from the exchange of field strengthscorresponding to the graviton and the three form, coupled non-minimally to thebranes. We show how an annulus computation truncated to its masslesscontribution is enough to reproduce these next-to-leading effects, meaning inparticular that the one-loop (M)atrix theory effective action should encode allthe spin dependence of low-energy supergravity interactions.
