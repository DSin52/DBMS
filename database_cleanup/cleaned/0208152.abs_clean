We consider a 3-parametric linear deformation of the Poisson brackets inclassical mechanics. This deformation can be thought of as the classical limitof dynamics in so-called "quantized spaces". Our main result is a descriptionof the motion of a particle in the corresponding Kepler-Coulomb problem.
