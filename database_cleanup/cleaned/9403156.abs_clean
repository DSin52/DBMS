We show that the argument in Phys Rev Lett 70 (1993) 1360 is correct andconsistent, and that Hagen & Sudarshan's solution has inconsistency leading tonon-vanishing commutators of $[P^1, P^2]$ and $[P^j, H]$ even in physicalstates. This proves that many of HS's statements in their Comment are basedmerely on incorrect guess, but not on careful algebra.
