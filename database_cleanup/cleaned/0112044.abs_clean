We construct the covariant $\kappa$-symmetric superstring action for type$IIB$ superstring on plane wave space supported by Ramond-Ramond background.The action is defined as a 2d sigma-model on the coset superspace. We fix thefermionic and bosonic light-cone gauges in the covariant Green-Schwarzsuperstring action and find the light-cone string Lagrangian and theHamiltonian. The resulting light-cone gauge action is quadratic in both thebosonic and fermionic superstring 2d fields, and therefore, this model can beexplicitly quantized. We also obtain a realization of the generators of thebasic superalgebra in terms of the superstring 2d fields in the light-conegauge.
