High Energy Physics and Field Theory; Protvino, Russia, June 1995By regularizing the conical singularities by means of a segment of a sphereor pseudosphere and then taking the regulator to zero, we compute exactly theFaddeev--Popov determinant related to the conformal gauge fixing for apiece-wise flat surface with the topology of the sphere. The result is analyticin the opening angles of the conical singularities in the interval ($\pi$,$4\pi$) and in the smooth limit goes over to the continuum expression. TheRiemann-Roch relation on the dimensions of ker$(L^{\dag}L)$ andker$(LL^{\dag})$ is satisfied.
