We consider Einstein gravity coupled to a CFT made of a single free conformalscalar in 4-d Anti de Sitter space. This simple case is rich enough to explainan unexpected gravitational Higgs phenomenon that has no flat-spacecounterpart, yet simple enough that many calculations can be carried onexactly. Specifically, in this paper we compute the graviton self energy due tomatter, and we exhibit its spectral representation. This enables us to find thespin-2 bound-state content of the system.
