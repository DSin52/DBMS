Recursion relations for orthogonal polynominals, arising in the study of theone-matrix model of two-dimensional gravity, are shown to be equvalent to theequations of the Toda-chain hierarchy supplemented by additional Virasoroconstraints. This is the case without the double scaling limit. A discrete timevariable to the matrix model is introduced. The discrete time dependentpartition functions are given by $\tau$ functions which satisfy the discreteToda molecule equation. Further the relations between the matrix model and thediscrete time Toda theory are discussed.
