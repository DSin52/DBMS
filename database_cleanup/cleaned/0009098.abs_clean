High Energy Physics (ICHEP2000), July 27-August 2, Osaka, Japan, Comments andreferences addedPerturbative aspects of ultraviolet and infrared dynamics of noncommutativequantum field theory is examined in detail. It is observed that high loopmomentum contribution to the nonplanar diagram develops a new infraredsingularity with respect to the external momentum. This singular behavior isclosely related to that of ultraviolet divergence of planar diagram. It is alsoshown that such a relation is precise in noncommutative Yang-Mills theory, butthe same feature does not persist in noncommutative generalization of QED.
