Title: 2+1 Dimensional Quantum Gravity as a Gaussian Fermionic System and the

3D-Ising ModelAuthors: Giuseppe Bonacina, Maurizio Martellini and Mario Rasetti

We show that 2+1-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity is equivalent, undersome mild topological assumptions, to a Gaussian fermionic system. Inparticular, for manifolds topologically equivalent to $\Sigma_g\times\RrR$ with$\Sigma_g$ a closed and oriented Riemann surface of genus $g$, thecorresponding 2+1-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity may be related to the3D-lattice Ising model before its thermodynamic limit.
