We present a complete solution of the constraints for two-dimensional, N=2supergravity in N=2 superspace. We obtain explicit expressions for thecovariant derivatives in terms of the vector superfield $H^m$ and, for the twoversions of minimal (2,2) supergravity, a chiral or twisted chiral scalarsuperfield $\phi$.
