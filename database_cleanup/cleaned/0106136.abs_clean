Title: Aspects of noncommutative descriptions of planar systems in high

magnetic fieldsAuthors: C.D. Fosco and A. Lopez

EffectWe study some aspects of recent proposals to use the noncommutativeChern-Simons theory as an effective description of some planar condensed mattermodels in strong magnetic fields, such as the Quantum Hall Effect. We presentan alternative justification for such a description, which may be extended toother planar systems where a uniform magnetic field is present.
