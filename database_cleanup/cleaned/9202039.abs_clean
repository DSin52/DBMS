We give a criterion for the existence of a non-degenerate quasihomogeneouspolynomial in a configuration, i.e. in the space of polynomials with a fixedset of weights, and clarify the relation of this criterion to the necessarycondition derived from the formula for the Poincar\'e polynomial. We furtherprove finiteness of the number of configurations for a given value of thesingularity index. For the value 3 of this index, which is of particularinterest in string theory, a constructive version of this proof implies analgorithm for the calculation of all non-degenerate configurations.
