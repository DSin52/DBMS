Several interesting features of coset models "without fixed points" areeasily understood via Chern-Simons theory. In this paper we derive explicitformulae for the handle-squashing operator in these cosets. These operators arefixed, linear combinations of the irreducible representations of the coset. Asa simple application of these curious formulae, we compute the traces of allgenus-one operators for several common cosets. (1 Figure, at end inencapsulated postscript- to locate use 'find figs')
