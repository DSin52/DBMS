In the first order form, the model considered by Strobl presents, besideslocal Lorentz and diffeomorphism invariances, an additional local non-linearsymmetry. When the model is realized as a Poincar\'e gauge theory according tothe procedure outlined in Refs.[1,2], the generators of the non-linear symmetryare responsible for the ``nasty constraint algebra''. We show that not only thePoincar\'e gauge theoretic formulation of the model is not the cause of theemerging of the undesirable constraint algebra, but actually allows to overcomethe problem. In fact one can fix the additional symmetry without breaking thePoincar\'e gauge symmetry and the diffeomorphisms, so that, after a preliminaryDirac procedure, the remaining constraints uniquely satisfy the Poincar\'ealgebra. After the additional symmetry is fixed, the equations of motion areunaltered. The objections to our method raised by Strobl in Ref.[3] are thenimmaterial. Some minor points put forward in Ref.[3] are also discussed.
