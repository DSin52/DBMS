We present a manifestly Lorentz invariant and supersymmetric component fieldaction for $D = 10$, type $IIB$ supergravity, using a newly developed methodfor the construction of actions with chiral bosons, which implies only a singlescalar non propagating auxiliary field. With the same method we construct alsoan action in which the complex two-form gauge potential and its Hodge-dual, acomplex six-form gauge potential, appear in a symmetric way in compatibilitywith supersymmetry and Lorentz invariance. The duals of the two physicalscalars of the theory turn out to be described by a $SL(2,R)$ triplet ofeight-forms whose curvatures are constrained by a single linear relation.We present also a supersymmetric action in which the basic fields and theirduals, six-form and eight-form potentials, appear in a symmetric way. All theseactions are manifestly invariant under the global $SL(2,R)$-duality group of $D= 10$, $IIB$ supergravity and are equivalent to each other in that theirdynamics corresponds to the well known equations of motion of $ D=10$, $IIB$supergravity.
