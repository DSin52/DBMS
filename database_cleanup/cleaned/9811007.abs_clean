Russian Academy of Sciences, Russian Federation)Comments: 8 pages, latex, 20k; e-mail

We construct a one-parametric family of the double-scaling limits in thehermitian matrix model $\Phi^6$ for 2D quantum gravity. The known limit ofBresin, Marinari and Parisi belongs to this family. The family is representedby the Gurevich-Pitaevskii solution of the Korteveg-de Vries equation whichdescribes the onset of nondissipative shock waves in media with smalldispersion. Numerical simulation of the universal Gurevich-Pitaevskii solutionis made.
