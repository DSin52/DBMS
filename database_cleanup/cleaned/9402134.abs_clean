Title: Universal and Generalized Cartan Calculus on Hopf Algebras

Comments: 13 pages

We extend the universal differential calculus on an arbitrary Hopf algebra toa ``universal Cartan calculus''. This is accomplished by introducing innerderivations and Lie derivatives which act on the elements of the universaldifferential envelope. A new algebra is formulated by incorporating these newobjects into the universal differential calculus together with consistentcommutation relations. We also explain how to include nontrivial commutationrelations into this formulation to obtain the ``generalized Cartan calculus''.
