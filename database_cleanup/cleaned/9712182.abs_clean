We compute the BRST cohomology of the holomorphic part of the N=2 string atarbitrary ghost and picture number. We confirm the expectation that therelative cohomology at non-zero momentum consists of a single massless state ineach picture. The absolute cohomology is obtained by an independent methodbased on homological algebra. For vanishing momentum, the relative and absolutecohomologies both display a picture dependence -- a phenomenon discoveredrecently also in the relative Ramond sector of N=1 strings by Berkovits andZwiebach.
