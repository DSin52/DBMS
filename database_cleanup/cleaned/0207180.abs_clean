We construct U(2) noncommutative multi-instanton solutions by extendingWitten's ansatz [1] which reduces the problem of cylindrical symmetry in fourdimensions to that of a set of Bogomol'nyi equations for an Abelian Higgsmodelin two dimensional curved space. Using the Fock space approach, we giveexplicit vortex solutions to the Bogomol'nyi equations and, from them, wepresent multi-instanton solutions.
