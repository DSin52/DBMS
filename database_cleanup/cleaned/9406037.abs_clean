Chiral, conformal and ghost number anomalies are discussed from the viewpointof the quantum vacuum in Hamiltonian formalism. After introducing the energycut-off, we derive known anomalies in a new way. We show that the physicalorigin of the anomalies is the zero point fluctuation of bosonic or fermionicfield. We first point out that the chiral U(1) anomaly is understood as thecreation of the chirality at the bottom of the regularized Dirac sea inclassical electromagnetic field. In the study of the (1+1) dimensional quantumvacuum of matter field coupled to the gravity, we give a physically intuitivepicture of the conformal anomaly. The central charges are evaluated from thevacuum energy. We clarify that the non-Hermitian regularization factor of thevacuum energy is responsible for the ghost number anomaly.
