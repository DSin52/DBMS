Although nonsingular spacetimes and those containing black holes arequalitatively quite different, there are continuous families of configurationsthat connect the two. In this paper we use self-gravitating monopole solutionsas tools for investigating the transition between these two types ofspacetimes. We show how causally distinct regions emerge as the black holelimit is achieved, even though the measurements made by an external observervary continuously. We find that near-critical solutions have a naturallydefined entropy, despite the absence of a true horizon, and that this has aclear connection with the Hawking-Bekenstein entropy. We find that certainclasses of near-critical solutions display naked black hole behavior, althoughthey are not truly black holes at all. Finally, we present a numericalsimulation illustrating how an incident pulse of matter can induce thedynamical collapse of a monopole into an extremal black hole. We discuss theimplications of this process for the third law of black hole thermodynamics.
