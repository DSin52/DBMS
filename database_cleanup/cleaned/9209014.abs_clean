Title: Free Boson Representation of $U_{q}(\hat{sl_{2}})$

Authors: J. Shiraishi

Comments: 8 pages, latex file, UT-617 (revised version)

A representation of the quantum affine algebra $U_{q}(\hat{sl_{2}})$ of anarbitrary level $k$ is realized in terms of three boson fields, whose $q\rightarrow 1$ limit becomes the Wakimoto representation. An analogue of thescreening current is also obtained. It commutes with the action of$U_{q}(\hat{sl_{2}})$ modulo total difference of some fields.
