Some instanton corrections to the universal hypermultiplet moduli spacemetric of the type-IIA string theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefoldarise due to multiple wrapping of BPS membranes and fivebranes around certaincycles of Calabi-Yau. The classical universal hypermultipet metric is locallyequivalent to the Bergmann metric of the symmetric quaternionic spaceSU(2,1)/U(2), whereas its generic quaternionic deformations are governed by theintegrable SU(infinity) Toda equation. We calculate the exact(non-perturbative) UH metrics in the special cases of (i) the D-instantons (thewrapped D2-branes) in the absence of fivebranes, and (ii) the fivebraneinstantons with vanishing charges, in the absence of D-instantons. Thesolutions of the first type preserve the U(1)xU(1) classical symmetry, whilethey can be interpreted as the gravitational dressing of the hyper-K"ahlerD-instanton solutions. The second type solution preserves the non-abelian SU(2)classical symmetry, while it can be interpreted as a gradient flow in theuniversal hypermultiplet moduli space.
