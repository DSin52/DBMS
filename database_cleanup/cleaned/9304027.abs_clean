One possible fate of information lost to black holes is its preservation inblack hole remnants. It is argued that a type of effective field theorydescribes such remnants (generically referred to as informons). The generalstructure of such a theory is investigated and the infinite pair productionproblem is revisited. A toy model for remnants clarifies some of the basicissues; in particular, infinite remnant production is not suppressed simply bythe large internal volumes as proposed in cornucopion scenarios. Criteria foravoiding infinite production are stated in terms of couplings in the effectivetheory. Such instabilities remain a problem barring what would be described inthat theory as a strong coupling conspiracy. The relation to euclideancalculations of cornucopion production is sketched, and potential flaws in thatanalysis are outlined. However, it is quite plausible that pair production ofordinary black holes (e.g. Reissner Nordstrom or others) is suppressed due tostrong effective couplings. It also remains an open possibility that amicroscopic dynamics can be found yielding an appropriate strongly coupledeffective theory of neutral informons without infinite pair production.
