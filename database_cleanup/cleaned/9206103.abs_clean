In Hawking's Euclidean path integral approach to quantum gravity, thepartition function is computed by summing contributions from all possibletopologies. The behavior such a sum can be estimated in three spacetimedimensions in the limit of small cosmological constant. The sum over topologiesfor $\Lambda>0$, the divergent behavior comes from the contributions of verylow volume, topologically complex manifolds, while for $\Lambda<0$ it is aconsequence of the existence of infinite sequences of relatively high volumemanifolds with converging geometries. Possible implications forfour-dimensional quantum gravity are discussed.
