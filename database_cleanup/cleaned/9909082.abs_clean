We discuss four dimensional renormalization group flows which preservesixteen supersymmetries. In the infra-red, these can be viewed as deformationsof the N=4 superconformal fixed points by special, irrelevant operators. It isargued that the gauge coupling beta function continues to vanish identically,for all coupling constants and energy scales, for such RG flows. In addition,the dimensions of all operators in short supersymmetry representations areconstant along such flows. It is conjectured that there is a generalization ofthe AdS/CFT holography correspondence which describes such flows, e.g. the D3brane vacuum before taking the near-horizon limit, at all energy scales. RGflows in three and six dimensions, preserving 16 supersymmetries, are alsobriefly discussed, including a conjectured generalized AdS/CFT duality for theM2 and M5 brane cases. Finally, we discuss maximally supersymmetric RG flowsassociated with non-commutative geometry.
