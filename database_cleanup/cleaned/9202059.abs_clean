We use the linear supermultiplet formalism of supergravity to study axioncouplings and chiral anomalies in the context of field-theoretical Lagrangiansdescribing orbifold compactifications beyond the classical approximation. Bymatching amplitudes computed in the effective low energy theory with theresults of string loop calculations we determine the appropriate counterterm inthis effective theory that assures modular invariance to all loop order. We usesupersymmetry consistency constraints to identify the correct ultra-violetcut-offs for the effective low energy theory. Our results have a simpleinterpretation in terms of two-loop unification of gauge coupling constants atthe string scale.
