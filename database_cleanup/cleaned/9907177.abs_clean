We consider small angle and large impact parameter high energy scattering ofcolourless states in SYM using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The gauge theoryscattering amplitude is linked with a correlation function of tilted Wilsonloops, which can be calculated by the exchange of bulk supergravity fieldsbetween the two corresponding string worldsheets. We identify the dominantcontributions, which all correspond to real phase shifts. In particular, wefind a contribution of the bulk graviton which gives an unexpected`gravity-like' $s^1$ behaviour of the gauge theory phase shift in a specificrange of energies and (large) impact parameters.
