We study the gauge theories on noncommutative space. We employ the idea ofthe covariant position to understand the linear and angular momenta, the centerof mass position, and to express all gauge invariant observables including theWilson line. In addition, we utilize the universality of the U(1) gauge theory,which originates from the underlying matrix theory, to analyze various solitonson U(N) theories, like the unstable static vortex solutions in two dimensionsand BPS dyonic fluxon solutions.
