Title: Fluctuations of a (Tensionless) Brane World

Authors: Bayram Tekin

Comments: 9 pages

We compute the quantum fluctuations of a 3-brane with tension, energy densityand stiffness. As a result of the fluctuations there are induced forces betweenmassive objects living on the brane. We study various limiting cases of theinduced potential between 2 and 3 massive objects. One quite interestingfinding is that for tensionless brane world there are universal (massindependent) $1/r^3$ forces between the objects on the brane. These forces arein principle measurable.
