Following recent work by Lambiase and Nesterenko we study in detail theinterquark potential for a Nambu-Goto string with point masses attached to itsends. We obtain exact solutions to the gap equations for the Lagrangemultipliers and metric components and determine the potential withoutsimplifying assumptions. We also discuss L\"{u}scher term and argue that itremains universal.
