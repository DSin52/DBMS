A two-form formulation for the N=2 vector-tensor multiplet is constructedusing superfield methods in central charge superspace. The N=2 non-Abelianstandard supergauge multiplet in central charge superspace is also discussed,as is with the associated Chern-Simons form. We give the constraints, solve theBianchi identities and present the action for a theory of the vector-tensormultiplet coupled to the non-Abelian supergauge multiplet via the Chern-Simonsform.
