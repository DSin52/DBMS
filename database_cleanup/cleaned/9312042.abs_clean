Title: The R-matrix structure of the Euler-Calogero-Moser model

Comments: 7 pages

SystemsWe construct the $r$-matrix for the generalization of the Calogero-Mosersystem introduced by Gibbons and Hermsen. By reduction procedures we obtain the$r$-matrix for the $O(N)$ Euler-Calogero-Moser model and for the standard $A_N$Calogero-Moser model.
