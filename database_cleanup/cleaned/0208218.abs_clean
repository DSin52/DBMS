SoftwareDue to the occurrence of large exceptional Lie groups in supergravity,calculations involving explicit Lie algebra and Lie group element manipulationseasily become very complicated and hence also error-prone if done by hand.Research on the extremal structure of maximal gauged supergravity theories invarious dimensions sparked the development of a library for efficient abstractmultilinear algebra calculations involving sparse and non-sparse higher-ranktensors, which is presented here.
