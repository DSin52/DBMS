Title: Eguchi-Hanson metric from various limits

Authors: Swapna Mahapatra

Comments: Latex file, 12 pages

In this note, we review various seemingly different ways of obtainingEguchi-Hanson metric with or without a cosmological constant term.Interestingly, the conformal class of metric corresponding to hyperbolic$n$-monopole solution obtained from the generalized Gibbons-Hawking ansatz,reduces to the Eguchi-Hanson metric in a particular limit. These results,though known from an algebraic geometry point of view, are useful while dealingwith rotational killing symmetry of self-dual metrics in general theory ofrelativity as well as in the context of duality symmetry in string theory.
