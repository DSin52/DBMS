We show that the symmetries of effective D-string actions in constant dilatonbackgrounds are directly related to homothetic motions of the backgroundmetric. In presence of such motions, there are infinitely many nonlinearlyrealized rigid symmetries forming a loop (or loop like) algebra. Near horizon(AdS) D3 and D1+D5 backgrounds are discussed in detail and shown to provide 2dinteracting field theories with infinite conformal symmetry.
