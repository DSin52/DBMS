The quantisation of gauge invariant systems usually proceeds through somegauge fixing procedure of one type or another. Typically for most cases, suchgauge fixings are plagued by Gribov ambiguities, while it is only for anadmissible gauge fixing that the correct dynamical description of the system isrepresented, especially with regards to non perturbative phenomena. However,any gauge fixing procedure whatsoever may be avoided altogether, by usingrather a recently proposed new approach based on the projection operator ontophysical gauge invariant states only, which is necessarily free on any suchissues. These different aspects of gauge invariant systems are explicitelyanalysed within a solvable U(1) gauge invariant quantum mechanical modelrelated to the dimensional reduction of Yang-Mills theory.
