A massive relativistic spinning point particle in any number of dimensionshas in a previous article been shown to be described by first classconstraints, which define a gauge theory. In the present paper we find thecorresponding finite gauge transformations. By comparing the integrated gaugetransformations to transformation equations found by Pryce, we conclude thatthe selection of gauge corresponds to selection of the relativistic center ofmass frame in the model of Pryce, where a spinning particle is considered acomposite object. The Lorentz group is identified as the gauge group, and asgauge field we identify the relativistic angular velocity. We also show that ananalogous physical interpretation is possible for the relativistic sphericaltop of Hanson and Regge.
