We study the global structure of the exact two-dimensional space-time whichemerges from string theory. Previous work has shown that in the semi-classicallimit, this is a black hole similar to the Schwarzschild solution. However, wefind that in the exact case, a new Euclidean region appears "between" thesingularity and black hole interior. However the boundary between theLorentzian and Euclidean regions is a coordinate singularity, which turns outto be a surface of time reflection symmetry in an extended space-time. Thusstrings having fallen through the black hole horizon would eventually emergethrough another one into a new asymptotically flat region. The maximallyextended space-time consists of an infinite number of universes connected bywormholes. There are no singularities present in this geometry. We alsocalculate the mass and temperature associated with the space-time.
