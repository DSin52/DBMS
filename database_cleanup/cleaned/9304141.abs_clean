We formulate a general set of consistency requirements, which are expected tobe satisfied by the scattering matrices in the presence of reflectingboundaries. In particular we derive an equivalent to the boostrap equationinvolving the W-matrix, which encodes the reflection of a particle off a wall.This set of equations is sufficient to derive explicit formulas for $W$, whichwe illustrate in the case of some particular affine Toda field theories.
