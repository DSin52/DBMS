We study the modular invariance of strings on pp-waves with RR-flux. Weexplicitly show that the one-loop partition functions of the maximallysupersymmetric pp-waves and their orbifolds can be modular invariant in spiteof the mass terms in the light-cone gauge. From this viewpoint, we alsodetermine the spectrum of type 0B theory on pp-wave and discuss its gaugetheory dual. Furthermore, we investigate the spectrum of a non-supersymmetricorbifold and point out its supersymmetry enhancement in the Penrose limit.
