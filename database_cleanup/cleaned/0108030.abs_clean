Title: A critique on the supplementary conditions of Rarita-Schwinger framework

Authors: M. Kirchbach, D. V. Ahluwalia

After a brief review of the celebrated 1941 paper of Rarita and Schwinger onthe theory of particles with half-integral spins, we present an {\em ab initio}construct of the representation space relevant for the description of spin-3/2particles. The chosen example case of spin-3/2 shows that covariance of a waveequation, and that of the imposed supplementary conditions, alone is not asufficient criterion to guarantee the compatibility of a framework withrelativity -- a lesson already arrived by Velo and Zwanziger. Here this samelesson is shown to be true at the level of the representation space withoutinvoking any interactions. The presented detailed analysis forces us to abandonthe single-spin interpretation of the Rarita and Schwinger framework, andsuggests a new interpretation that fully respects the relativity theory.
