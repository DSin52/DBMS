This is the second in a series of two contributions in which we set out toestablish a novel momentum space framework to treat field theoreticalinfinities in perturbative calculations when parity-violating objects occur.Since no analytic continuation on the space-time dimension is effected, thisframework can be particularly useful to treat dimension-specific theories.Moreover arbitrary local terms stemming from the underlying infinities of themodel can be properly parametrized. We (re)analyse the undeterminacy of theradiatively generated CPT violating Chern-Simons term within an extendedversion of $QED_4$ and calculate the Adler-Bardeen-Bell-Jackiw triangle anomalyto show that our framework is consistent and general to handle the subtletiesinvolved when a radiative corretion is finite.
