We analyze a recently constructed class of D-brane theories with the fermionspectrum of the SM at the intersection of D6-branes wrapping a compact toroidalspace. We show how the SM Higgs mechanism appears as a brane recombinationeffect in which the branes giving rise to U(2)_L \times U(1) recombine into asingle brane related to U(1)_{em}. We also show how one can construct D6-branemodels which respect some supersymmetry at every intersection. These arequasi-supersymmetric models of the type introduced in hep-th/0201205 which maybe depicted in terms of SUSY-quivers and may stabilize the hierarchy betweenthe weak scale and a fundamental scale of order 10-100 TeV present in lowstring scale models. Several explicit D6-brane models with three generations ofquarks and leptons and different SUSY-quiver structure are presented. One canprove on general grounds that if one wants to build a (factorizable) D6-braneconfiguration with the SM gauge group and N = 1 SUSY (or quasi-SUSY), also amassless (B-L) generator must be initially present in any model. If in additionwe insist on lef- and right-handed fermions respecting the same N=1 SUSY, thebrane configurations are forced to have intersections giving rise to Higgsmultiplets, providing for a rationale for the very existence of the SM Higgssector.
