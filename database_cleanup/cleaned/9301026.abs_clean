An equivalence between generalised restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS) models,associated with sets of graphs, and multi-colour loop models is established. Asan application we consider solvable loop models and in this way obtain newsolvable families of critical RSOS models. These families can all be classifiedby the Dynkin diagrams of the simply-laced Lie algebras. For one of the RSOSmodels, labelled by the Lie algebra pair (A$_L$,A$_L$) and related to theC$_2^{(1)}$ vertex model, we give an off-critical extension, which breaks theZ$_2$ symmetry of the Dynkin diagrams.
