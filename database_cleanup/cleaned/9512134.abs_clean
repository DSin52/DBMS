Title: Octonions and Supersymmetry

Comments: 8 pages, latex

We apply the techniques of $S^7$-algebras to the construction of N=5-8superconformal algebras and of S{\bf O}(1,9), a modification of SO(1,9) whichcommutes with $S^7$-transformations. We discuss the relevance of S{\bf O}(1,9)for off-shell super-Maxwell theory in D=(1,9).
