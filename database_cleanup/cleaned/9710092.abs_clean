We develop a bosonization procedure on the half line. Different boundaryconditions, formulated in terms of the vector and axial fermion currents, areimplemented by using in general the mixed boundary condition on the bosonicfield. The interplay between symmetries and boundary conditions is investigatedin this context, with a particular emphasis on duality. As an application, weexplicitly construct operator solutions of the massless Thirring model on thehalf line, respecting different boundary conditions.
