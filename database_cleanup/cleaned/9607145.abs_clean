We consider the question of ground states in the supersymmetric system thatarises in the search for the missing H-monopole states. By studying theeffective theory near certain singularities in the five-brane moduli space, wefind the remaining BPS states required by the conjectured S-duality of thetoroidally compactified heterotic string.
