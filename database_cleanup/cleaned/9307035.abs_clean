The topological charges of the \an affine Toda solitons are considered. Ageneral formula is presented for the number of charges associated with eachsoliton, as well as an expression for the charges themselves. For each solitonthe charges are found to lie in the corresponding fundamental representation,though in general these representations are not filled. Each soliton'stopological charges are invariant under cyclic permutations of the simple rootsplus the extended root or equivalently, under the action of the Coxeter element(with a particular ordering). Multisolitons are considered and are found tohave topological charges filling the remainder of the fundamentalrepresentations as well as the entire weight lattice. The article concludeswith a discussion of some of the other affine Toda theories.
