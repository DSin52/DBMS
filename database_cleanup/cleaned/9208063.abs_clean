The S-matrices for the scattering of two excitations in the XYZ model and inall of its SU(n)-type generalizations are obtained from the asymptotic behaviorof Kerov's generalized Hall-Littlewood polynomials. These physical scatteringprocesses are all reduced to geometric s-wave scattering problems on certainquantum-symmetric spaces, whose zonal spherical functions theseHall-Littlewood-Kerov polynomials are. Mathematically, this involves ageneralization with an unlimited number of parameters of the Macdonaldpolynomials. Physically, our results suggest that, of the (1+1)-dimensionalmodels, the integrable ones are those, for which the scattering of excitationsbecomes geometric in the sense above.
