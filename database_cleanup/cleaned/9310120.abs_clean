International Workshop on Squeezed States and Uncertainty RelationsDecoherence and dissipation in quantum systems has been studied extensivelyin the context of Quantum Brownian Motion. Effective decoherence in coarsegrained quantum systems has been a central issue in recent efforts by Zurek andby Hartle and Gell-Mann to address the Quantum Measurement Problem. Althoughthese models can yield very general classical phenomenology, they are incapableof reproducing relevant characteristics expected of a local environment on aquantum system, such as the characteristic dependence of decoherence onenvironment spatial correlations. I discuss the characteristics of QuantumBrownian Motion in a local environment by examining aspects of firstprinciple calculations and by the construction of phenomenological models.Effective quantum Langevin equations and master equations are presented in avariety of representations. Comparisons are made with standard results such asthe Caldeira-Leggett master equation.
