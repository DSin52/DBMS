Ladders of field polynomial differential forms obeying systems of descentequations and corresponding to observables and anomalies of gauge theories arerenormalized. They obey renormalized descent equations. Moreover they are shownto have vanishing anomalous dimensions. As an application a simple proof of thenonrenormalization theorem for the nonabelian gauge anomaly is given.
