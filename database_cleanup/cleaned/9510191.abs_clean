Bose-Einstein condensation of charged scalar and vector particles mayactually occur in presence of a constant homogeneous magnetic field, but thereis no critical temperature at which condensation starts. The condensate isdescribed by the statistical distribution. The Meissner effect is possible inthe scalar, but not in the vector field case, which exhibits a ferromagneticbehavior.
