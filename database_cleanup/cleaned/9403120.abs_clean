We investigate zero modes of a multivortex background which are due to theenergetic degeneracy of the planar static n-vortex solution in Bogomol'nyilimit of the Abelian Higgs model parametrised by a set of 2n real parameters.The zero modes take the form of waves travelling with a speed of lightindependently along each of the vortices irrespectively to their mutualseparations. String description of these zero modes is constructed. We alsocomment on the remnants of the modes a little outside of the Bogomol'nyi limit.
