We find the fusion rules for the c_{p,1} series of logarithmic conformalfield theories. This completes our attempts to generalize the concept ofrationality for conformal field theories to the logarithmic case. A novelty isthe appearance of negative fusion coefficients which can be understood in termsof exceptional quantum group representations. The effective fusion rules (i.e.without signs and multiplicities) resemble the BPZ fusion rules for the virtualminimal models with conformal grid given via c = c_{3p,3}. This leads to theconjecture that (almost) all minimal models with c = c_{p,q}, gcd(p,q) > 1,belong to the class of rational logarithmic conformal field theories.
