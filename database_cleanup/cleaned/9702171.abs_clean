Title: The Weyl Theory of Fundamental Interactions

We compare the conventional description of the interaction of matter with thefour known forces in the standard model with an alternative Weyl description inwhich the chiral coupling is extended to include gravity. The two areindistinguishable at the low energy classical level of equations of motion, butthere are subtle differences at the quantum level when nonvanishing torsion andthe Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly is taken into account. The spin current andenergy-momentum of the chiral theory then contain non-Hermitian terms which arenot present in the conventional theory. In the chiral alternative, CPTinvariance is not automatic because chirality supersedes Hermiticity but fullLorentz invariance holds. New fermion loop processes associated with the theoryare discussed together with a perturbative regularization which explicitlymaintains the chiral nature and local symmetries of the theory.
