We find the gravitational field of a `nested' domain wall living entirelywithin a brane-universe, or, a localised vortex within a wall. For a vortexliving on a critical Randall-Sundrum brane universe, we show that the inducedgravitational field on the brane is identical to that of an (n-1)-dimensionalvacuum domain wall. We also describe how to set-up a nested Randall-Sundrumscenario using a flat critical vortex living on a subcritical (adS) braneuniverse.
