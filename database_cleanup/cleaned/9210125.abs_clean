We calculate the lowest translationally invariant levels of the Z_3- andZ_4-symmetrical chiral Potts quantum chains, using numerical diagonalization ofthe hamiltonian for N <= 12 and N <= 10 sites, respectively, and extrapolatingN to infinity. In the high-temperature massive phase we find that the patternof the low-lying zero momentum levels can be explained assuming the existenceof n-1 particles carrying Z_n-charges Q = 1, ... , n-1 (mass m_Q), and theirscattering states. In the superintegrable case the masses of the n-1 particlesconvergence in N is observed for the single particle gaps, while powerconvergence is seen for the scattering levels. We also verify thatqualitatively the same pattern appears for the self-dual and integrable cases.For general Z_n we show that the energy-momentum relations of the particlesshow a parity non-conservation asymmetry which for very high temperatures isexclusive due to the presence of a macroscopic momentum P_m=(1-2Q/n)/\phi,where \phi is the chiral angle and Q is the Z_n-charge of the respectiveparticle.
