Using the observed time and spatial intervals defined originally by Einsteinand the observation frame in the vierbein formalism, we propose that in curvedspacetime, for a wave received in laboratories, the observed frequency is thechanging rate of the phase of the wave relative to the local observable timescale and the momentum the changing rate of the phase relative to the localobservable spatial length scale. The case of Robertson-Walker universe isespecially considered.
