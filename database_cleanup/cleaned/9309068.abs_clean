The problem of a periodic scalar field on a two-dimensional dynamical randomlattice is studied with the inclusion of vortices in the action. Using a randommatrix formulation, in the continuum limit for genus zero surfaces thepartition function is found exactly, as a function of the chemical potentialfor vortices of unit winding number, at a specific radius in the plasma phase.This solution is used to describe the Kosterlitz- Thouless phenomenon in thepresence of 2D quantum gravity as one passes from the ultra-violet to theinfra-red.
