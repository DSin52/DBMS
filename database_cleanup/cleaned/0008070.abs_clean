In this paper the SU(2) Skyrme model will be reformulated as a gauge theoryand the hidden symmetry will be investigated and explored in the energyspectrum computation. To this end we purpose a new constraint conversionscheme, based on the symplectic framework with the introduction of Wess-Zumino(WZ) terms in an unambiguous way. It is a positive feature not present on theBFFT constraint conversion. The Dirac's procedure for the first-classconstraints is employed to quantize this gauge invariant nonlinear system andthe energy spectrum is computed. The finding out shows the power of thesymplectic gauge-invariant formalism when compared with another constraintconversion procedures present on the literature.
