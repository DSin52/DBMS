A classical two dimensional theory of gravity which has a number ofinteresting features (including a Newtonian limit, black holes andgravitational collapse) is quantized using conformal field theoretictechniques. The critical dimension depends upon Newton's constant, permittingmodels with $d=4$. The constraint algebra and scaling properties of the modelare computed.
