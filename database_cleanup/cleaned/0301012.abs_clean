Title: Boundary $\sigma$-model and corrections to D-brane actions

Authors: Alexander Barabanschikov

Comments: Latex, 15 pages, 6 figures

We consider a $\sigma$-model formulation of open string theory in thepresence of D-branes. We perform two-loop computations and discussgravitational corrections to Born-Infeld action when branes are non-triviallyembedded in a curved ambient space. In particular for the case of a stack of$N$ coincident D-branes we analyze couplings of the form$R_{ijkl}[\Phi^i,\Phi^j][\Phi^k,\Phi^l]$.
