We construct quantum group-valued canonical connections on quantumhomogeneous spaces, including a q-deformed Dirac monopole on the quantum sphereof Podles quantum differential coming from the 3-D calculus of Woronowicz on$SU_q(2)$ . The construction is presented within the setting of a generaltheory of quantum principal bundles with quantum group (Hopf algebra) fiber,associated quantum vector bundles and connection one-forms. Both the base space(spacetime) and the total space are non-commutative algebras (quantum spaces).
