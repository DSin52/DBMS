The Ward identities of the $W_{\infty}$ symmetry in two dimensional stringtheory in the tachyon background are studied in the continuum approach. Weconsider amplitudes different from 2D string ones by the external leg factorand derive the recursion relations among them. The recursion relations havenon-linear terms which give relations among the amplitudes defined on differentgenus. The solutions agree with the matrix model results even in higher genus.We also discuss differences of roles of the external leg factor between the$c_M = 1$ model and the $c_M <1$ model.
