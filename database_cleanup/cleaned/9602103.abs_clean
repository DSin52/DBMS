We analyze the problems with the so called gauge invariant quantization ofthe anomalous gauge field theories originary due to Faddeev and Shatashvili(FS). Our analysis bring to a generalization of FS method which allows toconstruct a series of classically equivalent theories which are non equivalentat quantum level. We prove that these classical theories are all consistentwith the BRST invariance of the original gauge symmetry with suitably augmentedfield content. As an example of such a scenario, we discuss the class ofphysically distinct models of two dimensional induced gravity which are ageneralization of the David-Distler-Kawai model.
