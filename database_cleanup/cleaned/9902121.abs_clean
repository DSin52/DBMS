We propose a procedure for computing the boundary stress tensor associatedwith a gravitating system in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. Ourdefinition is free of ambiguities encountered by previous attempts, andcorrectly reproduces the masses and angular momenta of various spacetimes. Viathe AdS/CFT correspondence, our classical result is interpretable as theexpectation value of the stress tensor in a quantum conformal field theory. Wedemonstrate that the conformal anomalies in two and four dimensions arerecovered. The two dimensional stress tensor transforms with a Schwarzianderivative and the expected central charge. We also find a nonzero ground stateenergy for global AdS_5, and show that it exactly matches the Casimir energy ofthe dual N=4 super Yang-Mills theory on S^3 x R.
