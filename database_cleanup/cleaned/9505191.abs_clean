Title: Self-Gravitational Correction of the "Vacuum Polarization" Feynman

Diagram Using Full Einstein Equation Propagation of the Intermediate VirtualGravitonsComments: 22 pages, LaTeX, uses mathlet.sty (attached at bottom)

The self-gravitational correction of the ultraviolet-divergent second- order"vacuum polarization" radiative correction insertion Feynman diagram is carriedout using full, self-consistent Einstein equation propagation of theintermediate virtual gravitons, which takes into account their importantnon-linear interactions with each other. (As a by-product, the subsequentperturbative treatment of these non-linearities is avoided, which eliminatesthe source of the ultraviolet divergences of the second- quantized gravitytheory itself.) The corrected diagram is finite, makes no contribution tocharge renormalization (as could be expected of a diagram involving but asingle transient virtual pair), and its dynamical behaviour accords with thestandard quantum electrodynamics result except at inaccessibly extreme(Planck-scale-related) values of the momentum transfer. There, the standardlogarithmic rise with momentum transfer which this diagram contributes to theeffective coupling strength falls away, as the diagram proceeds instead todecrease strongly toward zero. The same self-gravitational correction is madeto the closely related quartically divergent second-order vacuum-to-vacuumamplitude correction Feynman diagram, and it is found that the result vanishesidentically.
