A class of the $D=4$ gravity models describing a coupled system of $n$Abelian vector fields and the symmetric $n \times n$ matrix generalizations ofthe dilaton and Kalb-Ramond fields is considered. It is shown that thePecci-Quinn axion matrix can be entered and the resulting equations of motionpossess the $Sp(2n, R)$ symmetry in four dimensions. The stationary case isstudied. It is established that the theory allows a $\sigma$-modelrepresentation with a target space which is invariant under the $Sp[2(n+1), R]$group of isometry transformations. The chiral matrix of the coset $Sp[2(n+1),R]/U(n+1)$ is constructed. A K\"ahler formalism based on the use of the Ernst$(n+1) \times (n+1)$ complex symmetric matrix is developed. The stationaryaxisymmetric case is considered. The Belinsky-Zakharov chiral matrix dependingon the original field variables is obtained. The Kramer-Neugebauertransformation, which algebraically maps the original variables into the targetspace ones, is presented.
