A class of solutions to the WDVV equations is provided by period matrices ofhyperelliptic Riemann surfaces, with or without punctures. The equationsthemselves reflect associativity of explicitly described multiplicative algebraof (possibly meromorphic) 1-differentials, which holds at least in thehyperelliptic case. This construction is direct generalization of the old one,involving the ring of polynomials factorized over an ideal, and is inspired bythe study of the Seiberg-Witten theory. It has potential to be further extendedto reveal algebraic structures underlying the theory of quantum cohomologiesand the prepotentials in string models with N=2 supersymmetry.
