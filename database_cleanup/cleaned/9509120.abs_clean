It is shown that the McCall-Hahn theory of self-induced transparency incoherent optical pulse propagation can be identified with the complexsine-Gordon theory in the sharp line limit. We reformulate the theory in termsof the deformed gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten sigma model and address various newaspects of self-induced transparency.
