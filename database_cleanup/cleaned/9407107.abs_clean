Motivated by topological bidimensional quantum models for distinguishableparticles, and by Haldane's definition of mutual statistics for differentspecies of particles, we propose a new class of one-dimensional $1/r_{ij}^2$Calogero model with coupling constants $g_{ij}$ depending on the labels of theparticles. We solve the groundstate problem, and show how to build some classesof excited states.
