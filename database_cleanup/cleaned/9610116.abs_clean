A generalization of ``Termo Field Dynamics'' to a curved geometry isproposed. In particular a neutral scalar field minimally coupled to gravity isconsidered as matter content in a Robertson-Walker metric. A non linearamplification in the particle creation is obtained, due to the altogetheraction of thermal and geometric effects. As a consequence the frequencies inthe system look like red shifted with respect to the case where the thermalcreation is not taken into account.
