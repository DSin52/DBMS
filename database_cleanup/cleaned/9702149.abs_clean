We shortly illustrate how the field-theoretic approach to critical phenomenatakes place in the more complete Wilson theory of renormalization andqualitatively discuss its domain of validity. By the way, we suggest that thedifferential renormalization functions (like the beta-function) of theperturbative scalar theory in four dimensions should be Borel summable providedthey are calculated within a minimal subtraction scheme.
