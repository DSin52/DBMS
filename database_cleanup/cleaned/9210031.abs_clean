Two string-like solutions to the equations of motion of the low-energyeffective action for the heterotic string are found, each a source of electricand magnetic fields. The first carries an electric current equal to theelectric charge per unit length and is the most general solution whichpreserves one half of the supersymmetries. The second is the most generalcharged solution with an event horizon, a `black string'. The relationship ofthe solutions to fundamental, macroscopic heterotic strings is discussed, andin particular it is shown that any stable state of such a fundamental stringalso preserves one half of the supersymmetries, in the same manner as the firstsolution.
