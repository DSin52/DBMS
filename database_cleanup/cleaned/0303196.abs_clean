Title: Quantum Energy of Fuzzy Sphere

Authors: Yu-Jie Zhong, Wung-Hong Huang

Comments: Short summary of the Master-thesis

The matrix model with mass term has a nontrivially classical solution whichis known to represent a noncommutative fuzzy sphere. The fuzzy sphere has alower energy then that of the trivial solution. In this letter we investigatethe quantum correction of the energy of the fuzzy sphere by using the Gaussianvariational technique, in contrast to the other studying in which only thesmall fluctuation was considered. Our result, which only considering the bosonpart, shows that the quantum correction does not change the stability of thefuzzy sphere.
