The thermal Euclidean Green functions for Photons propagating in the Rindlerwedge are computed employing an Euclidean approach within any covariantFeynman-like gauge. This is done by generalizing a formula which holds in theMinkowskian case. The coincidence of the found $(\be=2\pi)$-Green functions andthe corresponding Minkowskian vacuum Green functions is discussed in relationto the remaining static gauge ambiguity already found in previous papers.Further generalizations to more complicated manifolds are discussed. Wardidentities are verified in the general case.
