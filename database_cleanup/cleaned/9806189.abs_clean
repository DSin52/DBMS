We construct generalizations of the Calogero-Sutherland-Moser system byappropriately reducing a model involving many unitary matrices. The resultingsystems consist of particles on the circle with internal degrees of freedom,coupled through modifications of the inverse-square potential. The couplinginvolves SU(M) non-invariant (anti)ferromagnetic interactions of the internaldegrees of freedom. The systems are shown to be integrable and the spectrum andwavefunctions of the quantum version are derived.
