We describe in detail the space of the two K\"ahler parameters of theCalabi--Yau manifold $\P_4^{(1,1,1,6,9)}[18]$ by exploiting mirror symmetry.The large complex structure limit of the mirror, which corresponds to theclassical large radius limit, is found by studying the monodromy of the periodsabout the discriminant locus, the boundary of the moduli space corresponding tosingular Calabi--Yau manifolds. A symplectic basis of periods is found and theaction of the $Sp(6,\Z)$ generators of the modular group is determined. Fromthe mirror map we compute the instanton expansion of the Yukawa couplings andthe generalized $N=2$ index, arriving at the numbers of instantons of genuszero and genus one of each degree. We also investigate an $SL(2,\Z)$ symmetrythat acts on a boundary of the moduli space.
