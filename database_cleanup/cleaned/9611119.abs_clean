We present orientifold and F-theory duals of the heterotic stringcompactification constructed by Chaudhuri, Hockney and Lykken (CHL) which hasthe maximal supersymmetry but gauge group of reduced rank. The 8-dimensionaldual is given by the Type IIA orientifold on the M\"{o}bius band. We show thenon-trivial monodromy on the base induces non-simply laced gauge groups on theF-theory orbifolds dual to the CHL strings. The F-theory models dual to the CHLstrings in six dimensions are examples of N=2 F-theory vacua. We discuss theother N=2 F-theory vacua in six dimensions.
