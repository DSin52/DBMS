Authors: M. Chaichian, K. Nishijima and A. Tureanu

Comments: 5 pages, latex, no figures

We show that Pauli's spin-statistics relation remains valid in noncommutativequantum field theories (NC QFT), with the exception of some peculiar cases ofnoncommutativity between space and time. We also prove that, while theindividual symmetries C and T, and in some cases also P, are broken, the CPTtheorem still holds in general for noncommutative field theories, in spite ofthe inherent nonlocality and violation of Lorentz invariance.
