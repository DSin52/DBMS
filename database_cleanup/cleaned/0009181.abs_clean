We construct a Galilean invariant non-gravitational closed string theorywhose excitations satisfy a non-relativistic dispersion relation. This theorycan be obtained by taking a consistent low energy limit of any of theconventional string theories, including the heterotic string. We give a finitefirst order worldsheet Hamiltonian for this theory and show that this stringtheory has a sensible perturbative expansion, interesting high energy behaviorof scattering amplitudes and a Hagedorn transition of the thermal ensemble. Thestrong coupling duals of the Galilean superstring theories are considered andare shown to be described by an eleven-dimensional Galilean invariant theory oflight membrane fluctuations. A new class of Galilean invariantnon-gravitational theories of light-brane excitations are obtained. We exhibitdual formulations of the strong coupling limits of these Galilean invarianttheories and show that they exhibit many of the conventional dualities of Mtheory in a non-relativistic setting.
