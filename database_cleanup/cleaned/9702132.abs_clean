We compute the exact effective string vacuum backgrounds of the level $k =81/19 SU(2,1)/U(1)$ coset model. A compact SU(2) isometry present in this sevendimensional solution allows to interpreting it after compactification as a fourdimensional non-abelian SU(2) charged instanton with a singular submanifold andan $SO(3) \times U(1)$ isometry. The semiclassical backgrounds, solutions ofthe type II strings, present similar characteristics.
