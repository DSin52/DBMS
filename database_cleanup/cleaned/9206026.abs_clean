We generalize to p-dimensional extended objects and type II superstrings arecently proposed Green-Schwarz type I superstring action in which the tension$T$ emerges as an integration constant of the equations of motion. The actionis spacetime scale-invariant but its equations of motion are equivalent tothose of the standard super p-brane for $T\ne 0$ and the null super p-brane for$T=0$. We also show that for $p=1$ the action can be written in ``Born-Infeld''form.
