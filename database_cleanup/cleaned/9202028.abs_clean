In this paper we study the renormalization group flow of the $(p,q)$ minimal(non-unitary) CFT perturbed by the $\Phi_{1,3}$ operator with a positivecoupling. In the perturbative region $q>>(q-p)$, we find a new IR fixed pointwhich corresponds to the $(2p-q,p)$ minimal CFT. The perturbing field near thenew IR fixed point is identified with the irrelevent $\Phi_{3,1}$ operator. Weextend this result to show that the non-diagonal ($(A,D)$-type) modularinvariant partition function of the $(p,q)$ minimal CFT flows into the$(A,D)$-type partition function of the $(2p-q,p)$ minimal CFT and the diagonalpartition function into the diagonal.
