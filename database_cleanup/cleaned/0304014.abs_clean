We extend the formalism introduced in the paper hep-th/0209050 to computecorrelation functions in the AdS/CFT correspondence. We show how the on-shellaction of a scalar field in a compactification of AdS space can be obtained byflowing in the space of (non-local) theories with different sizes of theextra-dimension. Our method is relevant in particular for holographiccomputations in the Randall-Sundrum scenario with one or two branes and itallows the inclusion of brane-localized actions in a systematic way. The methodcan also be generalized to other backgrounds and does not rely on explicitknowledge of the solutions of the wave-equations.
