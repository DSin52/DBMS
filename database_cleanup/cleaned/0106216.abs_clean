We apply 't Hooft's deterministic quantum mechanics approach to free vectorbosons in three dimensions and check Lorentz invariance. This approach does notwork for the conformal group, for free bosons in two dimensions. This presentsa technical difficulty for constructing a ``deterministic string theory''.
