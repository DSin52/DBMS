The one-loop renormalization of a general chiral gauge theory without scalarand Majorana fields is fully worked out within Breitenlohner and Maisondimensional renormalization scheme. The coefficients of the anomalous termsintroduced in the Slavnov-Taylor equations by the minimal subtraction algorithmare calculated and the asymmetric counterterms needed to restore the BRSsymmetry, if the anomaly cancellation conditions are met, are computed. Therenormalization group equation and its coefficients are worked out in theanomaly free case. The computations draw heavily from the existence of actionprinciples and BRS cohomology theory.
