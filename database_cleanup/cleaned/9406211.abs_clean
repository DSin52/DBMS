Title: Representation theory and tensor product theory for vertex operator

algebrasComments: 122 pages

We first formulate a definition of tensor product for two modules for avertex operator algebra in terms of a certain universal property and then wegive a construction of tensor products. We prove the unital property of theadjoint module and the commutativity of tensor products, up to moduleisomorphism. We relate this tensor product construction with Frenkel and Zhu's$A(M)$-theory. We give a proof of a formula of Frenkel and Zhu for fusionrules. We also give the analogue of the ``Hom''-functor of classical Liealgebra theory for vertex operator algebra theory by introducing a notion of``generalized intertwining operator.'' We prove that the space of generalizedintertwining operators from one module to another for a vertex operator algebrais a generalized module. From this result we derive a general form of Tsuchiyaand Kanie's ``nuclear democracy theorem'' for any rational vertex operatoralgebra. This proves that the fusion rules obtained from our construction oftensor products are the same as the fusion rules obtained by using Tsuchiya andKanie's method, for both WZW models and minimal models. We prove that if $V$satisfies certain ``finiteness'' and ``semisimplicity'' conditions, then thereexists a unique maximal submodule inside the generalized module. Furthermore,we prove that this maximal submodule is isomorphic to the contragredient moduleof a certain tensor product module. This gives another construction of tensorproduct modules and this result turns out to be closely related to Huang andLepowsky's construction.
