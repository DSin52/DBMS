We study holographic RG flows of N=2 matter couple AdS_3 supergravities whichadmit both compact and non-compact sigma manifolds. For the compact case thesupersymmetric domain wall solution interpolates between a conformal IR regionand flat spacetime and this corresponds to a deformation of the CFT by anirrelevant operator. When it is non-compact, the solution can be interpreted asa flow between an UV fixed point and a non-conformal(singular) IR region. Thisis an exact example of a deformation flow when the singularity is physical. Wealso find a non-supersymmetric deformation flow when the scalar potential has asecond AdS vacua. The ratio of the central charges is rational for certainvalues of the size of the sigma model. Next, we analyze the spectrum of amassless scalar on our background by transforming the problem into Schroedingerform. The spectrum is continuous for the compact model, yet it can be bothcontinuous (with or without mass gap) and discrete otherwise. Finally, 2-pointfunctions are computed for two examples whose quantum mechanical potentials areof Calogero type.
