Extreme magnetic dilaton black holes are promoted to exact solutions ofheterotic string theory with unbroken supersymmetry. With account taken ofalpha' corrections this is accomplished by supplementing the known solutionswith SU(2) Yang-Mills vectors and scalars in addition to the already existingAbelian U(1) vector field. The solution has a simple analytic form and includesmulti-black-holes. The issue of exactness of other black-hole-type solutions,including extreme dilaton electrically charged black holes and Taub-NUTsolutions is discussed.
