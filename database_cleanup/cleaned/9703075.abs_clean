We describe the couplings of six-dimensional supergravity, which contain aself-dual tensor multiplet, to $n_T$ anti-self-dual tensor matter multiplets,$n_V$ vector multiplets and $n_H$ hypermultiplets. The scalar fields of thetensor multiplets form a coset $SO(n_T,1)/SO(n_T)$, while the scalars in thehypermultiplets form quaternionic K\"ahler symmetric spaces, the genericexample being $Sp(n_H,1)/Sp(n_H)\otimes Sp(1)$. The gauging of the compactsubgroup $Sp(n_H) \times Sp(1)$ is also described. These results generalizeprevious ones in the literature on matter couplings of $N=1$ supergravity insix dimensions.
