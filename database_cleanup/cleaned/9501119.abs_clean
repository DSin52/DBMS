Title: Effective quark interactions from QCD

Authors: C. Wetterich

Comments: New numerical results for the effective interactions of heavy quarks

along with three postscript figures as well a detailed discussion of theissue of gauge invariance are included. The paper is shortened (46 pages)We propose a new method for an analytical, non-perturbative computation ofeffective quark interactions from QCD. It is based on an exact flow equationwhich describes the scale dependence of the effective average action for quarksin presence of gluons.
