${\cal W}-$ algebras singular vectorsComments: 9 pages

The problem of describing the singular vectors of $\cW_3$ and $\cW_3^{(2)}$Verma modules is addressed, viewing these algebras as BRST quantizedDrinfeld-Sokolov (DS) reductions of $A^{(1)}_2\,$. Singular vectors of an$A^{(1)}_2\,$ Verma module are mapped into $\W$ algebra singular vectors andare shown to differ from the latter by terms trivial in the BRST cohomology.These maps are realized by quantum versions of the highest weight DS gaugetransformations.
