Comments: 12 pages, 3 figures included

We calculate the second virial coefficient of spin-1/2 anyon gas in thevarious values of the self-adjoint extension parameter by incorporating theself-adjoint extension method into the Green's function formalism. Especially,the completely different cusp- and discontinuity-structures from the result ofprevious literature are obtained when the self-adjoint extension parameter goesto infinity. This is originated from the different condition for the occurrenceof irregular states.
