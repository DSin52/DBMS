A generalized chiral Schwinger model is studied by means of perturbativetechniques. Explicit expressions are obtained, both for bosonic and fermionicpropagators, and compared to the ones derived by means of functionaltechniques. In particular a consistent recipe is proposed to describe theambiguity occurring in the regularization of the fermionic determinant. Therole of the gauge fixing term, which is needed to develop perturbation theoryand the behaviour of the spectrum as a function of the parameters are clarifiedtogether with ultraviolet and infrared properties of the model.
