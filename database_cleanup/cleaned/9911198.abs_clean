The effective Hamiltonian introduced many years ago by Bloch and generalizedlater by Wilson, appears to be the ideal starting point for Hamiltonianperturbation theory in quantum field theory. The present contribution derivesthe Bloch-Wilson Hamiltonian from a generalization of the Gell-Mann-Lowtheorem, thereby enabling a diagrammatic analysis of Hamiltonian perturbationtheory in this approach.
