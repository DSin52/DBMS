Comments: 6 pages, latex using espcrc2. Based on Talks given at the 29th

International Symposium on the Theory of Elementary Particles, Buckow, August1995 and at the 5th Hellenic School and Workshop on Elementary ParticlePhysics, Corfu, September 1995Journal-ref: Nucl.Phys.Proc.Suppl. 49 (1996) 213-218

In this talk we summarise our recent results on perturbative andnon-perturbative monodromies in four-dimensional heterotic strings with $N=2$space-time supersymmetry, and we compare our results with the rigid $SU(2)$$N=2$ Yang-Mills monodromies.
