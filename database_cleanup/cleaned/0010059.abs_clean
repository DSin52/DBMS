We review the structures imposed on perturbative QFT by the fact that itsFeynman diagrams provide Hopf and Lie algebras. We emphasize the role which theHopf algebra plays in renormalization by providing the forest formulas. Weexhibit how the associated Lie algebra originates from an operadic operation ofgraph insertions. Particular emphasis is given to the connection with theRiemann--Hilbert problem. Finally, we outline how these structures relate tothe numbers which we see in Feynman diagrams.
