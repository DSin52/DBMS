We study the Chern-Simons $CP(N)$ models with a global $U(1)$ symmetry andfound the self-dual models among them. The Bogomolnyi-type bound in theseself-dual models is a nontrivial generalization of that in the pure $CP(N)$models. Our models have quite a rich vacuum and soliton structure and approachthe many known gauged self-dual models in some limit.
