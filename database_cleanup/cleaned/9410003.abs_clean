We present a central extension of the $(m,n)$ super-Poincar\'e algebra in twodimensions. Besides the usual Poincar\'e generators and the $(m,n)$supersymmetry generators we have $(m,n)$ Grassmann generators, a bosonicinternal symmetry generator and a central charge. We then build up thetopological gauge theory associated to this algebra. We can solve the classicalfield equations for the fields which do not belong to the supergravitymultiplet and to a Lagrange multiplier multiplet. The resulting topologicalsupergravity theory turns out to be non-local in the fermionic sector.
