Title: Current algebras and light-cone quantization in 3+1 dimensions

Authors: Jouko Mickelsson

Comments: 12 pages

A polarization of the Lie algebras $Map(C, G)$ of gauge transformations onthe light-cone $C\subset\RM^4$ is introduced, using splitting of the initialdata on $C$ for the wave operator to positive and negative frequencies. Thisgeneralizes the usual polarization of affine Kac-Moody algebras to positive andnegative frequencies and paves the way to a generalization of the highestweight theory to the $3+1$ dimensional setting.
