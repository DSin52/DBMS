note added on November 24, 1996.Quantum mechanics of a test particle interacting with a spinning string(torsion vortex) is the quantum mechanics of the celebrated Aharonov-Bohmeffect. The angular momentum per unit length $J$ characterizing the spinningstring corresponds to the magnetic flux $\Phi$ of the Aharonov-Bom fluxon andthe gravitational mass-energy $E$ of an incoming particle corresponds to theelectric charge $q$. The characteristic periodicity of the gravitationalAharonov-Bohm scattering cross-section in the product of $GEJ$ has suggested anew quantization of mass-energy relation. We encounter a new physical situationwhere the gravitational mass-energy is quantized and the quantization conditioncontains both the Newton constant $G$ and the Planck constant $h$.
