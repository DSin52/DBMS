The topology and geometry of the moduli space, M_2, of degree 2 staticsolutions of the CP^1 model on a torus (spacetime T^2 x R) are studied. It isproved that M_2 is homeomorphic to the left coset space G/G_0 where G is acertain eight-dimensional noncompact Lie group and G_0 is a discrete subgroupof order 4. Low energy two-lump dynamics is approximated by geodesic motion onM_2 with respect to a metric g defined by the restriction to M_2 of the kineticenergy functional of the model. This lump dynamics decouples into a trivial``centre of mass'' motion and nontrivial relative motion on a reduced modulispace. It is proved that (M_2,g) is geodesically incomplete and has only finitediameter. A low dimensional geodesic submanifold is identified and a fulldescription of its geodesics obtained.
