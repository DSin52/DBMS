The article is a natural continuation of the papers by Gavrilov and Gitman(Class.Quant.Grav. {\bf 17} (2000) L133; Int. J. Mod. Phys. A15 (2000) 4499)devoted to relativistic particle quantization. Here we generalize the problem,considering the quantization of a spinning particle in arbitrary gravitationalbackground. The nontriviality of such a generalization is related to theneccessity of solving complicated ordering problems. Similar to the flatspace-time case, we show in the course of the canonical quantization how aconsistent relativistic quantum mechanics of spinning particle in gravitationaland electromagnetic backgrounds can be constructed.
