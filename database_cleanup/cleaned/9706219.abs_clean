In N=1 supersymmetric theories, quasi Nambu-Goldstone (QNG) bosons appear inaddition to ordinary Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons when the global symmetry Gbreaks down spontaneously. We investigate two-body scattering amplitudes ofthese bosons in the low-energy effective Lagrangian formalism. They areexpressed by the curvature of Kahler manifold. The scattering amplitudes of QNGbosons are shown to coincide with those of NG bosons though the effectiveLagrangian contains an arbitrary function, and those with odd number of QNGbosons all vanish.
