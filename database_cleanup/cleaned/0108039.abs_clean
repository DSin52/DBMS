We find new integrable boundary conditions, depending on a free parameter$g$, for the O(N) nonlinear $\sigma$ model, which are of nondiagonal type, thatis, particles can change their ``flavor'' through scattering off the boundary.These boundary conditions are derived from a microscopic boundary lagrangian,which is used to establish their integrability, and exhibit integrable flowsbetween diagonal boundary conditions investigated earlier. We solve theboundary Yang-Baxter equation, connect these solutions to the boundaryconditions, and examine the corresponding integrable flows.
