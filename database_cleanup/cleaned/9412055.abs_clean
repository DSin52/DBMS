We develop a general formalism to calculate the force between beads attachedto a flat $d$-dimensional membrane due to the quantum fluctuations of themembrane. The interaction potential is derived as a function of $d$ and themembrane energy density, tension, stiffness and temperature. We find that theinduced interactions turn off when $d$ exceeds a certain critical dimension.The potential is attractive in all cases where it is non-zero and at finitetemperature falls off exponentially for large distances.
