Extending early work, we formulate the large N matrix mechanics of generalThe Hamiltonian framework of large N matrix mechanics provides a naturalsetting in which to study the algebras of the large N limit, including(reduced) Lie algebras, (reduced) supersymmetry algebras and free algebras. Wefind in particular a broad array of new free algebras which we call symmetricCuntz algebras, interacting symmetric Cuntz algebras, symmetricBose/Fermi/Cuntz algebras and symmetric Cuntz superalgebras, and we discuss therole of these algebras in solving the large N theory. Most important, theinteracting Cuntz algebras are associated to a set of new (hidden) localquantities which are generically conserved only at large N. A number of othernew large N phenomena are also observed, including the intrinsic nonlocality ofthe (reduced) trace class operators of the theory and a closely related large Nfield identification phenomenon which is associated to another set (this timenonlocal) of new conserved quantities at large N.
