A superfield method of computing the effective potential in supersymmetricfield theories is suggested. Analysis of the structure of the effectivepotential in the Wess-Zumino model is carried out. It is shown that thepotential, chiral effective potential and auxiliary fields' effectivepotential. One-loop kahlerian effective potential is calculated using thesuperfield heat kernel technique. A corresponding superfield kernel is found inexplicit form. Procedure for computing higher loop corrections is developed.First (two-loop) correction to chiral effective potential is found. Two-loopkahlerian effective potential is calculated.
