Surface states are open string field configurations which arise from Riemannsurfaces with a boundary and form a subalgebra of the star algebra. We findthat a general class of star algebra projectors arise from surface states wherethe open string midpoint reaches the boundary of the surface. The projectorproperty of the state and the split nature of its wave-functional arise becauseof a nontrivial feature of conformal maps of nearly degenerate surfaces.Moreover, all such projectors are invariant under constant and oppositetranslations of their half-strings. We show that the half-string statesassociated to these projectors are themselves surface states. In addition tothe sliver, we identify other interesting projectors. These include a butterflystate, which is the tensor product of half-string vacua, and a nothing state,where the Riemann surface collapses.
