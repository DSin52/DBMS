Extremal BPS-saturated black holes in $N=2$, $d=4$ supergravity can carryelectric and magnetic charges $(q^\Lambda_{(m)},q_\Lambda^{(e)})$. It is shownthat in smooth cases the moduli fields at the horizon take a fixed "rational"value $X^\Lambda(q_{(m)},q^{(e)})$ which is determined by the charges and isindependent of the asymptotic values of the moduli fields. A universal formulafor the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is derived in terms of the charges and themoduli space geometry at $X^\Lambda(q_{(m)},q^{(e)})$. This work extendsprevious results of Ferrara, Kallosh and the author for the pure magnetic case.
