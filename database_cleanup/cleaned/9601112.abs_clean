International Workshop on High Energy Physics and Quantum Field Theory(Zvenigorod, Russia, 20-26 September 1995). Some misprints, which are notessential for the results of the article, are corrected in the revisedversionWe give a review of the exact renormalization group (ERG) approach andillustrate its applications in scalar and fermionic theories. The derivativeexpansion and approximations based on the derivative expansion with furthertruncation in the number of fields (mixed approximation) are discussed. Weanalyse the mixed approximation for a three-dimensional scalar theory and showthat it is less effective than the pure derivative expansion. For purefermionic theories analytical solutions for the pure derivative expansion andmixed approximation in the limit $N \to \infty $, where $N$ is the number offermionic species, are found. For finite $N$ a few series of fixed pointsolutions with their anomalous dimensions and critical exponents are computednumerically. We argue that one of the fermionic solutions can be identifiedwith that of Dashen and Frishman, whereas the others seem to be new ones. Theissues of spurious solutions and scheme dependence of the results arediscussed.
