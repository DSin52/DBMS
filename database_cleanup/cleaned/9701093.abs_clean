Scattering of fundamental states of type IIB supergravity and superstringtheory is discussed at low orders in perturbation theory in the background of aD-instanton. The integration over fermionic zero modes in both the low energysupergravity and in the string theory leads to explicit nonperturbative termsin the effective action. These include a single instanton correction to theknown tree-level and one-loop $R^4$ interactions. The `spectrum' ofmultiply-charged D-instantons is deduced by T-duality in nine dimensions frommultiply-wound world-lines of marginally-bound D-particles. This, and otherclues, lead to a conjectured SL(2,Z) completion of the $R^4$ terms whichsuggests that they are not renormalized by perturbative corrections in thezero-instanton sector beyond one loop. The string theory unit-chargedD-instanton gives rise to point-like effects in fixed-angle scattering, raisingunresolved issues concerning distance scales in superstring theory.
