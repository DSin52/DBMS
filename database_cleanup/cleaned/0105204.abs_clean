We show how the motion through the extra dimensions of a gas of branes andantibranes can, under certain circumstances, produce an era of inflation asseen by observers trapped on a 3-brane, with the inflaton being the inter-braneseparation. Although most of our discussion refers to arbitrary p-branes, whenwe need to be specific we assume that they are D-branes of Type II or Type Istring theory. For realistic brane couplings, such as those arising in stringtheory, the inter-brane potentials are too steep to inflate the universe foracceptably long times. However, for special regions of the parameter space ofbrane-antibrane positions the brane motion is slow enough for there to besufficient inflation. Inflation would be more generic in models where theinter-brane interactions are much weaker. The spectrum of primordial densityfluctuations predicted has index n slightly less than 1, and an acceptableamplitude, provided that the extra dimensions have linear size 1/r ~ 10^{12}GeV. Reheating occurs as in hybrid inflation, with the tachyonic instability ofthe brane-antibrane system taking over for small separations. The tachyon fieldcan induce a cascade mechanism within which higher-dimension branes annihilateinto lower-dimension ones. We argue that such a cascade naturally stops withthe production of 3-branes in 10-dimensional string theory.
