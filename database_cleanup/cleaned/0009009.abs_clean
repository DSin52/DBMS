As shown by Hashimoto and Itzhaki in hep-th/9911057, the perturbative degreesof freedom of a non-commutative Yang-Mills theory (NCYM) on a torus arequasi-local only in a finite energy range. Outside that range one may resort toa Morita equivalent (or T-dual) description appropriate for that energy. Inthis note, we study NCYM on a non-commutative torus with an irrationaldeformation parameter $\theta$. In that case, an infinite tower of dualdescriptions is generically needed in order to describe the UV regime. Weconstruct a hierarchy of dual descriptions in terms of the continued fractionapproximations of $\theta$. We encounter different descriptions depending onthe level of the irrationality of $\theta$ and the amount of non-localitytolerated. The behavior turns out to be isomorphic to that found for the phasestructure of the four-dimensional Villain $Z_N$ lattice gauge theories, whichwe revisit as a warm-up. At large 't Hooft coupling, using the AdS/CFTcorrespondance, we find that there are domains of the radial coordinate $U$where no T-dual description makes the derivative expansion converge. The radialdirection obtains multifractal characteristics near the boundary of AdS.
