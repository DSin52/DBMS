Features of screening and confinement are reviewed in two-dimensional quantumelectrodynamics (QED2). Our discussion is carried out using the gauge-invariantbut path-dependent variables formalism. This alternative and useful approachexploits the rich structure of the electromagnetic cloud or dressing aroundstatic fermions in a straightforward and simple way.
