We show that the Ocneanu algebra of quantum symmetries, for an ADE diagram(or for higher Coxeter-Dynkin systems, like the Di Francesco - Zuber system)is, in most cases, deduced from the structure of the modular T matrix in the Aseries. We recover in this way the (known) quantum symmetries of su(2) diagramsand illustrate our method by studying those associated with the three genuineexceptional diagrams of type su(3), namely E5, E9 and E21. This also providesthe shortest way to the determination of twisted partition functions inboundary conformal field theory with defect lines.
