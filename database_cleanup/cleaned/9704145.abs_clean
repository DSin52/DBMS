corrected for eleven-dimensional expressionsThe R^4 terms in the effective action for M-theory compactified on atwo-torus are motivated by combining one-loop results in type II superstringtheories with the Sl(2,Z) duality symmetry. The conjectured expressionreproduces precisely the tree-level and one-loop R^4 terms in the effectiveaction of the type II string theories compactified on a circle, together withthe expected infinite sum of instanton corrections. This conjecture impliesthat the R^4 terms in ten-dimensional string type II theories receive noperturbative corrections beyond one loop and there are also no non-perturbativecorrections in the ten-dimensional IIA theory. Furthermore, theeleven-dimensional M-theory limit exists, in which there is an R^4 term thatoriginates entirely from the one-loop contribution in the type IIA theory andis related by supersymmetry to the eleven-form C^{(3)}R^4. The generalizationto compactification on T^3 as well as implications for non-renormalizationtheorems in D-string and D-particle interactions are briefly discussed.
