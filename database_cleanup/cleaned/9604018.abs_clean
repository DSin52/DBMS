We review the status of quantising (non-abelian) gauge theories usingdifferent versions of a Hamiltonian formulation corresponding to Dirac'sinstant and front form of dynamics, respectively. In order to control infrareddivergences we work in a finite spatial volume, chosing a torus geometry forconvenience. We focus on the determination of the physical configuration spaceof gauge invariant variables via gauge fixing. This naturally leads us to theissue of the Gribov problem. We discuss it for different gauge choices, inparticular finite volume modifications of the axial gauge. Conventional andlight-front quantisation are compared and the differences pointed out.
