21-28 June 1992, ed. N. Sachez, World Scientific, 1993, p.202We discuss some aspects of string cosmology with an emphasis on the roleplayed by the dilaton.A cosmological scenario based on the assumption that all spatial dimensionsare periodic so that winding modes play an important role is reviewed. Apossibility of a transition from a `string phase' to the `standard' cosmologyvia a radiation dominated era and inflation is analysed. We also summarise somerecent results about time dependent solutions of tree level string equations.
