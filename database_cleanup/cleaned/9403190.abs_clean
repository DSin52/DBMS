The dispersionless Toda hierarchy turns out to lie in the heart of a recentlyproposed Landau-Ginzburg formulation of two-dimensional string theory atself-dual compactification radius. The dynamics of massless tachyons withdiscrete momenta is shown to be encoded into the structure of a specialsolution of this integrable hierarchy. This solution is obtained by solving aRiemann-Hilbert problem. Equivalence to the tachyon dynamics is proven byderiving recursion relations of tachyon correlation functions in the machineryof the dispersionless Toda hierarchy. Fundamental ingredients of theLandau-Ginzburg formulation, such as Landau-Ginzburg potentials and tachyonLandau-Ginzburg fields, are translated into the language of the Lax formalism.Furthermore, a wedge algebra is pointed out to exist behind the Riemann-Hilbertproblem, and speculations on its possible role as generators of ``extra''states and fields are presented.
