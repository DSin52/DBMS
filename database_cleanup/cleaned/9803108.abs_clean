We study non-linear corrections to the low-energy description of the (2,0)theory. We argue for the existence of a topological correction term similar tothe C3 wedge X8(R) in M-theory. This term can be traced to a classical effectin supergravity and to a one-loop diagram of the effective 4+1D SuperYang-Mills. We study other terms which are related to it by supersymmetry anddiscuss the requirements on the subleading correction terms fromM(atrix)-theory. We also speculate on a possible fundamental formulation of thetheory.
