We study fluctuations around the warped conifold supergravity solution ofKlebanov and Tseytlin [hep-th/0002159], known to be dual to a cascading N=1gauge theory. Although this supergravity background is not asymptotically AdS,corresponding to a non-conformal field theory, it is possible to apply theusual methods of AdS/CFT duality to extract the high energy behavior of fieldtheory correlators by solving linearized equations of motion for fluctuationsaround the background. We consider the Goldstone vector dual to the anomalousR-symmetry current and compute its mass, which exactly matches the generalprediction of [hep-th/0009156]. We find the high energy 2-point functions forthe R-current and two other vectors. As expected, the R-current 2-pointfunction has a longitudinal part because R-symmetry is broken. We alsocalculate the high energy 2-point function of the energy-momentum tensor fromfluctuations of modes in the graviton sector. This 2-point function has a tracepart corresponding to broken conformal symmetry.
