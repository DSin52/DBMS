Mirror Symmetry, Picard-Fuchs equations and instanton corrected Yukawacouplings are discussed within the framework of toric geometry. It allows toestablish mirror symmetry of Calabi-Yau spaces for which the mirror manifoldhad been unavailable in previous constructions. Mirror maps and Yukawacouplings are explicitly given for several examples with two and three moduli.
