Generalizing the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations, we derive a hierarchy ofnon-linear Ward identities for affine-Virasoro correlators. The hierarchyfollows from null states of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov type and the assumptionof factorization, whose consistency we verify at an abstract level. Solution ofthe equations requires concrete factorization ans\"atze, which may vary overaffine-Virasoro space. As a first example, we solve the non-linear equationsfor the coset constructions, using a matrix factorization. The resulting cosetcorrelators satisfy first-order linear partial differential equations whosesolutions are the coset blocks defined by Douglas.
