We derive type II supergravity solutions corresponding to space-fillingregular and fractional Dp branes on (9-p)-dimensional conical transversespaces. Fractional Dp-branes are wrapped D(p+2)-branes; therefore, oursolutions exist only if the base of the cone has a non-vanishing Betti numberb_2. We also consider 11-dimensional SUGRA solutions corresponding to regularand fractional M2 branes on 8-dimensional cones whose base has a non-vanishingb_3. (In this case a fractional M2-brane is an M5-brane wrapped over a3-cycle.) We discuss the gauge theory intepretation of these solutions, as wellas of the solutions constructed by Cvetic et al. in hep-th/0011023 andhep-th/0012011.
