We study the simplicial quantum gravity in three dimensions. Motivated by theBoulatov's model which generates a sum over simplicial complexes weighted withthe Turaev-Viro invariant, we introduce boundary operators in the simplicialgravity associated to compact orientable surfaces. An amplitude of the boundaryoperator is given by a sum over triangulations in the interior of the boundarysurface. It turns out that the amplitude solves the Schwinger-Dyson equationeven if we restrict the topology in the interior of the surface, as far as thesurface is non-degenerate. We propose a set of factorization conditions on theamplitudes which singles out a solution associated to triangulations of $S^3$.
