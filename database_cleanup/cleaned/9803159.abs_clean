Title: Symmetry and symmetry breaking in particle physics

Comments: Invited talk at the 8th General Meeting of European Women in

Mathematics, Trieste December 1997, given to a general audience ofmathematicians, 12 pages, Latex, 1 figure using epsSymmetry, in particular gauge symmetry, is a fundamental principle intheoretical physics. It is intimately connected to the geometry of fibrebundles. A refinement to the gauge principle, known as ``spontaneous symmetrybreaking'', leads to one of the most successful theories in modern particlephysics. In this short talk, I shall try to give a taste of this beautiful andexciting concept.
