Superembeddings which have bosonic codimension zero are studied in 3,4 and 6dimensions. The worldvolume multiplets of these branes are off-shell vectormultiplets in these dimensions, and their self-interactions include aBorn-Infeld term. It is shown how they can be written in terms of standardvector multiplets in flat superspace by working in the static gauge. The actionformula is used to determine both Green-Schwarz type actions and superfieldactions.
