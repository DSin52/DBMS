We investigate orbifold constructions of conformal field theories from latticesby no-fixed-point automorphisms (NFPA's) $Z_p$ for $p$ prime, $p>2$,concentrating on the case $p=3$. Explicit expressions are given for most of therelevant vertex operators, and we consider the locality relations necessary forthese to define a consistent conformal field theory. A relation toconstructions of lattices from codes, analogous to that found in earlier workin the $p=2$ case which led to a generalisation of the triality structure ofthe Monster module, is also demonstrated.
