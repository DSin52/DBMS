Title: Some notes on string theory

Authors: Karl-Georg Schlesinger

Comments: 14 pages

We start from a quantum computational principle suggested for string theoryin a previous paper and discuss how it might lead to a dynamical principleimplying the correct classical gravitational limit. Besides this, we brieflylook at some structural properties of moduli space.
