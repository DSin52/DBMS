In this paper, we present a new formulation of topological conformal gravityin four dimensions. Such a theory was first considered by Witten as a possiblegravitational counterpart of topological Yang-Mills theory, but severalproblems left it incomplete. The key in our approach is to realise a theorywhich describes deformations of conformally self-dual gravitational instantons.We first identify the appropriate elliptic complex which does precisely this.By applying the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, we calculate the number ofindependent deformations of a given gravitational instanton which preserve itsself-duality. We then quantise topological conformal gravity by BRSTgauge-fixing, and discover how the quantum theory is naturally described by theabove complex. Indeed, it is a process which closely parallels that of theYang-Mills theory, and we show how the partition function generates an uncannygravitational analogue of the first Donaldson invariant.
