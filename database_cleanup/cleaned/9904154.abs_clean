Title: Non Relativistic Limit of a Model of Fermions interacting through a

Chern-Simons FieldComments: 16 pages (revtex), 5 figures (eps). Invited talk at the meeting ``II

Trends in Theoretical Physics'', Buenos Aires, Dec. 1998. To be published byAIPWe study the non relativistic limit of a Model of Fermions interactingthrough a Chern-Simons Field, from a perspective that resembles the Wilson'sRenormalization Group approach, instead of the more usual approach found inmost texts of Field Theory. The solution of some difficulties, and a newunderstanding of non relativistic models is given.
