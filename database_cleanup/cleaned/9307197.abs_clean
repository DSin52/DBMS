In this paper we give an explicit formula for level 1 vertex operatorsrelated to $U_q(\widehat{sl}(n))$ as operators on the Fock spaces. We derivealso their commutation relations. As an applications we culculate the one pointfunctions of the one-dimensional spin chain associated with the vectorrepresentation of $U_q(\widehat{sl}(n))$, thereby extending the recent work onthe staggered polarization of the $XXZ$-model.
