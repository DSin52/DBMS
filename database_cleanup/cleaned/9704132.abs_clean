Lagrangian formulation of free massive fields corresponding to irreduciblerepresentations of the Poincare group of arbitrary integer and half-integerspins in three-dimensional space-time is presented. A relationship of thetheory under consideration with the self-duality equations in four dimensionsis discussed.
