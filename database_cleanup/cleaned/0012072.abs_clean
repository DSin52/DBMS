We study some aspects of the Kaluza-Klein Melvin solution in M-theory. Theassociated magnetic field has a maximal critical value $B=\pm 1/R$ where $R$ isthe radius of the compactification circle. It is argued that the Melvinbackground of type IIA with magnetic field $B$ and of type 0A with magneticfield $B'=B-1/R$ are equivalent. Evidence for this conjecture is provided usinga further circle compactification and a `9-11' flip. We show that partitionfunctions of nine-dimensional type IIA strings and of a $(-1)^F\sigma_{1/2}$type IIA orbifold both with NS-NS Melvin fluxtubes are related by such shift ofthe magnetic field. Then the instabilities of both IIA and 0A Melvin solutionsare analyzed. For each theory there is an instanton associated to the decay ofspacetime. In the IIA case the decay mode is associated to the nucleation of$D6/D\bar{6}$-brane pairs, while in the 0A case spacetime decays throughWitten's bubble production.
