We consider issues related to tachyonic inflation with exponential potential.We find exact solution of evolution equations in the slow roll limit in FRWcosmology. We also carry out similar analysis in case of Brane assistedtachyonic inflation. We investigate the phase space behavior of the system andshow that the dust like solution is a late time attractor. The difficultiesassociated with reheating in the tachyonic model are also indicated.
