Title: Classical Theta Functions and Quantum Tori

Comments: 9 pages

The Schwartz kernel of the multiplication operation on a quantum torus isshown to be the distributional boundary value of a classical multivariate thetafunction. The kernel satisfies a Schr\"odinger equation in which the role oftime is played by the deformation parameter $\hbar$ and the role of thehamiltonian by a Poisson structure. At least in some special cases, the kernelcan be written as a sum of products of single-variable theta functions.
