We discuss Wilson loop averages in 4-dimensional non-commutativesuperYang-Mills theory using the dual supergravity description. We postulatethat the Wilson loops are located at the mimimum length scale $R$ in the fifthradial coordinate. We find that they exhibit a crossover from Coulomb type ofbehaviour for large loops, for which non-commutativity is unimportant, to arealaw for small loops, for which non-commutativity effects are large. The stringtension, which can be read off from the area law, is controlled by thenon-commutativity scale. The crossover itself, however, appears to involveloops of size of order $R$ which is much larger than the non-commutativityscale. The existence of the area law in non-commutative super Yang-Mills theorywhich persists up to a large crossover length scale provides further evidencefor connection to an underlying string theory.
