Title: Areal Theory

Authors: Thomas Curtright

Comments: December 2001 "Coral Gables" conference contribution; Scientific

Workplace LatexNew features are described for models with multi-particle area-dependentpotentials, in any number of dimensions. The corresponding many-body fieldtheories are investigated for classical configurations. Some explicit solutionsare given, and some conjectures are made about chaos in such field theories.
