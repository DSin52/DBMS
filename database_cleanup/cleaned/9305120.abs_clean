In these lecture notes we explain a connection between Yang-Mills theory onarbitrary Riemann surfaces and two types of topological field theory, the socalled $BF$ and cohomological theories. The quantum Yang-Mills theory is solvedexactly using path integral techniques. Explicit expressions, in terms of grouprepresentation theory, are obtained for the partition function and variouscorrelation functions. In a particular limit the Yang-Mills theory devolves tothe topological models and the previously determined correlation functions givetopological information about the moduli spaces of flat connections. Inparticular, the partition function yields the volume of the moduli space forwhich an explicit expression is derived. These notes are self contained, with abasic introduction to the various ideas underlying the topological fieldtheories. This includes some relatively new work on handling problems thatarise in the presence of reducible connections which in turn forms the bridgebetween the various models under consideration. These notes are identical tothose made available to participants of the 1992 summer school in Trieste,except for one or two additions added circa January 1993.
