Title: Physics with exotic probability theory

Authors: Saul Youssef

Probability theory can be modified in essentially one way while maintainingconsistency with the basic Bayesian framework. This modification results incopies of standard probability theory for real, complex or quaternionprobabilities. These copies, in turn, allow one to derive quantum theory whilerestoring standard probability theory in the classical limit. The argumentleading to these three copies constrain physical theories in the same sensethat Cox's original arguments constrain alternatives to standard probabilitytheory. This sequence is presented in some detail with emphasis on questionsbeyond basic quantum theory where new insights are needed.
