We compute the dependence on the classical action "gauge" parameters of thebeta functions of the standard topological sigma model in flat space. We thusshow that their value is a "gauge" artifact indeed. We also show thatpreviously computed values of these beta functions can be continuouslyconnected to one another by smoothly varying those gauge parameters.
