discrete dynamical systems of varying degrees of ``chaoticity". The systems tobe quantized are piecewise affine maps on the two-torus, viewed as phase space,and include the automorphisms, translations and skew translations. We thentreat some discontinuous transformations such as the Baker map and thesawtooth-like maps. Our approach extends some ideas from geometric quantizationand it is both conceptually and calculationally simple.
