It is shown explicitly that the correlation functions of Conformal FieldTheories (CFT) with the logarithmic operators are invariant under thedifferential realization of Borel subalgebra of $\W_\infty$-algebra. Thisalgebra is constructed by tensor-operator algebra of differentialrepresentation of ordinary $sl(2,C)$. This method allows us to writedifferential equations which can be used to find general expression for threeand four-point correlation functions possessing logarithmic operators. Theoperator product expansion (OPE) coefficients of general logarithmic CFT aregiven up to third level.
