Title: Discrete Classical Electromagnetic Fields

Comments: 13 pages in Revtex,5 ps figures

The classical electromagnetic field of a spinless point electron is describedin a formalism with extended causality by discrete finite transversepoint-vector fields with discrete and localized point interactions. Thesefields are taken as a classical representation of photons, ``classicalphotons". They are all transversal photons; there are no scalar norlongitudinal photons as these are definitely eliminated by the gauge condition.The angular distribution of emitted photons coincides with the directions ofmaximum emission in the standard formalism. The Maxwell formalism and itsstandard field are retrieved by the replacement of these discrete fields bytheir space-time averages, and in this process scalar and longitudinal photonsare necessarily created and added. Divergences and singularities areby-products of this averaging process. This formalism enlighten the meaning andthe origin of the non-physical photons, the ones that violate the Lorentzcondition in manifestly covariant quantization methods.
