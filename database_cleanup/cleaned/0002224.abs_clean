A string in four dimensions is constructed by supplementing it with fortyfour Majorana fermions. The central charge is 26. The fermions are grouped insuch a way that the resulting action is supersymmetric. The energy momentum andcurrent generators satisfy the super-Virasoro algebra. The tachyonic groundstate decouples from the physical states. GSO projections are necessary forproving modular invariance. Space-time supersymmetry provides reasons todiscard the tachyons and is substantiated for modes of zero mass. The symmetrygroup of the model descends to the low energy standard model group $SU (3)\times SU_L (2) \times U_Y (1)$ through the Pati-Salam group. Left rightsymmetry is broken spontaneously and the mass of the tau neutrino is calculatedto be about 1/25 electron volt.
