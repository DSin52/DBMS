We derive a bosonic Hamiltonian from two dimensional QCD on the light-front.To obtain the bosonic theory we find that it is useful to apply the bosonexpansion method which is the standard technique in quantum many-body physics.We introduce bilocal boson operators to represent the gauge-invariant quarkbilinears and then local boson operators as the collective states of thebilocal bosons. If we adopt the Holstein-Primakoff type among variousrepresentations, we obtain a theory of infinitely many interacting bosons,whose masses are the eigenvalues of the 't Hooft equation. In the large $N$limit, since the interaction disappears and the bosons are identified withmesons, we obtain a free Hamiltonian with infinite kinds of mesons.
