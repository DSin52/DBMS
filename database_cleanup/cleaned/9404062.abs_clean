Title: Geometry of the Frenkel-Kac-Segal cocycle

Comments: 26 pages

We present an analysis of the cocycle appearing in the vertex operatorrepresentation of simply-laced, affine, Kac-Moody algebras. We prove that itcan be described in the context of $R$-commutative geometry, where $R$ is aYang-Baxter operator, as a strong $R$-commutative algebra. We comment on theHochschild, cyclic and dihedral homology theories that appear innon-commutative geometry and their potential relation to string theory.
