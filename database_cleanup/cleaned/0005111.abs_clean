We develop some basic properties of the open string on the symmetric productwhich is supposed to describe the open string field theory in discretelightcone quantization (DLCQ). After preparing the consistency conditions ofthe twisted boundary conditions for Annulus/M\"obius/Klein Bottle amplitudes ingeneric non-abelian orbifold, we classify the most general solutions of theconstraints when the discrete group is $S_N$. We calculate the correspondingorbifold amplitudes from two viewpoints -- from the boundary state formalismand from the trace over the open string Hilbert space. It is shown that thetopology of the world sheet for the short string and that of the long string ingeneral do not coincide. For example the annulus sector for the short stringcontains all the sectors (torus, annulus, Klein bottle, M\"obius strip) of thelong strings. The boundary/cross-cap states of the short strings are classifiedinto three categories in terms of the long string, the ordinary boundary andthe cross-cap states, and the ``joint'' state which describes the connection oftwo short strings. We show that the sum of the all possible boundary conditionsis equal to the exponential of the sum of the irreducible amplitude -- one bodyamplitude of long open (closed) strings. This is typical structure of DLCQpartition function. We examined that the tadpole cancellation condition in ourlanguage and derived the well-known gauge group $SO(2^{13})$.
