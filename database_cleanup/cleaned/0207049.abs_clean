We analyze the effect of heavy fundamentally charged particles on the finitetemperature deconfining phase transition in the 2+1 dimensional Georgi-Glashowmodel. We show that in the presence of fundamental matter the transition turnsinto a crossover. The near critical theory is mapped onto the 2 dimensionalIsing model in an external magnetic field. Using this mapping we determine thewidth of the crossover region as well as the specific heat as a function of thefundamental mass.
