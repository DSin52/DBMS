We construct models in 1+1 dimensions with chiral (0,N) supersymmetry bytaking orientifolds of type IIB on an eight-torus identified by differentnumbers of reflections. The resulting models have Dirichlet strings, fivebranesand ninebranes stretched along different directions. The cases we study indetail have residual chiral supersymmetry (0,8), (0,4) and (0,2). Thegravitational anomaly in all cases is shown to cancel.
