A new parameterisation of the solutions of Toda field theory is introduced.In this parameterisation, the solutions of the field equations are real,well-defined functions on space-time, which is taken to be two-dimensionalMinkowski space or a cylinder. The global structure of the covariant phasespace of Toda theory is examined and it is shown that it is isomorphic to theHamiltonian phase space. The Poisson brackets of Toda theory are thencalculated. Finally, using the methods developed to study the Toda theory, weextend these results to the non-Abelian Toda field theories.
