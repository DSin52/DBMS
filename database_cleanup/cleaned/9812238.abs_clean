We consider a massive Rarita-Schwinger field on the Anti-de Sitter space andsolve the corresponding equations of motion. We show that appropriate boundaryterms calculated on-shell give two-point correlation functions for spin-3/2fields of the conformal field theory on the boundary. The relation betweenRarita-Schwinger field masses and conformal dimensions of correspondingoperators is established.
