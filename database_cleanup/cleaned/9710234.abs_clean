Title: Modular Localization, H-Temperatures and the Bethe Ansatz Structure

Authors: Bert Schroer (FU-Berlin)

Comments: 32 pages tcilatex, unpulished conference Report. The discussion of

the modular Moeller operator and the in-representation of the Zamolodchikovalgebra in section 4 has been extended and an annoying misprint in section 3was removed. Since the original paper on which this report was based hasmeanwhile appeared as hep-th/9712124, the present report will remainunchanged in the hep-th archiveThe recently proposed constructive approach to nonperturbative QFT, based onmodular localization, is reviewed and extended. It allows to unify black holesphysics and H-temperatures (H standing for Hawking or Horizon) with thebootstrap-formfactor program for nonperturbative construction of lowdimensional QFT. In case of on-shell particle number conservation, theequations characterizing the modular localization spaces for wedges areBethe-Ansatz equation in the form as recently obtained in the treatment offactorizable models.
