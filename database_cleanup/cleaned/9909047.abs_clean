We find an exact, N=1 supersymmetric kink solution of 5d gauged supergravity.We associate this solution with the RG flow from N=4 super Yang-Mills theory,deformed by a relevant operator, to pure N=1 super Yang-Mills in the IR. Wetest this identification by computing various QFT quantities using thecondensate. As demanded by our identification, our kink solution is a truedeformation of N=4, that exhibits confinement of quarks, magnetic screening,and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking.
