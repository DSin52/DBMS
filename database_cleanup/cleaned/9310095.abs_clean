The spectrum and partition function of a model consisting of SU(n) spinspositioned at the equilibrium positions of a classical Calogero model andinteracting through inverse-square exchange are derived. The energy levels areequidistant and have a high degree of degeneracy, with several SU(n) multipletsbelonging to the same energy eigenspace. The partition function takes the formof a q-deformed polynomial. This leads to a description of the system by meansof an effective parafermionic hamiltonian, and to a classification of thestates in terms of "modules" consisting of base-n strings of integers.
