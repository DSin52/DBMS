We couple non-linear $\sigma$-models to Liouville gravity, showing thatintegrability properties of symmetric space models still hold for the mattersector. Using similar arguments for the fermionic counterpart, namelyGross--Neveu-type models, we verify that such conclusions must also hold forthem, as recently suggested.
