Proceedings available on line fromScience Network Publishing atThis course provides a self contained introduction to the general theory ofrelativistic brane models, of the category that includes point particle,string, and membrane representations for phenomena that can be considered asbeing confined to a worldsheet of the corresponding dimension (respectivelyone, two, and three) in a thin limit approximation. The first part of thedifferential order, the geometry (and in particular the inner and outercurvature) of a brane worldsheet of arbitrary dimension is describable in termsof the first, second, and third fundamental tensor; the extension to afoliation by a congruence of such worldsheets is also briefly discussed. In thenext part, it is shown how -- to lowest order in the thin limit -- theevolution of such a brane worldsheet will always be governed by a simpletensorial equation of motion whose left hand side is the contraction of thesecond fundamental tensor with the relevant surface stress tensor, while theright hand side will simply vanish in the case of free motion and willotherwise be just the orthogonal projection of any external force density thatmay happen to act on the brane. (Allowance for first order deviations from sucha thin limit treatment would require evolution equations of a more complicatedkind of which a prototype example is presented.) The last part of the courseconcentrates on the case of a string, and particularly on the stationary(centrifugally supported) configurations known as vortons, which, if they aresufficiently stable, may be of considerable cosmological significance.
