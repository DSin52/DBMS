We consider a pair of coupled non-linear partial differential equationsdescribing a biochemical model system. The Weiss-algorithm for the Painle\'{e}test, that has been succesfully used in mathematical physics for theKdV-equation, Burgers equation, the sine-Gordon equation etc., is applied, andwe find that the system possesses only the "conditional" Painlev\'{e} property.We use the outcome of the analysis to construct an auto-B\"{a}cklundtransformation, and we find a variety of one and two-parameter families ofspecial solutions.
