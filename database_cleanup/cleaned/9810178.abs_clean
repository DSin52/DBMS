It has recently been shown how the effect of the divergent part of thegravitational self interaction for a classical string model in 4 dimensions canbe allowed for by a renormalisation of its stress energy tensor and in theelastic case a corresponding renormalisation of the off shell action. It isshown here that that it is possible to construct a new category of elasticstring models for which this effect is describable as a renormalisation in thestricter ``formal'' sense, meaning that it only requires a rescaling of one ofthe fixed parameters characterising the model.
