We investigate mesons in the bosonized massive Schwinger model in thelight-front Tamm-Dancoff approximation in the strong coupling region. Weconfirm that the three-meson bound state has a few percent fermion six-bodycomponent in the strong coupling region when expressed in terms of fermionvariables, consistent with our previous calculations. We also discuss somequalitative features of the three-meson bound state based on the informationabout the wave function.
