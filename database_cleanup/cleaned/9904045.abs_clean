By making use of the background field method, we derive a novel reformulationof the Yang-Mills theory which was proposed recently by the author to derivequark confinement in QCD. This reformulation identifies the Yang-Mills theorywith a deformation of a topological quantum field theory. The relevantbackground is given by the topologically non-trivial field configuration,especially, the topological soliton which can be identified with the magneticmonopole current in four dimensions. We argue that the gauge fixing termbecomes dynamical and that the gluon mass generation takes place by aspontaneous breakdown of the hidden supersymmetry caused by the dimensionalreduction. We also propose a numerical simulation to confirm the validity ofthe scheme we have proposed. Finally we point out that the gauge fixing partmay have a geometric meaning from the viewpoint of global topology where themagnetic monopole solution represents the critical point of a Morse function inthe space of field configurations.
