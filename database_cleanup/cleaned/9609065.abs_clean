We show how to obtain the explicite form of the low energy quantum effectiveaction for $N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in the weak coupling regionfrom the underlying hyperelliptic Riemann surface. This is achieved byevaluating the integral representation of the fields explicitly. We calculatethe leading instanton corrections for the group $SU(\nc), SO(N)$ and $SP(2N)$and find that the one-instanton contribution of the prepotentials for the thesegroup coincide with the one obtained recently by using the direct instantoncaluculation.
