Title: Unifying Approaches in Integrable Systems

Ultralocal and NonultralocalComments: Latex, 29 pages, 1 figure; To be published in {Classical and Quantum

SystemsThe aim of this review is to present the list of by now a significantcollection of quantum integrable models, ultralocal as well as nonultralocal,in a systematic way stressing on their underlying unifying algebraicstructures. We restrict to quantum and statistical models belonging totrigonometric and rational classes with (2 x 2)- Lax operators. The ultralocalmodels can be classified successfully through their associated quantum algebraand are governed by the Yang-Baxter equation, while the nonultralocal models,the theory of which is still in the developmental stage, allow systematizationthrough the braided Yang-Baxter equation. Along with the known integrablemodels some possible directions for investigation in this field and generationof such new models are suggested.
