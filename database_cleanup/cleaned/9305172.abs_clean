In a four dimensional theory of gravity with lagrangian quadratic incurvature and torsion, we compute the effective action for metrics of the form$g_{\mu\nu}=\rho^2\delta_{\mu\nu}$, with $\rho$ constant. Using standardfield-theoretic methods we find that one loop quantum effects produce anontrivial effective potential for $\rho$. We explain this unexpected result byshowing how our regularization procedure differs from the one that is usuallyadopted in Quantum Gravity. Using the method of the average effectivepotential, we compute the scale dependence of the v.e.v. of the conformalfactor.
