note which was pointed out by H. HataThe operators K_n are generators of reparameterization symmetries of Witten'scubic open string field theory. One pertinent question is whether they can beutilised to generate deformations of the tachyon vacuum and thereby violate itsuniqueness. We use level truncation to show that these transformations on thevacuum are in fact pure gauge transformations to a very high accuracy, thusgiving new evidence for the uniqueness of the perturbatively stable vacuum.Equivalently, this result implies the vanishing of some discrete cohomologyclasses of the BRST operator in the stable vacuum.
