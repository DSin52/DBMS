We calculate the entropy of the brane-world black hole in theRandall-Sundrum(RS) model by using the brick-wall method. The modes along theextra dimension are semi-classically quantized on the extra dimension. Thenumber of modes in the extra dimension is given as a simple form with the helpof the RS mass relation, and then the entropy for the scalar modes in thefive-dimensional spacetime is described by the two-dimensional area of theblack brane world.
