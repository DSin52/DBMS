We describe the symplectic structure and Hamiltonian dynamics for a class ofGrassmannian manifolds. Using the two dimensional sphere ($S^2$) and disc($D^2$) as illustrative cases, we write their path integral representationsusing coherent state techniques. These path integrals can be evaluated exactlyby semiclassical methods, thus providing examples of localisation formula.Along the way, we also give a local coordinate description for a class ofGrassmannians.
