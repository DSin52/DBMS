We present the 5-dimensional cosmological solutions in the Randall-Sundrumwarped compactification scenario, using the Goldberger-Wise mechanism tostabilize the size of the extra dimension. Matter on the Planck and TeV branesis treated perturbatively, to first order. The back-reaction of the scalarfield on the metric is taken into account. We identify the appropriategauge-invariant degrees of freedom, and show that the perturbations in the bulkscalar can be gauged away. We confirm previous, less exact computations of theshift in the radius of the extra dimension induced by matter. We point out thatthe physical mass scales on the TeV brane may have changed significantly sincethe electroweak epoch due to cosmological expansion, independently of thedetails of radius stabilization.
