Title: Eigenvalue Repulsion and Matrix Black Holes

Authors: Gavin Polhemus

Comments: 10 pages, AMS-LaTeX

Eigenvalue repulsion can explain the holographic growth of black holes inMatrix theory. The resulting picture is essentially the same as the Boltzmangas picture but avoids any assumption about the effective potential between theD0 branes. Further, eigenvalue repulsion extends the Boltzman gas picture pastthe BFKS point to N >> S. The use of Boltzman statistics is natural in thispicture.
