We consider simple CFT models which contain massless bosons, or masslessfermions or a supersymmetric combination of the two, on the strip. We study thedeformations of these models by relevant boundary operators. In particular, wework out the details for a boundary operator with a quadratic dependence on thefields and argue that some of our results can be extended to a more generalsituation. In the fermionic models, several subtleties arise due to thedoubling of zero modes at the UV fixed point and a ``GSO projected'' RG flow.We attempt to resolve these issues and to discuss how bulk symmetries arerealised along the flow. We end with some speculations on possible stringtheory applications of these results.
