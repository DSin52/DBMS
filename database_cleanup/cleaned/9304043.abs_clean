It is shown that gravity on the line can be described by the two dimensional(2D) Hilbert-Einstein Lagrangian supplemented by a kinetic term for the coframeand a translational {\it boundary} term. The resulting model is equivalent to aYang-Mills theory of local {\it translations} and frozen Lorentz gauge degrees.We will show that this restricted Poincar\'e gauge model in 2 dimensions iscompletely integrable. {\it Exact} wave, charged black hole, and `dilaton'solutions are then readily found. In vacuum, the integrability of the {\itgeneral} 2D Poincar\'e gauge theory is formally proved along the same line ofreasoning.
