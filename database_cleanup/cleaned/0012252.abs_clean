We study a nonminimal massive scalar field in a 2-dimensional black holespacetime. We consider the black hole which is the solution of the 2d dilatongravity derived from string-theoretical models. We found an explicit solutionin a closed form for all modes and the Green function of the scalar field withan arbitrary mass and a nonminimal coupling to the curvature. Greybody factors,the Hawking radiation, and $ < \phi^2 >^{ren} $ are calculated explicitly forthis exactly solvable model.
