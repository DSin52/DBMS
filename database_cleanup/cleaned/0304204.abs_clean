The large-group behavior of the nonlocal YM$_2$'s and gYM$_2$'s on a cylinderor a disk is investigated. It is shown that this behavior is similar to that ofthe corresponding local theory, but with the area of the cylinder replaced byan effective area depending on the dominant representation. The critical areasfor nonlocal YM$_2$'s on a cylinder with some special bounary conditions arealso obtained.
