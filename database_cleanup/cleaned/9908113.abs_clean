We derive a new form of loop equations for light-like Wilson loops. Inbosonic theories those loop equations close only for straight light-like Wilsonlines. In the case of N=1 in ten dimensions they close for any light-likeWilson loop. Upon dimensional reduction to N=4 SYM in four dimensions, theseloops become exactly the chiral loops which can be evaluated semiclassically,in the strong coupling limit, by a minimal surface in anti de-Sitter space. Weshow that the AdS calculation satisfies those loop equations. We also find anew fermionic loop equation derived from the gauge theory fermionic equation ofmotion.
