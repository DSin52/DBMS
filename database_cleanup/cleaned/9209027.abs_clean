We propose a bilocal field theory for mesons in two dimensions obtained as akind of non local bosonization of two dimensional QCD. Its semi-classicalexpansion is equivalent to the $1/N_c$ expansion of QCD. Using an ansatz wereduce the classical equation of motion of this theory in the baryon number onesector to a relativistic Hartree equation and solve it numerically. This (nontopological) soliton is identified with the baryon.
