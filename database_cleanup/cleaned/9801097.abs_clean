We explore the anomaly induced effective QCD meson potential in the frameworkof the effective Lagrangian approach. We suggest a decoupling procedure, when aflavored quark becomes massive, which mimics the one employed by Seiberg forsupersymmetric gauge theories. It is seen that, after decoupling, the QCDpotential naturally converts to the one with one less flavor. We study the$N_c$ and $N_f$ dependence of the $\eta^{\prime}$ mass.
