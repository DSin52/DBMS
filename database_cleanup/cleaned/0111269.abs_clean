The minimal embedding of the Standard Model in type I string theory isdescribed. The SU(3) color and SU(2) weak interactions arise from two differentcollections of branes. The correct prediction of the weak angle is obtained fora string scale of 6-8 TeV. Two Higgs doublets are necessary and protonstability is guaranteed. It predicts two massive vector bosons with masses atthe TeV scale, as well as a new superweak interaction.
