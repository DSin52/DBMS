An earlier proposed theory with linear-gonihedhic action for quantum gravityis reviewed. One can consider this theory as a "square root" of classicalgravity with a new fundamental constant of dimension one. We demonstrate also,that the partition function for the discretized version of the Einstein-Hilbertaction found by Regge in 1961 can be represented as a superposition of randomsurfaces with Euler character as an action and in the case of linear gravity asa superposition of three-dimensional manifolds with an action which isproportional to the total solid angle deficit of these manifolds. Thisrepresentation allows to construct the transfer matrix which describes thepropagation of space manifold. We discuss the so called gonihedric principlewhich allows to defind a discrete version of high derivative terms in quantumgravity and to introduce intrinsic rigidity of spacetime. This note is based ona talk delivered at the II meeting on constrained dynamics and quantum gravityat Santa Margherita Ligure.
