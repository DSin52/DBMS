We use the fivebrane of M theory to study the $\theta$ dependence of fourdimensional $SU(N_c)$ super Yang-Mills and super QCD softly broken by a gauginomass. We compute the energy of the vacuum in the supergravity approximation.The results obtained are in qualitative agreement with field theory. We alsostudy the $\theta$ dependence of the QCD string tension via the fivebrane.
