Title: Brackets in the jet-bundle approach to field theory

Comments: 15 pages AMS-latex file, talk given at the conference ``Secondary

Calculus and Cohomological Physics, August 24--31, 1997, Moscow, Russia''In the first part the sh Lie structure of brackets in field theory, describedin the jet bundle context along the lines suggested by Gel'fand, Dickey andDorfman, is analyzed. In the second part, we discuss how this descriptionallows us to find a natural relation between the Batalin-Vilkovisky antibracketand the Poisson bracket.
