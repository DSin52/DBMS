Title: Topological Field Theory As The Key To Quantum Gravity

Authors: Louis Crane

Comments: 10 pages to appear in Knots and Quantum Gravity ed John Baez, Oxford

University Press Latex documentMotivated by the similarity between CSW theory and the Chern Simons state forGeneral Relativity in the Ashtekar variables, we explore what the universewould look like if it were in a state corresponding to a 3D TQFT. We end upwith a construction of propagating ststes for parts of the universe and aHilbert space corresponding to a certain approximation. The construction avoidspath integrals, using instead recombination diagrams in a certain tensorcategory.
