We propose a method to investigate the conservation of brane charges at theintersection of two or more branes using the Thom classes of their normalbundles. In particular we find a relation between the charge of the branesinvolved in the configuration and the charge of the defects on the branes dueto the intersection. We also explore the applications of our method for variousbrane intersections in type II strings and M-theory.
