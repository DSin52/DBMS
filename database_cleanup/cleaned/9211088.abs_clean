There is a constrained-WZNW--Toda theory for any simple Lie algebra equippedwith an integral gradation. It is explained how the different approaches tothese dynamical systems are related by gauge transformations. Combining Gaussdecompositions in relevent gauges, we unify formulae already derived, andexplictly determine the holomorphic expansion of the conformally reduced WZNWsolutions - whose restriction gives the solutions of the Toda equations. Thesame takes place also for semi-integral gradations. Most of our conclusions arealso applicable to the affine Toda theories.
