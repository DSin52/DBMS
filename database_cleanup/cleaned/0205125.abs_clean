In the framework of the q-deformed Heisenberg algebra the investigation of$q$-deformation of Virial theorem explores that q-deformed quantum mechanicspossesses better dynamical property. It is clarified that in the case of thezero potential the theoretical framework for the q-deformed Virial theorem isself-consistent. In the selfadjoint states the q-deformed uncertainty relationessentially deviates from the Heisenberg one.
