A universal formula for an action associated with a noncommutative geometry,defined by a spectal triple $(\Ac ,\Hc ,D)$, is proposed. It is based on thespectrum of the Dirac operator and is a geometric invariant. The new symmetryprinciple is the automorphism of the algebra $\Ac $ which combines bothdiffeomorphisms and internal symmetries. Applying this to the geometry definedby the spectrum of the standard model gives an action that unifies gravity withthe standard model at a very high energy scale.
