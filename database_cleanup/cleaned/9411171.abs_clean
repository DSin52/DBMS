Title: The infinite unitary group, Howe dual pairs, and the quantization of

constrained systemsComments: LaTeX, 43 pages

The irreducible unitary representations of the Banach Lie group $U_0(\H)$(which is the norm-closure of the inductive limit $\cup_k U(k)$) of unitaryoperators on a separable Hilbert space $\H$, which were found by Kirillov andOl'shanskii, are reconstructed from quantization theory. Firstly, the coadjointorbits of this group are realized as Marsden-Weinstein symplectic quotients inthe setting of dual pairs. Secondly, these quotients are quantized on the basisof the author's earlier proposal to quantize a more general symplecticreduction procedure by means of Rieffel induction (a technique in the theory ofoperator algebras). As a warmup, the simplest such orbit, the projectiveHilbert space, is first quantized using geometric quantization, and then againwith Rieffel induction. Reduction and induction have to be performed witheither $U(M)$ or $U(M,N)$. The former case is straightforward, unless thehalf-form correction to the (geometric) quantization of the unconstrainedsystem is applied. The latter case, in which one induces from holomorphicdiscrete series representations, is problematic. For finite-dimensional$\H=\C^k$, the desired result is only obtained if one ignores half-forms, andinduces from a representation, `half' of whose highest weight is shifted by $k$(relative to the naive orbit correspondence). This presumably poses a problemfor any theory of quantizing constrained systems.
