We consider a class of extremal and non-extremal four-dimensional black-holesolutions occuring in toroidally compactified heterotic string theory, whoseten-dimensional interpretation involves a Kaluza-Klein monopole and afive-brane. We show that these four-dimensional solutions can be connected toextremal and non-extremal two-dimensional heterotic black-hole solutionsthrough a change in the asymptotic behaviour of the harmonic functionsassociated with the Kaluza-Klein monopole and with the five-brane. This changein the asymptotic behaviour can be achieved by a sequence of S and T-S-Tduality transformations in four dimensions. These transformations areimplemented by performing a reduction on a two-torus with Lorentzian signature.We argue that the same mechanism can be applied to extremal and non-extremalblack-hole solutions in the FHSV model.
