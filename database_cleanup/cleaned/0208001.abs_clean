The explicit solutions of the Bogomolny equations for N vortices on a sphereof radius R^2 > N are not known. In particular, this has prevented the use ofthe geodesic approximation to describe the low energy vortex dynamics. In thispaper we introduce an approximate general solution of the equations, valid forR^2 close to N, which has many properties of the true solutions, including thesame moduli space CP^N. Within the framework of the geodesic approximation, themetric on the moduli space is then computed to be proportional to the Fubini-Study metric, which leads to a complete description of the particle dynamics.
