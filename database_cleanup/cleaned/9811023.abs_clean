Title: The long delayed solution of the Bukhvostov Lipatov model

Comments: 9 pages

In this paper I complete the solution of the Bukhvostov Lipatov model bycomputing the physical excitations and their factorized S matrix. I alsoexplain the paradoxes which led in recent years to the suspicion that the modelmay not be integrable.
