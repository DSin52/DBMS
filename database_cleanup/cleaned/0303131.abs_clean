Title: Non-linear Brane Dynamics in a Six Dimensional Model

Authors: Bertha Cuadros-Melgar

Comments: 24 pages, 9 figures

We consider a dynamical brane world in a six dimensional spacetime containinga singularity. Using the Israel conditions we study the motion of a 4-braneembedded in this setup. We analize the brane behavior when its position isperturbed about a fixed point and solve the full non-linear dynamics in theseveral possible scenarios. We also investigate the possible gravitationalshortcuts and calculate the delay between graviton and photon signals and theratio of the corresponding subtended horizons.
