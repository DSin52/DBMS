It is shown how the Mandelstam constraints for an $SU(2)$ pure lattice gaugetheory with $3{\cal N}$ physical degrees of freedom may be solved completely interms of $3{\cal N}$ Wilson and Polyakov loop variables and ${\cal N}-1$ gaugeinvariant discrete +/-1 variables, thus enabling a manifestly gauge invariantformulation of the theory.
