We study the supersymmetric Gelfand-Dickey algebras associated with thesuperpseudodifferential operators of positive as well as negative leadingorder. We show that, upon the usual constraint, these algebras contain the N=2super Virasoro algebra as a subalgebra as long as the leading order is odd. Thedecompositions of the coefficient functions into N=1 primary fields are thenobtained by covariantizing the superpseudodifferential operators. We discussthe problem of identifying N=2 supermultiplets and work out a couple ofsupermultiplets by explicit computations.
