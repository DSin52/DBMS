We study different renormalisation group flows for scale dependent effectiveactions, including exact and proper-time renormalisation group flows. Theseflows have a simple one loop structure. They differ in their dependence on thefull field-dependent propagator, which is linear for exact flows. Weinvestigate the inherent approximations of flows with a non-linear dependenceon the propagator. We check explicitly that standard perturbation theory is notreproduced. We explain the origin of the discrepancy by providing links toexact flows both in closed expressions and in given approximations. We showthat proper-time flows are approximations to Callan-Symanzik flows. Within abackground field formalism, we provide a generalised proper-time flow, which isexact. Implications of these findings are discussed.
