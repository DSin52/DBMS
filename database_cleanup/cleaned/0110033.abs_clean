Non-Perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics, Paris, June 2001It is sometimes claimed that one cannot describe charged particles in gaugetheories. We identify the root of the problem and present an explicitconstruction of charged particles. This is shown to have good perturbativeproperties and, asymptotically before and after scattering, to recover particlemodes.
