A method is developed to construct irreducible representations(irreps) of thequantum supergroup $U_q(C(n+1))$ in a systematic fashion. It is shown thatevery finite dimensional irrep of this quantum supergroup at generic $q$ is adeformation of a finite dimensional irrep of its underlying Lie superalgebra$C(n+1)$, and is essentially uniquely characterized by a highest weight. Thecharacter of the irrep is given. When $q$ is a root of unity, all irreps of$U_q(C(n+1))$ are finite dimensional; multiply atypical highest weight irrepsand (semi)cyclic irreps also exist. As examples, all the highest weight and(semi)cyclic irreps of $U_q(C(2))$ are thoroughly studied.
