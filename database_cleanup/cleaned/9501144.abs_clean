This is a review of irrational conformal field theory, which includesrational conformal field theory as a small subspace. Central topics of thereview include the Virasoro master equation, its solutions and the dynamics ofirrational conformal field theory. Discussion of the dynamics includes thegeneralized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations on the sphere, the correspondingheat-like systems on the torus and the generic world- sheet action ofirrational conformal field theory.
