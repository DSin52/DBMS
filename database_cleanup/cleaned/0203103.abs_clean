We prove a relation between the asymptotic behavior of the conformal factorand the accessory parameters of the SU(1,1) Riemann- Hilbert problem. Such arelation shows the hamiltonian nature of the dynamics of N particles coupled to2+1 dimensional gravity. A generalization of such a result is used to prove aconnection between the regularized Liouville action and the accessoryparameters in presence of general elliptic singularities. This relation hadbeen conjectured by Polyakov in connection with 2-dimensional quantum gravity.An alternative proof, which works also in presence of parabolic singularities,is given by rewriting the regularized Liouville action in term of a backgroundfield.
