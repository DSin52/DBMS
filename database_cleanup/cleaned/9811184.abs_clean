In this paper we study dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in dimensionallyregularized quenched QED within the context of Dyson-Schwinger equations. In D< 4 dimensions the theory has solutions which exhibit chiral symmetry breakingfor all values of the coupling. To begin with, we study this phenomenon bothnumerically and, with some approximations, analytically within the rainbowapproximation in the Landau gauge. In particular, we discuss how to extract thecritical coupling alpha_c = pi/3 relevant in four dimensions from the Ddimensional theory. We further present analytic results for the chirallysymmetric solution obtained with the Curtis-Pennington vertex as well asnumerical results for solutions exhibiting chiral symmetry breaking. For thesewe demonstrate that, using dimensional regularization, the extraction of thecritical coupling relevant for this vertex is feasible. Initial results forthis critical coupling are in agreement with cut-off based work within thecurrently achievable numerical precision.
