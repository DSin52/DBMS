The chiral null model is a generalization of the fundamental string andgravitational wave background. It is an example of a conformally invariantmodel in all orders in $\alpha'$ and has unbroken supersymmetries. In aKaluza--Klein approach we start in 10 dimensions and reduce the model down to 4dimensions without making any restrictions. The 4-D field content is given bythe metric, torsion, dilaton, a moduli field and 6 gauge fields. This model isself-dual and near the singularities asymptotically free. The relation to knownIWP, Taub-NUT and rotating black hole solutions is discussed.
