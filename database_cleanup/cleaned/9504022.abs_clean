The quantum entanglement entropy of an eternal black hole is studied. Weargue that the relevant Euclidean path integral is taken over fields defined on$\alpha$-fold covering of the black hole instanton. The statement thatdivergences of the entropy are renormalized by renormalization of gravitationalcouplings in the effective action is proved for non-minimally coupled scalarmatter. The relationship of entanglement and thermodynamical entropies isdiscussed.
