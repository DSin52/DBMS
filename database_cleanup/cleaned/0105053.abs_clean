We study SU(N) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with massless adjoint matterdefined on $M^3\otimes S^1$. The SU(N) gauge symmetry is broken maximally to$U(1)^{N-1}$, independent of the number of flavor and the boundary conditionsof the fields associated with the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism of supersymmetrybreaking. The mass of the Higgs scalar is generated through quantum correctionsin the extra dimensions. The quantum correction can become manifest by a finiteHiggs boson mass at low energies even in the limit of small extra dimensionsthanks to the supersymmetry breaking parameter of the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism.
