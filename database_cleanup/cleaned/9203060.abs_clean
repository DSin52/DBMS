We find the general solution to Polchinski's classical scattering equationsfor $1+1$ dimensional string theory. This allows efficient computation ofscattering amplitudes in the standard Liouville $\times$ $c=1$ background.Moreover, the solution leads to a mapping from a large class of time-dependentcollective field theory backgrounds to corresponding nonlinear sigma models.Finally, we derive recursion relations between tachyon amplitudes. These may besummarized by an infinite set of nonlinear PDE's for the partition function inan arbitrary time-dependent background.
