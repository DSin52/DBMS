Following the construction of the $\kappa$-Minkowski space from thebicrossproduct structure of the $\kappa$-Poincare group, we investigatepossible differential calculi on this noncommutative space. We discuss then theaction of the Lorentz quantum algebra and prove that there are no 4Dbicovariant differential calculi, which are Lorentz covariant. We show,however, that there exist a five-dimensional differential calculus, whichsatisfies both requirements. We study also a toy example of 2D$\kappa$-Minkowski space and and we briefly discuss the main properties of itsdifferential calculi.
