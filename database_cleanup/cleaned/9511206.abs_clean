Using the torus action method, we construct one variable polynomialrepresentation of quantum cohomology ring for degree $k$ hypersurface in$CP^{N-1}$ . The results interpolate the well-known result of $CP^{N-2}$ modeland the one of Calabi-Yau hypersuface in $CP^{N-1}$. We find in $k\leq N-2$case, principal relation of this ring have very simple form compatible withtoric compactification of moduli space of holomorphic maps from $CP^{1}$ to$CP^{N-1}$.
