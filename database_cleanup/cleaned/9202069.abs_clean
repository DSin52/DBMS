We study the renormalization and conservation at the quantum level ofhigher-spin currents in affine Toda theories with particular emphasis on thenonsimply-laced cases. For specific examples, namely the spin-3 current for the$a_3^{(2)}$ and $c_2^{(1)}$ theories, we prove conservation to all-loop order,thus establishing the existence of factorized S-matrices. For these theories,as well as the simply-laced $a_2^{(1)}$ theory, we compute one-loop correctionsto the corresponding higher-spin charges and study charge conservation for thethree-particle vertex function. For the $a_3^{(2)}$ theory we show thatalthough the current is conserved, anomalous threshold singularities spoil theconservation of the corresponding charge for the on-shell vertex function,implying a breakdown of some of the bootstrap procedures commonly used indetermining the exact S-matrix.
