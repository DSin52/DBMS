We present a method for classifying conformal field theories based on Coulombgases (bosonic free-field construction). Given a particular geometricconfiguration of the screening charges, we give necessary conditions for theexistence of degenerate representations and for the closure of thevertex-operator algebra. The resulting classification contains, but is moregeneral than, the standard one based on classical Lie algebras. We then applythe method to the Coulomb gas theory for the two-flavoured loop model ofJacobsen and Kondev. The purpose of the study is to clarify the relationbetween Coulomb gas models and conformal field theories with extendedsymmetries.
