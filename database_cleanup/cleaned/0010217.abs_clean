We investigate further on the correspondence between branes on a Calabi-Yauin the large volume limit and in the orbifold limit. We conjecture a newprocedure which improves computationally the McKay correspondence and prove itin a non trivial example. We point out the relevance of helices and try to drawsome general conclusions about Beilinson theorem and McKay correspondence.
