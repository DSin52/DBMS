We treat spherically symmetric black holes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity byimposing boundary conditions on fluctuating metric on the horizon. Obtainedeffective two-dimensional theory admits Virasoro algebra near the horizon. Thisenables, with the help of Cardy formula, evaluation of the number of states.Obtained results coincide with the known macroscopic expression for the entropyof black holes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity.
