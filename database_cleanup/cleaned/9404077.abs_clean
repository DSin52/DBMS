Polyakov has argued that the QCD string should have long range order. We showthat a phase transition does exist in a generalization of string theorycharacterized by the addition of the curvature of the world sheet (rigidity)and the long range Kalb-Ramond interactions to the Nambu-Goto action. Althoughrigid strings coupled to long range interactions exhibit the typicalpathologies of higher derivative theories at the classical level, we commentbased on previous results in rigid paths coupled to long range Coulombinteractions that both phases of the quantum theory are free of ghosts andtachyons.
