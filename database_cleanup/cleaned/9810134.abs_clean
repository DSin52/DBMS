44'th annual meeting of the Israel Physical Society, Apr 8, 1998, Rehovot,Israel, and ICHEP98, 23-29 July, Vancouver, BC, Canada, and second conf. onQuantum Aspects of Gauge Theories, Supersymmetry and Unification, Sept 21-26,1998, Corfu, Greece. To be published in the proceedingsScale factor duality, a truncated form of time dependent T-duality, is asymmetry of string effective action in cosmological backgrounds interchangingsmall and large scale factors. The symmetry suggests a cosmological scenario("pre-big-bang") in which two duality related branches, an inflationary branchand a decelerated branch are smoothly joined into one non-singular cosmology.The use of scale factor duality in the analysis of the higher derivativecorrections to the effective action, and consequences for the nature of exittransition, between the inflationary and decelerated branches, are outlined. Anew duality symmetry is obeyed by the lowest order equations for inhomogeneityperturbations which always exist on top of the homogeneous and isotropicbackground. In some cases it corresponds to a time dependent version ofS-duality, interchanging weak and strong coupling and electric and magneticdegrees of freedom, and in most cases it corresponds to a time dependentmixture of both S-, and T-duality.The energy spectra obtained by using the new symmetry reproduce known resultsof produced particle spectra, and can provide a useful lower bound on particleproduction when our knowledge of the detailed dynamical history of thebackground is approximate or incomplete.
