An important element in a model of non-singular string cosmology is a phasein which classical corrections saturate the growth of curvature in adeSitter-like phase with a linearly growing dilaton (an `algebraic fixedpoint'). As the form of the classical corrections is not well known, here welook for evidence, based on a suggested symmetry of the action, scale factorduality and on conformal field theory considerations, that they can producethis saturation. It has previously been observed that imposing scale factorduality on the $O(\alpha')$ corrections is not compatible with fixed pointbehavior. Here we present arguments that these problems persist to all ordersin $\alpha'$. We also present evidence for the form of a solution to theequations of motion using conformal perturbation theory, examine itsimplications for the form of the effective action and find novel fixed pointstructure.
