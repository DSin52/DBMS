We investigate blowup formulae in Donaldson-Witten theory with gauge groupSU(N), using the theory of hyperelliptic Kleinian functions. We find that theblowup function is a hyperelliptic sigma-function and we describe an explicitprocedure to expand it in terms of the Casimirs of the gauge group up toarbitrary order. As a corollary, we obtain a new expression for the contactterms and we show that the correlation functions involving the exceptionaldivisor are governed by the KdV hierarchy. We also show that, for manifolds ofsimple type, the blowup function becomes a tau-function for a multisolitonsolution.
