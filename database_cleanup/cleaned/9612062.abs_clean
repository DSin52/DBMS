We study multiple 3-branes on an F theory orientifold. The world-volumetheory of the 3-branes is d=4, N=2 Sp(2k) gauge theory with an antisymmetrictensor and four flavors of matter in the fundamental. The solution of thisgauge theory is found for vanishing bare mass of the antisymmetric tensormatter, and massive fundamental matter. The integrable system underlying thistheory is constructed.
