Sigma model actions are constructed for the Type II superstring compactifiedto four and six dimensional curved backgrounds which can contain non-vanishingRamond-Ramond fields. These actions are N=2 worldsheet superconformallyinvariant and can be covariantly quantized preserving manifest spacetimesupersymmetry. They are constructed using a hybrid version of superstringvariables which combines features of the Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz and Green-Schwarzformalisms. For the $AdS_2\times S^2$ and $AdS_3\times S^3$ backgrounds, theseactions differ from the classical Greeen-Schwarz actions by a crucial kineticterm for the fermions. Parts of this work have been done in collaborations withM. Bershadsky, T. Hauer, W. Siegel, C. Vafa, E. Witten, S. Zhukov and B.Zwiebach.
