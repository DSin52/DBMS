The non-commutative Wess-Zumino model is used as a prototype for studying thelow energy behaviour of a renormalizable non-commutative field theory. We startby deriving the potential mediating the fermion-fermion and boson-bosoninteractions in the non-relativistic regime. The quantum counterparts of thesepotentials are afflicted by irdering ambiguities but we show that there existsan ordering prescription which makes them hermitean. For space/spacenoncommutativity it turns out that Majorana fermions may be pictured as rodsoriented perpendicularly to the direction of motion showing a lack oflocalituy, while bosons remain insensitive to the effects of noncommutativity.For time/space noncommutativity bosopns and fermions can be regarded as rodsoriented along the direction of motion. For both cases of noncommutativity thescattering state described scattered waves, with at least one wave havingnegative time delay signalizing the underlying nonlocality. The superfieldformulation of the model is used to compute the corresponding effective actionin the one- and two-loop approximations. In the case of time/spacenoncommutativity, unitarity is violated in the relativistic regime. However,this does not preclude the existence of the unitary low energy limit.
