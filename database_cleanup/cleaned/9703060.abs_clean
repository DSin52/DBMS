General considerations on the unification of A-type and B-typesupersymmetries in the context of interacting p-branes strongly suggest thatthe signature of spacetime includes two timelike dimensions. This leads to thepuzzle of how ordinary physics with a single timelike dimension emerges. Inthis letter we suggest that the two timelike dimensions could be real, andbelong to two physical sectors of a single theory each containing its owntimelike dimension. Effectively there is a single time evolution parameter. Wesubstantiate this idea by constructing certain actions for interacting p-braneswith signature (n,2) that have gauge symmetries and constraints appropriate fora physical interpretation with no ghosts. In combination with related ideas andgeneral constraints in S-theory, we are led to a cosmological scenario inwhich, after a phase transition, the extra timelike dimension becomes part ofthe compactified universe residing inside microscopic matter. The internalspace, whose geometry is expected to determine the flavor quantum numbers oflow energy matter, thus acquires a Minkowski signature. The formalism meshesnaturally with a new supersymmetry in the context of field theory that wesuggested in an earlier paper. The structure of this supersymmetry gives riseto a new Kaluza-Klein type mechanism for determining the quantum numbers of lowenergy families, thus suggesting that the extra timelike dimension would betaken into account in understanding the Standard Model of particle physics.
