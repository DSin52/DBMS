A new approach for investigating the classical dynamics of the relativisticstring model with rigidity is proposed. It is based on the embedding of thestring world surface into the space of a constant curvature. It is shown thatthe rigid string in flat space-time is described by the Euler-Lagrange equationfor the Willmore functional in a space-time of the constant curvature K=-g/(2a), where g and a are constants in front of the Nambu-Goto term and thecurvature term in the rigid string action respectively. For simplicity theEuclidean version of the rigid string in the three-dimensional space-time isconsidered. The Willmore functional (the action for the "Willmore string") isobtained by dropping the Nambu-Goto term in the Polyakov-Kleinert action forthe rigid string. Such "reduction" of the rigid string model would be useful,for example, by applying some results about the Numbu-Goto string dynamics inthe de Sitter universe to the rigid string model in the Minkowski space-time.It allows also to use numerous mathematical results about the Willmore surfacesin the context of the physical problem.
