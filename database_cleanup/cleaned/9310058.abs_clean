Title: Massless integrable quantum field theories and massless scattering in

1+1 dimensionsAuthors: P. Fendley and H. Saleur

Comments: 30 pages + 2 figs included

These lecture notes provide an elementary introduction to the study ofmassless integrable quantum field theory in 1+1 dimensions using ``masslessscattering''. Some previously unpublished results are also presented, includinga non-perturbative study of Virasoro conserved quantities.
