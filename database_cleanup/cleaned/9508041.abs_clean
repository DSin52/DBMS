The lattice definition of the two-dimensional topological quantum fieldtheory [Fukuma, {\em et al}, Commun.~Math.~Phys.\ {\bf 161}, 157 (1994)] isgeneralized to arbitrary (not necessarily orientable) compact surfaces. It isshown that there is a one-to-one correspondence between real associative$*$-algebras and the topological state sum invariants defined on such surfaces.The partition and $n$-point functions on all two-dimensional surfaces(connected sums of the Klein bottle or projective plane and $g$-tori) aredefined and computed for arbitrary $*$-algebras in general, and for the thegroup ring $A=\R[G]$ of discrete groups $G$, in particular.
