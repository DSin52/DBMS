We use local mirror symmetry in type IIA string compactifications onCalabi-Yau n+1 folds $X_{n+1}$ to construct vector bundles on (possiblysingular) elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau n-folds Z_n. The interpretation ofthese data as valid classical solutions of the heterotic string compactified onZ_n proves F-theory/heterotic duality at the classical level. Toric geometry isused to establish a systematic dictionary that assigns to each given toricn+1-fold $X_{n+1}$ a toric n fold Z_n together with a specific family of sheafson it. This allows for a systematic construction of phenomenologicallyinteresting d=4 N=1 heterotic vacua, e.g. on deformations of the tangentbundle, with grand unified and SU(3)\times SU(2) gauge groups. As anotherapplication we find non-perturbative gauge enhancements of the heterotic stringon singular Calabi-Yau manifolds and new non-perturbative dualities relatingheterotic compactifications on different manifolds.
