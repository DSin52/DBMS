We first present a general method for extracting collective variables out ofnon-relativistic fermions by extending the gauge theory of collectivecoordinates to fermionic systems. We then apply the method to a system ofnon-interacting flavored fermions confined in a one-dimensionalflavor-independent potential. In the limit of a large number of particles weobtain a Lagrangian with the Wess-Zumino-Witten term, which is the well-knownLagrangian describing the non-Abelian bosonization of chiral fermions on acircle. The result is universal and does not depend on the details of theconfining potential.
