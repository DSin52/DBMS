The problem of the passage of the neutral massless particle with anomalousmagnetic moment through the external electromagnetic field is considered bothin pseudoclassical and quantum mechanics. The quantum description uses thehamiltonian in the Foldy--Wouthuysen representation, obtained from thepseudoclassical hamiltonian of the massive charged particle with anomalousmagnetic moment in interaction with the external electromagnetic field usingWeyl quantization scheme.
