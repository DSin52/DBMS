Title: Spin and Isospin in Quaternion Quantum Mechanics

Comments: 7 pages revtex

The algebraic consistency of spin and isospin at the level of an unbrokenSU(2) gauge theory suggests the existence of an additional angular momentumbesides the spin and isospin and also produces a full quaternionic spinoroperator. The latter corresponds to a vector boson in space-time, interpretedas a SU(2) gauge field. The existence of quaternionic spinor fields implies ina quaternionic Hilbert space and its necessary mathematical analysis. It isshown how to obtain a unique representation of a quaternion function by aconvergent positive power series.
