Title: The Moduli Space of Noncommutative Vortices

Authors: David Tong

Comments: Invited contribution to special issue of J.Math.Phys. on

revision of history in introductionThe abelian Higgs model on the noncommutative plane admits both BPS vorticesand non-BPS fluxons. After reviewing the properties of these solitons, wediscuss several new aspects of the former. We solve the Bogomoln'yi equationsperturbatively, to all orders in the inverse noncommutivity parameter, and showthat the metric on the moduli space of k vortices reduces to the computation ofthe trace of a k-dimensional matrix. In the limit of large noncommutivity, wepresent an explicit expression for this metric.
