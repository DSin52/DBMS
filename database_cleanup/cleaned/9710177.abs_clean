Title: The Ring Division Self Duality

Comments: LaTeX file. various typos, equations and calculations errors fixed. A

new part is added where the incompatibility between the self duality and theYang-Mills equation of motion is mentioned. The conclusion is modifiedWe present a simple construction of the instantonic type equation overoctonions where its similarities and differences with the quaternionic case arevery clear. We use the unified language of Clifford Algebra. We argue that ourapproach is the pure algebraic formulation of the geometric based soft Liealgebra. The topological criteria for the stability of our solution is givenexplicitly to establish its solitonic property. Many beautiful features of theparallelizable ring division spheres and Absolute Parallelism (AP) reveal theirpresence in our formulation.
