Using the formalism of noncommutative geometric gauge theory based on thesuperconnection concept, we construct a new type of vector gauge theorypossessing a shift-like symmetry and the usual gauge symmetry. The newshift-like symmetry is due to the matrix derivative of the noncommutativegeometric gauge theory, and this gives rise to a mass term for the vector fieldwithout introducing the Higgs field. This construction becomes possible byusing a constant one form even matrix for the matrix derivative, for which onlyconstant zero form odd matrices have been used so far. The fermionic action inthis formalism is also constructed and discussed.
