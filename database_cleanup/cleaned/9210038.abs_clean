Using the generalized hamiltonian method of Batalin, Fradkin and Vilkovisky,we investigate the algebraic structure of anomalies in the Polyakov stringtheory that appear as the Schwinger terms in super-commutation relationsbetween BRST charge and total hamiltonian. We obtain the most general form ofthe anomalies in the extended phase space, without any reference to a twodimensional metric. This pregeometri- cal result, refered to as the genelarizedVirasoro anomaly, independent of the gauge and the regularization under a minorassumption, is a non-perturbative result, and valid for any space-timedimension. In a configuration space, in which the two dimensional metric can beidentified, we can geometrize the result without assuming the weakgravitational field, showing that the most general anomaly exactly exhibits theWeyl anomaly.
