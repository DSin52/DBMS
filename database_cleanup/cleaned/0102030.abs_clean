simple way, include N supersymmetric generators(see \cite{Nahm}) (2.) contain(3.) permit nontrivial gauge symmetry groups. The smallest groups satisfyngabove conditions are the OSp(N|4) groups, which contain Sp(4)xSO(N) ($Sp(4)\simSO(3,2)$) or OSp(1|4)xSO(N-1). Because of this, it is possible to generateo $OSp(N|4)\to ^SP(3,1|N)$ where P(3,1) is the Poincar\'e group and G is agauge group, say SO(N) or SO(N-1). This group contraction mechanism and itsconsequences upon different groups representations including SO(3,2) orSO(4,1), is clarified and extended to OSp(N|4) representations (see\cite{Nicolai}), contracted to its N-extensi\'on SuperPoincar\'e group $\^SP(3,1|N)$.
