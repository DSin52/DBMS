We present a topological Lagrangian field theory that is geometricallysimilar to the Yang-Mills(-Higgs) Lagrangian, and study the Bogomol'nyisolitons contained within this theory. The topological field theory may providean example of a dual field theory to Yang-Mills(-Higgs). The existence of adual field theory to Yang-Mills(-Higgs) was conjectured by Montonen and Olive.
