We consider duality between type 0B string theory on $AdS_5\times S^5$ andthe planar CFT on $N$ electric D3-branes coincident with $N$ magneticD3-branes. It has been argued that this theory is stable up to a critical valueof the `t Hooft coupling but is unstable beyond that point. We suggest thatfrom the gauge theory point of view the development of instability isassociated with singularity in the dimension of the operator corresponding tothe tachyon field via the AdS/CFT map. Such singularities are common in large$N$ theories because summation over planar graphs typically has a finite radiusof convergence. Hence we expect transitions between stability and instabilityfor string theories in AdS backgrounds that are dual to certain large $N$ gaugestabilized by reducing the radius below a critical value of order the stringscale.
