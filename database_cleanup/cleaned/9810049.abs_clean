We consider the most general loop integral that appears in non-relativisticeffective field theories with no light particles. The divergences of thisintegral are in correspondence with simple poles in the space of complexspace-time dimensions. Integrals related to the original integral bysubtraction of one or more poles in dimensions other than D=4 lead tononminimal subtraction schemes. Subtraction of all poles in correspondence withultraviolet divergences of the loop integral leads naturally to aregularization scheme which is precisely equivalent to cutoff regularization.We therefore recover cutoff regularization from dimensional regularization witha nonminimal subtraction scheme. We then discuss the power-counting fornon-relativistic effective field theories which arises in these alternativeschemes.
