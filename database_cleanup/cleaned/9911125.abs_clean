It has been remarked in several previous works that the combination of centervortices and nexuses (a nexus is a monopole-like soliton whose world linemediates certain allowed changes of field strengths on vortex surfaces) carrytopological charge quantized in units of 1/N for gauge group SU(N). Thesefractional charges arise from the interpretation of the standard topologicalcharge integral as a sum of (integral) intersection numbers weighted by certain(fractional) traces. We show that without nexuses the sum of intersectionnumbers gives vanishing topological charge (since vortex surfaces are closedand compact). With nexuses living as world lines on vortices, the contributionsto the total intersection number are weighted by different trace factors, andyield a picture of the total topological charge as a linking of a closed nexusworld line with a vortex surface; this linking gives rise to a non-vanishingbut integral topological charge. This reflects the standard 2\pi periodicity ofthe theta angle. We argue that the Witten-Veneziano relation, naively violating2\pi periodicity, scales properly with N at large N without requiring 2\pi Nperiodicity. This reflects the underlying composition of localized fractionaltopological charge, which are in general widely separated. Some simple modelsare given of this behavior. Nexuses lead to non-standard vortex surfaces forall SU(N) and to surfaces which are not manifolds for N>2. We generalizepreviously-introduced nexuses to all SU(N) in terms of a set of fundamentalnexuses, which can be distorted into a configuration resembling the 'tHooft-Polyakov monopole with no strings. The existence of localized butwidely-separated fractional topological charges, adding to integers only onlong distance scales, has implications for chiral symmetry breakdown.
