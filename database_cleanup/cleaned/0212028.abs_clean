Title: Photon decay in a CPT-violating extension of quantum electrodynamics

Comments: LaTeX with elsart.cls, 16 pages. v3

We consider the process of photon decay in quantum electrodynamics with aCPT-violating Chern-Simons-like term added to the action. For a simplifiedmodel with only the quadratic Maxwell and Chern-Simons-like terms and thequartic Euler-Heisenberg term, we obtain a nonvanishing probability for thedecay of a particular photon state into three others.
