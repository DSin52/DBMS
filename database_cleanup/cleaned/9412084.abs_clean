We show that any of the new knot invariants obtained from Chern-Simons theorybased on an arbitrary non-abelian gauge group do not distinguish isotopicallyinequivalent mutant knots and links. In an attempt to distinguish these knotsand links, we study Murakami (symmetrized version) $r$-strand composite braids.Salient features of the theory of such composite braids are presented.Representations of generators for these braids are obtained by exploitingproperties of Hilbert spaces associated with the correlators of Wess-Zuminoconformal field theories. The $r$-composite invariants for the knots are givenby the sum of elementary Chern-Simons invariants associated with theirreducible representations in the product of $r$ representations (allowed bythe fusion rules of the corresponding Wess-Zumino conformal field theory)placed on the $r$ individual strands of the composite braid. On the other hand,composite invariants for links are given by a weighted sum of elementarymulticoloured Chern-Simons invariants. Some mutant links can be distinguishedthrough the composite invariants, but mutant knots do not share this property.The results, though developed in detail within the framework of $SU(2)$Chern-Simons theory are valid for any other non-abelian gauge group.
