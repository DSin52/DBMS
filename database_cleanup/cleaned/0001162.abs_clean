QCD_2 with fundamental quarks on a cylinder is solved to leading order in the1/N expansion, including the zero mode gluons. As a result of thenon-perturbative dynamics of these gauge degrees of freedom, the compactspace-time direction gets effectively decompactified. In a thermodynamicinterpretation, this implies that there is no pressure of order N and that thechiral condensate of order N is temperature independent. These findings areconsistent with confinement of quarks, rule out both chiral and deconfiningphase transitions in the finite temperature 't Hooft model, and help to resolvesome controversial issues in the literature
