The duality symmetries of various chiral boson actions are investigated usingD=2 and D=6 space-time dimensions as examples. These actions involve theSiegel, Floreanini-Jackiw, Srivastava and Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin formulations. Wediscover that the Siegel, Floreanini-Jackiw and Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin actionshave self-duality with respect to a common anti-dualization of chiral bosonfields in D=2 and D=6 dimensions, respectively, while the Srivastava action isself-dual with respect to a generalized dualization of chiral boson fields.Moreover, the action of the Floreanini-Jackiw chiral bosons interacting withgauge fields in D=2 dimensions also has self-duality but with respect to ageneralized anti-dualization of chiral boson fields.
