Quantum particles confined to surfaces in higher dimensional spaces are actedupon by forces that exist only as a result of the surface geometry and thequantum mechanical nature of the system. The dynamics are particularly richwhen confinement is implemented by forces that act normal to the surface. Wereview this confining potential formalism applied to the confinement of aparticle to an arbitrary manifold embedded in a higher dimensional Euclideanspace. We devote special attention to the geometrically induced gauge potentialthat appears in the effective Hamiltonian for motion on the surface. Weemphasize that the gauge potential is only present when the space of statesdescribing the degrees of freedom normal to the surface is degenerate. We alsodistinguish between the effects of the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry on theeffective Hamiltonian and provide simple expressions for the induced scalarpotential. We discuss examples including the case of a 3-dimensional manifoldembedded in a 5-dimensional Euclidean space.
