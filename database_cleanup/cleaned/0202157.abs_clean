We find a Penrose limit of AdS_5 x T^{1,1} which gives the pp-wave geometryidentical to the one that appears in the Penrose limit of AdS_5 x S^5. Thisleads us to conjecture that there is a subsector of the corresponding N=1 gaugetheory which has enhanced N=4 supersymmetry. We identify operators in the N=1gauge theory with stringy excitations in the pp-wave geometry and discuss howthe gauge theory operators fall into N=4 supersymmetry multiplets. We findsimilar enhancement of symmetry in some other models, but there are alsoexamples in which there is no supersymmetry enhancement in the Penrose limit.
