We establish a theorem about non-trivial 11D supergravity fluctuations thatare conformally related to flat superspace geometry. Under the assumption thata theory of conformal 11D supergravity exists, similar in form to that ofpreviously constructed theories in lower dimensions, this theorem demands theappearance of non-vanishing dimension 1/2 torsion tensors in order toaccommodate a non-trivial 11D conformal compensator and thus M-theorycorrections that break super-conformal symmetry. At the complete non-linearlevel, a presentation of a conventional minimal superspace realization of Weylsymmetry in eleven dimensional superspace is also described. All of our resultstaken together imply that there exists some realization of conformal symmetryrelevant for the M-theory effective action. We thus led to conjecture this isalso true for the full and complete M-theory.
