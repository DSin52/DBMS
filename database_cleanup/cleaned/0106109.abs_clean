Title: Quantum Gravity In De Sitter Space

Authors: Edward Witten

Comments: 19pp

We discuss some general properties of quantum gravity in De Sitter space. Ithas been argued that the Hilbert space is of finite dimension. This suggests amacroscopic argument that General Relativity cannot be quantized -- unless itis embedded in a more precise theory that determines the value of thecosmological constant. We give a definition of the quantum Hilbert space usingthe asymptotic behavior in the past and future, without requiring detailedmicroscopic knowledge. We discuss the difficulties in defining any preciselycalculable or measurable observables in an asymptotically de Sitter spacetime,and explore some meta-observables that appear to make mathematical sense butcannot be measured by an observer who lives in the spacetime. This article isan expanded version of a lecture at Strings 2001 in Mumbai.
