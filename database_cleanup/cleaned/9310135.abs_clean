The gauging of isometries in general sigma-models which include fermionicterms which represent the interaction of strings with background Yang-Millsfields is considered. Gauging is possible only if certain obstructions areabsent. The quantum gauge anomaly is discussed, and the (1,0) supersymmetricgeneralisation of the gauged action given.
