The restricted solid-on-solid models in the anti-ferromagnetic regime isstudied in the framework of quantum affine algebras. Following the linedeveloped recently for vertex models, a representation theoretical picture ispresented for the structure of the space of states. The local operators and thecreation/annihilation operators of quasi-particles are defined using vertexoperators, and their commutation relations are calculated.
