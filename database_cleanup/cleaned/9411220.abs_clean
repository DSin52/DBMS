presented at the Mt. Sorak Summer School, S. Korea, June 27- July 2, 1994Summation over hard thermal loops, by themselves and as insertions in higherorder Feynman diagrams, is important in thermal perturbation theory for QuantumChromodynamics, so that all contributions of a given order in the couplingconstant can be consistently taken into account. I review some of the basicproperties of hard thermal loops and how the generating functional for them isrelated to the eikonal for a Chern-Simons gauge theory, and using an auxiliaryfield, to the gauged Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten action. The Hamiltoniananalysis of the effective action and a discussion of plasma waves are given. Itis also pointed out that a possible expression for the magnetic mass term canbe written in a closely related way.
