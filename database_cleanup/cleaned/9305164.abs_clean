We give the general solution of the stationary problem of 2+1 dimensionalgravity in presence of extended sources, also endowed with angular momentum. Wesolve explicitly the compact support property of the energy momentum tensor andwe apply the results to the study of closed time-like curves. In the case ofrotational symmetry we prove that the weak energy condition combined with theabsence of closed time-like curves at space infinity prevents the existence ofclosed time-like curves everywhere in an open universe (conical space atinfinity).
