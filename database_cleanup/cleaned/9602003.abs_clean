We construct the solution $\phi(t,{\bf x})$ of the quantum wave equationbe expanded over Wick polynomials of the free $in$-field, and whererespect to the free $in$-field. The constructed solution is correctly definedas a bilinear form on $D_{\theta}\times D_{\theta}$, where $D_{\theta}$ is adense linear subspace in the Fock space of the free $in$-field. On$D_{\theta}\times D_{\theta}$ the diagonal Wick symbol of this bilinear formsatisfies the nonlinear classical wave equation.
