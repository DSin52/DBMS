Title: Cosmic String Helicity

Quantization of Baryon NumberAuthors: Tsippy R. Mendelson

Comments: 27 pages, 10 figures

We apply the concept of helicity from classical hydrodynamics to elucidatetwo problematical issues in cosmic string physics. Helicity, the space integralof the scalar product of a velocity-like field with its vorticity field (curl),can be defined for a complex scalar field in analogy with fluids. We dwell onthe topological interpretation of helicity as related to the linking of fieldlines of the vorticity field. Earlier works failed to fully implement thisinterpretation for cosmic strings by missing a term connected with the linkingof these lines inside the strings. As a result paradoxical conclusions werebaryon number is not quantized in integers in the presence of local cosmicstrings in gauge theory. We show that both paradoxes are removed when internalcontributions to helicity are properly taken into account. In particular,quantization of baryon number can be understood within a special case of theGlashow-Weinberg-Salam model if cosmic strings are the unique mechanism forbaryosynthesis. In addition, we find a new constraint on the permitted linkagesof cosmic strings in a string tangle.
