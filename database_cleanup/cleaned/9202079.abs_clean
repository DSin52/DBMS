Quantum theory of the free Maxwell field in Minkowski space is constructedusing a representation in which the self dual connection is diagonal. Quantumstates are now holomorphic functionals of self dual connections and adecomposition of fields into positive and negative frequency parts isunnecessary. The construction requires the introduction of new mathematicaltechniques involving ``holomorphic distributions''. The method extends also tolinear gravitons in Minkowski space. The fact that one can recover the entireFock space --with particles of both helicities-- from self dual connectionsalone provides independent support for a non-perturbative, canonicalquantization program for full general relativity based on self dual variables.
