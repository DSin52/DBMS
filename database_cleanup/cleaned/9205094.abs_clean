A distinctive feature of string unification is the possibility of unificationby a non-simply-laced group. This occurs most naturally in four dimensionaltype~II string models where the gauge symmetry is realized by Kac-Moodyalgebras at different levels. We investigate the running coupling constants andthe one-loop thresholds for such general models. As a specific case, we examinea $\rm SU(3)\times U(1)\times U(1)$ model and find that the thresholdcorrections lead to a small $6\%$ increase in the unification scale.
