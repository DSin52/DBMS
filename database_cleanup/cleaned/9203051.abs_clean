We propose a new formulation of the $D=10$ Brink-Schwarz superparticle whichis manifestly invariant under both the target-space super-Poincar\'e group andthe world-line local $N=8$ superconformal group. This twistor-like constructionnaturally involves the sphere $S^8$ as a coset space of the $D=10$ Lorentzgroup. The action contains only a finite set of auxiliary fields, but theyappear in unusual trilinear combinations. The origin of the on-shell $D=10$fermionic $\kappa$ symmetry of the standard Brink-Schwarz formulation isexplained. The coupling to a $D=10$ super-Maxwell background requires a newmechanism, in which the electric charge appears only on shell as an integrationconstant.
