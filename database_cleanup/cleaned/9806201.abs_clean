Title: Feynman Graphs from D-Particle Dynamics

Authors: Amir H. Fatollahi

Comments: It is added that graphs and their associated amplitudes can be

corresponded to a field theory only in the light-cone frame. Also theapplication to define M-theory by an energetic expansion is discussed. LaTeXfile, 3 figures, 7 pagesIt is argued that quantum propagation of D-particles in the limit \alpha'-> 0can represent the "joining-splitting" processes of Feynman graphs of a certainfield theory in the light-cone frame. So basically it provides the possibilityto define a field theory by its Feynman graphs. The application of thisobservation to define M-theory by an energetic expansion approach is discussed.
