In this paper we study arbitrary $W$ algebras related to embeddings of $sl_2$in a Lie algebra $g$. We give a simple formula for all $W$ transformations,which will enable us to construct the covariant action for general $W$ gravity.It turns out that this covariant action is nothing but a Fourier transform ofthe WZW action. The same general formula provides a geometrical interpretationtransformations. This is used to argue that the moduli space relevant to $W$gravity is part of the moduli space of $G$-bundles over a Riemann surface.
