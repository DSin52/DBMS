We investigate the correspondence between existence/stability of BPS statesin type II string theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold and BPSsolutions of four dimensional N=2 supergravity. Some paradoxes emerge, and wepropose a resolution by considering composite configurations. This in turngives a smooth effective field theory description of decay at marginalstability. We also discuss the connection with 3-pronged strings, the Joycetransition of special Lagrangian submanifolds, and Pi-stability.
