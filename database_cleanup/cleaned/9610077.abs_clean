The supersymmetric p-branes of Type II string theory can be interpreted aftercompactification as extremal black holes with zero entropy and infinitetemperature. We show how the p-branes avoid this apparent, catastrophicinstability by developing an infinite mass gap. Equivalently, these black holesprevent absorption of impinging particles. In contrast, configurations with 2,3, and 4 intersecting branes and their nonextremal extensions, behaveincreasingly like conventional black holes. These results extend and clarifyearlier work by Holzhey and Wilczek in the context of four dimensional dilatongravity.
