We generalize the integrable Heisenberg ferromagnet model according to eachHermitian symmetric spaces and address various new aspects of the generalizedmodel. Using the first order formalism of generalized spins which are definedon the coadjoint orbits of arbitrary groups, we construct a Lagrangian of thegeneralized model from which we obtain the Hamiltonian structure explicitly inthe case of $CP(N-1)$ orbit. The gauge equivalence between the generalizedHeisenberg ferromagnet and the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger models is given. Usingthe equivalence, we find infinitely many conserved integrals of both models.
