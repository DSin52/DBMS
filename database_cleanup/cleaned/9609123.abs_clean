We study the properties of color-singlet Reggeon compound states inmulticolor high-energy QCD in four dimensions. Their spectrum is governed bycompletely integrable (1+1)-dimensional effective QCD Hamiltonian whosediagonalization within the Bethe Ansatz leads to the Baxter equation for theHeisenberg spin magnet. We show that nonlinear WKB solution of the Baxterequation gives rise to the same integrable structures as appeared in theSeiberg-Witten solution for $N=2$ SUSY QCD and in the finite-gap solutions ofthe soliton equations. We explain the origin of hyperelliptic Riemann surfacesout of QCD in the Regge limit and discuss the meaning of the Whitham dynamicson the moduli space of quantum numbers of the Reggeon compound states, QCDPomerons and Odderons.
