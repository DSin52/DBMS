Title: A correspondence between standard model fermions and degrees of freedom

of polycrystalline materialsAuthors: I. Schmelzer

We identify natural degrees of freedom of polycrystalline materials -- affinetransformations of grains -- with those of a three-dimensional lattice theoryfor $(T\otimes\Omega)(\mathbb{R}^3)$. We define a lattice Dirac operator onthis space and identify its continuous limit with the free field limit of thewhole fermionic sector of the standard model. Fermion doubling is used here asa tool to obtain the necessary number of steps of freedom. The correspondenceextends to important structural properties (families, colors, flavor pairs,electromagnetic charge). We find a lattice version of chiral symmetry similarto the Ginsparg-Wilson approach.This correspondence suggests to propose a ``polycrystalline ether''. Combinedwith GLET, a general Lorentz ether theory of gravity with GR limit, thisbecomes a concept for a theory of everything. The extension to gauge fields isthe major open problem and requires new concepts.
