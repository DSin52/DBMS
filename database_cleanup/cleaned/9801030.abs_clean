We consider hidden sector supersymmetry breakdown in the strongly coupledheterotic $E_8\times E_8$ theory of Ho\v{r}ava and Witten. Using effectivefield theory methods in four dimensions, we can show that gravitationalinteractions induce soft breaking terms in the observable sector that are oforder of the gravitiono mass. We apply these methods to the mechanism ofgaugino condensation at the hidden wall. Although the situation is very similarto the weakly coupled case, there is a decisive difference concerning theobservable sector gaugino mass; with desirable phenomenological as well ascosmological consequences.
