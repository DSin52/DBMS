This is a set of lectures on the gauge/string duality and non-criticalstrings, with a particular emphasis on the discretized, or matrix model,approach. After a general discussion of various points of view, I describe therecent generalization to four dimensional non-critical (or five dimensionalcritical) string theories of the matrix model approach. This yields a fullynon-perturbative and explicit definition of string theories with eight (ormore) supercharges that are related to four dimensional CFTs and their relevantdeformations. The space-time as well as world-sheet dimensions of thesupersymmetry preserving world-sheet couplings are obtained. Exact formulas forthe central charge of the space-time supersymmetry algebra as a function ofthese couplings are calculated. They include infinite series of stringperturbative contributions as well as all the non-perturbative effects. Animportant insight on the gauge theory side is that instantons yield anon-trivial 1/N expansion at strong coupling, and generate open stringcontributions, in addition to the familiar closed strings from Feynmandiagrams. We indicate various open problems and future directions of research.
