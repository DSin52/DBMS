A framework for background independent open-string field theory is proposed.The approach involves using the BV formalism -- in a way suggested by recentdevelopments in closed-string field theory -- to implicitly define a gaugeinvariant Lagrangian in a hypothetical ``space of all open-string world-sheettheories.'' It is built into the formalism that classical solutions of thestring field theory are BRST invariant open-string world-sheet theories andthat, when expanding around a classical solution, the infinitesimal gaugetransformations are generated by the world-sheet BRST operator.
