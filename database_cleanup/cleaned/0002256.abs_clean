When two-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space (AdS_2) is endowed with anon-constant dilaton the origin of the central charge in the Virasoro algebragenerating the asymptotic symmetries of AdS_2 can be traced back to thebreaking of the SL(2,R) isometry group of AdS_2. We use this fact to clarifysome controversial results appeared in the literature about the value of thecentral charge in these models.
