The moduli space describing the low-energy dynamics of BPS multi-monopolesfor several charge configurations is presented. We first prove the conjecturedform of the moduli space of $n-1$ distinct monopoles in a spontaneously brokenSU(n) gauge theory. We further propose the solution where one of the chargecomponents has two units, hence asymptotically corresponds to embeddings of twomonopoles of one charge type and the rest different. The latter hyperk\"ahlermetrics possess features of the two-monopole Atiyah-Hitchin metric. We alsoconjecture classes of solutions to multi-monopole moduli spaces with arbitrarycharge and no more than two units in each component, which models the gluingtogether of Atiyah-Hitchin metrics. Our approach here uses the generalizedLegendre transform technique to find the new hyperk\"ahler manifolds andrederive previously conjectured ones.
