We provide a simple lagrangian interpretation of the meaning of the $b_0^-$semi-relative condition in closed string theory. Namely, we show how thesemi-relative condition is equivalent to the requirement that physicaloperators be cohomology classes of the BRS operators acting on the space oflocal fields {\it covariant} under world-sheet reparametrizations. Statestrivial in the absolute BRS cohomology but not in the semi-relative one areexplicitly seen to correspond to BRS variations of operators which are notglobally defined world-sheet tensors. We derive the covariant expressions forthe observables of topological gravity. We use them to prove a formula thatequates the expectation value of the gravitational descendant of ghost number 4to the integral over the moduli space of the Weil-Peterson K\"ahler form.
