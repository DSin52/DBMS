68-86We begin a study of possibilities of describing hadrons in terms of monolocalfields which transform as proper Lorentz group representations decomposableinto an infinite direct sum of finite-dimensional irreducible representations.The additional requirement that the free-field Lagrangians be invariant underthe secondary symmetry transformations generated by the polar or the axialfour-vector representation of the orthochronous Lorentz group provides aneffective mechanism for selecting the class representations considered andeliminating an infinite number of arbitrary constants allowed by therelativistic invariance of the Lagrangians.
