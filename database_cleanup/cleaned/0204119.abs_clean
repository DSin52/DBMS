We argue that in the presence of instanton-like singularities, the existenceof cosmological horizons can become frame-dependent, ie. a horizon whichappears in Einstein frame may not appear in string frame. We speculate on therelation between instanton-like singularities and the formulation of quantumgravity in de Sitter space.
