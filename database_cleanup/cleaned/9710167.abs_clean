The S-matrix in the static limit of a dispersion relation is a matrix of afinite order N of meromorphic functions of energy $\omega$ in the plane withcuts $(-\infty,-1],[+1,+\infty)$. In the elastic case it reduces to N functions$S_{i}(\omega)$ connected by the crossing symmetry matrix A. The scattering ofa neutral pseodoscalar meson with an arbitrary angular momentum l at a sourcewith spin 1/2 is considered (N=2). The Regge trajectories of this model areexplicitly found.
