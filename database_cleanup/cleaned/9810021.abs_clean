It has recently been shown that the Matrix model and supergravity give thesame predictions for three graviton scattering. This contradicts an earlierclaim in the literature (hep-th/9710174). We explain the error in this earlierwork, and go on to show that certain terms in the $n$-graviton scatteringamplitude involving $v^{2n}$ are given correctly by the Matrix model. TheMatrix model also generates certain $v^6$ terms in four graviton scattering atthree loops, which do not seem to have any counterparts in supergravity. Theconnection of these results with nonrenormalization theorems is discussed.
