Recently, background independent open-string field theory has been formallydefined in the space of all two-dimensional world-sheet theories. In thispaper, to make the construction more concrete, I compute the action for anoff-shell tachyon field of a certain simple type. From the computation itemerges that, although the string field action does not coincide with theworld-sheet (matter) partition function in general, these functions do coincideon shell. This can be demonstrated in general, as long as matter and ghosts aredecoupled.
