We consider Shiraishi's metrics on the moduli space of extreme black holes.We interpret the simplification in the pattern of N-body interactions that heobserved in terms of the recent picture of black holes in four and fivedimensions as composites, made up of intersecting branes. We then show that thegeometry of the moduli space of a class of black holes in five and ninedimensions is hyper-K\"ahler with torsion, and octonionic-K\"ahler withtorsion, respectively. For this, we examine the geometry of point particlemodels with extended world-line supersymmetry and show that both of the abovegeometries arise naturally in this context. In addition, we construct a largeclass of hyper-K\"ahler with torsion and octonionic-K\"ahler with torsiongeometries in various dimensions. We also present a brane interpretation of ourresults.
