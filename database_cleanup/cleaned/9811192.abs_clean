We compute the leading behaviour of the quark anti-quark potential from ageneralized Nambu-Goto action associated with a curved space-time having an"extra dimension". The extra dimension can be the radial coordinate in theAdS/CFT correspondence, the Liouville field in Polyakov's approach, or aninternal dimension in MQCD. In particular, we derive the condition forconfinement, and in the case it occurs we find the string tension and thecorrection to the linear potential.
