This paper deals with a dynamical system that generalizes the Kepler-Coulombsystem and the Hartmann system. It is shown that the Schr\"odinger equation forthis generalized Kepler-Coulomb system can be separated in prolate spheroidalcoordinates. The coefficients of the interbasis expansions between three bases(spherical, parabolic and spheroidal) are studied in detail. It is found thatthe coefficients for the expansion of the parabolic basis in terms of thespherical basis, and vice-versa, can be expressed through the Clebsch-Gordancoefficients for the group SU(2) analytically continued to real values of theirarguments. The coefficients for the expansions of the spheroidal basis in termsof the spherical and parabolic bases are proved to satisfy three-term recursionrelations.
