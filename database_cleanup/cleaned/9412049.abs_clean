Title: Mass Generation in Three Dimensions

Comments: 28 pages, LaTeX, 5 postscript figures available upon request (the

previous LaTex file turned out to be incomplete)I consider the dilute monopole gas expansion of the three dimensionalYang-Mills-Higgs system in the symmetry broken phase. The functionaldeterminants which occur in such an expansion are computed in the heat kernelapproximation for an arbitrary $SU(N)$ gauge group. Explicit expressions forthe gauge boson mass in the unbroken gauge sector and the string tension areobtained for the $SU(2)$ gauge model and are evaluated numerically. The resultsshow a strong dependence on the ratio $m_{\rm Higgs}/m_W$.
