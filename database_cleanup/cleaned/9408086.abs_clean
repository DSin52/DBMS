We prove $q$-series identities between bosonic and fermionic representationsof certain Virasoro characters.  These identities include some of theconjectures made by the Stony Brook group as special cases. Our method is adirect application of Andrews' extensions of Bailey's lemma to recentlyobtained polynomial identities.
