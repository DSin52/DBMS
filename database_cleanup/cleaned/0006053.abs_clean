We develop the WKB expansion to relate Quantum Field Theory variables withthose describing macroscopical matter. We find that, up to the first quantumcorrection, free scalar fields correspond to perfect fluids with pressure. Wealso find the law of motion for the associated particles which takes intoaccount deviations from the classical trajectories, showing that they do notfollow unaccelerated straight line trajectories.
