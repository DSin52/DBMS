Particle scattering and radiation by a magnetically charged, dilatonic blackhole is investigated near the extremal limit at which the mass is a constanttimes the charge. Near this limit a neighborhood of the horizon of the blackhole is closely approximated by a trivial product of a two-dimensional blackhole with a sphere. This is shown to imply that the scattering oflong-wavelength particles can be described by a (previously analyzed)two-dimensional effective field theory, and is related to theformation/evaporation of two-dimensional black holes. The scattering proceedsvia particle capture followed by Hawking re-emission, and naively appears toviolate unitarity. However this conclusion can be altered when the effects ofbackreaction are included. Particle-hole scattering is discussed in the lightof a recent analysis of the two-dimensional backreaction problem. It is arguedthat the quantum mechanical possibility of scattering off of extremal blackholes implies the potential existence of additional quantum numbers - referredto as ``quantum whiskers'' - characterizing the black hole.
