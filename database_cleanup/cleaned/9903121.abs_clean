We discuss the BRST cohomology and exhibit a connection between the Hodgedecomposition theorem and the topological properties of a two dimensional freenon-Abelian gauge theory having no interaction with matter fields. Thetopological nature of this theory is encoded in the vanishing of the Laplacianoperator when equations of motion are exploited. We obtain two sets oftopological invariants with respect to BRST and co-BRST charges on the twodimensional manifold and show that the Lagrangian density of the theory can beexpressed as the sum of terms that are BRST- and co-BRST invariants.
