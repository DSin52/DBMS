Authors: B. Stefanski Jr

Comments: 4 pages, LaTeX. To appear in the gong show section of the Proceedings

of the Cargese `99 ASI "Progress in String Theory and M-Theory"In this short note we review the construction and role of Wess-Zuminocouplings of Dirichlet branes and Orientifold planes, and show how thesecombine to give the Green-Schwarz anomaly cancelling terms.
