Authors: Eric D'Hoker, Daniel Z. Freedman

Comments: Paragraph with (10.39) revised, refs. added, typos fixed; 145 pages;

14 figures; email to D.Z Freedman <dzf@math.mit.edu>In these lecture notes we first assemble the basic ingredients ofsupersymmetric gauge theories (particularly N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory),supergravity, and superstring theory. Brane solutions are surveyed. Thegeometry and symmetries of anti-de Sitter space are discussed. The AdS/CFTcorrespondence of Maldacena and its application to correlation functions in thethe conformal phase of N=4 SYM are explained in considerable detail. Apedagogical treatment of holographic RG flows is given including a review ofthe conformal anomaly in four-dimensional quantum field theory and itscalculation from five-dimensional gravity. Problem sets and exercises await thereader.
