The quantum dynamics of a simplest dissipative system, a particle moving in aconstant external field , is exactly studied by taking into account itsinteraction with a bath of Ohmic spectral density. We apply the main idea andmethods developed in our recent work [1] to quantum dissipative system withconstant external field. Quantizing the dissipative system we obtain the simpleand exact solutions for the coordinate operator of the system in Heisenbergpicture and the wave function of the composite system of system and bath inSchroedinger picture. An effective Hamiltonian for the dissipative system isexplicitly derived from these solutions with Heisenberg picture method andthereby the meaning of the wavefunction governed by it is clarified byanalyzing the effect of the Brownian motion. Especially, the general effectiveHamiltonian for the case with arbitrary potential is directly derived with thismethod for the case when the Brownian motion can be ignored. Using thiseffective Hamiltonian, we show an interesting fact that the dissipationsuppresses the wave packet spreading.
