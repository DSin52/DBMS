Path integral for the $SU(2)$ spin system is reconsidered. We show that theNielsen-Rohrlich(NR) formula is equivalent to the spin coherent stateexpression so that the phase space in the NR formalism is not topologicallynontrivial. We also perform the WKB approximation in the NR formula and findthat it gives the exact result.
