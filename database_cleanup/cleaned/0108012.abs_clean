Title: Spinors and Supersymmetry

Authors: D.G.C. McKeon (University of Western Ontario), T.N. Sherry (National

The flat spaces we consider are eitherthree or four dimensional of signatures 3 + 1, 4 + 0, 2 + 2 and 3 + 0. In eachof these cases, SUSY generators anti-commute to yield the generators oftranslations in the non-compact flat spaces. The spaces of constant curvatureAnti-deSitter space AdS_2. S_2 is embedded in a 3 + 0 Euclidean space whileAdS_2 is embedded in 2 + 1 Minkowski space. The SUSY generators in these casesanti-commute to yield the generators of the isometry groups (SO(3) or SO(2,1))of the space involved. We also report on some recent developments in lookingfor superspace realizations of these SUSY algebras. We can report good progressin the 3 + 0 Euclidean and in the AdS_2 case, somewhat less in the S_2 case. Ineach of the compact cases, we can construct field multiplet models carryinginvariance under the full SUSY algebra.
