I review the appearance of classical integrable systems as an effective toolfor the description of non-perturbative exact results in quantum string andvariables, Whitham deformations and associativity equations are consideredseparately demonstrating hidden parallels between topological 2d stringtheories and naively non-topological 4d theories. The proofs are supplementedby explicit illustrative examples.
