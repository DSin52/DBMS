We investigate $2d$ sigma-models with a $2+N$ dimensional Minkowski signaturetarget space metric and Killing symmetry, specifically supersymmetrized, andsee under which conditions they might lead to corresponding exact string vacua.It appears that the issue relies heavily on the properties of the vector$M_{\mu}$, a reparametrization term, which needs to possess a definite form forthe Weyl invariance to be satisfied. We give, in the $n = 1$ supersymmetriccase, two non-renormalization theorems from which we can relate the $u$component of $M_{\mu}$ to the $\beta^G_{uu}$ function. We work out this $(u,u)$component of the $\beta^G$ function and find a non-vanishing contribution atfour loops. Therefore, it turns out that at order $\alpha^{\prime 4}$, thereare in general non-vanishing contributions to $M_u$ that prevent us fromdeducing superstring vacua in closed form.
