Within the classical approximation we calculate the static $Q\bar Q$potential via the AdS/CFT relation for nonzero temperature and arbitraryinternal orientation of the quarks. We use a higher order curvature correctedtarget space background. For timelike Wilson loops there arises a criticalline in the orientation-distance plane which is shifted to larger distancesrelative to the calculation with uncorrected background. Beyond that line thereis no $Q\bar Q$-force. The overall vanishing of the force for antipodalorientation known from zero tempera ture remains valid. The spacelike Wilsonloops yield a string tension for a (2+1)-dimensional gauge theory, independentof the relative internal orientation, but sensitive to the backgroundcorrection.
