We consider a renormalizable two-dimensional model of dilaton gravity coupledto a set of conformal fields as a toy model for quantum cosmology. We discussthe cosmological solutions of the model and study the effect of including thebackreaction due to quantum corrections. As a result, when the matter densityis below some threshold new singularities form in a weak coupling region, whichsuggests that they will not be removed in the full quantum theory. We alsosolve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. Depending on the quantum state of theUniverse, the singularities may appear in a quantum region where the wavefunction is not oscillatory, i.e., when there is not a well defined notion ofclassical spacetime.
