Title: Physical fields and Clifford algebras

Comments: 8 pages, Latex

The physical fields (electromagnetic and electron fields) considered in theframework of Clifford algebras $\C_2$ and $\C_4$. The electron field describedby the algebra $\C_4$ which in spinor representation is realized by well-knownDirac $\gamma$-matrices, and by force of isomorphism $\C_{4}\cong\C_{2}\otimes\C_{2}$ is represented as a tensor product of two photon fields. By means ofthis introduced a system of electron field equations, which in particular casesis coincide with Dirac's and Maxwell's equations.
