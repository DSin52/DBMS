We have generalized recent results of Cappelli, Trugenberger and Zemba on theinteger quantum Hall effect constructing explicitly a ${\cal W}_{1+\infty}$ forthe fractional quantum Hall effect such that the negative modes annihilate theLaughlin wave functions. This generalization has a nice interpretation inJain's composite fermion theory. Furthermore, for these models we havecalculated the wave functions of the edge excitations viewing them as areapreserving deformations of an incompressible quantum droplet, and have shownthat the ${\cal W}_{1+\infty}$ is the underlying symmetry of the edgeexcitations in the fractional quantum Hall effect. Finally, we have appliedthis method to more general wave functions.
