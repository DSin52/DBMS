We show the exact equality of the path integral of the general renormalizablefourth order gravitational action to the path integral of the Einstein actioncoupled to a massive spin-0 field and a massive spin-2 ghost-like field withnon-polynomial interactions. The metric in the Einstein version is a highlynonlinear function of the metric in the quadratic version. Both massiveexcitations are unstable. The respective cosmological constant terms in the twoversions can be very different. Some implications are briefly discussed.
