Title: Discrete Mathematics and Physics on the Planck-Scale

Starting from the hypothesis that both physics, in particular space-time andthe physical vacuum, and the corresponding mathematics are discrete on thePlanck scale we develop a certain framework in form of a '{\it cellularnetwork}' consisting of cells interacting with each other via bonds. Both theinternal states of the cells and the "strength" of the bonds are assumed to bedynamical variables. In section 3 the basis is laid for a version of '{\itdiscrete analysis}' which, starting from different, perhaps more physicallyoriented principles, manages to make contact with the much more abstractmachinery of Connes et al. and may complement the latter approach. In section 4a, as far as we can see, new concept of '{\it topological dimension}' in formof a '{\it degree of connectivity}' for graphs, networks and the like isdeveloped. It is then indicated how this '{\it dimension}', which forcontinuous structures or lattices being embedded in a continuous backgroundagrees with the usual notion of dimension, may change dynamically as a resultof a '{\it phase transition like}' change in '{\it connectivity}' in thenetwork. A certain speculative argument, along the lines of statisticalmechanics, is supplied in favor of the naturalness of dimension 4 of ordinary(classical) space-time.
