We identify a new symmetry for the equations governing odderon amplitudes,corresponding in the Regge limit of QCD to the exchange of 3 reggeized gluons.The symmetry is a modular invariance with respect to the unique normal subgroupof sl(2,Z) {\,} of index 2.This leads to a natural description of the Hamiltonian and conservation-lawoperators as acting on the moduli space of elliptic curves with a fixedother by an {\em even} number of Dehn twists.
