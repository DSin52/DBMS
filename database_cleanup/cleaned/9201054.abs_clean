The effect of world-sheet boundaries on the temperature-dependence of bosonicstring theory is studied to first order in string perturbation theory. Thehigh- temperature behaviour of a theory with Dirichlet boundary conditions hasfeatures suggestive of the high-temperature limit of the confining phase oflarge-$n$ $SU(n)$ Yang--Mills theory, recently discussed by Polchinski.
