Title: Uniqueness of a Negative Mode About a Bounce Solution

Authors: Michael Maziashvili

Comments: 4 pages,LaTeX

We consider the uniqueness problem of a negative eigenvalue in the spectrumof small fluctuations about a bounce solution in a multidimensional case. Ourapproach is based on the concept of conjugate points from Morse theory and is anatural generalization of the nodal theorem approach usually used in onedimensional case. We show that bounce solution has exactly one conjugate pointat $\tau=0$ with multiplicity one.
