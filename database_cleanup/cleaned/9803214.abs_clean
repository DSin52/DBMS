Extending the recent work in hep-th/9803076, we consider string perturbativeexpansion in the presence of D-branes and orientifold planes imbedded inorbifolded space-time. In the $\alpha'\to 0$ limit the weak coupling stringperturbative expansion maps to `t Hooft's large N expansion. We focus on fourdimensional ${\cal N}=1,2,4$ supersymmetric theories, and also discuss possibleextensions to ${\cal N}=0$ cases. Utilizing the string theory perturbationtechniques we show that computation of any M-point correlation function inthese theories reduces to the corresponding computation in the parent ${\calN}=4$ theory. In particular, we discuss theories (which are rather constrained)with vanishing beta-functions to all orders in perturbation theory in the largeN limit. We also point out that in theories with non-vanishing beta-functionsthe gauge coupling running is suppressed in the large N limit. Introduction oforientifold planes allows to construct certain gauge theories with SO, Sp andSU gauge groups and various matter (only unitary gauge groups withbi-fundamental/adjoint matter arise in theories without orientifold planes).
