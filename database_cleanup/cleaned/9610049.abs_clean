We give an explicit derivation of the Picard-Fuchs equations for N=2supersymmetric SU(3) Yang-Mills theory with $N_f<6$ massive hypermultipletsin the fundamental representation. We determine the instanton corrections tothe prepotential in the weak coupling region using the relation between$\tr<\phi^2>$ and the prepotential. This method can be generalized to othergauge groups.
