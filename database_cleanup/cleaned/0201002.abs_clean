Title: Non-Commutative Space-Times, Black Hole, and Elementary Particle

Authors: Mu- in Park (CCNY)

Comments: Added footnote and references

It is shown that elementary black hole can not be distinguished from anelementary particle in the non-commutative space-times (space/space andspace/time) at the Planck scale. But, the non-commutative space-times can notbe ``directly'' measured in the elementary black hole system. A time-varyingnon-commutative parameter $\theta(t)$ is suggested in accordance with thetime-varying-G scenario. By identifying the elementary black hole with anelementary particle, the large hierarchy between the weak scale and Planckscale is naturally understood. For large black hole, the discrete spectrum ofthe horizon area is derived by identifying the black hole horizon with anon-commutative sphere.
