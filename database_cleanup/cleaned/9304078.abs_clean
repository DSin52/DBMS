We study the equations for the quasi-momenta which characterize thewave-functions in the Bethe ansatz for the XXX-Heisenberg model. We show in asimple analytical fashion, that the usual ``string hypothesis" incorrectlypredicts the number of real solutions and the number of complex solutions for$N>21$ in the sector with two spins flipped, confirming the work of Essler etal. Two complex pair solutions drop out and form two additional real pairsolutions. We also introduce a new set of variables which allows the equationsto be written as a single polynomial equation in one variable. We consider insome detail the case of three spins flipped.
