The Dirac quantization is performed for the constrained system of the openstring with different charges located at both ends in the constant background Bfield. Noncommutativity reveals to commutators [X, X], [P, P] and also [X,P] atboth ends of the string. We consider a dependence on the change of the"cyclotron frequency" of the charged string. The g-factor of the charged stringis also calculated in the framework of our formulation.
