Based on results about open string correlation functions, a nonassociativealgebra was proposed in a recent paper for D-branes in a background withnonvanishing $H$. We show that our associative algebra obtained by quantizingthe endpoints of an open string in an earlier work can also be used toreproduce the same correlation functions. The novelty of this algebra is thatfunctions on the D-brane do not form a closed algebra. This poses a problem todefine gauge transformations on such noncommutative spaces. We propose aresolution by generalizing the description of gauge transformations whichnaturally involves global symmetries. This can be understood in the context ofmatrix theory.
