improvements and one added referenceCausal perturbative renormalization within the recursive Epstein-Glaserscheme involves extending, at each order, time-ordered operator-valueddistributions to coinciding points. This is achieved by a generalized Taylorsubtraction on test functions, which is transposed to distributions. We showhow the Epstein-Glaser recursive construction can, by means of a slightmodification of the Hopf algebra of Feynman graphs, be recast in terms of thenew Connes-Kreimer algebraic setup for renormalization. This is illustrated for$\phi^4_4$-theory.
