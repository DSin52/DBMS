Dijkgraaf and Vafa have conjectured that the effective superpotentials forN=1 four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories can be given by the planardiagrams of matrix models. We examine some special models with cubic andquartic tree level superpotentials for adjoint chiral superfield \Phi. Weconsider the effective superpotentials for the classical vacuum \Phi=0 for U(N)and SO(N)/Sp(N) gauge theories. We evaluate the effective superpotentialsexactly in terms of the matrix model and in terms of closed string theory onCalabi-Yau geometry with fluxes. As a result we find their perfect agreements.
