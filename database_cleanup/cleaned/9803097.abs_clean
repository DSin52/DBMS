We analyze scattering of string modes at string junctions of type IIB stringtheory. In the infrared limit, certain orthogonal linear combinations of thefields on the different strings satisfy either Dirichlet or Neumann boundaryconditions. We confirm that the worldsheet theory of a general string networkhas eight conserved supercharges in agreement with target space BPSconsiderations. As an application, we obtain the band spectrum of some simplestring lattices.
