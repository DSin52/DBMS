We determine higher-derivative terms in the open superstring effective actionwith U(N) gauge group up to and including order alpha'^4 as can be extractedfrom 4 boson, 2 boson - 2 fermion and 4 fermion string scattering amplitudes.This yields corrections to the non-abelian Born-Infeld action involving higherderivatives as is relevant for studying D-branes beyond the slowly varyingfield approximation. While at order alpha'^2 the action has recently been shownto be a symmetrised trace, this no longer is true at order alpha'^3 oralpha'^4. We argue that these terms including higher derivatives are asimportant in a low-energy expansion as e.g. the much-discussed alpha'^4 F^6terms. In particular a computation of the fluctuation spectra at order alpha'^4has to take into account these non-symmetrised trace higher-derivative termscomputed here.
