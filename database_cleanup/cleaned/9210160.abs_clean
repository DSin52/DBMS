We show that several WZW coset models can be obtained by applying O(d,d)symmetry transformations (referred to as twisting) on WZW models. This leads toa conjecture that WZW models gauged by U(1)^n subgroup can be obtained bytwisting (ungauged) WZW models.  In addition, a class of solutions thatdescribe charged black holes in four dimensions is derived by twistingSL(2,R)\times SU(2) WZW.
