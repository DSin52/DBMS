The recent renaissance of wormhole physics has led to a very disturbingto to transform such wormholes into time machines. This extremely disturbingstate of affairs has lead Hawking to promulgate his chronology protectionconjecture. This paper continues a program begun in an earlier paper [PhysicalReview {\bf D47}, 554--565 (1993), hepth@xxx/9202090]. An explicit calculationof the vacuum expectation value of the renormalized stress--energy tensor inwormhole spacetimes is presented. Point--splitting techniques are utilized.Particular attention is paid to computation of the Green function [in itsHadamard form], and the structural form of the stress-energy tensor near shortclosed spacelike geodesics. Detailed comparisons with previous calculations arepresented, leading to a pleasingly unified overview of the situation.
