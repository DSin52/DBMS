5d dilatonic gravity (bosonic sector of gauged supergravity) with non-trivialbulk potential and with surface terms (boundary cosmological constant and traceanomaly induced effective action for brane quantum matter) is considered. Forconstant bulk potential and maximally SUSY Yang-Mills theory (CFT living on thebrane) the inflationary brane-world is constructed. The bulk is singularasymptotically AdS space with non-constant dilaton and dilatonic de Sitter orhyperbolic brane is induced by quantum matter effects. At the same time,dilaton on the brane is determined dynamically. This all is natural realizationof warped compactification in AdS/CFT correspondence. For fine-tuned toyexample of non-constant bulk potential we found the non-singular dilatonicbrane-world where bulk again represents asymptotically AdS space and de Sitterbrane (inflationary phase of observable Universe) is induced exclusively byquantum effects. The radius of the brane and dilaton are determineddynamically. The analytically solvable example of exponential bulk potentialleading to singular asymptotically AdS dilatonic bulk space with de Sitter (orhyperbolic) brane is also presented.In all cases under discussion the gravityon the brane is trapped via Randall-Sundrum scenario. It is shown thatqualitatively the same types of brane-worlds occur when quantum brane matter isdescribed by $N$ dilaton coupled spinors.
