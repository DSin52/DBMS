We study whether orbifold models are equivalently rewritten into torus modelsin the case of fermionic string theories. It is pointed out that symmetricorbifold models cannot be rewritten into torus models in the case of fermionicstring theories because of the absence of twist-untwist intertwining currentson the orbifold models. We present a list of current algebras on asymmetric$Z_N$-orbifold models of type II superstring theories with inner automorphismsof Lie algebra lattices of the $A_n$ series. It turns out that whether anasymmetric orbifold model is rewritten into a torus model depends on thespecific choice of a momentum lattice and an inner automorphism of the lattice.
