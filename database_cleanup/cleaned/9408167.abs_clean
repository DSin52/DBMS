We introduce a generalization of $A_{r}$-type Toda theory based on anon-abelian group G, which we call the $(A_{r},G)$-Toda theory, and its affineextensions in terms of gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten actions with deformationterms. In particular, the affine $(A_{1},SU(2))$-Toda theory describes theintegrable deformation of the minimal conformal theory for the critical Isingmodel by the operator $\Phi_{(2,1)}$. We derive infinite conserved charges andsoliton solutions from the Lax pair of the affine $(A_{1}, SU(2))$-Toda theory.Another type of integrable deformation which accounts for the$\Phi_{(3,1)}$-deformation of the minimal model is also found in the gaugedWess-Zumino-Witten context and its infinite conserved charges are given.
