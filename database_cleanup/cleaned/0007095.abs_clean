We classify the possible finite symmetries of conformal field theories withan affine Lie algebra su(2) and su(3), and discuss the results from theperspective of the graphs associated with the modular invariants. Thehighlights of the analysis are first, that the symmetries we found in eithercase are matched by the graph data in a perfect way in the case of su(2), butin a looser way for su(3), and second, that some of the graphs lead naturallyto projective representations, both in su(2) and in su(3).
