Trivialty"Authors: M. Consoli (INFN Catania) and P.M. Stevenson (Rice U.)

We respond to Tarrach's criticisms (hep-th/9511034) of our work on lambdaPhi^4 theory.  Tarrach does not discuss the same renormalization procedurethat we do. He also relies on results from perturbation theory that are notvalid. There is no "infrared divergence" or unphysical behaviour associatedwith the zero-momentum limit of our effective action.
