We give an argument showing that in N=4 supersymmetric gauge theories thereexists at least one bound state saturating the Bogomol'nyi bound with electriccharge $p$ and magnetic charge $q$, for each $p$ and $q$ relatively prime, andwe comment on the uniqueness of such state. This result is a necessarycondition for the existence of an exact S-duality in N=4 supersymmetrictheories.
