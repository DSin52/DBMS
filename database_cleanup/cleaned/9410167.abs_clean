The effective action for type II string theory compactified on a six torus is$N=8$ supergravity, which is known to have an $E_{7}$ duality symmetry. We showthat this is broken by quantum effects to a discrete subgroup, $E_7(\Z)$, whichcontains both the T-duality group $SO(6,6;\Z)$ and the S-duality group$SL(2;\Z)$. We present evidence for the conjecture that $E_7(\Z)$ is an exact\lq U-duality' symmetry of type II string theory. This conjecture requirescertain extreme black hole states to be identified with massive modes of thefundamental string. The gauge bosons from the Ramond-Ramond sector couple notto string excitations but to solitons. We discuss similar issues in the contextof toroidal string compactifications to other dimensions, compactifications ofthe type II string on $K_3\times T^2$ and compactifications ofeleven-dimensional supermembrane theory.
