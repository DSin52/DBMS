A simple iterative procedure is suggested for the deformation quantization of(irregular) Poisson brackets associated to the classical Yang-Baxter equation.The construction is shown to admit a pure algebraic reformulation giving theUniversal Deformation Formula (UDF) for any triangular Lie bialgebra. A simpleproof of classification theorem for inequivalent UDF's is given. As an examplethe explicit quantization formula is presented for the quasi-homogeneousPoisson brackets on two-plane.
