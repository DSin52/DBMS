We show that the recently found covariant formulation for chiral $p$--formsin $2(p+1)$ dimensions with $p$ even, can be naturally extended tosupersymmetric theories. We present the general method for writing covariantactions for chiral bosons and construct, in particular, in six dimensionscovariant actions for one tensor supermultiplet, for pure supergravity and forsupergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of tensor supermultiplets.
