We consider the problem of condensation of open string tachyon fields whichhave an O(D) symmetric profile. This problem is described by a boundaryconformal field theory with D scalar fields on a disc perturbed by relevantboundary operators with O(D) symmetry. The model is exactly solvable in thelarge D limit and we analyze its 1/D expansion. We find that this expansion isonly consistent for tachyon fields which are polynomials. In that case, we showthat the theory is renormalized by normal ordering the interaction. Thebeta-function for the tachyon field is the linear wave operator. We derive anexpression for the tachyon potential and compare with other known expressions.In particular, our technique gives the exact potential for the quadratictachyon profile. It can be used to correct the action which has been derived inthat case iteratively in derivatives of the tachyon field.
