We show that $N=8$ {\it self-dual} supergravity theory, which is theconsistent background for $N=2$ closed superstring theory in $2+2\-$dimensions,can accommodate the recently discovered two-dimensional dilaton gravity blackhole solution, {\it via} appropriate dimensional reductions and truncations.Interestingly, the usual dilaton field in this set of solutions emerges fromthe scalar field in the ${\bf 70}\-$dimensional representation of an intrinsicglobal $SO(8)$ group. We also give a set of exact solutions, which can beinterpreted as the dilaton field on Eguchi-Hanson gravitational instantonbackground, realized in an $N=1$ self-dual supergravity theory. This suggeststhat the $N=2$ superstring has a close (even closer) relationship with thetwo-dimensional black hole solution, which was originally developed in thecontext of bosonic string and $N=1$ superstring. Our result also providessupporting evidence for the conjecture that the $N=2$ superstring theory is the``master theory'' of supersymmetric integrable systems in lower-dimensions.
