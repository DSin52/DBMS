We study the conformal field theories corresponding to current superalgebras$osp(2|2)^{(1)}_k$ and $osp(2|2)^{(2)}_k$. We construct the free fieldrealizations, screen currents and primary fields of these current superalgebrasat general level $k$. All the results for $osp(2|2)^{(2)}_k$ are new, and theresults for the primary fields of $osp(2|2)^{(1)}_k$ also seem to be new. Ourresults are expected to be useful in the supersymmetric approach to Gaussiandisordered systems such as random bond Ising model and Dirac model.
