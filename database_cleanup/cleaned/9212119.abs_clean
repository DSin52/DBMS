Title: Correlation Functions in 2-Dimensional Integrable Quantum Field Theories

Comments: 19pp, LATEX version, (talk at Como Conference on ``Integrable Quantum

Field Theories'')In this talk I discuss the form factor approach used to compute correlationfunctions of integrable models in two dimensions. The Sinh-Gordon model is ourbasic example. Using Watson's and the recursive equations satisfied by matrixelements of local operators, I present the computation of the form factors ofthe elementary field $\phi(x)$ and the stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}(x)$ ofthe theory.
