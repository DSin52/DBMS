We find the cross-over behavior for the spin-spin correlation function for the2D Ising and 3-states Potts model with random bonds at the critical point. Theprocedure employed is the renormalisation approach of the perturbation seriesaround the conformal field theories representing the pure models. We obtain acrossover in the amplitude for the correlation function for the Ising modelwhich doesn't change the critical exponent, and a shift in the criticalexponent produced by randomness in the case of the Potts model. A comparisonwith numerical data is discussed briefly.
