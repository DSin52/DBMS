Constrained effective potentials in hot gauge theory give the probabilitythat a configuration p of the order parameter (Polyakov loop) occurs. They areimportant in the analysis of surface effects and bubble formation in theplasma. The vector potential appears non-linearly in the loop; in weak couplingthe linear term gives rise to the traditional free energy graphs. But thenon-linear terms generate insertions of the constrained modes into the freeenergy graphs, through renormalisations of the Polyakov loop. These insertionsare gauge dependent and are necessary to cancel the gauge dependence of thefree energy graphs. The latter is shown, through the BRST identities, to haveagain the form of constrained mode insertions. It also follows, that absoluteminima of the potential are at the centergroup values of the loop. We evaluatethe two-loop contributions for SU(N) gauge theories, with and without quarks,for the full domain of the N-1 variables.
