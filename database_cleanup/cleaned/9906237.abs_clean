We compare oscillations of a fundamental string ending on a D3-brane in twoextremal black D3-brane and (2) the spike soliton of the DBI effective actionfor a D3-brane. Previous work has shown that overall transverse modes of thetest-string appear as l=0 modes of the transverse scalar fields of the DBIsystem. We identify DBI world-volume degrees of freedom that have dynamicsmatching those of the test-string relative transverse modes. We show that thereis a map, resembling T-duality, between relative and overall transverse modesfor the test-string that interchanges Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditionsand implies equality of the absorption coefficients for both modes. We givegeneral solutions to the overall and relative transverse parts of the DBIcoupled gauge and scalar system and calculate absorption coefficients for thehigher angular momentum modes in the low frequency limit. We find that there isa nonzero amplitude for l>0 modes to travel out to infinity along the spike,demonstrating that the spike remains effectively 3+1-dimensional.
