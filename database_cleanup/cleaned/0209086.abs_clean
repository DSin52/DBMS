Title: Gauge Theories in the Derivative Expansion

Comments: 9 pages, v2

Gauge theories with and without matter are formulated in the derivativeexpansion. Amplitudues are derived as a power series in the energy scales;there are simplifications as compared with the usual loop expansion. Theincorporation and summation of Wilson loops is natural in this approach andallows for a derivation of the confining potential as well as the masses of thegauge invariant observables.
