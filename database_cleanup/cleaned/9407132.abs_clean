We realize the $U_q(\widehat{sl(2)})$ current algebra at arbitrary level interms of one deformed free bosonic field and a pair of deformed parafermionicfields. It is shown that the operator product expansions of these parafermionicfields involve an infinite number of simple poles and simple zeros, which thencondensate to form a branch cut in the classical limit $q\rightarrow 1$. Ourrealization coincides with those of Frenkel-Jing and Bernard when the level $k$takes the values 1 and 2 respectively.
