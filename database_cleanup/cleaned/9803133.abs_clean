We show that the four-dimensional U(1) gauge theory in the continuumformulation has a confining phase (exhibiting area law of the Wilson loop) inthe strong coupling region above a critical coupling $g_c$. This result isobtained by taking into account topological non-trivial sectors in U(1) gaugetheory. The derivation is based on the reformulation of gauge theory as adeformation of a topological quantum field theory and subsequent dimensionalreduction of the D-dimensional topological quantum field theory to the(D-2)-dimensional nonlinear sigma model. The topological quantum field theorypart of the four-dimensional U(1) gauge theory is exactly equivalent to thetwo-dimensional O(2) nonlinear sigma model. The confining (resp. Coulomb) phaseof U(1) gauge theory corresponds to the high (resp. low) temperature phase ofO(2) nonlinear sigma model and the critical point $g_c$ is determined by theBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition temperature. The quark(charge) confinement in the strong coupling phase is caused by the vortexcondensation. Thus the continuum gauge theory has the direct correspondence tothe compact formulation of lattice gauge theory.
