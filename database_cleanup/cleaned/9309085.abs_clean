We consider the problem of removing the divergences in an arbitrarygauge-field theory (possibly nonrenormalizable). We show that this can beachieved by performing, order by order in the loop expansion, a redefinition ofsome parameters (possibly infinitely many) and a canonical transformation (inthe sense of Batalin and Vilkovisky) of fields and BRS sources.Gauge-invariance is turned into a suitable quantum generalization ofBRS-invariance. We define quantum observables and study their properties. Weapply the result to renormalizable gauge-field theories that are gauge-fixedwith a nonrenormalizable gauge-fixing and prove that their predictivity isretained. A corollary is that topological field theories are predictive.Analogies and differences with the formalisms of classical and quantummechanics are pointed out.
