Title: The Global Problem of Time

Authors: Arlen Anderson

Comments: 8 pp., McGill 92-15

Time does not obviously appear amongst the coordinates on the constrainedphase space of general relativity in the Hamiltonian formulation. Recent workin finite-dimensional models claims that topological obstructions genericallymake the global definition of time impossible. It is shown here that a timecoordinate can be globally defined on a constrained phase space by patchingtogether local time coordinates, just as coordinates are defined ontopologically non-trivial manifolds.
