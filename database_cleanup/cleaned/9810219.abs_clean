In this paper, we describe non-abelian gauge bundles with magnetic andelectric fluxes on higher dimensional noncommutative tori. We give an explicitconstruction of a large class of bundles with nonzero magnetic 't Hooft fluxes.We discuss Morita equivalence between these bundles. The action of the dualityis worked out in detail for the four-torus. As an application, we discussBorn-Infeld on this torus, as a description of compactified string theory. Weshow that the resulting theory, including the fluctuations, is manifestlyinvariant under the T-duality group SO(4,4;Z). The U-duality invariant BPSmass-formula is discussed shortly. We comment on a discrepancy of this resultwith that of a recent calculation.
