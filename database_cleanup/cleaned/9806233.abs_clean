We solve exactly the (linear order) equations for tensor and scalarperturbations over the homogeneous, isotropic, open pre-big bang model recentlydiscussed by several authors. We find that the parametric amplification ofvacuum fluctuations (i.e. particle production) remains negligible throughoutthe perturbative pre-big bang phase.
