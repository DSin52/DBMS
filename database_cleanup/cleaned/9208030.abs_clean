We solve a class of branched polymer models coupled to spin systems and showthat they have no phase transition and are either always magnetized or nevermagnetized depending on the branching weights. By comparing these results withnumerical simulations of two-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to matterfields with central charge $c$ we provide evidence that for $c$ sufficientlylarge ($c\geq 12$) these models are effectively described by branched polymers.Moreover, the numerical results indicate a remarkable universality in theinfluence on the geometry of surfaces due to the interaction with matter. Forspin systems this influence only depends on the total central charge.
