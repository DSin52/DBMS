We analyse MINBU distribution of 2 dimensional quantum gravity. New data ofR$^2$-gravity by the Monte Carlo simulation and its theoretical analysis by thesemiclassical approach are presented. The cross-over phenomenon takes place atsome size of the baby universe where the randomness competes with the smoothingforce of $R^2$-term. The dependence on the central charge $c_m$\ and on the$R^2$-coupling are explained for the ordinary 2d quantum gravity and for$R^2$-gravity. The $R^2$-Liouville solution plays the central role in thesemiclassical analysis. A total derivative term (surface term) and the infraredregularization play important roles . The surface topology is that of a sphere.
