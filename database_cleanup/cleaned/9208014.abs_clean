A modification of the canonical quantization procedure for systems withtime-dependent second-class constraints is discussed and applied to thequantization of the relativistic particle in a plane wave. The time dependenceof constraints appears in the problem in two ways. The Lagrangian depends ontime explicitly by origin, and a special time-dependent gauge is used. Twopossible approaches to the quantization are demonstrated in this case. One isto solve directly a system of operator equations, proposed by Tyutin and one ofthe authors (Gitman) as a generalization of Dirac canonical quantization innonstationary case, and another to find first a canonical transformation, whichmakes it possible to discribe the dynamics in the physical sactor by means ofsome effective Hamiltonian. Quantum mechanics constructed in both cases provesto be equivalent to Klein-Gordon theory of the relativistic particle in a planewave. The general conditions of unitarity of the dynamics in the physicalsector are discussed.
