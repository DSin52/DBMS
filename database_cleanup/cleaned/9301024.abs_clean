We construct $N=4$ supersymmetric KdV equation as a hamiltonian flow on the$N=4\;SU(2)$ super Virasoro algebra. The $N=4$ KdV superfield, the hamiltonianand the related Poisson structure are concisely formulated in $1D \;N=4$harmonic superspace. The most general hamiltonian is shown to necessarilyinvolve $SU(2)$ breaking parameters which are combined in a traceless rank 2$SU(2)$ tensor. First nontrivial conserved charges of $N=4$ super KdV (ofdimensions 2 and 4) are found to exist if and only if the $SU(2)$ breakingtensor is a bilinear of some $SU(2)$ vector with a fixed length proportional tothe inverse of the central charge of $N=4\;SU(2)$ algebra. After the reductionto $N=2$ this restricted version of $N=4$ super KdV goes over to the $a=4$integrable case of $N=2$ super KdV and so is expected to be integrable. We showthat it is bi-hamiltonian like its $N=2$ prototype.
