Title: Correlation functions of the global E8 symmetry currents in the

Heterotic 5-brane theoryAuthors: Morten Krogh

Comments: 10 pages, Talk at the Trieste conference on Superfivebranes and

Physics in 5+1 dimensions, April 1998. LaTex, requires sprocl.styWe consider the 5-brane placed at one end of the world in the Heterotic $E_8\times E_8$ theory. The low energy theory is a 6 dimensional $(1,0)$superconformal theory with $E_8$ as a global symmetry. We calculate thetwo-point correlator of the $E_8$ current in 6 dimensions and in 4 dimensionsafter compactification on $\MT{2}$. This correlator is derived in 3 different
