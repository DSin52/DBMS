We study the role of rotational symmetry in the systems where nonabelianBerry potentials emerge as a result of integrating out fast degrees of freedom.The conserved angular momentum is constructed in the presence of a non-abelianBerry potential, which is formulated using Grassmann variables. Themodifications on conventional angular momentum are discussed in close analogywith monopole systems. The diatomic molecular system discussed by Zygelman isfound to have a similar structure to that of a non-abelian $SU(2)$ chargecoupled to a 't Hooft - Polyakov monopole. The abelian limit of the Berrypotential in diatomic systems is shown to be the same as $U(1)$ monopole and ina large separation limit, we observe the decoupling associated with a vanishingfield tensor.
