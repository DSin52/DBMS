The coupling, in a non-standard way, of a bosonic string theory with adilaton and antisymmetric fields is investigated. By integrating over theantisymmetric fields, a Coulomb-like interaction term is generated. The staticpotential of a theory of this kind is obtained from the corresponding non-localzeta function, in some approximation. An interpretation of the static potentialas a type of non-local Casimir effect is given.
