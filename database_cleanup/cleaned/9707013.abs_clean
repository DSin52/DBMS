We discuss several implications of R^4 couplings in M theory whencompactified on Calabi-Yau (CY) manifolds. In particular, these couplings canbe predicted by supersymmetry from the mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simonscouplings in five dimensions and are related to the one-loop holomorphicanomaly in four-dimensional N=2 theories. We find a new contribution to theEinstein term in five dimensions proportional to the Euler number of theinternal CY threefold, which corresponds to a one-loop correction of thehypermultiplet geometry. This correction is reproduced by a direct computationin type II string theories. Finally, we discuss a universal non-perturbativecorrection to the type IIB hyper-metric.
