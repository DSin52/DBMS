(Contribution to the 7th Marcel Grossman Meeting on General Relativity,Stanford, July 1994)We study the effect of S-duality and target-space duality tranformations of$N=4,d=4$ and $N=1,d=10$ supersymmetric configurations on their Killingspinors. We find that, under reasonable assumptions, the dual configurationsare also supersymmetric and that the Killing spinors transform in a simple way.
