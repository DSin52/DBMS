Efim Fradkin, 5-10 June 2000, Moscow, RussiaA summary is given of a quantization of the multiflavour Schwinger model on afinite-temperature cylinder with chirality-breaking boundary conditions at itsspatial ends, and it is shown that the analytic expression for the chiralcondensate implies that the theory exhibits a second order phase transitionwith $T_c = 0$.
