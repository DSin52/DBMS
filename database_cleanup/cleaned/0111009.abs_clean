The problem of the restoring of the equivalence between Light-Front (LF)Hamiltonian and conventional Lorentz-covariant formulations of gauge theory issolved for QED(1+1) and (perturbatively to all orders) for QCD(3+1). ForQED(1+1) the LF Hamiltonian is constructed which reproduces the results ofLorentz-covariant theory. This is achieved by bosonization of the model and byanalysing the resulting bosonic theory to all orders in the fermion mass. ForQCD(3+1) we describe nonstandard regularization that allows to restorementioned equivalence with finite number of counterterms in LF Hamiltonian.
