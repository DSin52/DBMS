In unified gauge theories there exist renormalization group invariantrelations among gauge and Yukawa couplings that are compatible withperturbative renormalizability, which could be considered as a Gauge-YukawaUnification. Such relations are even necessary to ensure all-loop finiteness inFinite Unified Theories, which have vanishing $\beta$-functions beyond theunification point. We elucidate this alternative way of unification, and thenpresent its phenomenological consequences in $SU(5)$-based models.
