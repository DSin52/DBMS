By considering the superembedding equation for the Type II superstring wederive the classical relation between the NSR string and the Type II GSsuperstring Grassmannian variables. The connection between the actions of thesetwo models is also established. Then introducing the proper twistor-likeLorentz harmonic variables we fix $\kappa-$symmetry of the GS formulation inthe manifestly SO(1,9) Lorentz covariant manner and establish the relationbetween the gauge-fixed variables of the NSR and the Type II GS models.
