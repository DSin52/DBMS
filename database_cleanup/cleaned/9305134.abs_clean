The free energy and local height probabilities of the dilute A models withbroken $\Integer_2$ symmetry are calculated analytically using inversion andcorner transfer matrix methods. These models possess four critical branches.The first two branches provide new realisations of the unitary minimal seriesand the other two branches give a direct product of this series with an Isingmodel. We identify the integrable perturbations which move the dilute A modelsaway from the critical limit. Generalised order parameters are defined andtheir critical exponents extracted. The associated conformal weights are foundto occur on the diagonal of the relevant Kac table. In an appropriate regimethe dilute A$_3$ model lies in the universality class of the Ising model in amagnetic field. In this case we obtain the magnetic exponent $\delta=15$directly, without the use of scaling relations.
