We use the recursive structure of the compactification of the instantonmoduli space of N=2 Super Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(2), toconstruct, by inductive limit, a universal moduli space which includes all themulti-instanton moduli spaces. Furthermore, with the aim of understanding thefield theoretic structure of the strong coupling expansion, we perform theBorel sum which acts on the parameter defining such a universal moduli space.
