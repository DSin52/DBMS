We formulate a renormalizable quantum gravity in $2+\epsilon$ dimensions bygeneralizing the nonlinear sigma model approach to string theory. We find thatthe theory possesses the ultraviolet stable fixed point if the central chargeof the matter sector is in the range $0~<~c~<~25$. This may imply the existenceof consistent quantum gravity theory in 3 and 4 dimensions. We compute thescaling dimensions of the relevant operators in the theory at the ultravioletfixed point. We obtain a scaling relation between the cosmological constant andthe gravitational constant, which is crucial for searching for the continuumlimit in the constructive approach to quantum gravity.
