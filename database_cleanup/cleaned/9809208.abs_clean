The recently presented quantum antibrackets are generalized to quantumSp(2)-antibrackets. For the class of commuting operators there are true quantumversions of the classical Sp(2)-antibrackets. For arbitrary operators we have ageneralized bracket structure involving higher Sp(2)-antibrackets. It is shownthat these quantum antibrackets may be obtained from generating operatorsinvolving operators in arbitrary involutions. A recently presented quantummaster equation for operators, which was proposed to encode generalized quantumMaurer-Cartan equations for arbitrary open groups, is generalized to the Sp(2)formalism. In these new quantum master equations the generalized Sp(2)-bracketsappear naturally.
