The Discrete Light-Cone Quantization (DLCQ) of a supersymmetric SU(N) gaugetheory in 1+1 dimensions is discussed, with particular emphasis given to theinclusion of all dynamical zero modes. Interestingly, the notorious `zero-modeproblem' is now tractable because of special supersymmetric cancellations. Inparticular, we show that anomalous zero-mode contributions to the currents areabsent, in contrast to what is observed in the non-supersymmetric case. We findthat the supersymmetric partner of the gauge zero mode is the diagonalcomponent of the fermion zero mode. An analysis of the vacuum structure isprovided and it is shown that the inclusion of zero modes is crucial forprobing the phase properties of the vacua. In particular, we find that theground state energy is zero and N-fold degenerate, and thus consistent withunbroken supersymmetry. We also show that the inclusion of zero modes for thelight-cone supercharges leaves the supersymmetry algebra unchanged. Finally, weremark that the dependence of the light-cone Fock vacuum in terms of the gaugezero is unchanged in the presence of matter fields.
