Braided groups and braided matrices are novel algebraic structures living inbraided or quasitensor categories. As such they are a generalization ofsuper-groups and super-matrices to the case of braid statistics. Here weconstruct braided group versions of the standard quantum groups $U_q(g)$. Theyhave the same FRT generators $l^\pm$ but a matrix braided-coproduct $\und\DeltaL=L\und\tens L$ where $L=l^+Sl^-$, and are self-dual. As an application, thedegenerate Sklyanin algebra is shown to be isomorphic to the braided matrices$BM_q(2)$; it is a braided-commutative bialgebra in a braided category. As asecond application, we show that the quantum double $D(\usl)$ (also known asthe `quantum Lorentz group') is the semidirect product as an algebra of twocopies of $\usl$, and also a semidirect product as a coalgebra if we use braidstatistics. We find various results of this type for the doubles of generalquantum groups and their semi-classical limits as doubles of the Lie algebrasof Poisson Lie groups.
