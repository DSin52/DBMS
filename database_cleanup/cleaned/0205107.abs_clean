New section discussing the k=0 algebraand other singularities in the continuous Moyal formalismIn this paper, we recast the fermionic ghost sector of Witten's open bosonicstring field theory in the language of noncommutative field theory. Inparticular, following the methods of hep-th/0202087, we find that in Siegelgauge Witten's star product roughly corresponds to a continuous tensor productof Clifford Algebras, and we formulate important operators of the theory inthis language, notably the kinetic operator of vacuum string field theory andthe BRST operator describing the vacuum of the unstable D-25 brane. We findthat the BRST operator is singular in this formulation. We explore alternativeoperator/Moyal representations of the star product analogous to the splitstring description and the discrete Moyal basis developed extensively in recentwork by Bars and Matsuo (hep-th/0204260). Finally we discuss some interestingsingulariries in the formalism and how they may be regulated.
