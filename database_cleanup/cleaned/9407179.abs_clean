Title: Octonionic representations of Clifford algebras and triality

Comments: 33 pages

The theory of representations of Clifford algebras is extended to employ thedivision algebra of the octonions or Cayley numbers. In particular, questionsthat arise from the non-associativity and non-commutativity of this divisionalgebra are answered. Octonionic representations for Clifford algebras lead toa notion of octonionic spinors and are used to give octonionic representationsof the respective orthogonal groups. Finally, the triality automorphisms areshown to exhibit a manifest $\perm_3 \times SO(8)$ structure in this framework.
