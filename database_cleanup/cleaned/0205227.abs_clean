A family of de Sitter vacua introduced in hep-th/0203198 as plausible initialconditions for inflation, are discussed from the point of view of de Sitterholography. The vacua are argued to be physically acceptable and theinflationary picture provides a physical interpretation of a subfamily of deSitter invariant vacua. Some speculations on the issue of vacuum choice and theconnection between the CMBR and holography are also provided.
