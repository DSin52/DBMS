Wormhole spacetimes may be responsible for the possible loss of quantumcoherence and the introduction of additional fundamental quantum indeterminancyof the values of constants of nature. As a system which is known to admit suchclassical wormhole solutions, Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) theory is revisited.Since the classical wormhole instanton solution in this theory has been studiedextensively thus far, in the present work, ``quantum wormholes'' are explored.Namely in the context of a minisuperspace quantum cosmology model based on thisEYM theory, ``quantum wormhole'', defined as a state represented by a solutionto the Wheeler-DeWitt equation satisfying an appropriate wormhole boundarycondition, is discussed. Finally, it is proposed that the minisuperspace modelbased on this theory in the presence of the cosmological constant may serve asa simple yet interesting system displaying an overall picture of entireuniverse's history from the deep quantum domain all the way to the classicaldomain.
