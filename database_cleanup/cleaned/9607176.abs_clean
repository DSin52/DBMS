Working in a Hamiltonian formulation with $A_0 = 0$ gauge and also in a pathintegral formulation, we show that the vacuum wave functional offour-dimensional pure Yang-Mills theory has the form of the exponential of a{\it three}-dimensional Yang-Mills action. This result implies that vacuumexpectation values can be calculated in Yang-Mills theory but one dimensionlower. Our analysis reveals that this dimensional reduction results from astochastic nature of the theory.
