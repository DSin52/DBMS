The RR Page charges for the D2-, D4-, D6-brane in B fields are constructedexplicitly from the equations of motion and the nonvanishing (modified) Bianchiidentities by exploiting their properties --- conserved and localized. It isfound that the RR Page charges are independent of the backgound B fields, whichprovides further evidence that the RR Page charge should be quantized. In ourconstruction, it is highly nontrivial that the terms like B x B x B, B x B x F,B x F x F from different sources are exactly cancelled with each other.
