Effective potential for scalar $\lambda\phi^4$ theory is obtained using theexact renormalization group method which includes both the usual one-loopcontribution as well as the dominant higher loop effects. Our numericalcalculation indicates a breakdown of naive one-loop result for sufficientlylarge renormalized coupling constant.
