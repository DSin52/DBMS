The long-range fields associated with non-abelian vortices generally obstructfull realization, in the spectrum, of the symmetry of the ground state. In thecontext of 2+1 dimensional field theories, we show how this effect manifestsitself concretely in altered conditions for the angular momentum and in theenergy spectrum. A particularly interesting case is supersymmetry, which isobstructed by the gravitational effect of any mass.
