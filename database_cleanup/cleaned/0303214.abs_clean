We construct boundary states for D-branes which carry traveling waves in thecovariant formalism. We compute their vacuum amplitudes to investigate theirinteractions. In non-compact space, the vacuum amplitudes become trivial as iscommon in plane wave geometries. However, we found that if they arecompactified in the traveling direction, then the amplitudes are affected bynon-trivial time dependent effects. The interaction between D-branes with wavestraveling in the opposite directions (`pulse-antipulse scattering') are alsocomputed. Furthermore, we apply these ideas to open string tachyon condensationwith traveling waves.
