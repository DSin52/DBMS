A solution of effective string theory in four dimensions is presented whichadmits interpretation of a rotating black cosmic string. It is constructed bytensoring the three dimensional black hole, extended with the Kalb-Ramondaxion, with a flat direction. The physical interpretation of the solution isdiscussed, with special attention on the axion, which is found to play a rolevery similar to a Higgs field. Finally, it is pointed out that the solutionrepresents an exact WZWN $\sigma$ model on the string world sheet, to allorders in the inverse string tension $\alpha'$.
