Title: Strings in Nontrivial Gravitino and Ramond-Ramond Backgrounds

Authors: Ioannis Giannakis

Comments: 6 pages, Latex; Based on a talk given at the 10th International

Symposium on String Theory, Towha University, Fukuoka, Japan, July 2001In this paper we discuss deformations of the BRST operator of the fermionicstring. These deformations preserve nilpotency of the BRST operator andcorrespond to turning on infinitesimal Gravitino and Ramond-Ramond spacetimefields.
