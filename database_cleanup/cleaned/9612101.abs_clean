We construct static axially symmetric solutions of SU(2)Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton theory. Like their spherically symmetriccounterparts, these solutions are nonsingular and asymptotically flat. Thesolutions are characterized by the winding number n and the node number kof the gauge field functions. For fixed n with increasing k the solutionstend to ``extremal'' Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton black holes with n units ofmagnetic charge.
