Title: The Vacuum in Light-Cone Field Theory

Comments: 20 pages, RevTeX, 4 Postscript figures. Minor typos corrected

This is an overview of the problem of the vacuum in light-cone field theory,stressing its close connection to other puzzles regarding light-conequantization. I explain the sense in which the light-cone vacuum is``trivial,'' and describe a way of setting up a quantum field theory on nullplanes so that it is equivalent to the usual equal-time formulation. Thisconstruction is quite helpful in resolving the puzzling aspects of thelight-cone formalism. It furthermore allows the extraction of effectiveHamiltonians that incorporate vacuum physics, but that act in a Hilbert spacein which the vacuum state is simple. The discussion is fairly informal, andfocuses mainly on the conceptual issues. [Talk presented at {\sc OrbisScientiae 1996}, Miami Beach, FL, January 25--28, 1996. To appear in theproceedings.]
