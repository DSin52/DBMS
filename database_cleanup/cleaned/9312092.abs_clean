By considering the parity-transformation properties of the $(1/2,\,0)$ and$(0,\,1/2)$ fields in the {\it front form} we find ourselves forced to studythe front-form evolution both along $x^+$ and $x^-$ directions. As a byproduct, we find that half of the dynamical degrees of freedom of a full theorylive on the $x^+=0$ surface and the other half on the $x^-=0$ surface.Elsewhere, Jacob shows how these results are required to build a satisfactory,and internally consistent, front-form quantum field theory.
