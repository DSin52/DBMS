Domain-wall solutions in four-dimensional supersymmetric field theories withdistinct discrete vacuum states lead to the spontaneous breaking ofsupersymmetry, either completely or partially. We consider in detail the casewhen the domain walls are the BPS-saturated states, and 1/2 of supersymmetry ispreserved. Several useful criteria that relate the preservation of 1/2 ofsupersymmetry on the domain walls to the central extension appearing in the N=1superalgebras are established. We explain how the central extension can appearin N=1 supersymmetry and explicitly obtain the central charge in varioustheories with or without matter. The BPS-saturated domain walls satisfy thefirst-order differential equations which we call the creek equations, sincethey formally coincide with the (complexified) equations of motion of an analoghigh-viscosity fluid on a profile which is given by the superpotential of theoriginal problem. Some possible applications are considered.
