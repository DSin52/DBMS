We point out some problems with the previously-proposed phase diagram of the$Z_6$ spin models. Consideration of the diagram near to the decoupling surfaceusing both exact and approximate arguments suggests a modification whichremedies these deficiencies. With the aid of a new parametrisation of the phasespace, we study the models numerically, with results which support ourconjectures.
