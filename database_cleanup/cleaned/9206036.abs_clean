Quantum field theory is discussed in M\"obius corner kaleidoscopes using themethod of images. The vacuum average of the stress-energy tensor of a freefield is derived and is shown to be a simple sum of straight cosmic stringexpressions, the strings running along the edges of the corners. It does notseem possible to set up a spin-half theory easily.
