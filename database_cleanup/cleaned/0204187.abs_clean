We consider the evolution of FRW cosmological models and linear perturbationsof tachyon matter rolling towards a minimum of its potential. The tachyoncoupled to gravity is described by an effective 4d field theory of stringtheory tachyon. In the model where a tachyon potential $V(T)$ has a quadraticminimum at finite value of the tachyon field $T_0$ and $V(T_0)=0$, the tachyoncondensate oscillates around its minimum with a decreasing amplitude. It isshown that its effective equation of state is $p=-\epsilon/3$. However, linearinhomogeneous tachyon fluctuations coupled to the oscillating backgroundcondensate are exponentially unstable due to the effect of parametricresonance. In another interesting model, where tachyon potential exponentiallyapproaches zero at infinity of $T$, rolling tachyon condensate in an expandinguniverse behaves as pressureless fluid. Its linear fluctuations coupled withsmall metric perturbations evolve similar to these in the pressureless fluid.However, this linear stage changes to a strongly non-linear one very early, sothat the usual quasi-linear stage observed at sufficiently large scales in thepresent Universe may not be realized in the absence of the usual particle-likecold dark matter.
