A general field-antifield BV formalism for antisymplectic first classconstraints is proposed. It is as general as the corresponding symplecticBFV-BRST formulation and it is demonstrated to be consistent with a previouslyproposed formalism for antisymplectic second class constraints through ageneralized conversion to corresponding first class constraints. Thereby thebasic concept of gauge symmetry is extended to apply to quite a new class ofgauge theories potentially possible to exist.
