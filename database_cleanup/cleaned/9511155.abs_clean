In the Bargmann-Fock representation the coordinates $z^i$ act as bosoniccreation operators while the partial derivatives $\partial_{z^j}$ act asannihilation operators on holomorphic $0$-forms as states of a $D$-dimensionalbosonic oscillator. Considering also $p$-forms and further geometrical objectsas the exterior derivative and Lie derivatives on a holomorphic ${\bf C}^D$, weend up with an analogous representation for the $D$-dimensional supersymmetricoscillator. In particular, the supersymmetry multiplet structure of the Hilbertspace corresponds to the cohomology of the exterior derivative. In addition, a1-complex parameter group emerges naturally and contains both time evolutionand a homotopy related to cohomology. Emphasis is on calculus.
