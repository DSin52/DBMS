Using an infinite number of fields, we construct actions for D=4 self-dualYang-Mills with manifest Lorentz invariance and for D=10 super-Yang-Mills withmanifest super-Poincar\'e invariance. These actions are generalizations of thecovariant action for the D=2 chiral boson which was first studied by McClain,Wu, Yu and Wotzasek.
