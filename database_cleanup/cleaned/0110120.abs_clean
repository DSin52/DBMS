We analyse the large momentum behaviour of 4-dimensional massive euclideanPhi-4-theory using the flow equations of Wilson's renormalization group. Theflow equations give access to a simple inductive proof of perturbativerenormalizability. By sharpening the induction hypothesis we prove new and, asit seems, close to optimal bounds on the large momentum behaviour of thecorrelation functions. The bounds are related to what is generally calledWeinberg's theorem.
