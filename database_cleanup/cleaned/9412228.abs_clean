The antibracket formalism for gauge theories, at both the classical andquantum level, is reviewed. Gauge transformations and the associated gaugestructure are analyzed in detail. The basic concepts involved in theantibracket formalism are elucidated. Gauge-fixing, quantum effects, andanomalies within the field-antifield formalism are developed. The concepts,issues and constructions are illustrated using eight gauge-theory models.
