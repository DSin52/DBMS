The Turaev-Viro state sum invariant is known to give the transition amplitudefor the three dimensional BF theory with cosmological term, and its deformationparameter hbar is related with the cosmological constant via hbar=sqrt{Lambda}.This suggests a way to find the expectation value of the spacetime volume bydifferentiating the Turaev-Viro amplitude with respect to the cosmologicalconstant. Using this idea, we find an explicit expression for the spacetimevolume in BF theory. According to our results, each labelled triangulationcarries a volume that depends on the labelling spins. This volume is explicitlydiscrete. We also show how the Turaev-Viro model can be used to obtain thespacetime volume for (2+1) dimensional quantum gravity.
