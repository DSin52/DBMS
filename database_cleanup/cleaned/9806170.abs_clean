Title: Duality in SU(N) x SU(N') Product Group from M theory

Authors: Julian Lee and Sang-Jin Sin

Comments: Latex, 15 pages, 4 figures. The title, abstract and contents are

modified in order to give a more clear presentation. The misleading remark onS-duality transformation is removed. The version to appear in Mod. Phys.Lett. AWe generalize the M-theoretic duality of Schmaltz and Sundrum to the productgroup SU(N) x SU(N') case. We show that the type IIA brane configurations fordual gauge theories are in fact two special limits of the same M-theory5-brane, just as in the case of the simple SU(N) group.
