Title: On Entropy of 3-Dimensional Simplicial Complexes

Authors: D.V.Boulatov

Comments: NBI-HE-94-37, 13 pages

We prove that the number of 3-dimensional simplicial complexes having thespherical topology grows exponentially as a function of a volume. It issuggested that the 3d simplicial quantum gravity has qualitatively the samephase structure as the O(n) matrix model in the dense phase.
