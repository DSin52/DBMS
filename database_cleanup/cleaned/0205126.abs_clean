We study the geometry of determinant line bundles associated to Diracoperators on compact odd dimensional manifolds. Physically, these arise as(local) vacuum line bundles in quantum gauge theory. We give a simplifiedderivation of the commutator anomaly formula using a construction based onnoncyclic trace extensions and associated multiplicative renormalizeddeterminants.
