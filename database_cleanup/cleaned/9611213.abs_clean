Supersymmetry breaking and compactification of extra space-time dimensionsmay have a common dynamical origin if our universe is spontaneously generatedin the form of a four-dimensional topological or non-topological defect inhigher dimensional space-time. Within such an approach the conventionalparticles are zero modes trapped in the core of the defect. In many casessolutions of this type spontaneously break all supersymmetries of the originaltheory, so that the low-energy observer from ``our'' universe inside the corewould not detect supersymmetry. Since the extra dimensions are not compact but,rather, inaccessible to low-energy observers, the usual infinite tower of theKaluza-Klein excitations does not exist. Production of superpartners at theenergy scale of SUSY restoration will be accompanied by four-momentumnon-conservation. (Depending on the nature of the solution at hand, thenon-conservation may either happen above some threshold energy or becontinuous). In either case, the door to extra dimensions may be not very farfrom the energies accessible at present colliders.
