We show how the gravity, extrinsic curvature, and gauge field theories areinduced on dynamically localized brane world. They should obey theGauss-Codazzi-Ricci equation in addition to their own equations of motion. Asan example, we derive the solitonic solution for curved domain wall in fivedimensions in terms of gravity and extrinsic curvature fields of the brane, andthen derive the effective action for their field theory on the brane.
