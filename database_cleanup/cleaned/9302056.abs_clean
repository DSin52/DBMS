This paper is the third in a sequel to develop a super-analogue of theclassical Selberg trace formula, the Selberg supertrace formula. It deals withbordered super Riemann surfaces. The theory of bordered super Riemann surfacesis outlined, and the corresponding Selberg supertrace formula is developed. Theanalytic properties of the Selberg super zeta-functions on bordered superRiemann surfaces are discussed, and super-determinants of Dirac-Laplaceoperators on bordered super Riemann surfaces are calculated in terms of Selbergsuper zeta-functions.
