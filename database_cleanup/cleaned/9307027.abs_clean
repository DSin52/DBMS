We study perturbatively the (conformal) WZNW model. At one loop we computeone-particle irreducible two- and three-point current correlation functions,both in the conventional version and in the classically equivalent, chiral,nonlocal, induced version of the model. At two loops we compute the two-pointfunction and find that it vanishes (modulo infrared-induced logarithms). We usedimensional regularization and the $R^*$ operation for removing infrareddivergences. The outcome of the calculations is insensitive to the treatment ofthe $\varepsilon^{\m\n}$ tensor as a two-dimensional or $d$-dimensional object.Our results indicate that the one-particle irreducible current correlationfunctions constitute an effective action equal to the original WZNW action withthe familiar level shift, $k\to k+\tilde h$.
