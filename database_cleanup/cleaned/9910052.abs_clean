We find the terms in the nonabelian world-volume action of a system of manyDp-branes which describe the leading coupling to all type II supergravitybackground fields. These results are found by T-dualizing earlier results forD0-branes, which in turn were determined from calculations of the M(atrix)theory description of the supercurrent of 11D supergravity. Our results arecompatible with earlier results on the supersymmetric Born-Infeld action for asingle D-brane in a general background and with Tseytlin's symmetrized traceproposal for extending the abelian Born-Infeld action to a nonabelian theory.In the case p = 3, the operators we find on the D-brane world-volume areclosely related to those which couple to supergravity fields in the AdS_5 * S^5IIB supergravity background. This gives an explicit construction, includingnormalization, of some of the operators used in the celebrated AdS/CFTcorrespondence for 3-branes. We also discuss the S-duality of the action in thecase p = 3, finding that the S-duality of the action determines how certainoperators in the 4D N = 4 SYM theory transform under S-duality. These S-dualityresults give some new insight into the puzzle of the transverse 5-brane inM(atrix) theory.
