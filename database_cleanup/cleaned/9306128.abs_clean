163-172The method of geometrical quantization of symplectic manifolds is applied toconstructing infinite dimensional irreducible unitary representations of thealgebra of functions on the compact quantum group $SU_q(2)$. A formulation ofthe method for the general case $SU_q(n)$ is suggested. (This work is theEnglish version of the article submitted for publication in Algebra Analiz.)
