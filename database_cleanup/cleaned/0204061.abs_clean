A 7-manifold with G_2 holonomy can be constructed as a R^3 bundle over aquaternionic space. We consider a quaternionic base space which is singular andits metric depends on three parameters, where one of them corresponds to aninterpolation between S^4 and CP^2 or its non-compact analogs. This 4-dEinstein space has four isometries and the fixed point set of a generic Killingvector is discussed. When embedded into M-theory the compactification over agiven Killing vector gives intersecting 6-branes as IIA configuration and weargue that membrane instantons may resolve the curvature singularity.
