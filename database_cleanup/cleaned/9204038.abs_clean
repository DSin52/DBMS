It has been known for some time that $W$ algebras can be realised in terms ofan energy-momentum tensor together with additional free scalar fields. Somerecent results have shown that more general realisations are also possible. Inthis paper, we consider a wide class of realisations that may be obtained fromthe Miura transformation, related to the existence of canonical subalgebras ofthe Lie algebras on which the $W$ algebras are based. We give explicit formulaefor all realisations of this kind, and discuss their applications in $W$-stringtheory.
