Static spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell gravity withthe dilaton field are described. The solutions correspond to black holes andare generalizations of the previously known dilaton black hole solution. Inaddition to mass and electric charge these solutions are labeled by a newparameter, the dilaton charge of the black hole. Different effects of thedilaton charge on the geometry of space-time of such black holes are studied.It is shown that in most cases the scalar curvature is divergent at thehorizons. Another feature of the dilaton black hole is that there is a finiteinterval of values of electric charge for which no black hole can exist.
