Title: On the effective action of local composite fields

Comments: 15 pages, LATEX, 5 figures

The gauge invariant method for calculation of the effective action of thelocal composite fields in QFT is proposed. The effective action of the localcomposite fields in QED is studied up to 2-loop level. The graph rules for thelocal composite fields are derived. On the basis of these rules the problem ofone-particle irreducibility is discussed.
