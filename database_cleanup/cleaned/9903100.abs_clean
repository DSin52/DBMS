A direct consequence of the occurrence of fermion families is the invarianceof currents under certain groups of (universality) transformations. We show howthese universality groups can themselves be used to find and study grand familyunification models. Identifying two independent - weak and strong -universality groups and assuming that the grand unification group is SU(8N),its subgroup respecting either weak or strong universality is shown to be G =SU(2)xU(1)xSU(3). The fundamental representation of SU(8N) decomposes as Nfamilies of leptons and quarks. In the G-invariant limit, all fermions areleft-handed. A mechanism for generating the correct number of right-handedfermions with the correct couplings so as to give pure vector colour andelectromagnetic currents is exhibited. Universality is shown to result mostnaturally from a preonic structure of fermions. In such a preonic picture thereare no ultraheavy gauge bosons and no anomaly or hierarchy problem.
