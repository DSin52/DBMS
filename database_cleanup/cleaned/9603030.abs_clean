Preserving the T-duality invariance of the continuum string in its randomlattice regularization uniquely determines the random matrix model potential.For D=0 the duality transformation can be performed explicitly on the matrixaction, and replaces color with flavor; invariance thus requires that the colorand flavor groups be the same.
