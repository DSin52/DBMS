Within the general framework of Liouville string theory, we construct a modelfor quantum D-brane fluctuations in the space-time background through whichlight closed-string states propagate. The model is based on monopole and vortexdefects on the world sheet, which have been discussed previously in a treatmentof 1+1-dimensional black-hole fluctuations in the space-time background, andmakes use of a T-duality transformation to relate formulations with Neumann andDirichlet boundary conditions. In accordance with previous general arguments,we derive an open quantum-mechanical description of this D-brane foam whichembodies momentum and energy conservation and small mean energy fluctuations.Quantum decoherence effects appear at a rate consistent with previousestimates.
