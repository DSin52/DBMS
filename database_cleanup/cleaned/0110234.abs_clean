Recently an interesting conjecture was put forward which states that anyasymptotically de Sitter space whose mass exceeds that of exact de Sitter spacecontains a cosmological singularity. In order to test this mass boundconjecture, we present two solutions. One is the topological de Sitter solutionand the other is its dilatonic deformation. Although the latter is notasymptotically de Sitter space, the two solutions have a cosmological horizonand a cosmological singularity. Using surface counterterm method we compute thequasilocal stress-energy tensor of gravitational field and the mass of the twosolutions. It turns out that this conjecture holds within the two examples.Also we show that the thermodynamic quantities associated with the cosmologicalhorizon of the two solutions obey the first law of thermodynamics. Furthermore,the nonconformal extension of dS/CFT correspondence is discussed.
