changesWe generalize Witten's conjectured formula relating Donaldson andSeiberg-Witten invariants to manifolds of non-simple type, via equivariantlocalization techniques. This approach does not use the theory of non-abelianmonopoles, but works directly on the Donaldson-Witten and Seiberg-Witten modulispaces. We give a formal derivation of Witten's conjecture and itsgeneralization, making use of an infinite dimensional version of the abelianlocalization theorem.
