46 (1996) 162-172We review the derivation and the basic properties of the perturbativeprepotential in N=2 compactifications of the heterotic superstring. We discussthe structure of the perturbative monodromy group and the embedding of rigidlysupersymmetric monodromies associated with enhanced gauge groups, at bothperturbative and non-perturbative level.
