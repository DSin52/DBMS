This entropy hasdifferent behavior in asymptotically free and non--asymptotically freetheories. We find that the transition between the two regimes (from theasymptotically free to the non--asymptotically free) takes place via acontinuous phase transition. For asymptotically free theories there existregimes where the ``temperatures" are negative. In asymptotically free theoriesthere exist maser--like states mostly in the infrared; furthermore, as one goesinto the ultraviolet and more matter states contribute to quantum processes,the quantum field system can shed entropy and cause the formation ofthermodynamically stable {\it entropy--ordered} states. It is shown how theknown heavier quarks can be thus described.
