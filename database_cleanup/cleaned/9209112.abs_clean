We compute N-point correlation functions of non-unitary (2k-1, 2) minimalmatter coupled to 2D quantum gravity on a sphere using the continuum Liouvillefield approach. A gravitational dressing of the matter primary field with theminimum conformal weight is used as the cosmological operator. Our results arein agreement with the correlation functions of the one-matrix model at the k-thcritical point.
