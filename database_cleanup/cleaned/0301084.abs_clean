Title: The one-loop QED in Noncommutative space

Authors: Nguyen Tien Binh

Comments: 27pages,4figures

Returning to the old problems in ordinary QED, by an appropriate extension ofthe dimensional regularization method in noncommutative space we try to providea quite coherent look into NCQED.The renormalisation of theories, the $\beta$function,the vacuum polarisation of photon, the general structure of vertexfermion-photon, the anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) of fermions and thevalidity of Ward identity at the one-loop level are reinvestigated.
