We compute certain 2K+4-point, one-loop couplings in the type IIA stringcompactified on K3 x T^2, which are related to a topological index on thismanifold. Their special feature is that they are sensitive to only short andintermediate BPS multiplets. The couplings derive from underlying prepotentialsG[K](T,U), which can be nicely summed up into a fundamental generatingfunction. In the dual heterotic string on T^6, the amplitudes describenon-perturbative gravitational corrections to K-loop amplitudes due to boundstates of fivebrane instantons with heterotic world-sheet instantons. We argue,as a consequence, that our results also give information about instantonconfigurations in six dimensional Sp(2k) gauge theories on T^6.
