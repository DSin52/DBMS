Conference on Squeezed States and Uncertainty Relations (Taiyuan, Shanxi,China, June 5-8, 1995)Lorentz boosts are squeeze transformations. While these transformations aresimilar to those in squeezed states of light, they are fundamentally differentfrom both physical and mathematical points of view. The difference isillustrated in terms of two coupled harmonic oscillators, and in terms of thecovariant harmonic oscillator formalism.
