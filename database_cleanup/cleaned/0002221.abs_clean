Title: Knot Theory from a Chern-Simons Gauge Theory Point of View

Authors: J. M. F. Labastida

Comments: 18 pages, lecture delivered at the Workshop on Geometry and Physics

held at Medina del Campo, Spain, 1999A brief summary of the development of perturbative Chern-Simons gauge theoryrelated to the theory of knots and links is presented. Emphasis is made on theprogress achieved towards the determination of a general combinatorialexpression for Vassiliev invariants. Its form for all the invariants up toorder four is reviewed, and a table of their values for all prime knots withten crossings is presented.
