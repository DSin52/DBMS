A new non-perturbative approach to quantum theory in curved spacetime and toquantum gravity, based on a generalisation of the Wigner equation, is proposed.Our definition for a Wigner equation differs from what have otherwise beenproposed, and does not imply any approximations. It is a completely exactequation, fully equivalent to the Heisenberg equations of motion. The approachmakes different approximation schemes possible, e.g. it is possible to performa systematic calculation of the quantum effects order by order. An iterativescheme for this is also proposed. The method is illustrated with some simpleexamples and applications. A calculation of the trace of the renormalisedenergy-momentum tensor is done, and the conformal anomaly is thereby related tonon-conservation of a current in d=2 dimensions and a relationship between avector and an axial-vector current in d=4 dimensions.The corresponding ``hydrodynamic equations'' governing the evolution ofmacroscopic quantities are derived by taking appropriate moments. The emphasisis put on the spin-1/2 case, but it is shown how to extend to arbitrary spins.Gravity is treated first in the Palatini formalism, which is not verytractable, and then more successfully in the Ashtekar formalism, where theconstraints lead to infinite order differential equations for the Wignerfunctions.
