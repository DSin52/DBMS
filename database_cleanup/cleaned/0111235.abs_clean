In brane world models of nature, supersymmetry breaking is often isolated ona distant brane in a higher dimensional space. The form of the Kahler potentialin generic string and M-theory brane world backgrounds is shown to give rise totree-level non-universal squark and slepton masses. This results from theexchange of bulk supergravity fields and warping of the internal geometry. Thisis contrary to the notion that bulk locality gives rise to a sequesteredno-scale form of the Kahler potential with vanishing tree-level masses andsolves the supersymmetric flavor problem. As a result, a radiatively generatedanomaly mediated superpartner spectrum is not a generic outcome of thesetheories.
