Title: Strong-Weak Coupling Duality in Quantum Mechanics

Comments: 6 pages, Plain Latex

We present a strong-weak coupling duality for quantum mechanical potentials.Similarly to what happens in quantum field theory, it relates two problems withinverse couplings, leading to a mapping of the strong coupling regime into theweak one, giving information from the nonperturbative region of the parametersspace. It can be used to solve exactly power-type potentials and to extractdeep information about the energy spectra of polynomial ones.
