The notion of a translation map in a quantum principal bundle is introduced.A translation map is then used to prove that the cross sections of a quantumfibre bundle $E(B,V,A)$ associated to a quantum principal bundle $P(B,A)$ arein bijective correspondence with equivariant maps $V\to P$, and that a quantumprincipal bundle is trivial if it admits a cross section which is an algebramap. The vertical automorphisms and gauge transformations of a quantumprincipal bundle are discussed. In particular it is shown that verticalautomorphisms are in bijective correspondence with $\ad$-covariant maps $A\toP$.
