Journal-ref: Nucl. Phys. B448 (1995) 355

The double-scaling limit of the supereigenvalue model is performed in themoment description. This description proves extremely useful for theidentification of the multi-critical points in the space of bosonic andfermionic coupling constants. An iterative procedure for the calculation ofhigher-genus contributions to the free energy and to the multi-loop correlatorsin the double-scaling limit is developed. We present the general structure ofthese quantities at genus g and give explicit results up to and including genustwo.
