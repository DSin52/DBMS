Within a four-dimensional, toroidally compactified heterotic string, weidentify (quantized) charge vectors of electrically charged BPS-saturatedstates (along with the tower of SL(2,Z) related dyonic states), which preserve1/2 of N=4 supersymmetry and become massless along the hyper-surfaces ofenhanced gauge symmetry of the two-torus moduli sub-space. In addition, weidentify charge vectors of the dyonic BPS-saturated states (along with thetower of SL(2,Z) related states), which preserve 1/4 of N=4 supersymmetry, andbecome massless at two points with the maximal gauge symmetry enhancement.
