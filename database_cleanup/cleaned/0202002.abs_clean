Recently, the author has constructed a series of four dimensionalnon-critical string theories with eight supercharges, dual to theories of lightelectric and magnetic charges, for which exact formulas for the central chargeof the space-time supersymmetry algebra as a function of the world-sheetcouplings were obtained. The basic idea was to generalize the old matrix modelapproach, replacing the simple matrix integrals by the four dimensional matrixpath integrals of N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, and the Kazakovcritical points by the Argyres-Douglas critical points. In the present paper,we study qualitatively similar toy path integrals corresponding to the twodimensional N=2 supersymmetric non-linear sigma model with target space CP^nand twisted mass terms. This theory has some very strong similarities with N=2super Yang-Mills, including the presence of critical points in the vicinity ofwhich the large n expansion is IR divergent. The model being exactly solvableat large n, we can study non-BPS observables and give full proofs that doublescaling limits exist and correspond to universal continuum limits. A completecharacterization of the double scaled theories is given. We find evidence fordimensional transmutation of the string coupling in some non-critical stringtheories. We also identify en passant some non-BPS particles that becomemassless at the singularities in addition to the usual BPS states.
