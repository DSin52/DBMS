We study five-dimensional gravity models with non-vanishing background scalarfields which are dual to non-conformal boundary field theories. We develop aprocedure to decouple the graviton fluctuations from the scalar ones and applyit to the simplest case of one scalar field. The quadratic action for thedecoupled scalar fluctuations has a very simple form and can be used to computetwo-point functions. We perform this computation for the two examples ofbackground RG flow recently considered by DeWolfe and Freedman and findphysically reasonable results.
