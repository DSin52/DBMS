An exact conformal model representing a constant magnetic field background inheterotic string theory is explicitly solved in terms of freecreation/annihilation operators. The spectrum of physical states is examinedfor different possible embeddings of the magnetic U(1) subgroup. We find thatan arbitrarily small magnetic field gives rise to an infinite number oftachyonic excitations corresponding to charged vector states of the masslesslevel and to higher level states with large spins and charges.
