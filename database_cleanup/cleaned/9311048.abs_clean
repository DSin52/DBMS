It is shown that new leading ($\al'$) as well as all-order solutions ofString theory can be obtained by taking appropriate singular limits of theknown solutions. We give several leading order solutions for the bosonic aswell as the heterotic string. We then present all-order forms of the previouslyknown two dimensional cosmological solutions. An all-order form for thecosmological solution in three dimensions is also predicted. The physicalimplications of our results are discussed.
