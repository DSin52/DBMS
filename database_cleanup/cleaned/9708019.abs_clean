Functional measures for lattice quantum gravity should agree with theircontinuum counterparts in the weak field, low momentum limit. After showingthat the standard simplicial measure satisfies the above requirement, we provethat a class of recently proposed non-local measures for lattice gravity do notsatisfy such a criterion, already to lowest order in the weak field expansion.We argue therefore that the latter cannot represent acceptable discretefunctional measures for simplicial geometries.
