A generic massive Thirring Model in three space-time dimensions exhibits acorrespondence with a topologically massive bosonized gauge action associatedto a self-duality constraint, and we write down a general expression for thisrelationship.We also generalize this structure to $d$ dimensions, by adopting theso-called doublet approach, recently introduced. In particular, a non-conventional formulation of the bosonization technique in higher dimensions (inthe spirit of $d=3$), is proposed and, as an application, we show how fermionic(Thirring-like) representations for bosonic topologically massive models infour dimensions may be built up.
