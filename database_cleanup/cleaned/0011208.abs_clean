The purpose of this note is to show that W3 algebras originate from anunusual interplay between the breakings of the reparametrization invarianceunder the diffemorphism action on the cotangent bundle of a Riemann surface. Itis recalled how a set of smooth changes of local complex coordinates on thebase space are collectively related to a background within a symplecticframework. The power of the method allows to calculate explicitly some primaryfields whose OPEs generate the algebra as explicit functions in theand new symmetries emerge from the construction. Moreoverer, when primaryflelds are introduced outside of a coordinate description the W3 symmetrybyproducts acquire a good geometrical definition with respect to holomorphicchanges of charts.
