We discuss the canonical quantization of Chern-Simons theory in $2+1$dimensions, minimally coupled to a Dirac spinor field. Gauss's law and thegauge condition, $A_0 = 0$, are implemented by embedding the formulation in anappropriate physical subspace. We find two kinds of charged particle states inthis model. One kind has a rotational anomaly in the form of arbitrary phasesthat develop in $2\pi$ rotations; the other kind rotates ``normally''---i.e.,charged states only change sign in $2\pi$ rotations. The rotational anomaly hasnothing to do with the implementation of Gauss's law. It is possible toinadvertently produce these anomalous states in the process of implementingGauss's law, but it is also possible to implement Gauss's law without producingrotational anomalies. Moreover, states with or without rotational anomaliesobey ordinary Fermi statistics.
