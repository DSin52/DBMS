Title: On n-point correlations in the log-gas at rational temperature

Authors: Andrei Okounkov

Comments: 18 pages, AMS TeX, presentation improved

We obtain a Ha type formula for n-point correlations in the log-gas atrational temperature (or, equivalently, n-point one-time ground statecorrelations in the quantum Calogero-Sutherland model for rational couplingconstant).
