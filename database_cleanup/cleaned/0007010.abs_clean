Title: Tutorial on quasi-sparse eigenvector diagonalization

Comments: 8 pages, uses ws-p8-50x6-00.cls included, to appear in the

proceedings of the International Workshop on Nonperturbative Methods andLattice QCD, Guangzhou, May 2000We review several topics related to the diagonalization of quantum fieldHamiltonians using the quasi-sparse eigenvector (QSE) method.
