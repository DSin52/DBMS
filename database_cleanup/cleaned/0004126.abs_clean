The cosmology of the Randall-Sundrum scenario for a positive tension brane ina 5-D Universe with localized gravity has been studied extensively recently.Here we extend it to more general situations. We consider the time-dependentsituation where the two sides of the brane are different AdS/Schwarzschildspaces. We show that the expansion rate in these models during inflation couldbe larger than in brane worlds with compactified extra dimensions of fixedsize. The enhanced expansion rate could lead to the production of densityperturbations of substantially larger amplitude.
