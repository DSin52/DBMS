Title: Truncations of the D9-brane action and type-I strings

Comments: 15 pages, LaTeX file. Refs. added

The low-energy effective action of type-I superstring theory in tendimensions is obtained performing a truncation of type-IIB supergravity in abackground where D9-branes are present. The open sector corresponds to thefirst order in the low-energy expansion of the D9-brane action in a type-Ibackground. In hep-th/9901055 it was shown that there are two ways ofperforming a type-I truncation of the D9-brane action, and the resultingtruncated action was obtained in a flat background. We extend this result to ageneric type-I background, and argue that the two different truncations are incorrespondence with the open sector of the low-energy effective action of thetwo different consistent ten-dimensional type-I string theories, namely theSO(32) superstring and the $USp(32)$ non-supersymmetric string.
