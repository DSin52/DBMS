We develop the canonical ADM approach to 2+1 dimensional gravity in presenceof point particles. The instantaneous York gauge can be applied for openuniverses or universes with the topology of the sphere. The sequence ofcanonical ADM equations is solved in terms of the conformal factor. A simplederivation is given for the solution of the two body problem. A geometricalcharacterization is given for the apparent singularities occurring in theN-body problem and it is shown how the Garnier hamiltonian system arises in theADM treatment by considering the time development of the conformal factor atthe locations where the extrinsic curvature tensor vanishes.
