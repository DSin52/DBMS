By considering a set of $N$ anyonic oscillators ( non-local, intrinsictwo-dimensional objects interpolating between fermionic and bosonicoscillators) on a two-dimensional lattice, we realize the $SU_q(N)$ quantumalgebra by means of a generalized Schwinger construction. We find that thedeformation parameter $q$ of the algebra is related to the anyonic statisticalparameter $\nu$ by $q=exp({\rm i}\pi\nu)$.
