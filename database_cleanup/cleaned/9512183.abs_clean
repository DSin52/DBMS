Quantum integrable models that possess $N=2$ supersymmetry are investigatedon the half-space. Conformal perturbation theory is used to identify some $N=2$supersymmetric boundary integrable models, and the effective boundaryLandau-Ginzburg actions are constructed. It is found that $N=2$ supersymmetrylargely determines the boundary action in terms of the bulk, and in particular,the boundary bosonic potential is $|W|^2$, where $W$ is the bulksuperpotential. Supersymmetry is also discussed from the perspective of theaffine quantum group symmetry of exact scattering matrices, and exact $N=2$supersymmetry preserving boundary reflection matrices are described.
