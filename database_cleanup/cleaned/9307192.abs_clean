Title: Quantum group and Manin plane related to a coloured braid group

representationComments: 20 Pages

By considering `coloured' braid group representation we have obtained aquantum group, which reduces to the standard $GL_q(2)$ and $GL_{p,q}(2)$ casesat some particular limits of the `colour' parameters. In spite of quitecomplicated nature, all of these new quantum group relations can be expressedneatly in the Heisenberg-Weyl form, for a nontrivial choice of the basiselements. Furthermore, it is possible to associate invariant Manin planes,parametrised by the `colour' variables, with such quantum group structure.
