We show that U(N) Yang-Mills theory on noncommutative Minkowski space-timecan be renormalized, in a BRS invariant way, at the one-loop level, bymultiplicative dimensional renormalization of its coupling constant, its gaugeparameter and its fields. It is shown that the Slavnov-Taylor equation, thegauge-fixing equation and the ghost equation hold, up to order $\hbar$, for theMS renormalized noncommutative U(N) Yang-Mills theory. We give the value of thepole part of every 1PI diagram which is UV divergent.
