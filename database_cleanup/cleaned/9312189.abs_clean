We study a topological Landau-Ginzburg model with superpotential W(X)=X^{-1}.This is argued to be equivalent to c=1 string theory compactified at theself-dual radius. We compute the tree-level correlation function of N tachyonsin this theory and show their agreement with matrix-model results. We alsodiscuss the nature of contact terms, the perturbed superpotential and the flowof operators in the small phase space. The role of gravitational descendants inthis theory is examined, and the tachyon two-point function in genus 1 isobtained using a conjectured modification of the gravitational recursionrelations.
