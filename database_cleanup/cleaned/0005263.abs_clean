Participants of this workshop pursue the old Neutrino Theory of Lightvigorously. Other physicists have long ago abandoned it, because it lacks gaugeinvariance. In the recent Quantum Induction (QI), all basic Bose fields${\mathcal B}^{P}$ are local limits of quantum fields composed of Dirac's$\Psi$ (for leptons and quarks). The induced field equations of QI evendetermine all the interactions of those ${\mathcal B}^{P}$. Thus a precisegauge invariance and other physical consequences are unavoidable. They includethe absence of divergencies, the exclusion of Pauli terms, a prediction of theHiggs mass and a `minimal' Quantum Gravity.As we find in this paper, however, photons can't be bound states whileMaxwell's potential $A_{\mu}$ contains all basic Dirac fields except those ofneutrinos.
