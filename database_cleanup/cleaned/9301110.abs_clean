Title: Neutron Acceleration in Uniform Electromagnetic Fields

Authors: J. Anandan and C. R. Hagen

Comments: 11 pages

The question as to whether neutron acceleration can occur in uniformelectromagnetic fields is examined. Although such an effect has been predictedusing the canonical equations of motion some doubt has been raised recently asto whether it is in principle observable for a spin 1/2 particle. To resolvethis issue a gedanken experiment is proposed and analyzed using a wave packetconstruction for the neutron beam. By allowing arbitrary orientation for theneutron spin as well as for the electric and magnetic fields a non vanishingacceleration of the center of the neutron wave packet is found which confirmsthe predictions of the canonical formalism.
