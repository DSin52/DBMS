Solution is presented to the simplest problem about the vacuum backreactionon a pair creating source. The backreaction effect is nonanalytic in thecoupling constant and restores completely the energy conservation law. Thevacuum changes the kinematics of motion like relativity theory does and imposesa new upper bound on the velocity of the source.
