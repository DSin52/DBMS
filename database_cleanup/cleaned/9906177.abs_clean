Following the Papapetrou-Dixon-Wald procedure we derive the equation ofmotion for a dilatonic test body(probe) with the dilaton coupling $\alpha ={\sqrt {p/(2+p)}}$ in four dimension. Since the dilatonic freedom sometimescomes from extra dimensions, it is best to derive the EOM by a dimensionalreduction from $(p+4)-$dimensions. We discuss about the force balance up to thegravitational spin-spin interactions via the probe technique. The force balancecondition yields the saturation of a Bogomol'nyi bound and the gyromagneticratio of the test body.
