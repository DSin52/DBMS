We demonstrate that an action proposed by A. Khoudeir and N. R. Pantoja in{\sl Phys. Rev.} {\bf D53}, 5974 (1996) for endowing Maxwell theory withmanifest electric--magnetic duality symmetry contains, besides the Maxwellfield, additional propagating vector degrees of freedom. Hence it cannot beconsidered as a duality symmetric action for a {\it single} abelian gaugefield.
