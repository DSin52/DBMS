We discuss the stringy properties of high-energy QCD using its hiddenintegrability in the Regge limit and on the light-cone. It is shown thatmulti-colour QCD in the Regge limit belongs to the same universality class assuperconformal $\cal{N}$=2 SUSY YM with $N_f=2N_c$ at the strong couplingorbifold point. The analogy with integrable structure governing the low energysector of $\cal{N}$=2 SUSY gauge theories is used to develop the brane picturefor the Regge limit. In this picture the scattering process is described by asingle M2 brane wrapped around the spectral curve of the integrable spin chainand unifying hadrons and reggeized gluons involved in the process. Newquasiclassical quantization conditions for the complex higher integrals ofmotion are suggested which are consistent with the $S-$duality of themulti-reggeon spectrum. The derivation of the anomalous dimensions of thelowest twist operators is formulated in terms of the Riemann surfaces
