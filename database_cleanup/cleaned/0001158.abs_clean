In a remarkable variety of contexts appears the modular data associated tofinite groups. And yet, compared to the well-understood affine algebra modulardata, the general properties of this finite group modular data has been poorlyexplored. In this paper we undergo such a study. We identify some senses inwhich the finite group data is similar to, and different from, the affine data.We also consider the data arising from a cohomological twist, and write down,explicitly in terms of quantities associated directly with the finite group,the modular S and T matrices for a general twist, for what appears to be thefirst time in print.
