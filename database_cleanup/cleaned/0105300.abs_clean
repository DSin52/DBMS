The estimation of the cosmological constant in inflationary Brane New Worldmodels is done. It is shown that basically it is quite large, of the same orderas in anomaly-driven inflation. However, for some fine-tuning of bulkgravitational constant and AdS scale parameter $l^2$ it may be reduced tosufficiently small value. Bulk higher derivative AdS gravity with quantum branematter may also serve as the model where small positive cosmological constantoccurs.
