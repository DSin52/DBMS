Title: The Monopole Dominance in QCD

Comments: plain Latex, 14 pages

A projection (gauge) independent formulation of the monopole dominance,discovered in lattice QCD for the maximal abelian projection, is given. A newdynamical abelian projection of continuum QCD, which does not rely on anyexplicit gauge condition imposed on gauge fields, is proposed. Under theassumption that the results of numerical simulations holds in the continuumlimit, the monopole dominance is proved for the dynamical abelian projection.The latter enables us to develop an effective scalar field theory for dominant(monopole) configurations of gauge fields. The approach is manifestly gauge andLorentz invariant.
