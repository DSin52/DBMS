Conference "Problems of Quantum Field Theory" (Alushta-96) JINR E2-96-369,Dubna, Russia, 1996the fermionic vacuum attains nontrivial quantum numbers in the background of amagnetic vortex even in the case when the spatial region of nonvanishingexternal field strength is excluded. The dependence of the vacuum quantumnumbers on the value of the vortex flux and the choice of the condition on theboundary of the excluded region is determined.
