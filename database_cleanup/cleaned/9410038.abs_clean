Title: Gauge theory and renormalization (Erice, August 1994)

Comments: Minor, cosmetic changes. 19 pages. Plain TeX plus 6 figures in

PostScriptEarly developments leading to renormalizable non-Abelian gauge theories forthe weak, electromagnetic and strong interactions, are discussed from apersonal viewpoint. They drastically improved our view of the role of fieldtheory, symmetry and topology, as well as other branches of mathematics, in theworld of elementary particles.
