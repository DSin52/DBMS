We consider N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory formulated in terms of N=2superfields in harmonic superspace. Using the background field method we definemanifestly gauge invariant and N=2 supersymmetric effective action depending onN=2 strength superfields and develop a general procedure for its calculation inone-loop approximation. Explicit form for this effective action is found forthe case of SU(2) gauge group broken down to U(1).
