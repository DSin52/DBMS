By a mapping to the bosonic string theory, we present an exact solution tothe O(26) sigma model coupled to 2-D quantum gravity. In particular, we obtainthe exact gravitational dressing to the various matter operators classified bythe irreducible representations of O(26). We also derive the exact form of thegravitationally modified beta function for the original coupling constant$e^2$. The relation between our exact solution and the asymptotic solutiongiven in ref[3] is discussed in various aspects.
