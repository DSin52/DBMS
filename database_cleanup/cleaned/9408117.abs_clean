It has been reported that, within the hard-thermal-loop resummation scheme,the production rate of soft real photons from a hot quark-gluon plasma exhibitsunscreened mass singularities. We show that still higher-order resummationsscreen the mass singularities and obtain the finite soft-photon production rateto leading order at logarithmic accuracy ${\cal O} (\alpha \alpha_s \ln^2\alpha_s)$.
