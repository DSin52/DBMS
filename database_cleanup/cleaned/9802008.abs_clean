Title: Non-thermalizability of a Quantum Field Theory

Comments: 9 pages, latex. no figures

The problem of understanding the role of large gauge transformations inthermal field theories has recently inspired a number of studies of a onedimensional field theory. Such work has led to the conclusion that gaugeinvariance is restored only when the entire perturbation expansion can besummed. A careful reexamination of that model is shown, h0owever, to lead tovastly different conclusions when the constraint implied by the field equationsis explicitly taken into account. In particular it is found that none of therelevant propagators has any temperature dependence and that the effectiveaction is essentially trivial. A generalization of the model to include bosonsas well as fermions is also solved with qualitatively identical results beingobtained.
