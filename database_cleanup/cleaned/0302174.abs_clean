We analyze $N=2,1,0$ vacua of type IIB string theory on $K3\times T^2/Z_2$ inpresence of three-form fluxes from a four dimensional supergravity viewpoint.The quaternionic geometry of the $K3$ moduli space together with the specialgeometry of the NS and R-R dilatons and of the $T^2$-complex structure moduliplay a crucial role in the analysis. The introduction of fluxes corresponds toa particular gauging of N=2, D=4 supergravity. Our results agree with a recentwork of Tripathy and Trivedi. The present formulation shows the power ofsupergravity in the study of effective theories with broken supersymmetry.
