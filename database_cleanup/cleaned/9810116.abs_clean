We discuss Born-Infeld on the noncommutative two-torus as a description ofcompactified string theory. We show that the resulting theory, including thefluctuations, is manifestly invariant under the T-duality group SO(2,2;Z). TheBPS mass even has a full SL(3,Z)xSL(2,Z) U-duality symmetry. The directidentification of the noncommutative parameter \theta with the B-field modulushowever seems to be problematic at finite volume.
