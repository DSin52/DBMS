Comments: To Appear in the Proceedings of the 70th Meeting of Mathematicians

and Physicists at Strassbourg, June 2002; ed. by V. Turaev and T. WurzbacherMathematical PhysicsQuantum fluctuations of some systems vanish not only in the limit $\hbar\to0$, but also as some other parameters (such as $1\over N$, the inverse of thenumber of `colors' of a Yang-Mills theory) vanish. These lead to new classicallimits that are often much better approximations to the quantum theory. Weatomic physics as well as the limit of large spatial dimension. Then we presentan approach of the Hecke operators on modular forms inspired by these ideas ofquantum mechanics. It explains in a simple way why the spectra of theseoperators tend to the spectrum of random matrices for large weight for themodular forms.
