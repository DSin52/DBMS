In this note we present a operator formulation of gauge theories in a quantumphase space which is specified by a operator algebra. For simplicity we workwith the Heisenberg algebra. We introduce the notion of the derivative(transport) and Wilson line (parallel transport) which enables us to constructa gauge theory in a simple way. We illustrate the formulation by a discussionof the Higgs mechanism and comment on the large N masterfield.
