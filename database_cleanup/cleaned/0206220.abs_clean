In the presence of compact dimensions massive solutions of General Relativitymay take one of several forms including the black-hole and the black-string,the simplest relevant background being R^{3+1} * S^1. It is shown how Morsetheory places constraints on the qualitative features of the phase diagram, anda minimalistic diagram is suggested which describes a first order transitionwhose only stable phases are the uniform string and the black-hole. The diagramcalls for a topology changing ``merger'' transition in which the black-holeevolves continuously into an unstable black-string phase. As evidence a localmodel for the transition is presented in which the cone over S^2 * S^2 plays acentral role. Horizon cusps do not appear as precursors to black hole merger. Ageneralization to higher dimensions finds that whereas the cone has a tachyonfunction for d=5, its stability depends interestingly on the dimension - it isunstable for d<10, and stable for d>10.
