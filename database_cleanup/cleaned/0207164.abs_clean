The origin of the anomalies is analyzed. It is shown that they are due to thefact that the generators of the symmetry do not leave invariant the domain ofdefinition of the Hamiltonian and then a term, normally forgotten in theHeisenberg equation, gives an extra contribution responsible for the nonconservation of the charges. This explanation is equivalent to that of theFujikawa in the path integral formalism. Finally, this approach is applied tothe conformal symmetry breaking in two-dimensional quantum mechanics.
