A generalized Chan-Paton construction is presented which is analogous to thetensor product of vector bundles. To this end open string theories areconsidered where the space of states decomposes into sectors whose product isdescribed by a semigroup. The cyclicity properties of the open string theoryare used to prove that the relevant semigroups are direct unions of Brandtsemigroups. The known classification of Brandt semigroups then implies that allsuch theories have the structure of a theory with Dirichlet-branes. We alsodescribe the structure of an arbitrary orientifold group, and show that thetruncation to the invariant subspace defines a consistent open string theory.Finally, we analyze the possible orientifold projections of a theory withseveral kinds of branes.
