Inflationary theory is already 20 years old, and it is impossible to describeall of its versions and implications in a short talk. I will concentrate onseveral subjects which I believe to be most important. First of all, I willgive a brief review of the first versions of inflationary theory, fromStarobinsky model to new inflation. Then I will describe chaotic inflation, thetheory of quantum fluctuations and density perturbations, the theory of eternalinflation, and recent observational data. In the second part of the talk I willdiscuss the recently proposed ekpyrotic scenario and argue that in its presentform it does not provide a viable alternative to inflation.
