We show that the connection between partial breaking of supersymmetry andnonlinear actions is not accidental and has to do with constraints that leaddirectly to nonlinear actions of the Born-Infeld type. We develop a constrainedsuperfield approach that gives a universal way of deriving and using theseactions. In particular, we find the manifestly supersymmetric form of theaction of the 3-brane in 6-dimensional space in terms of N=1 superfields byusing the tensor multiplet as a tool. We explain the relation between theBorn-Infeld action and the model of partial N=2 supersymmetry breaking by adual D-term. We represent the Born-Infeld action in a novel form quadratic inthe gauge field strengths by introducing two auxiliary complex scalar fields;this makes duality covariance and the connection with the N=1 supersymmetricextension of the action very transparent. We also suggest a general procedurefor deriving manifestly duality symmetric actions, explaining in a systematicway relations between previously discussed Lorentz covariant and noncovariantactions.
