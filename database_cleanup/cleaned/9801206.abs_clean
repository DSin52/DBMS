The bosonic actions for M2, D3 and M5 branes in their own d-dimensionalnear-horizon background are given in a manifestly SO(p+1,2) x SO(d-p-1)invariant form (p=2,3,5). These symmetries result from a breakdown of ISO(d,2)(with d=10 for D3 and d=11 for M2 and M5) symmetry by the Wess-Zumino term andconstraints. The new brane actions, reduce after gauge-fixing and solvingconstraints to (p+1) dimensional interacting field theories with a non-linearlyrealized SO(p+1,2) conformal invariance. We also present an interactingtwo-dimensional conformal field theory on a D-string in the near-horizongeometry of a D1+D5 configuration.
