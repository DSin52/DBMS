Title: Noncommutative instantons revisited

Authors: Nikita A. Nekrasov

Comments: 24pp. uses sprocl.sty

We find a new gauge in which U(1) noncommutative instantons are explicitlynon-singular on the whole noncommutative R^4, thus resolving the previousconfusions of the author. We start with the pedagogical introduction to thenoncommutative gauge theories.
