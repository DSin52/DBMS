In 1973 two Salam prot\'{e}g\'{e}s (Derek Capper and the author) discoveredthat the conformal invariance under Weyl rescalings of the metric tensor$g_{\mu\nu}(x)\rightarrow\Omega^2(x)g_{\mu\nu}(x)$ displayed by classicalmassless field systems in interaction with gravity no longer survives in thequantum theory. Since then these Weyl anomalies have found a variety ofapplications in black hole physics, cosmology, string theory and statisticalmechanics. We give a nostalgic review.
