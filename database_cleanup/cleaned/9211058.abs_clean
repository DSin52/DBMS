by Mark Bowick at the Erice Workshop on "String Quantum Gravity and Physicsat the Planck Energy Scale", June 92 and at the First Iberian Meeting onGravity, Evora, Portugal, September 92We examine a model of non-self-avoiding, fluctuating surfaces as a candidatecontinuum string theory of surfaces in three dimensions. This model describesDynamically Triangulated Random Surfaces embedded in three dimensions with anextrinsic curvature dependent action. We analyze, using Monte Carlosimulations, the dramatic crossover behaviour of several observables whichcharacterize the geometry of these surfaces. We then critically discuss whetherour observations are indicative of a phase transition.
