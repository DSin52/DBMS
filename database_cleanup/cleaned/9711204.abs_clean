Vienna, Aug 97Assume that in a fundamental theory of quantum gravity spatial information isencoded through elements x_i of an associative, complex and possiblynoncommutative algebra in which the involution acts as x^*_i = x_i. Withoutfurther assumptions it can be shown that such x_i can describe only threeIII. a finite lower bound on the uncertainty in positions, as e.g. described ina stringy uncertainty relation. All other cases are mixtures of the three. Webriefly review recent results on the case III short distance structure, inparticular its ultraviolet regularity and a possible new mechanism that turnsthe external degrees of freedom lost through the UV-cutoff into internaldegrees of freedom.
