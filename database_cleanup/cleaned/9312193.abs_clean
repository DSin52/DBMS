Title: Description of moduli space of projective structures via fat graphs

Comments: 17 pages, 11 pictures (included)

We give an elementary explicit construction of cell decomposition of themoduli space of projective structures on a two dimensional surface analogous tothe decomposition of Penner/Strebel for moduli space of complex structures. Therelations between projective structures and $PGL(2,{\bf C})$ flat connectionsare also described. (in the revised version uuencoded pictures are madeprintable)
