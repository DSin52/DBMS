reducedNo positive result has been obtained on the magnetic monopoles search. Thisallows to consider different theoretical approaches as the proposed in thispaper, developed in the framework of the Einstein General Relativity. Theproperties of second rank skew-symmetrical fields are the basis ofelectromagnetic theories. In the space-time the Hodge duality of these fieldsis narrowly related with the rotations in the SO(2) group. An axiomaticapproach to a dual electromagnetic theory is presented. The main result of thisparallel and the perpendicular. The parallel part is easily integrated on theLagrangian approach, while some problems appears with the perpendicular part. Asolution with the parallel part alone is found, it generates a non-standardmodel of magnetic monopoles neutral to the electric charges.
