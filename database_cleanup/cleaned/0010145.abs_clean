Title: Holographic Vacuum Energy

Authors: Scott Thomas

Comments: 11 pages

Gravitational holography is argued to render the cosmological constant stableagainst divergent quantum corrections. This provides a technically naturalsolution to the cosmological constant problem. Evidence for quantum stabilityof the cosmological constant is illustrated in a number of examples including,bulk descriptions in terms of delocalized degrees of freedom, boundary screendescriptions on stretched horizons, and non-supersymmetric conformal fieldtheories as dual descriptions of anti-de Sitter space. In an expandinguniverse, holographic quantum contributions to the stress-energy tensor areargued to be at most of order the energy density of the dominant mattercomponent.
