A detailed description of the infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of star-gaugetransformations in noncommutative Yang-Mills theory is presented. Variousdescriptions of this algebra are given in terms of inner automorphisms of theunderlying deformed algebra of functions on spacetime, of deformed symplecticdiffeomorphisms, of the infinite unitary Lie algebra, and of the algebra ofcompact operators on a quantum mechanical Hilbert space. The spacetime andstring interpretations are also elucidated.
