We describe in detail the solution of type IIB superstring theory in themaximally supersymmetric plane-wave background with constant null Ramond-Ramond5-form field strength. The corresponding light-cone Green-Schwarz action foundin hep-th/0112044 is quadratic in both bosonic and fermionic coordinates. Wefind the spectrum of the light-cone Hamiltonian and the string representationof the supersymmetry algebra. The superstring Hamiltonian has a``harmonic-oscillator'' form in both the string-oscillator and the zero-modeparts and thus has discrete spectrum in all 8 transverse directions. We analyzethe structure of the zero-mode sector of the theory, establishing the precisecorrespondence between the lowest-lying ``massless'' string states and the typeIIB supergravity fluctuation modes in the plane-wave background. The zero-modespectrum has certain similarity to the supergravity spectrum in AdS_5 x S^5 ofwhich the plane-wave background is a special limit. We also compare theplane-wave string spectrum with expected form of the light-cone gauge spectrumof superstring in AdS_5 x S^5.
