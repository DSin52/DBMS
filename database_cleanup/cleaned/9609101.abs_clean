It is shown that the physical ``quark number'' charges which appear in thecentral charge of the supersymmetry algebra of $N=2$ supersymmetric QCD cantake irrational values and depend non trivially on the Higgs expectation value.This gives a physical interpretation of the constant shifts which the``electric'' and ``magnetic'' variables $a_D$ and $a$ undergo when encircling asingularity, and show that duality in this model is truly anelectric-magnetic-quark number duality. Also included is a computation of themonodromy matrices directly in the microscopic theory.
