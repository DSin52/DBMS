Classical string cosmology consists of two branches related to each other by(FRW) branch. Curvature and string coupling singularity separates the twobranches, hence posing `graceful exit problem' to super-inflationary stringcosmology. In an exactly soluble two-dimensional compactification model it isshown that quantum back reaction retards curvature and string coupling growthand connects the super-inflation branch to the FRW branch without encounteringa singularity. This may offer an attractive solution to the `graceful exitproblem' in string inflationary cosmology.
