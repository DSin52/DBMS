The recent developments in string theory suggest that the space-timecoordinates should be generalized to non-commuting matrices. Postulating thissuggestion as the fundamental geometrical principle, we formulate a candidatefor covariant second quantized RNS superstrings as a topological field theoryin two dimensions. Our construction is a natural non-Abelian extension of theRNS string. It also naturally leads to a model with manifest 11-dimensionalcovariance, which we conjecture to be a formulation of M theory. Thenon-commuting space-time coordinates of the strings are further generalized tonon-commuting anti-symmetric tensors. The usual space-time picture and the freesuperstrings appear only in certain special phases of the model. We derive asimple set of algebraic equations, which determine the moduli space of ourmodel. We test some aspects of our conjectual M theory for the case ofcompactification on $T^2$.
