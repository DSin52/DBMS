We show explicitly by the heuristic and practical arguments that for $N = 2$supersymmetry (SUSY) a SUSY invariant relation between component fields of avector supermultiplet of linear SUSY and Nambu-Goldstone fermions of theVolkov-Akulov model of nonlinear SUSY is written by using only three arbitrarydimensionless parameters, which can be recasted as the vacuum expectationvalues of auxiliary fields in the vector supermultiplet.
