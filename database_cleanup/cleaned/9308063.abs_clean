By introducing two kinds of gaugeon fields, we extend Yokoyama's Type Igaugeon formalism for quantum electrodynamics. The theory admits a q-numbergauge transformation by which we can shift the gauge parameter into arbitrarynumerical value; whereas in the original theory we cannot change the sign ofthe parameter. The relation to the Type II theory is also discussed.
