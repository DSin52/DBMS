We investigate the low energy dynamics of N=1 supersymmetric SO(N) gaugetheories with a single symmetric tensor matter field. These theories exhibitnon-trivial matching of global 't Hooft anomalies at the origin of modulispace. We argue that their quantum moduli spaces possess distinct Higgs andconfining branches which touch at the origin in an interacting non-AbelianCoulomb phase. The matching of anomalies between microscopic degrees of freedomand colorless moduli therefore appears to be coincidental. We discuss a formalmathematical relation between the SO(N) model and an analogous Sp(2N) theorywith a single antisymmetric matter field which provides an explanation for theanomaly matching coincidence.
