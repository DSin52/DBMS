Title: Supersymmetric Index Of Three-Dimensional Gauge Theory

Authors: Edward Witten

In N=1 super Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions, with a simplegauge group $G$ and a Chern-Simons interaction of level $k$, the supersymmetricindex $\Tr (-1)^F$ can be computed by making a relation to a pure Chern-Simonstheory or microscopically by an explicit Born-Oppenheimer calculation on atwo-torus. The result shows that supersymmetry is unbroken if $|k|\geq h/2$(with $h$ the dual Coxeter number of $G$) and suggests that dynamicalsupersymmetry breaking occurs for $|k|<h/2$. The theories with large $|k|$ aremassive gauge theories whose universality class is not fully described by thestandard criteria.
