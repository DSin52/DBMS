Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) theory is a theory with twoobserver-independent scales, of velocity and mass (or length). Such a theoryhas been proposed by Amelino--Camelia as a kinematic structure which mayunderline quantum theory of relativity. Recently another theory of this kindhas been proposed by Magueijo and Smolin. In this paper we show that both thesetheories can be understood as particular bases of the $\kappa$--Poincar\'etheory based on quantum (Hopf) algebra. This observation makes it possible toconstruct the space-time sector of Magueijo and Smolin DSR. We also show howthis construction can be extended to the whole class of DSRs. It turns out thatfor all such theories the structure of space-time commutators is the same. Thisresults lead us to the claim that physical predictions of properly defined DSRtheory should be independent of the choice of basis.
