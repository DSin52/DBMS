A split dimensional regularization, which was introduced for the Coulombgauge by Leibbrandt and Williams, is used to regularize the spurioussingularities of Yang-Mills theory in the temporal gauge. Typical one-loopsplit dimensionally regularized temporal gauge integrals, and hence therenormalization structure of the theory are shown to be the same as thosecalculated with some nonprincipal-value prescriptions.
