We prove a determinantal formula for quantities related to the problem ofenumeration of (semi-) meanders, namely the topologically inequivalent planarconfigurations of non-self-intersecting loops crossing a given (half-) linethrough a given number of points. This is done by the explicit Gram-Schmidtorthogonalization of certain bases of subspaces of the Temperley-Lieb algebra.
