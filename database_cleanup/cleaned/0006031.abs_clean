This is a review of the constrained dynamical structure of Poincare gaugetheory which concentrates on the basic canonical and gauge properties of thetheory, including the identification of constraints, gauge symmetries andconservation laws. As an interesting example of the general approach we discussthe teleparallel formulation of general relativity.
