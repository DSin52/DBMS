We show how to construct path integrals for quantum mechanical systems wherethe space of configurations is a general non-compact symmetric space.Associated with this path integral is a perturbation theory which respects theglobal structure of the system. This perturbation expansion is evaluated for asimple example and leads to a new exactly soluble model. This work is a steptowards the construction of a strong coupling perturbation theory for quantumgravity.
