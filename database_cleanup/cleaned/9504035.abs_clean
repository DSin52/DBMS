In this paper we formulate an integrable model on the simple cubic lattice.The $N$ -- valued spin variables of the model belong to edges of the lattice.The Boltzmann weights of the model obey the vertex type Tetrahedron Equation.In the thermodynamic limit our model is equivalent to the Bazhanov -- BaxterModel. In the case when $N=2$ we reproduce the Korepanov's and Hietarinta'ssolutions of the Tetrahedron equation as some special cases.
