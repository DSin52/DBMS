Certain four-dimensional $N=4$ supersymmetric theories have special vacua inwhich massive charged vector supermultiplets become massless, resulting in anenhanced non-abelian gauge symmetry. We show here that any two $N=4$ theorieshaving the same Bogomolnyi spectrum at corresponding points of their modulispaces have the same enhanced symmetry groups. In particular, the $K_3\timesT^2$ compactified type II string is argued to have the same enhanced symmetrygroups as the $T^6$-compactified heterotic string, giving further evidence forour conjecture that these two string theories are equivalent. A feature of theenhanced symmetry phase is that for every electrically charged state whose masstends to zero as an enhanced symmetry point is approached, there aremagnetically charged and dyonic states whose masses also tend to zero, a resultthat applies equally to N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. These extranon-perturbative massless states in the $K_3$ compactification result from$p$-branes wrapping around collapsed homology two-cycles of $K_3$. Finally, weshow how membrane `wrapping modes' lead to symmetry enhancement in D=11supergravity, providing further evidence that the $K_3$-compactified D=11supergravity is the effective field theory of the strong coupling limit of the$T^3$-compactified heterotic string.
