SU(4) Einstein-Yang-Mills theory possesses sequences of static sphericallysymmetric globally regular and black hole solutions. Considering solutions witha purely magnetic gauge field, based on the 4-dimensional embedding of $su(2)$in $su(4)$, these solutions are labelled by the node numbers $(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ ofthe three gauge field functions $u_1$, $u_2$ and $u_3$. We classify the varioustypes of solutions in sequences and determine their limiting solutions. Thelimiting solutions of the sequences of neutral solutions carry charge, and thelimiting solutions of the sequences of charged solutions carry higher charge.For sequences of black hole solutions with node structure $(n,j,n)$ and$(n,n,n)$, several distinct branches of solutions exist up to critical valuesof the horizon radius. We determine the critical behaviour for these sequencesof solutions. We also consider SU(4) Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton theory andshow that these sequences of solutions are analogous in most respects to thecorresponding SU(4) Einstein-Yang-Mills sequences of solutions.
