We study the restrictions imposed by cancellation of the tadpoles for two,three, and four-form gauge fields in string theory, M-theory and F-theorycompactified to two, three and four dimensions, respectively. For a large classof supersymmetric vacua, turning on a sufficient number of strings, membranesand three-branes, respectively, can cancel the tadpoles, and preservesupersymmetry. However, there are cases where the tadpole cannot be removed inthis way, either because the tadpole is fractional, or because of its sign. ForM-theory and F-theory compactifications, we also explore the relation of themembranes and three-branes to the nonperturbative space-time superpotential.
