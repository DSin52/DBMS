Title: Exact String Solutions and the Open String - D-Brane System in

Non-Constant Background Fields IComments: LaTeX, 10 pages, no figures; V2

references rewritten, report-no addedNew exact string solutions in non-constant background fields are found and itis shown that some of them are compatible with the boundary conditions for theopen string - D-brane system. Extension of the constraint algebra is proposedand discussed.
