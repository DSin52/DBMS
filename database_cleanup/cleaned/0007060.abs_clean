We analyze the thermodynamical properties of brane-worlds, with a focus onthe second model of Randall and Sundrum. We point out that during aninflationary phase on the brane, black holes will tend to be thermallybrane-world system evolve towards a configuration of thermal equilibrium? Toanswer this, we generalize the second Randall-Sundrum scenario to allow fornon-static bulk regions on each side of the brane-world. Explicitly, we takethe bulk to be a {\it Vaidya-AdS} metric, which describes the gravitationalcollapse of a spherically symmetric null dust fluid in Anti-de Sitterspacetime. Using the background subtraction technique to calculate theEuclidean action, we argue that at late times a sufficiently large black holewill relax to a point of thermal equilibrium with the brane-world environment.These results have interesting implications for early-universe cosmology.
