We investigate Aharonov-Bohm scattering in a theory in which charged bosonicmatter fields are coupled to topologically massive electrodynamics andtopologically massive gravity. We demonstrate that, at one-loop order, thetransmuted spins in this theory are related to the ones of ordinaryChern-Simons gauge theory in the same way that theKnizhnik-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov formula relates the Liouville-dressed conformalweights of primary operators to the bare weights in two-dimensional conformalfield theories. We remark on the implications of this connection betweentwo-dimensional conformal field theories and three-dimensional gauge andgravity theories for a topological membrane reformulation of strings. We alsodiscuss some features of the gravitational analog of the Aharonov-Bohm effect.
