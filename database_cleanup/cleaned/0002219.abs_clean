The perturbed conformal field theories corresponding to the massive SymmetricSpace sine-Gordon soliton theories are identified by calculating the centralcharge of the unperturbed conformal field theory and the conformal dimension ofthe perturbation. They are described by an action with a positive-definitekinetic term and a real potential term bounded from below, their equations ofmotion are non-abelian affine Toda equations and, moreover, they exhibit a massgap. The unperturbed CFT corresponding to the compact symmetric space G/G_0 iseither the WZNW action for G_0 or the gauged WZNW action for a coset of theform G_0/U(1)^p. The quantum integrability of the theories that describeperturbations of a WZNW action, named Split models, is established by showingthat they have quantum conserved quantities of spin +3 and -3. Together withthe already known results for the other massive theories associated with thenon-abelian affine Toda equations, the Homogeneous sine-Gordon theories, thissupports the conjecture that all the massive Symmetric Space sine-Gordontheories will be quantum integrable and, hence, will admit a factorizableS-matrix. The general features of the soliton spectrum are discussed, and someexplicit soliton solutions for the Split models are constructed. In general,the solitons will carry both topological charges and abelian Noether charges.Moreover, the spectrum is expected to include stable and unstable particles.
