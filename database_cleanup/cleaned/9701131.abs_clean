We herein set forth intrinsically four-dimensional string solutions andanalyze some of its properties. The solutions are constructed as gauged WZWmodels of the coset $SO(2,2)/SO(2)\times SO(1,1)$. We recover backgroundshaving metric and antisymmetric tensors, dilaton fields and two electromagneticfields. The theories describe anisotropically expanding and static universesfor some time values.
