The Hopf algebra of Feynman diagrams, analyzed by A.Connes and D.Kreimer, isconsidered from the perspective of the theory of effective actions andgeneralized $\tau$-functions, which describes the action of diffeomorphism andshift groups in the moduli space of coupling constants. These considerationsprovide additional evidence of the hidden group (integrable) structure behindthe standard formalism of quantum field theory.
