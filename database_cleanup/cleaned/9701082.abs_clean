We study axion-dilaton cosmologies derived from the low-energy stringeffective action. We present the classical homogeneousFriedmann-Robertson-Walker solutions and derive the semi-classical perturbationspectra in the dilaton, axion and moduli fields in the pre-Big Bang scenario.By constructing the unique S-duality invariant field perturbations for theaxion and dilaton fields we derive S-duality invariant solutions, valid whenthe axion field is time-dependent as well as in a dilaton-vacuum cosmology.Whereas the dilaton and moduli fields have steep blue perturbation spectra(with spectral index n=4) we find that the axion spectrum depends upon theexpansion rate of the internal dimensions (0.54<n<4) which allowsscale-invariant (n=1) spectra. We note that for n<1 the metric is non-singularin the conformal frame in which the axion is minimally coupled.
