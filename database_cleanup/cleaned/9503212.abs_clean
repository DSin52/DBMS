It is argued that many linear (0,2) models flow in the infrared toconformally invariant solutions of string theory. The strategy in the argumentis to show that the effective space-time superpotential must vanish becausethere is no place where it can have a pole. This conclusion comes from eitherof two different analyses, in which the Kahler class or the complex structureof the gauge bundle is varied, while keeping everything else fixed. In theformer case, we recover from the linear sigma model the usual simple pole inthe ${\bf \bar {27}}^3$ Yukawa coupling but show that an analogous pole doesnot arise in the couplings of gauge singlet modes. In the latter case, adimension count shows that the world-sheet instanton sum does not ``see'' thesingularities of the gauge bundle and hence cannot have a pole.
