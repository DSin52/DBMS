We show that combining the spatial noncommutative SYM limit and Lorentztransformation, one can obtain a well-behaved light-like noncommutative SYMlimit. The light-like noncommutative SYM is unitary. When the boost velocity isfinite, the resulting theory with space-time noncommutativity is unitary aswell. The light-like noncommutative SYM limit can also be approached bycombining the noncommutative open string theory limit and Lorentztransformation. Along this line, we obtain the supergravity dual for thelight-like noncommutative SYM, which is the same as the one acquired using adifferent method. As a comparison, the supergravity duals for the ordinary SYM,spatial noncommutative SYM and the noncommutative open string theories aregiven as well, in an infinitely-boosted frame with finite momentum density,which are the decoupling limits of bound states (Dp, W), (D($p-2$), W, Dp), and(F1, W, Dp), respectively.
