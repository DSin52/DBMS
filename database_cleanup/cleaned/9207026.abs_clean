For the special case of the quantum group $SL_q (2,{\bf C})\ (q= \exp \pii/r,\ r\ge 3)$ we present an alternative approach to quantum gauge theories intwo dimensions. We exhibit the similarities to Witten's combinatorial approachwhich is based on ideas of Migdal. The main ingredient is the Turaev-Virocombinatorial construction of topological invariants of closed, compact3-manifolds and its extension to arbitrary compact 3-manifolds as given by theauthors in collaboration with W. Mueller.
