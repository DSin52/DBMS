Title: Quantum Backreaction on ``Classical'' Variables

Comments: LaTeX, 10 pp. title change, minor improvement of presentation

A mathematically consistent procedure for coupling quasiclassical and quantumvariables through coupled Hamilton-Heisenberg equations of motion is derivedfrom a variational principle. During evolution, the quasiclassical variablesbecome entangled with the quantum variables with the result that the value ofthe quasiclassical variables depends on the quantum state. This provides aformalism to compute the backreaction of any quantum system on a quasiclassicalone. In particular, it leads to a natural candidate for a theory of gravitycoupled to quantized matter in which the gravitational field is not quantized.
