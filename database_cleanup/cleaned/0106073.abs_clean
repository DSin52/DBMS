We analyse the implications of the fact that there are two claims for a dualto \N=4 superconformal SU(N) Yang-Mills theory (SCYM), the Maldacena conjectureand the theorem of Rehren. While the Maldacena dual is conjectured to be anon-perturbative string theory for large string coupling $g_s$ and small $N$,the Rehren dual is an ordinary quantum field theory on $AdS_5$ for all valuesof the parameters. We argue that as a result, if we accept the Maldacenasatisfy the axioms of algebraic quantum field theory for finite $N$ because itsobservables do not obey the causal structure of conformal Minkowski space;. 2)String theory on $AdS_5 \times S^5$ is not a quantum theory of gravity in 10dimensions because it is dual to an ordinary quantum field theory on $AdS_5$whose causal structure remains fixed for all values of its couplings; or 3)there is no consistent quantisation of string theory on $AdS_5 \times S^5$ forfinite string scale $l_s$ and $g_s$.In evaluating the evidence for each of these conclusions we point out thatmany of the tests of the Maldacena conjecture can be explained by a weaker formof an $AdS/CFT$ correspondence.
