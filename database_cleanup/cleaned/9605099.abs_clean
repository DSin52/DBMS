We quantize the $SU(n)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model in terms of left and rightchiral variables choosing an appropriate gauge and we compare our results withthe results that have been previously obtained in the algebraic treatment ofthe problem. The algebra of the chiral vertex operators in the fundamentalrepresentation is verified by solving appropriate Knizhnik-Zamolodchikovequations.
