323-344We formulate the equations of motion of a free scalar field in the flat and$AdS$ space of an arbitrary dimension in the form of some "higher spin"covariant constancy conditions. Klein-Gordon equation is interpreted as anon-trivial cohomology of a certain "\sgm-complex". The action principle for ascalar field is formulated in terms of the "higher-spin" covariant derivativesfor an arbitrary mass in $AdS_d$ and for a non-zero mass in the flat space. Theconstructed action is shown to be equivalent to the standard first-orderKlein-Gordon action at the quadratic level but becomes different at theinteraction level because of the presence of an infinite set of auxiliaryfields which do not contribute at the free level. The example of Yang-Millscurrent interaction is considered in some detail. It is shown in particular howthe proposed action generates the pseudolocally exact form of the mattercurrents in $AdS_d$.
