The string equations of motion for some homogeneous (Kantowski-Sachs, BianchiI and Bianchi IX) background spacetimes are given, and solved explicitly insome simple cases. This is motivated by the recent developments in stringcosmology, where it has been shown that, under certain circumstances, suchspacetimes appear as string-vacua.Both tensile and null strings are considered. Generally, it is much simplerto solve for the null strings since then we deal with the null geodesicequations of General Relativity plus some additional constraints.We consider in detail an ansatz corresponding to circular strings, and wediscuss the possibility of using an elliptic-shape string ansatz in the case ofhomogeneous (but anisotropic) backgrounds.
