Loop equations of matrix models express the invariance of the models underfield redefinitions. We use loop equations to prove that it is possible todefine continuum times for the generic hermitian {1-matrix} model such that allcorrelation functions in the double scaling limit agree with the correspondingcorrelation functions of the Kontsevich model expressed in terms of kdV times.In addition the double scaling limit of the partition function of the hermitianmatrix model agree with the $\tau$-function of the kdV hierarchy correspondingto the Kontsevich model (and not the square of the $\tau$-function) except forsome complications at genus zero.
