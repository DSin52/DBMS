There are infinitely many topological solitons in any given complex affineToda theories and most of them have complex energy density. When we require theenergy density of the solitons to be real, we find that the reality conditionis related to a simple ``pairing condition.'' Unfortunately, rather few solitonsolutions in these theories survive the reality constraint, especially if onealso demands positivity. The resulting implications for the physicalapplicability of these theories are briefly discussed.
