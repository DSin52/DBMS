Title: Finite-Size and Finite-Temperature Effects in the Conformally Invariant

O(N) Vector Model for 2<d<4Authors: Anastasios C. Petkou and Nicholas D. Vlachos

Workshop on Thermal Field Theories and Their Applications, Regensburg,Germany, August 10-14, 1998We study the operator product expansion (OPE) of the auxiliary scalar field\lambda(x) with itself, in the conformally invariant O(N) Vector Model for2<d<4, to leading order in 1/N in a strip-like geometry with one finitedimension of length L. We show that consistency of the finite-geometry OPE withbulk OPE calculations requires the physical conditions of, either finite-sizescaling at criticality, or finite-temperature phase transition.
