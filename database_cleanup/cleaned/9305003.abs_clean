We solve the equations of motion of the tachyon and the discrete states inthe background of Witten's semiclassical black hole and in the exact 2Ddilaton-graviton background of Dijkgraaf et al. We find the exact solutions forweak fields, leading to conclusions in disagreement with previous studies oftachyons in the black hole. Demanding that a state in the black hole be wellbehaved at the horizon implies that it must tend asymptotically to acombination of a Seiberg and an anti-Seiberg c=1 state. For such a state to bewell behaved asymptotically, it must satisfy the condition that neither itsSeiberg nor its anti-Seiberg Liouville momentum is positive. Thus, although thefree-field BRST cohomologies of the underlying SL(2,R)/U(1) theory is the sameTHERE ARE NO W_INFINITY STATES, AND ONLY TACHYONS WITH X-MOMENTA | P_TACH | <=| M_TACH | ARE ALLOWED. In the Minkowski case only the static tachyon isallowed. The black hole is stable to the back reaction of these remainingtachyons, so they are good perturbations of the black hole, or ``hair''.However, this leaves only 3 tachyonic hairs in the black hole and 7 in theexact solution! Such sparse hair is clearly irrelevant to the maintenance ofcoherence during black hole evaporation.
