We describe a new first-order formulation of D=11 supergravity which showsthat that theory can be understood to arise from a certain topological fieldtheory by the imposition of a set of local constraints on the fields, plus alagrange multiplier term. The topological field theory is of interest as thealgebra of its constraints realizes the D=11 supersymmetry algebra with centralcharges.
