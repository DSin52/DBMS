We find charged, abelian, spherically symmetric solutions (in flatspace-time) corresponding to the effective action of $D=4$ heterotic stringtheory with scale-dependent dilaton $\p$ and modulus $\vp$ fields. We take intoaccount perturbative (genus-one), moduli-dependent `threshold' corrections tothe coupling function $f(\p,\vp)$ in the gauge field kinetic term $f(\p,\vp)F^2_{\m\n}$, as well as non-perturbative scalar potential $V(\p, \vp)$, e.g.induced by gaugino condensation in the hidden gauge sector. Stable, finiteenergy, electric solutions (corresponding to on abelian subgroup of anon-abelian gauge group) have the small scale region as the weak couplingregion ($\phi\ra -\infty$) with the modulus $\vp$ slowly varying towardssmaller values. Stable, finite energy, abelian magnetic solutions exist onlyfor a specific range of threshold correction parameters. At small scales theycorrespond to the strong coupling region ($\p\ra \infty$) and thecompactification region ($\vp\ra 0$). The non-perturbative potential $V$ playsa crucial role at large scales, where it fixes the asymptotic values of $\phi$and $\vp$ to be at the minimum of $V$.
