In this paper we give the boundary string field theory description ofbrane-antibrane systems. From the world-sheet action of brane-antibrane systemswe obtain the tachyon potential and discuss the tachyon condensation exactly.We also find the world-volume action including the gauge fields. Moreover wedetermine RR-couplings exactly for non-BPS branes and brane-antibranes. Thesecouplings are written by superconnections and correspond to K^1(M) and K^0(M)for the non-BPS branes and brane-antibranes, respectively. We also show thatMyers terms appear if we include the transverse scalars in the boundary sigmamodel action.
