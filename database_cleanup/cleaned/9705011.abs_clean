Title: Intersecting Branes

Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett

Comments: Latex, 48 pages. Typos corrected. Various minor improvements

BPS configurations of intersecting branes have many applications in stringtheory. We attempt to provide an introductory and pedagogical review ofsupergravity solutions corresponding to orthogonal BPS intersections of braneswith an emphasis on eleven and ten space-time dimensions. Recent work on BPSsolutions corresponding to non-orthogonally intersecting branes is alsodiscussed. These notes are based on lectures given at the APCTP Winter School"Dualities of Gauge and String Theories", Korea, February 1997.
