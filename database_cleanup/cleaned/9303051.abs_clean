We discuss the conditions under which the BRST operator of a $W$-string canbe written as the sum of two operators that are separately nilpotent andanticommute with each other. We illustrate our results with the example of thenon-critical $W_3$-string. Furthermore, we apply our results to make aconjecture about a relationship between the spectrum of a non-critical$W_n$-string and a $W_{n-1}$-string.
