The \nl \cls for the N=1 supersymmetric KdV equation are shown to be relatedin a simple way to powers of the fourth root of its Lax operator. This providesa direct link between the supersymmetry invariance and the existence of \nlconservation laws. It is also shown that nonlocal conservation laws exist forthe two integrable N=2 supersymmetric KdV equations whose recursion operator isknown.
