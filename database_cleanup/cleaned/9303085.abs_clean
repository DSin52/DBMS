We consider a one-dimensional Osp($N|2M$) pseudoparticle mechanical modelwhich may be written as a phase space gauge theory. We show how thepseudoparticle model naturally encodes and explains the two-dimensional zerocurvature approach to finding extended conformal symmetries. We describe aprocedure of partial gauge fixing of these theories which leads generally totheories with superconformally extended ${\cal W}$-algebras. The pseudoparticlemodel allows one to derive the finite transformations of the gauge and matterfields occurring in these theories with extended conformal symmetries. Inparticular, the partial gauge fixing of the Osp($N|2$) pseudoparticlemechanical models results in theories with the SO($N$) invariant $N$-extendedsuperconformal symmetry algebra of Bershadsky and Knizhnik. These algebras arenonlinear for $N \geq 3.$ We discuss in detail the cases of $N=1$ and $N=2,$giving two new derivations of the superschwarzian derivatives. Some commentsare made in the $N=2$ case on how twisted and topological theories represent asignificant deformation of the original particle model. The particle model alsoallows one to interpret superconformal transformations as deformations of flagsin super jet bundles over the associated super Riemann surface.
