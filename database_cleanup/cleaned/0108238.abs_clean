A family of conformal boundary states for a free boson on a circle isconstructed. The family contains superpositions of conventional U(1)-preservingNeumann and Dirichlet branes, but for general parameter values the boundarystates are fundamental and preserve only the conformal symmetry. The relativeoverlaps satisfy Cardy's condition, and each boundary state obeys thefactorisation constraint. It is also argued that, together with theconventional Neumann and Dirichlet branes, these boundary states alreadyaccount for all fundamental conformal D-branes of the free boson theory. Theresults can be generalised to the situation with N=1 world-sheet supersymmetry,for which the family of boundary states interpolates between superpositions ofnon-BPS branes and combinations of conventional brane anti-brane pairs.
