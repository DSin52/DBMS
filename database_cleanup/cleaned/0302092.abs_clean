We confirm earlier hints that the conventional phase diagram of the discretechiral Gross-Neveu model in the large N limit is deficient at non-zero chemicalpotential. We present the corrected phase diagram constructed in mean fieldtheory. It has three different phases, including a kink-antikink crystal phase.All transitions are second order. The driving mechanism for the new structureof baryonic matter in the Gross-Neveu model is an Overhauser type instabilitywith gap formation at the Fermi surface.
