analogous calculation for a free Dirac fermion. To appear in Advances inTheoretical and Mathematical PhysicsWe study multi-soliton states in two-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric theories.We calculate their energy exactly as a function of mass and volume in thesimplest integrable N=2 theory, the sine-Gordon model at a particular coupling.These energies are related to the expectation value $I= tr [\exp(in\pi F)\exp(-H/T)]$, where F is the fermion number. For n=1, this is Witten's index;for n an odd integer, we argue that $I$ is an index in the sense that it isindependent of all D-term variations.
