We present a direct field theoretical calculation of the consistent gaugeanomaly in the superfield formalism, on the basis of a definition of theeffective action through the covariant gauge current. The scheme isconceptually and technically simple and the gauge covariance in intermediatesteps reduces calculational labors considerably. The resultant superfieldanomaly, being proportional to the anomaly $d^{abc}=\tr T^a\{T^b,T^c\}$, isminimal without supplementing any counterterms. Our anomaly coincides with theanomaly obtained by Marinkovi\'c as the solution of the Wess-Zumino consistencycondition.
