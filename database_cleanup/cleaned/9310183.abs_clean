Associated with the fundamental representation of a quantum algebra such as$U_q(A_1)$ or $U_q(A_2)$, there exist infinitely many gauge-equivalent$R$-matrices with different spectral-parameter dependences. It is shown howthese can be obtained by examining the infinitely many possible gradations ofthe corresponding quantum affine algebras, such as $U_q(A_1^{(1)})$ and$U_q(A_2^{(1)})$, and explicit formulae are obtained for those two cases.Spectral-dependent similarity (gauge) transformations relate the $R$-matricesin different gradations. Nevertheless, the choice of gradation can bephysically significant, as is illustrated in the case of quantum affine Todafield theories.
