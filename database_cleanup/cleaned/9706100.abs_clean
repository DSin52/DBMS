The absorption of photons and fermions into four-dimensional black holes isdescribed by equations which in certain cases can be analyzed using dyadicindex techniques. The resulting absorption cross-sections for near-extremalblack holes have a form at low energies suggestive of the effective stringmodel. A coupling to the effective string is proposed for spin-0 and spin-1/2fields of pure N=4 supergravity which respects the unbroken supersymmetry ofextreme black holes and correctly predicts dilaton, axion, and fermioncross-sections up to an overall normalization.
