The superembedding approach to $p$-branes is used to study a class of$p$-branes which have linear multiplets on the worldvolume. We refer to thesebranes as L-branes. Although linear multiplets are related to scalar multiplets(with 4 or 8 supersymmetries) by dualising one of the scalars of the latter toa $p$-form field strength, in many geometrical situations it is the linearmultiplet version which arises naturally. Furthermore, in the case of 8supersymmetries, the linear multiplet is off-shell in contrast to the scalarmultiplet. The dynamics of the L-branes are obtained by using a systematicprocedure for constructing the Green-Schwarz action from the superembeddingformalism. This action has a Dirac-Born-Infeld type structure for the $p$-form.In addition, a set of equations of motion is postulated directly in superspace,and is shown to agree with the Green-Schwarz equations of motion.
