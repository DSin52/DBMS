We formulate a new bootstrap principle which allows for the construction ofparticle spectra involving unstable as well as stable particles. We comment onthe general Lie algebraic structure which underlies theories with unstableparticles and propose several new scattering matrices. We find a new Liealgebraic decoupling rule, which predicts the renormalization group flow independence of the relative ordering of the resonance parameters. The proposalsare exemplified for some concrete theories which involve unstable particles,such as the homogeneous sine-Gordon models and their generalizations. The newdecoupling rule can be validated by means of our new bootstrap principle andalso via the renormalization group flow, which we obtain from a thermodynamicBethe ansatz analysis.
