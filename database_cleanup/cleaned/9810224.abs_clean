The complete phase diagram of objects in M-theory compactified on tori $T^p$,$p=1,2,3$, is elaborated. Phase transitions occur when the object localizes oncycle(s) (the Gregory-Laflamme transition), or when the area of the localizedpart of the horizon becomes one in string units (the Horowitz-Polchinskicorrespondence point). The low-energy, near-horizon geometry that governs agiven phase can match onto a variety of asymptotic regimes. The analysis makesit clear that the matrix conjecture is a special case of the Maldacenaconjecture.
