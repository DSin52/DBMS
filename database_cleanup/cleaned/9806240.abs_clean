Title: Short-Distance Space-Time Structure and Black Holes in String Theory

Short Review of the Present StatusAuthors: Miao Li and Tamiaki Yoneya

Comments: 34 pages, no figures, to appear in the special issue of the Journal

of Chaos, Solitons and Fractals on "Superstrings, M, F, S...Theory"We briefly review the present status of string theory from the viewpoint ofits implications on the short-distance space-time structure and black holephysics. Special emphases are given on two closely related issues in recentdevelopments towards nonperturbative string theory, namely, the role of thespace-time uncertainty relation as a qualitative but universal characterizationof the short-distance structure of string theory and the microscopicformulation of black-hole entropies. We will also suggest that the space-timeuncertainty relation can be an underlying principle for the holographicproperty of M theory, by showing that the space-time uncertainty relationnaturally explains the UV/IR relation used in a recent derivation of theholographic bound for D3 brane by Susskind and Witten.
