The coupling of a string to gravity allows for Schwarzschild black holeswhose entropy to area relation is $S=(A/4)(1-4\mu)$, where $\mu$ is the stringtension. This departure from the A/4 universality results from a stringinstanton generating a black hole with smaller entropy at a temperatureexceeding the Hawking value. The temperature is sensitive to the presence ofclassical matter outside the black hole horizon but the entropy is not. Thehorizon materializes at the quantum level. It is conjectured that such amacroscopic non local effect may be operative in retrieving information fromincipient black holes.
