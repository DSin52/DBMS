We consider a general N=(2,2) non-linear sigma-model in (2,2) superspace.Depending on the details of the complex structures involved, an off-shelldescription can be given in terms of chiral, twisted chiral and semi-chiralsuperfields. Using superspace techniques, we derive the conditions thepotential has to satisfy in order to be ultra-violet finite at one loop. We payparticular attention to the effects due to the presence of semi-chiralsuperfields. A complete description of N=(2,2) strings follows from this.
