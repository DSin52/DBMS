We show that the BF theory in any space-time dimension, when quantized in acertain linear covariant gauge, possesses a vector supersymmetry. The generatorof the latter together with those of the BRS transformations and of thetranslations form the basis of a superalgebra of the Wess-Zumino type. We givea general classification of all possible anomalies and invariant counterterms.Their absence, which amounts to ultraviolet finiteness, follows from purelyalgebraic arguments in the lower-dimensional cases.
