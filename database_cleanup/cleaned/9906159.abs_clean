A pedagogical presentation of integrable models with special reference to theToda lattice hierarchy has been attempted. The example of the KdV equation hasbeen studied in detail, beginning with the infinite conserved quantities andgoing on to the Lax formalism for the same. We then go on to symplecticmanifolds for which we construct the Lax operator. This formalism is applied toToda Lattice systems. The Zakharov Shabat formalism aimed at encompassing allintegrable models is also covered after which the zero curvature condition andits fallout are discussed. We then take up Toda Field Theories and theirconnection to W algebras via the Hamiltonian reduction of the WZNW model.Finally, we dwell on the connection between four dimensional Yang Millstheories and the KdV equation along with a generalization to supersymmetry.
