Black p-brane solutions for a wide class of intersection rules and Ricci-flat``internal'' spaces are considered. They are defined up to moduli functions H_sobeying non-linear differential equations with certain boundary conditionsimposed. A new solution with intersections corresponding to the Lie algebra A_3is obtained. The functions H_1, H_2 and H_3 for this solution are polynomialsof degree 3, 4 and 3, correspondingly. An example of A_3-solution with three3-branes in 12-dimensional model (suggested by N. Khviengia et al) ispresented.
