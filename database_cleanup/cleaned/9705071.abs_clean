Title: Strong-weak coupling duality in non-abelian gauge theories

Comments: 97 pages, introductory part of a PhD thesis, in french; the very last

sentence erasedThis is a general introduction to electric-magnetic duality in non-abeliangauge theories. In chapter I, I review the general ideas which led in the late70s to the idea of electric/magnetic duality in quantum field theory. Inchapters II and III, I focus mainly on N=2 supersymmetric theories. I presentthe lagrangians and explain in more or less detail the non-renormalizationtheorems, rigid special geometry, supersymmetric instanton calculus, chargefractionization, the semiclassical theory of monopoles, duality in Maxwelltheory and the famous Seiberg-Witten solution. I discuss various physicalapplications, as electric charge confinement, chiral symmetry breaking ornon-trivial superconformal theories in four dimensions. In Section II.3 newmaterial is presented, related to the computation of the eta invariant ofcertain Dirac operators coupled minimally to non-trivial monopole fieldconfigurations. I explain how these invariants can be obtained exactly by aone-loop calculation in a suitable N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory. This is anunexpected application of the holomorphy properties of N=2 supersymmetry, andconstitutes a tremendous simplification of the usual computation. An expandedversion of these new results will be published soon.
