The effective action of string theory in three dimensions is investigated,incorporating the Lorentz and gauge Chern-Simons terms in the definition of theKalb-Ramond axion field strength. Since in three dimensions any three-form istrivial, the action can be reformulated by properly integrating the axion out.The circumstances under which it can be recast in form of topologically massivegravity coupled to a topologically massive gauge theory are pointed out.Finally, the strong coupling limit of the resulting action is inspected, withthe focus on the roles played by the axion and dilaton fields.
