Title: On the Global Structure of Some Natural Fibrations of Joyce Manifolds

Comments: 36 pages

GeometryThe study of fibrations of the target manifolds of string/M/F-theories hasprovided many insights to the dualities among these theories or even as a toolto build up dualities since the work of Strominger, Yau, and Zaslow on theCalabi-Yau case. For M-theory compactified on a Joyce manifold $M^7$, the factthat $M^7$ is constructed via a generalized Kummer construction on a 7-torus${\smallBbb T}^7$ with a torsion-free $G_2$-structure $\phi$ suggests thatthere are natural fibrations of $M^7$ by ${\smallBbb T}^3$, ${\smallBbb T}^4$,and K3 surfaces in a way governed by $\phi$. The local picture of some of thesefibrations and their roles in dualities between string/M-theory have beenstudied intensively in the work of Acharya. In this present work, we explainhow one can understand their global and topological details in terms of bundlesover orbifolds. After the essential background is provided in Sec. 1, we givegeneral discussions in Sec. 2 about these fibrations, their generic andexceptional fibers, their monodromy, and the base orbifolds. Based on these,one obtains a 5-step-routine to understand the fibrations, which we illustrateby examples in Sec. 3. In Sec. 4, we turn to another kind of fibrations forJoyce manifolds, namely the fibrations by the Calabi-Yau threefolds constructedby Borcea and Voisin. All these fibrations arise freely and naturally from thework of Joyce. Understanding how the global structure of these fibrations mayplay roles in string/M-theory duality is one of the major issues for furtherpursuit.
