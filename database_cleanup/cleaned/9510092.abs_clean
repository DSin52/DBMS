We discuss the non-abelian duality procedure for groups which do not actfreely. As an example we consider Taub-NUT space, which has the local isometrygroup $SU(2) \otimes U(1)$. We dualise over the entire symmetry group as wellas the subgroups $SO(3)$ and $U(1)$, presenting unusual new solutions to lowenergy string theory. The solutions obtained highlight the relationship betweenfixed points of an isometry in one solution and singular points in another. Wealso find the interesting results that, in this case, the $U(1)$ and $SO(3)$$T$-duality procedures commute with each other, and that the extreme points ofthe $O(1,1)$ duality group for the time translations have special significanceunder the $SO(3)$ T-duality.
