It is by now clear that the naive rule for the entropy of a black hole,{entropy} = 1/4 {area of event horizon}, is violated in many interesting cases.Indeed, several authors have recently conjectured that in general the entropyof a dirty black hole might be given purely in terms of some surface integralover the event horizon of that black hole. A formal proof of this conjecture,using Lorentzian signature techniques, has recently been provided by Wald. Thisnote performs two functions. Firstly, a rather different proof of this resultis presented --- a proof based on Euclidean signature techniques. The totalentropy is S = 1/4 {k A_H / l_P^2} + \int_H {S} \sqrt{g} d^2x. The integrationruns over a spacelike cross-section of the event horizon H. The surface entropydensity, {S}, is related to the behaviour of the matter Lagrangian under timedilations.  Secondly, I shall consider the specific case of Einstein-Hilbertgravity coupled to an effective Lagrangian that is an arbitrary function of theRiemann tensor (though not of its derivatives). In this case a more explicitresult is obtained S = 1/4 {k A_H / l_P^2} + 4 pi {k/hbar} \int_H {partial L /partial R_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}} g^\perp_{\mu\lambda} g^\perp_{\nu\rho} \sqrt{g}d^2x . The symbol $g^\perp_{\mu\nu}$ denotes the projection onto thetwo-dimensional subspace orthogonal to the event horizon.
