Comments: 7 pages (LaTeX), preprint TPJU 14/93

We introduce the analogue of the metric tensor in case of $q$-deformeddifferential calculus. We analyse the consequences of the existence of suchmetric, showing that this enforces severe restrictions on the parameters of thetheory. We discuss in detail the examples of the Manin plane and the$q$-deformation of $SU(2)$. Finally we touch the topic of relations with theConnes' approach.
