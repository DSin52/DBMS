We show that renormalization in quantum field theory is a special instance ofa general mathematical procedure of multiplicative extraction of finite valuesbased on the Riemann-Hilbert problem. Given a loop $\gamma(z), | z |=1$ ofelements of a complex Lie group G the general procedure is given by evaluationof $ \gamma_{+}(z)$ at z=0 after performing the Birkhoff decomposition $\gamma(z)=\gamma_{-}(z)^{-1} \gamma_{+}(z)$ where $ \gamma_{\pm}(z) \in G$ areloops holomorphic in the inner and outer domains of the Riemann sphere (with$\gamma_{-}(\infty)=1$). We show that, using dimensional regularization, thebare data in quantum field theory delivers a loop (where z is now the deviationfrom 4 of the complex dimension) of elements of the decorated Butcher group(obtained using the Milnor-Moore theorem from the Kreimer Hopf algebra ofrenormalization) and that the above general procedure delivers the renormalizedphysical theory in the minimal substraction scheme.
