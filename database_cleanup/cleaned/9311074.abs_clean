Title: Integrability in Hamiltonian Chern-Simons theory

Comments: 21 pages

SystemsWe consider the moduli space of flat connections on the Riemann surface withmarked points. The new efficient parametrization is suggested and used toconstruct an integrable model on the moduli space. A family of commutingHamiltonians is extracted from the trace of the transfer matrix built from theWilson line observables of the Chern-Simons theory. Our model appears to begauge equivalent to XXZ magnetic chain with finite number of sites.
