A state saturating a BPS bound derived from a supersymmetry algebra preservessome fraction of the supersymmetry. This fraction of supersymmetry depends onthe charges carried by the system, and we show that in general there areconfigurations of charges for which a BPS state would preserve more than halfthe original supersymmetry. We investigate configurations that could preserve3/4 supersymmetry in string theory, M-theory and supersymmetric field theoriesand discuss whether states saturating these bounds actually occur in thesetheories.
