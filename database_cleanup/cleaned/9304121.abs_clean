We discuss topological Landau-Ginzburg theories coupled to the 2-dimensionaltopological gravity. We point out that the basic recursion relations forcorrelation functions of the 2-dimesional gravity have exactly the same form asthe Gauss-Manin differential equations for the period integrals ofsuperpotentials. Thus the one-point functions on the sphere of theLandau-Ginzburg theories are given exactly by the period integrals. We discussvarious examples, A-D-E minimal models and the $c=3$ topological theories.
