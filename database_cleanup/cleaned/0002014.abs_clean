Static properties of SU(3) multiskyrmions with baryon number up to 6(classical masses and momenta of inertia) are estimated. The calculations arebased on the recently suggested generalization of the SU(2) rational mapansaetze applied to the SU(3) model. Both SU(2) embedded skyrmions and genuineSU(3) solutions are considered, and it is shown that although, at the classicallevel, the energy of embeddings is lower, the quantum corrections can alterthis conclusion. This correction to the energy of lowest state, bilinear in theWess-Zumino (WZ) term, is presented for the most general case as a convolutionof the inverse tensor of inertia and the components of the WZ-term.
