We introduce so-called chaotic strings (coupled 1-dimensional noise stringsunderlying the Parisi-Wu approach of stochastic quantization on a small scale)as a possible amendment of ordinary string theories. These strings are stronglyself-interacting and exhibit strongest possible chaotic behavior. Constraintson the vacuum energy of the strings fix a certain discrete set of allowedstring couplings. We provide extensive numerical evidence that these stringcouplings numerically coincide with running standard model coupling constants,evaluated at energy scales given by the masses of the known quarks, leptons andgauge bosons. Chaotic strings can thus be used to provide a theoreticalargument why certain standard model parameters are realized in nature, othersare not, assuming that the a priori free standard model parameters evolve tothe minima of the effective potentials. The chaotic string spectrum correctlyreproduces the numerical values of the electroweak and strong couplingconstants with a precision of 4-5 digits, as well as the (free) masses of theknown quarks and leptons with a precision of 3-4 digits. Neutrino masspredictions consistent with present experiments are obtained. The W boson massalso comes out correctly, and a Higgs mass prediction is obtained.
