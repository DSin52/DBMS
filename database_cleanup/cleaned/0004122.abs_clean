The torus and the Klein bottle amplitude coefficients are computed inpermutation orbifolds of RCFT-s in terms of the same quantities in the originaltheory and the twist group. An explicit expression is presented for the numberof self conjugate primaries in the orbifold as a polynomial of the total numberof primaries and the number of self conjugate ones in the parent theory. Theformulae in the $Z_2$ orbifold illustrate the general results.
