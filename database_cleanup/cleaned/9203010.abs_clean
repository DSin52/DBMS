We analyze the beta-function equations for string theory in the case when thetarget space has one spacelike (or timelike) direction and rest is someconformal field theory (CFT) with appropriate central charge and has one nearlymarginal operator. We show there always exists a space (time) dependentsolution which interpolates between the original background and the backgroundwhere CFT is replaced by a new conformal field theory, obtained by perturbingCFT by the nearly marginal operator.
