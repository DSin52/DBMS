We use a unitary operator constructed in earlier work to transform theHamiltonian for QCD in the temporal ($A_0=0$) gauge into a representation inwhich the quark field is gauge-invariant, and its elementary excitations --quark and antiquark creation and annihilation operators -- implement Gauss'slaw. In that representation, the interactions between gauge-dependent parts ofthe gauge field and the spinor (quark) field have been transformed away andreplaced by long-range non-local interactions of quark color charge densities.These long-range interactions connect SU(3) color charge densities through aninfinite chain of gauge-invariant gauge fields either to other SU(3) colorcharge densities, or to a gluon "anchor". We discuss possible implications ofthis formalism for low-energy processes, including confinement of quarks thatare not in color singlet configurations.
