By applying the method of Dijkgraaf-Vafa, we study matrix model related tosupersymmetric SO(N) gauge theory with N_f flavors of quarks in the vectorrepresentation found by Intriligator-Seiberg. By performing the matrix integralover tree level superpotential characterized by light meson fields (massdeformation) in electric theory, we reproduce the exact effectivesuperpotential in the gauge theory side. Moreover, we do similar analysis inmagnetic theory. It turns out the matrix descriptions of both electric and
