We develop a method for extracting accurate critical exponents fromperturbation expansions of the O(n)-symmetric nonlinear sigma-model in D=2+epsilon dimensions. This is possible by considering the epsilon-expansions inthis model as strong-coupling expansions of functions of the variabletildevarepsilon = 2(4-D)/(D-2), whose first five weak-coupling expansioncoefficients of powers of tildevarepsilon are known from varepsilon-expansionsof critical exponents in O(n)-symmetric phi^4-theory in D=4-epsilon dimensions.
