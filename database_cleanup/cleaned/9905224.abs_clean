We review new aspects of integrable systems discovered recently in N=2supersymmetric gauge theories and their topologically twisted versions. Themain topics are (i) an explicit construction of Whitham deformations of theSeiberg-Witten curves for classical gauge groups, (ii) its application tocontact terms in the u-plane integral of topologically twisted theories, and(iii) a connection between the tau functions and the blowup formula intopologically twisted theories.
