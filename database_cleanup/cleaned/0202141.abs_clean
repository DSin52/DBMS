We consider the superposition of the first two members of the gravitationalhierarchy (Einstein plus first Gauss-Bonnet(GB)) interacting with thesuperposition of the first two members of the $SO_{(\pm)}(d)$ Yang--Millshierarchy, in $d$ dimensions. Such systems can occur in the low energyeffective action of string theory. Particle-like solutions %for the systemswith only an Einstein term, and with only a GB term, in dimensions $d=6,8$ areconstructed respectively. Our results reveal qualitatively new propertiesfeaturing double-valued solutions with critical behaviour. In this preliminarystudy, we have restricted ourselves to one-node solutions.
