Title: Localized gravity on de Sitter brane in five dimensions

Authors: Masato Ito (Nagoya Univ.)

Comments: 9 pages, 1 figure

We consider a single brane embedded in five dimensions with vanishing andpositive bulk cosmological constant. In this setup, the existence of $dS_{4}$brane is allowed. We explore the gravitational fluctuations on the brane, andwe point out that the usual four-dimensional gravity can be reproduced by anormalizable zero mode and that the continuous massive modes are separated by amass gap from zero mode. We derive the relation among the cosmological constantin the brane, and the fundamental scale of five dimensions and Planck scale.Finally we show that not zero but tiny observed cosmological constant cannot berealized in this setup.
