Title: Miscellaneous Physical Applications of Quantum Algebras

Comments: 16 pages, Tex

Some ideas about phenomenological applications of quantum algebras to physicsare reviewed. We examine in particular some applications of the algebras $U_ q(su_2)$ and $U_{qp}({\rm u}_2)$ to various dynamical systems and to atomic andnuclear spectroscopy. The lack of a true (unique) $q$- or $qp$-quantizationprocess is emphasized.
