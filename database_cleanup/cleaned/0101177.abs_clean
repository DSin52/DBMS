We consider an open Wilson line as a momentum representation of a boundarystate which describes a D-brane in a constant B-field background. Using thispicture, we study the Seiberg-Witten map which relates the commutative andnoncommutative gauge fields, and determine the products of fields appearing inthe general terms in the expansion of this map.
