Motivated by the search for potentially exactly solvable time-dependentstring backgrounds, we determine all homogeneous plane wave (HPW) metrics inany dimension and find one family of HPWs with geodesically complete metricsand another with metrics containing null singularities. The former generalisesboth the Cahen-Wallach (constant $A_{ij}$) metrics to time-dependent HPWs,$A_{ij}(t)$, and the Ozsvath-Sch\"ucking anti-Mach metric to arbitrarydimensions. The latter is a generalisation of the known homogeneous metricswith $A_{ij}\sim 1/t^2$ to a more complicated time-dependence. We display thesemetrics in various coordinate systems, show how to embed them into stringtheory, and determine the isometry algebra of a general HPW and the associatedconserved charges. We review the Lewis-Riesenfeld theory of invariants oftime-dependent harmonic oscillators and show how it can be deduced from thegeometry of plane waves. We advocate the use of the invariant associated withthe extra (timelike) isometry of HPWs for lightcone quantisation, andillustrate the procedure in some examples.
