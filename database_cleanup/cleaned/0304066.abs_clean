We perform the matching required to compute the leading effective boundarycontribution to the QED lagrangian in the presence of a conducting surface,once the electron is integrated out. Our result resolves a confusion in theliterature concerning the interpretation of the leading such correction to theCasimir energy. It also provides a useful theoretical laboratory forbrane-world calculations in which kinetic terms are generated on the brane,since a lot is known about QED near boundaries.
