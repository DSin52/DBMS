We study the integrability properties of the one-parameter family of $N=2$super Boussinesq equations obtained earlier by two of us (E.I. \& S.K., Phys.Lett. B 291 (1992) 63) as a hamiltonian flow on the $N=2$ super-$W_3$ algebra.We show that it admits nontrivial higher order conserved quantities and hencegives rise to integrable hierarchies only for three values of the involvedparameter, $\alpha=-2,\;-1/2,\;5/2$. We find that for the case $\alpha = -1/2$there exists a Lax pair formulation in terms of local $N=2$ pseudo-differentialoperators, while for $\alpha = -2$ the associated equation turns out to bebi-hamiltonian.
