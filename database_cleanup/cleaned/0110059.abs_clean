The Maxwell theory on non-commutative spaces has been considered. Thenon-linear equations of electromagnetic fields on non-commutative spaces wereobtained in the compact spin-tensor (quaternion) form. It was shown that theplane electromagnetic wave is the solution of the system of non-linear waveequations of the second order for the electric and magnetic induction fields.We have found the canonical and symmetrical energy-momentum tensors and theirnon-zero traces. So, the trace anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor wasobtained in electrodynamics on non-commutative spaces. It was noted that thedual transformations of electromagnetic fields on non-commutative spaces arebroken.
