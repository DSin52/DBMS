We investigate supersymmetric extrema of Abelian gauged supergravity theorieswith non-trivial vector multiplets and 8 supercharges in four and fivedimensions. The scalar fields of these models parameterize a manifoldconsisting of disconnected branches and restricting to the case where thismanifold has a non-singular metric we show that on every branch there can be atmost one extremum, which is a local maximum (for W>0) or a minimum (for W<0) ofthe superpotential W. Therefore, these supergravity models do not allow forregular domain wall solutions interpolating between different extrema of thesuperpotential and the space-time transverse to the wall asymptotically alwaysapproaches the boundary of AdS (UV-fixed points in a dual field theory).
