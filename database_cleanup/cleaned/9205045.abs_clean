We study the two-dimensional supersymmetric Toda theory based on the Liesuperalgebra $B(1,1) \equiv Osp(3|2)$ and construct its quantum W-currents. Wethe non-unitary form of the Lagrangian the $B^{(1)}(1,1)$ theory has a realparticle mass spectrum which is not renormalized at one-loop. We construct thefirst higher--spin conserved current, prove its conservation to all-loop order,compute one-loop corrections to the corresponding charge and check consistencybetween charge and mass renormalization.
