I show that the new topological field theories recently associated byDubrovin with each Coxeter group may be all obtained in a simple way by a``restriction'' of the standard ADE solutions. I then study the Chebichevspecializations of these topological algebras, examine how the Coxeter graphsand matrices reappear in the dual algebra and mention the intriguing connectionwith the operator product algebra of conformal field theories. A directunderstanding of the occurrence of Coxeter groups in that context is highlydesirable.
