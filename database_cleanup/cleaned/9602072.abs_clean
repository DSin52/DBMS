Title: Tuning the RADIO to the Off-Shell 2D Fayet Hypermultiplet Problem

Authors: S. James Gates, Jr. and Lubna Rana

We show via use of the RADIO technique that an off-shell (4,0) version of thehypermultiplet, in the form first proposed by Fayet, exists and contains 28 -28 component fields. The off-shell structure uncovered is found to include achiral truncation of the ``generalized 2D, N = 4 tensor multiplet formalism''proposed by Ketov. The (4,0) theory is extended to an off-shell 56 - 56component field (4,4) theory with the addition of a minimal (4,0) minus spinormultiplet together with (4,0) auxiliary multiplets. We propose that our finalresult gives a solution to a twenty year-old 2D supersymmetry problem in thephysics literature.
