We show that the Hamiltonian dynamics of the self-interacting, abelian p-formtheory in D=2p+2 dimensional space-time gives rise to the quasi-localstructure. Roughly speaking, it means that the field energy is localized but onclosed 2p-dimensional surfaces (quasi-localized). From the mathematical pointof view this approach is implied by the boundary value problem for thecorresponding field equations. Various boundary problems, e.g. Dirichlet orNeumann, lead to different Hamiltonian dynamics. Physics seems to prefergauge-invariant, positively defined Hamiltonians which turn out to bequasi-local. Our approach is closely related with the standard two-potentialformulation and enables one to generate e.g. duality transformations in aperfectly local way (but with respect to a new set of nonlocal variables).Moreover, the form of the quantization condition displays very similarstructure to that of the symplectic form of the underlying p-form theoryexpressed in the quasi-local language.
