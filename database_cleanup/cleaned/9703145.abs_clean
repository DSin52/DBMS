Conformal mapping techniques are used to determine analytically the geodesicson the Seiberg-Witten Riemann surface which correspond to the BPS dyon statesin N=2 SUSY QCD with gauge group SU(2) and up to three flavors of masslessfundamental matter. The results are exact for zero and two flavors, andapproximate in the weak-coupling limit for one and three flavors. The presenceof states of magnetic charge 2, in the three-flavor case only, is confirmed.
