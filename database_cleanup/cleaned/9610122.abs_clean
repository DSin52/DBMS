Infinite-dimensional Grassmannian manifold contains moduli spaces of Riemannsurfaces of all genera. This well known fact leads to a conjecture thatnon-perturbative string theory can be formulated in terms of Grassmannian. Wepresent new facts supporting this hypothesis. In particular, it is shown thatGrassmannians can be considered as generalized moduli spaces; this statementpermits us to define corresponding "string amplitudes" (at least formally). Onecan conjecture, that it is possible to explain the relation betweennon-perturbative and perturbative string theory by means of localizationtheorems for equivariant cohomology; this conjecture is based on thecharacterization of moduli spaces, relevant to string theory, as setsconsisting of points with large stabilizers in certain groups acting onGrassmannian. We describe an involution on the Grassmannian that could berelated to S-duality in string theory.
