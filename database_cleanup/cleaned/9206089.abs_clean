Starting from the Wess-Zumino action associated to the super Weyl anomaly, wedetermine the local counterterm which allows to pass from this anomaly to thechirally split superdiffeomorphism anomaly (as defined on a compact superRiemann surface without boundary). The counterterm involves the gradedextension of the Verlinde functional and the results can be applied to thestudy of holomorphic factorization of partition functions in superconformalfield theory.
