We study the mechanism of confinement via formation ofAbrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortices on the Higgs branch of N=2 supersymmetricSU(2) gauge theory with massive fundamental matter. Higgs branch represents alimiting case of superconductor of type I with vanishing Higgs mass. We showthat in this limit vortices still exist although they become logarithmically"thick". Because of this the confining potential is not linear any longer. Itbehaves as $L/\log L$ with a distance $L$ between confining heavy charges(monopoles). This new confining regime can occur only in supersymmetrictheories. We also address the problem of quantum stability of vortices. To thisend we develop string representation for a vortex and use it to argue thatvortices remain stable.
