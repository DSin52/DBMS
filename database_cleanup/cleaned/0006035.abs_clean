We study the near-horizon AdS_2\timesS^2 geometry of evaporatingnear-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes interacting with null matter. Thenon-local (boundary) terms t_{\pm}, coming from the effective theory correctedwith the quantum Polyakov-Liouville action, are treated as dynamical variables.We describe analytically the evaporation process which turns out to becompatible with the third law of thermodynamics, i.e., an infinite amount oftime is required for the black hole to decay to extremality. Finally we commentbriefly on the implications of our results for the information loss problem.
