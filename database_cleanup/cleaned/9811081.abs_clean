Title: The Physics of Negative Energy Densities

Authors: Adam D. Helfer

Comments: 10 pages, latex, uses sprocl, talk given at the Quantum Fields in

External Potentials Workshop, Leipzig, 1998I review some recent results showing that the physics of negative energydensities, as predicted by relativistic quantum field theories, is morecomplicated than has generally been appreciated. On the one hand, in externalpotentials where there is a time--dependence, however slight, the Hamiltoniansare unbounded below. On the other, there are limitations of quantum measurementin detecting or utilizing these negative energies.
