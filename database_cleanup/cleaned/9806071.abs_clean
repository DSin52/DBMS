Title: Anti-DeSitter Spaces and Nonextreme Black Holes

Authors: Finn Larsen

Comments: 8 pages, latex, uses sprocl.sty

At low energy the near horizon geometry of nonextreme black holes in fourdimensions exhibits an effective SL(2,R)_L x SL(2,R)_R symmetry. The parametersof the corresponding induced conformal field theory gives the correctexpression for the black hole entropy. The resulting spectrum of theSchwarzchild black hole is compared with another proposal.
