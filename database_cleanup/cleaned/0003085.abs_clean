Via partial resolution of Abelian orbifolds we present an algorithm forextracting a consistent set of gauge theory data for an arbitrary toric varietywhose singularity a D-brane probes. As illustrative examples, we tabulate thematter content and superpotential for a D-brane living on the toric del Pezzosurfaces as well as the zeroth Hirzebruch surface. Moreover, we discuss thenon-uniqueness of the general problem and present examples of vastly differenttheories whose moduli spaces are described by the same toric data. Our methodsprovide new tools for calculating gauge theories which flow to the sameuniversality class in the IR. We shall call it ``Toric Duality.''
