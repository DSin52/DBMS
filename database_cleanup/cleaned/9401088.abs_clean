The classical soliton solution, quantized by means of suitable translationaland rotational collective coordinates, is embedded into the one-particleirreductible representation of the Poincare group corresponding to a definitespin. It is shown, that within the conventional quasiclassical expansion suchembedding leads to a set of nontrivial consistency conditions imposed on theclassical solution. The validity of these relations is considered for a numberof soliton models in 2+1- and 3+1-dimensions.
