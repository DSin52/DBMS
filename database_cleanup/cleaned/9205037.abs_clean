We present a global analysis of the geometries that arise in non-compactcurrent algebra (or gauged WZW) coset models of strings and particlespropagating in curved space-time. The simplest case is the 2d black hole. Inhigher dimensions these geometries describe new and much more complexsingularities. For string and particle theories (defined in the text) weintroduce general methods for identifying global coordinates and give thegeneral exact solution for the geodesics for any gauged WZW model for anynumber of dimensions. We then specialize to the 3d geometries associated with$SO(2,2)/SO(2,1)$ (and also $SO(3,1)/SO(2,1)$) and discuss in detail the globalspace, geodesics, curvature singularities and duality properties of this space.The large-small (or mirror) type duality property is reformulated as aninversion in group parameter space. The 3d global space has two topologicallydistinct sectors, with patches of different sectors related by duality. Thefirst sector has a singularity surface with the topology of ``pinched doubletrousers". It can be pictured as the world sheet of two closed strings thatjoin into a single closed string and then split into two closed strings, butwith a pinch in each leg of the trousers. The second sector has a singularitysurface with the topology of ``double saddle", pictured as the world sheets oftwo infinite open strings that come close but do not touch. We discuss thegeodesicaly complete spaces on each side of these surfaces and interpret themotion of particles in physical terms. A cosmological interpretation issuggested and comments are mode on possible physical applications.
