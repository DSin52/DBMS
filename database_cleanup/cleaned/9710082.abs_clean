In four-dimensional gauge theory there exists a well-known correspondencebetween instantons and holomorphic curves, and a similar correspondence existsbetween certain octonionic instantons and triholomorphic curves. We prove thatthis latter correspondence stems from the dynamics of various dimensionalreductions of ten-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. More preciselywe show that the dimensional reduction of the (5+1)-dimensional supersymmetricsigma model with hyperkaehler (but otherwise arbitrary) target X to afour-dimensional hyperkaehler manifold M is a topological sigma modellocalising on the space of triholomorphic maps M -> X (or hyperinstantons).When X is the moduli space M_K of instantons on a four-dimensional hyperkaehlermanifold K, this theory has an interpretation in terms of supersymmetric gaugetheory. In this case, the topological sigma model can be understood as anadiabatic limit of the dimensional reduction of ten-dimensional supersymmetricYang-Mills on the eight-dimensional manifold M x K of holonomy Sp(1) x Sp(1) inSpin(7), which is a cohomological theory localising on the moduli space ofoctonionic instantons.
