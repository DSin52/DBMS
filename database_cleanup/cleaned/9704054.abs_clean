Extended superalgebras of types A,B,C, heterotic and type-I are all derivedas solutions to a BPS equation in 14 dimensions with signature ( 11,3). The BPSequation as well as the solutions are covariant under SO( 11,3). This shows howsupersymmetries with N<=8 in four dimensions have their origin in the samesuperalgebra in 14D. The solutions provide different bases for the samesuperalgebra in 4D, and the transformations among bases correspond to variousdualities.
