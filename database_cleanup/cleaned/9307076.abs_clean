TheoriesAuthors: P. Montague

We describe a pair of constructions of Eisenstein lattices from ternarycodes, and a corresponding pair of constructions of conformal field theoriesfrom lattices which turn out to have a string theoretic interpretation. Theseare found to interconnect in a similar way to results for binary codes, whichled to a generalisation of the triality structure relevant in the constructionof the Monster module. We therefore make some comments regarding a series ofconstructions of $V^\natural$. In addition, we present a complete constructionof the Niemeier lattices from ternary codes, which in view of the aboveanalogies should prove to be of great importance in the problem of theclassification of self-dual $c=24$ conformal field theories. Other progresstowards this problem is summarised, and some comments arise from thisdiscussion regarding the uniqueness of the Monster conformal field theory.(Talk presented at the "Monster Bash", Ohio State University, May 1993.)
