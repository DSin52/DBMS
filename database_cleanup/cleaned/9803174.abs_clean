Title: Large N Gauge Theories and Anti-de Sitter Bag Model

Authors: I.V. Volovich

Comments: 6 pages, Latex

Using a proposal of Maldacena one describes the large N limit of gaugetheories in terms of supergravity solutions on anti-de Sitter space. From thispoint of view we discuss a possible scenario for quark confinement in gaugetheory by describing hadrons as strongly curved universes. In particular aninterpretation of black hole as a bag model in SQCD is discussed. One relatesthe mystery of curvature singularities in classical general relativity with themystery of quark confinement. The AdS bag model is defined by computing theprobe membrane action in supergravity background. It naturally implies the"Cheshire Cat bag" principle. The confining pressure in the MIT bag model isrelated with the cosmological constant in the AdS bag model. The Skyrme modelis interpreted as an effective theory describing black holes.
