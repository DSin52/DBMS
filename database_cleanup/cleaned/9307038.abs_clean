We develop techniques to compute the complete the massless spectrum inheterotic string compactification on N=2 supersymmetric Landau-Ginzburgorbifolds. This includes not just the familiar charged fields, but also thegauge singlets. The number of gauge singlets can vary in the moduli space of agiven compactification and can differ from what it would be in the large radiuslimit of the corresponding Calabi-Yau. Comparison with exactly soluble Gepnermodels provides a confirmation of our results at Gepner points. Our methodscarry over straightforwardly to $(0,2)$ Landau-Ginzburg models.
