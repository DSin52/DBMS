A spinning nonextremal D3-brane undergoes a phase transition to a nakedsingularity which, from the braneworld point of view, corresponds to theapparent graviton speed passing from subluminal to superluminal. We investigatethis phase transition from the dual perspectives of braneworld scenarios andholography. We discuss the relevance of the thermodynamic stability domains ofa spinning D3-brane to the physics of braneworld scenarios. We also describevarious gravitational Lorentz violations which arise from static D3-branes.
