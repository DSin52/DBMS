The validity of the renormalization group approach for large $N$ is clarifiedby using the vector model as an example. An exact difference equation isobtained which relates free energies for neighboring values of $N$. Thereparametrization freedom in field space provides infinitely many identitieswhich reduce the infinite dimensional coupling constant space to that of finitedimensions. The effective beta functions give exact values for the fixed pointsand the susceptibility exponents.
