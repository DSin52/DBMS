We show that, although the correlator of four stress-tensor multiplets in N=4SYM is known to have radiative corrections, certain linear combinations of itscomponents are protected from perturbative renormalisation and remain at theirfree-field values. This result is valid for weak as well as for strong couplingand for any gauge group. Our argument uses Intriligator's insertion formula,and includes a proof that the possible contact term contributions cannot changethe form of the amplitudes. Combining this new non-renormalisation theorem withMaldacena's conjecture allows us to make a prediction for the structure of thecorresponding correlator in AdS supergravity. This is verified by firstconsiderably simplifying the strong coupling expression obtained by recentsupergravity calculations, and then showing that it does indeed exhibit theexpected structure.
