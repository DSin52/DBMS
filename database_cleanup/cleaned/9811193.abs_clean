Motivated by the coupling unification problem, we propose a novel extensionof the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. One of the predictions of thisextension is existence of new states neutral under SU(3)_c X SU(2)_w butcharged under U(1)_Y. The mass scale for these new states can be around themass scale of the electroweak Higgs doublets. This suggests a possibility oftheir detection in the present or near future collider experiments. Unificationof gauge couplings in this extension is as precise (at one loop) as in theMSSM, and can occur in the TeV range.
