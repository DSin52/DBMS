Using the previous obtained universal $R$-matrix for the quantized nontwistedaffine Lie algebras $U_q(A_1^{(1)})$ and $U_q(A_2^{(1)})$, we determine theexplicitly spectral-dependent universal $R$-matrix for the correspondingquantum Lie algebras $U_q(A_1)$ and $U_q(A_2)$. As their applications, wereproduce the well-known results in the fundamental representations and we alsoderive an extreamly explicit formula of the spectral-dependent $R$-matrix forthe adjoint representation of $U_q(A_2)$, the simplest non-trival case when thetensor product decomposition of the representation with itself has finitemultiplicity.
