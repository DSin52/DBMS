Authors: Bobby Acharya and Edward Witten

Comments: 26 pages

M-theory compactification on a manifold X of $G_2$ holonomy can give chiralfermions in four dimensions only if X is singular. A number of examples ofconical singularities that give chiral fermions are known; the present paper isdevoted to describing some additional examples. In some of them, the physicscan be determined but the metric is not known explicitly, while in others themetric can be described explicitly but the physics is more challenging tounderstand.
