The issue of non-perturbative background independent quantization of matrixmodels is addressed. The analysis is carried out by considering a simple matrixmodel which is a matrix extension of ordinary mechanics reduced to 0 dimension.It is shown that this model has an ordinary mechanical system evolving in timeas a classical solution. But in this treatment the action principle admits anatural modification which results in algebraic relations describing quantumtheory. The origin of quantization is similar to that in Adler's generalizedquantum dynamics. The problem with extension of this formalism to many degreesof freedom is solved by packing all the degrees of freedom into a singlematrix. The possibility to apply this scheme to field theory and to variousmatrix models is discussed.
