Using perturbative methods we derive new results for the spectrum andcorrelation functions of the general Z_3-chiral Potts quantum chain in themassive low-temperature phase. Explicit calculations of the ground state energyand the first excitations in the zero momentum sector give excellentapproximations and confirm the general statement that the spectrum in thelow-temperature phase of general Z_n-spin quantum chains is identical to one inthe high-temperature phase where the role of charge and boundary conditions areinterchanged. Using a perturbative expansion of the ground state for the Z_3model we are able to gain some insight in correlation functions. We argue thatthey might be oscillating and give estimates for the oscillation length as wellas the correlation length.
