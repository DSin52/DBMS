Title: Some remarks on the "classical" large N limit

Comments: 5 pages, Contribution to Festschrift in honor of Holger Bech

Nielsen's 60'th birthdayIt has been proposed some time ago that the large $N-$limit can be understoodas a ``classical limit'', where commutators in some sense approach thecorresponding Poisson brackets. We discuss this in the light of some recentnumerical results for an SU(N) gauge model, which do not agree with this``classicality'' of the large N-limit. The world sheet becomes very crumpled.We speculate that this effect would disappear in supersymmetric models.
