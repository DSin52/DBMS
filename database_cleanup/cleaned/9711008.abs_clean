We analyze the Ising model on a random surface with a boundary magnetic fieldusing matrix model techniques. We are able to exactly calculate the diskamplitude, boundary magnetization and bulk magnetization in the presence of aboundary field. The results of these calculations can be interpreted in termsof renormalization group flow induced by the boundary operator. In thecontinuum limit this RG flow corresponds to the flow from non-conformal toconformal boundary conditions which has recently been studied in flat spacetheories.
