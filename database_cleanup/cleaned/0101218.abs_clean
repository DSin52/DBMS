Title: Brane/anti-Brane Systems and U(N|M) Supergroup

Comments: 10 pages, additional reference included

We show that in the context of topological string theories N branes and Manti-branes give rise to Chern-Simons gauge theory with the gauge supergroup$U(N|M)$. We also identify a deformation of the theory which corresponds tobrane/anti-brane annihilation. Furthermore we show that when $N=M$ all openstring states are BRST trivial in the deformed theory.
