We discuss the different bounds on entropy in the context of two-dimensionalcosmology. We show that in order to obtain well definite bounds one has to usethe scale symmetry of the gravitational theory. We then extend the recentlyfound relation between the Friedmann equation and the Cardy formula to the caseof two dimensions. In particular, we find that in two dimensions this relationrequires that the central charge c of the conformal field theory is given interms of the Newton constant G of the gravitational theory by c=6/G.
