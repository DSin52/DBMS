We construct Dp-branes in bosonic string theory as unstable lumps in atruncated string field theory of open strings on a D25-brane. We find that thelowest level truncation gives good quantitative agreement with the predictedD-brane tension and low-lying spectrum of the D-brane for sufficiently large pand study the effect of the next level corrections for p=24. We show that aU(1) gauge field zero mode on the D-brane arises through a mechanismreminiscent of the Randall-Sundrum mechanism for gravity.
