Title: Quantum Mechanics and Determinism

Comments: 13 pages Plain TeX, 1 figure in PostScript. Presented at PASCOS 2001,

Eighth International Symposium on Particles, Strings and Cosmology, UNC atChapel Hill, April 10-15, 2001It is shown how to map the quantum states of a system of free scalarparticles one-to-one onto the states of a completely deterministic model. It isa classical field theory with a large (global) gauge group. The mapping is nowalso applied to free Maxwell fields. Lorentz invariance is demonstrated.
