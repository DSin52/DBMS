If background fields are soft on the scale set by mass of the particleinvolved, a reliable approximation to the field-theoretic one-loop effectiveaction is obtained by a systematic large mass expansion involving higher-orderSeeley-DeWitt coefficients. Moreover, if the small mass limit of the effectiveaction in a particular background has been found by some other means, the twoinformations may be used to infer the corresponding result for {\em arbitrary}mass values. This method is used to estimate the one-loop contribution to theQCD vacuum tunneling amplitude by quarks of arbitrary mass.
