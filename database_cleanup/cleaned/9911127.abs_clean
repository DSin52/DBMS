We show the existence of a renormalizable local supersymmetry for the gaugefixed action of the four dimensional antisymmetric tensor field model in acurved background quantized in a generalized axial gauge. By using thetechnique of the algebraic renormalization procedure, we prove the ultravioletfiniteness of the model to all orders of perturbation theory.
