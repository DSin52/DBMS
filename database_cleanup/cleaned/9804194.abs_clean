Title: Black Holes in the Framework of the Four-Dimensional Effective Theory of

Heterotic Superstrings at Low EnergiesComments: A 4 page version (including summary and contents), PhD thesis, full

postscript version (197 pages in Greek) available atIn the framework of the four-dimensional effective theory of heteroticsuperstrings at low energies, which is considered as a generalised theory ofgravity, we search for new black hole solutions. The analytical expressions ofall the scalar fields of the effective theory is determined in a Kerr-Newmanblack hole background and the evasion of the existing "no-hair" theorems in thepresence of higher curvature gravitational terms is demonstrated. New blackhole solutions, such as the Dilatonic and the Coloured black holes, aredetermined by use of numerical integration and their properties are analysed.Finally, the linear stability of Dilatonic black holes under smalltime-dependent perturbations is exhibited through a semi-analytic method.
