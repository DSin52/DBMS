Title: $SO(5)_{q}$ and Contraction

Authors: Amitabha Chakrabarti

Comments: 8 pages Tex, written version of a talk presented at XXX Karpacz

Winter schoolRepresentations of $SO(5)_{q}$ are constructed explicitly on the Chevalleybasis for all $q$, generic and root of unity. Matrix elements of the generatorsare obtained for all representations depending on three variable indices, themaximal number being 4. A prescription for contraction is given such that acomplete Hopf algebra is immediately obtained for the non-semisimple contractedcase. For $q$ a root of unity the periodic representations for $SO(5)_{q}$ andthe contracted algebra are obtained directly in the "fractional part" formalismwhich unifies the treatments for the generic and root of unity cases. The$q$-deformed quadratic Casimir operator is explicitly evaluated for therepresentations presented.
