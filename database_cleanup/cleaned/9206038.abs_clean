Title: A Comment on the Relationship Between Differential and Dimensional

RenormalizationAuthors: Gerald Dunne and Nuria Rius

Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B293 (1992) 367-374

We show that there is a very simple relationship between differential anddimensional renormalization of low-order Feynman graphs in renormalizablemassless quantum field theories. The beauty of the differential approach isthat it achieves the same finite results as dimensional renormalization withoutthe need to modify the space time dimension.
