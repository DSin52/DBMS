In the Chern-Simons gauge theory formulation of the spinning (2+1)dimensional black hole, we may treat the horizon and the spatial infinity asboundaries. We obtain the actions induced on both boundaries, applying theFaddeev and Shatashvili procedure. The action induced on the boundary of thehorizon is precisely the gauged $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model,which has been studied previously in connection with a Lorentz signature blackhole in (1+1) dimensions. The action induced on the boundary of spatialinfinity is also found to be a gauged $SL(2,R)$ WZW model, which is equivalentto the Liouville model, the covariant action for the (1+1) dimensional quantumgravity. Thus, the (2+1) dimensional black hole is intimately related to thequantum gravity in (1+1) dimensions.
