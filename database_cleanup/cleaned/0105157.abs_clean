We study the finite temperature phase transition in 2+1 dimensional compacttemperature was established long time ago by Hosotani. Phase transition incompact QED is well studied and we employ the `duality' to study thesuperconductivity phase transition in a Josephson junction. For a thickjunction we obtain a critical temperature in terms of the geometricalproperties of the junction.
