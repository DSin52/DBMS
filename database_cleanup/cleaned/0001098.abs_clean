I emphasize analogy between Dp-branes in string theories and solitons ingauge theories comparing their common properties and showing differences. Wewill show that for certain excitations of the string/D3-brane system Neumannboundary conditions emerge from the Born-Infeld dynamics. The excitations whichare coming down the string with a polarization along a direction parallel tothe brane are almost completely reflected. For the wavelengths much larger thanthe string scale only a small fraction of the energy escapes in the form ofdipole radiation. The physical interpretation is that a string attached to the3-brane manifests itself as an electric charge, and waves on the string causethe end point of the string to freely oscillate and produce electromagneticdipole radiation in the asymptotic outer region. The magnitude of emitted poweris in fact exactly equal to the one given by Thompson formula in ordinaryelectrodynamics.
