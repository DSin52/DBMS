The zero curvature representation for two dimensional integrable models isgeneralized to spacetimes of dimension d+1 by the introduction of a d-formconnection. The new generalized zero curvature conditions can be used torepresent the equations of motion of some relativistic invariant field theoriesof physical interest in 2+1 dimensions (BF theories, Chern-Simons, 2+1 gravityand the CP^1 model) and 3+1 dimensions (self-dual Yang-Mills theory and theBogomolny equations). Our approach leads to new methods of constructingconserved currents and solutions. In a submodel of the 2+1 dimensional CP^1model, we explicitly construct an infinite number of previously unknownnontrivial conserved currents. For each positive integer spin representation ofsl(2) we construct 2j+1 conserved currents leading to 2j+1 Lorentz scalarcharges.
