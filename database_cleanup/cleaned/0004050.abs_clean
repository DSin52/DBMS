Title: Fermions on the Light-Front

Comments: 9 pages, to appear in the proceedings of the CSSM Workshop on

Light-Cone QCD and Nonperturbative Hadron Physics, Adelaide, Australia, Dec.13-21, 1999Issues that are specific for formulating fermions in light-cone quantizationare discussed. Special emphasis is put on the use of parity invariance in thenon-perturbative renormalization of light-cone Hamiltonians.
