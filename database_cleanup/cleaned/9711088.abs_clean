We write general one-loop anomalies of string field theory as path integralson a torus for the corresponding nonlinear sigma model. This extends the workof Alvarez-Gaum\'e and Witten from quantum mechanics to two dimensions. Higherworld-volume loops contribute in general to nontopological anomalies and aformalism to compute these is developed. We claim that (i) for generalanomalies one should not use the propagator widely used in string theory butrather the one obtained by generalization from quantum mechanics, but (ii) forchiral anomalies both propagators give the same result. As a check of thisclaim in a simpler model we compute trace anomalies in quantum mechanics. Thepropagator with a center-of-mass zero mode indeed does not give the correctresult for the trace anomaly while the propagator for fluctuations $q^i (\tau)$satisfying $q^i (\tau = -1) = q^i (\tau = 0) = 0$ yields in $d=2$ and $d=4$dimensions the correct results from two- and three-loop graphs.We then return to heterotic string theory and calculate the contributions tothe anomaly from the different spin structures for $d=2$. We obtain agreementwith the work of Pilch, Schellekens and Warner and that of Li in the sectorwith spacetime fermions. In the other sectors, where no explicit computationshave been performed in the past and for which one needs higher loops, we find agenuine divergence, whose interpretation is unclear to us. We discuss whetheror not this leads to a new anomaly.
