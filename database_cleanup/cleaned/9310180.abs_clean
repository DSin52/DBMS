We analyze the relation between a topological coset model based on super$SL(2,R)/U(1)$ coset and non-critical string theory by using free fieldrealization. We show that the twisted $N=2$ algebra of the coset model can benaturally transformed into that of non-critical string. The screening operatorsof the coset models can be identified either with those of the minimal mattersor with the cosmological constant operator. We also find that another screeningoperator, which is intrinsic in our approach, becomes the BRST nontrivial stateof ghost number $0$ (generator of the ground ring for $c=1$ gravity).
