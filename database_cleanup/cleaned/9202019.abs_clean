The D=0 matrix model is reformulated as a 2d nonlocal quantum field theory.The interactions occur on the one-dimensional line of hermitian matrixeigenvalues. The field is conjugate to the density of matrix eigenvalues whichappears in the Jevicki-Sakita collective field theory. The classical solutionof the field equation is either unique or labeled by a discrete index. Such asolution corresponds to the Dyson sea modified by an entropy term. Themodification smoothes the sea edges, and interpolates between differenteigenvalue bands for multiple-well potentials. Our classical eigenvalue densitycontains nonplanar effects, and satisfies a local nonlinear Schr\"odingerequation with similarities to the Marinari-Parisi $D=1$ reformulation. Thequantum fluctuations about a classical solution are computable, and the IR andUV divergences are manifestly removed to all orders. The quantum correctionsgreatly simplify in the double scaling limit, and include bothstring-perturbative and nonperturbative effects.
