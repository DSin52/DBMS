We show that within the framework of a definite proposal for the initialconditions for the universe, the Hartle-Hawking `no boundary' proposal, openinflation is generic and does not require any special properties of theinflaton potential. In the simplest inflationary models, the semiclassicalapproximation to the Euclidean path integral and a minimal anthropic conditionlead to $\Omega_0\approx 0.01$. This number may be increased in models withmore fields or extra dimensions.
