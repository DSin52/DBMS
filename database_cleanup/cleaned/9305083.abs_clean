Exact solutions of heterotic string theory corresponding to four-dimensionalcharge Q magnetic black holes are constructed as tensor products of anSU(2)/Z(2Q+2) WZW orbifold with a (0,1) supersymmetric SU(1,1)/U(1) WZW cosetmodel. The spectrum is analyzed in some detail. ``Bad'' marginal operators arefound which are argued to deform these theories to asymptotically flat blackholes. Surprising behaviour is found for small values of Q, where low-energyfield theory is inapplicable. At the minimal value Q=1, the theory degenerates.Renormalization group arguments are given that suggest the potentialgravitational singularity of the low-energy field theory is resolved by amassive two-dimensional field theory. At Q=0, a stable, neutral ``remnant,'' ofpotential relevance to the black hole information paradox, is found.
