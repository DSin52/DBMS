We study the U(1) Higgs model in spacetime-dependent background fields (abackground metric and a background scalar field).Particle creation can occur because of the time-dependence of thesebackground fields. In gauge theories, there is a unphysical sector andconsequently unphysical particles may be produced. However, it is shown thatproduced unphysical particles have no contribution to backreaction tobackground fields.
