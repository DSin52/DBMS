Title: Relativistic KMS-condition and Kaellen-Lehmann type representatios of

thermal propagatorsComments: 8 pages, ams-latex

A relativistic version of the Kubo--Martin--Schwinger boundary condition ispresented which fixes the properties of thermal equilibrium states with respectto arbitrary space--time translations. This novel condition is a naturalgeneralization of the relativistic spectrum condition in the vacuum theory andhas similar consequences. In combination with the condition of locality itgives rise to a Kaellen--Lehmann type representation of thermal propagatorswith specific regularity properties. Possible applications of the results andsome open problems are outlined.
