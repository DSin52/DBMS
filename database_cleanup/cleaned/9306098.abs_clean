We consider the uncertainty relation between position and momentum of aparticle on $ S^1 $ (a circle). Since $ S^1 $ is compact, the uncertainty ofposition must be bounded. Consideration on the uncertainty of position demandsdelicate treatment. Recently Ohnuki and Kitakado have formulated quantummechanics on $ S^D $ (a $D$-dimensional sphere). Armed with their formulation,we examine this subject. We also consider parity and find a phenomenon similarto the spontaneous symmetry breaking. We discuss problems which we encounterwhen we attempt to formulate quantum mechanics on a general manifold.
