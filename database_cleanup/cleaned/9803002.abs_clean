We propose a method to calculate the expectation values of an operatorsimilar to the Wilson loop in the large N limit of field theories. We considerN=4 3+1 dimensional super-Yang-Mills. The prescription involves calculating thearea of a fundamental string worldsheet in certain supergravity backgrounds. Wealso consider the case of coincident M-theory fivebranes where one is lead tocalculating the area of M-theory two-branes. We briefly discuss the computationfor 2+1 dimensional super-Yang-Mills with sixteen supercharges which isnon-conformal. In all these cases we calculate the energy of quark-antiquarkpair.
