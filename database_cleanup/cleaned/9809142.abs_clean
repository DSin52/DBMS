In this paper we study three point functions of the Type II superstringinvolving one graviton and two massive states, focusing in particular on thespin-7/2 fermions at the first mass level. Defining a gravitational quadrupole``h-factor'', we find that the non-minimal interactions of string states ingeneral are parametrized by $h\ne1$, in contrast to the preferred field theoryvalue of h=1 (for tree-level unitarity). This difference arises from the factthat consistent gravitational interactions of strings are related to thepresence of a complete tower of massive states, not present in the ordinaryfield theory case.
