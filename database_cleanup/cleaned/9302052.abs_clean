Progress on the physics of strings in curved spacetime are comprehensivelyreviewed.We start by showing through renormalization group arguments that ameaningful quantum theory of gravity must be finite and must include allparticle physics.Then, we review classical and quantum string propagation incurved spacetimes.We start by the general expansion method proposed by de Vegaand S\'anchez in 1987. The particle transmutation phenomena in asymptoticallyflat spacetimes are detailed including fermion-boson transitions insupergravity backgrounds.The next chapters review the exactly solvable cases ofde Sitter cosmological spacetime. The calculation of various physicalquantities like the string mass and the energy-momentum tensor shows thatclassical and quantum string propagation in shock-waves and singular planewaves is physically meaningful and full of interesting new phenomena.Theimportant phenomenom of {\bf string stretching} that takes place when stringsfall into spacetime singularities and in expanding universes is analyzed.Weconclude by reporting on strings in de Sitter spacetime, where the stringequations are integrable and reduce to the sinh-Gordon equation and tointegrable generalizations of it. Lectures delivered at the ERICE SCHOOL``STRING QUANTUMGRAVITY AND PHYSICS AT THE PLANCK ENERGY SCALE'', 21-28 June 1992 , to appearin the Proceedings edited by N. S\'anchez, World Scientific.
