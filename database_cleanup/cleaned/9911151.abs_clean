In the frame of the scalar theory $g \phi ^{4}$, we explore the occurrence ofthermal renormalons, i. e. temperature dependent singularities in the Borelplane. The discussion of a particular renormalon type diagram at finitetemperature, using Thermofield Dynamics, allows us to establish that thesesingularities actually get a temperature dependence. This dependence appears inthe residues of the poles, remaining their positions unchanged withtemperature.
