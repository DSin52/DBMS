We construct new supersymmetric solutions of $D$=11 supergravity describing$n$ orthogonally ``overlapping" membranes and fivebranes for $n$=2,\dots,8.Overlapping branes arise after separating intersecting branes in a directiontransverse to all of the branes. The solutions, which generalize knownintersecting brane solutions, preserve at least $2^{-n}$ of the supersymmetry.Each pairwise overlap involves a membrane overlapping a membrane in a 0-brane,a fivebrane overlapping a fivebrane in a 3-brane or a membrane overlapping afivebrane in a string. After reducing $n$ overlapping membranes to obtain $n$overlapping $D$-2-branes in $D$=10, $T$-duality generates new overlapping$D$-brane solutions in type IIA and type IIB string theory. Uplifting certaintype IIA solutions leads to the $D$=11 solutions. Some of the new solutionsreduce to dilaton black holes in $D$=4. Additionally, we present a $D$=10solution that describes two $D$-5-branes overlapping in a string. $T$-dualitythen generates further $D$=10 solutions and uplifting one of the type IIAsolutions gives a new $D$=11 solution describing two fivebranes overlapping ina string.
