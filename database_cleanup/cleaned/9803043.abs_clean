We obtain the Hausdorff dimension, $h=2-2s$, for particles with fractionalspins in the interval, $0\leq s \leq 0.5$, such that the manifold ischaracterized by a topological invariant given by, ${\cal W}=h+2s-2p$. Thisobject is related to fractal properties of the path swept out by fractionalspin particles, the spin of these particles, and the genus (number of anyons)of the manifold. We prove that the anyonic propagator can be put into a pathintegral representation which gives us a continuous family of Lagrangians in aconvenient gauge. The formulas for, $h$ and ${\cal W}$, were obtained takinginto account the anyon model as a particle-flux system and by a qualitativeinference of the topology.
