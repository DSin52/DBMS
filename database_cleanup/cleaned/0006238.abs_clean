Title: Deformed Heisenberg Algebra with Reflection, Anyons and Supersymmetry of

ParabosonsComments: 4 pages. Talk given at the Int. Conf. ``Spin-Statistics Connection

and Commutation Relations", Anacapri, Capri Island, Italy -- May 31-June 3,2000 (to appear in Proceedings)Deformed Heisenberg algebra with reflection appeared in the context ofWigner's generalized quantization schemes underlying the concept of parafieldsand parastatistics of Green, Volkov, Greenberg and Messiah. We review theapplication of this algebra for the universal description of ordinary spin-$j$and anyon fields in 2+1 dimensions, and discuss the intimate relation betweenparastatistics and supersymmetry.
