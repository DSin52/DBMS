The $N=2$ fermionic string theory is revisited in light of its recentlyproposed equivalence to the non-compact $N=4$ fermionic string model. Theissues of space-time Lorentz covariance and supersymmetry for the BRSTquantized $N=2$ strings living in uncompactified $2 + 2$ dimensions arediscussed. The equivalent local quantum supersymmetric field theory appears tobe the most transparent way to represent the space-time symmetries of theextended fermionic strings and their interactions. Our considerations supportthe Siegel's ideas about the presence of $SO(2,2)$ Lorentz symmetry as well asat least one self-dual space-time supersymmetry in the theory of the $N=2(4)$fermionic strings, though we do not have a compelling reason to argue about thenecessity of the {\it maximal} space-time supersymmetry. The world-sheetarguments about the absence of all string massive modes in the physicalspectrum, and the vanishing of all string-loop amplitudes in the Polyakovapproach, are given on the basis of general consistency of the theory.
