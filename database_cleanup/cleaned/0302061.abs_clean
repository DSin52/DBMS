Title: A Model of Quantum Field Theory with Inter Source

Authors: Gang Zhao

Comments: 6 pages, RevTex

By putting a confined inter source, we construct a model which can give usconvergent solution from free field equation. On the other hand, the solutionof new field equation can be separated into two parts, one part is just same asthe one in Quantum Field Theory and make it survived in this model, and theother part, which we will see doesn't take energy and momentum, just gives us anegative propagator which can soften quadratic divergence.
