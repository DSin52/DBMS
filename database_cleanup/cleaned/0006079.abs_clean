For superstrings, the consequences of replacing the measure of integration$\sqrt{-\gamma}d^2 x$ in the Polyakov's action by $\Phi d^2 x$ where $\Phi$ isa density built out of degrees of freedom independent of the metric$\gamma_{ab}$ defined in the string are studied. As in Siegel reformulation ofthe Green Schwarz formalism the Wess-Zumino term is the square ofsupersymmetric currents. As opposed to the Siegel case, the compensating fieldsneeded for this do not enter into the action just as in a total derivative.They instead play a crucial role to make up a consistent dynamics. The stringtension appears as an integration constant of the equations of motion. Thegeneralization to higher dimensional extended objects is also studied using inthis case the Bergshoeff and Sezgin formalism with the associated additionalfields, which again are dynamically relevant unlike the standard formulation.Also unlike the standard formulation, there is no need of a cosmological termon the world brane.
