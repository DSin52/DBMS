We review the derivation of a noncommutative version of the nonlinear sigmamodel on $\CPn$ and it's soliton solutions for finite $\theta$ emphasizing thesimilarities it bears to the GMS scalar field theory. It is also shown thatunlike the scalar theory, some care needs to be taken in defining thetopological charge of BPS solitons of the theory due to nonvanishing surfaceterms in the energy functional. Finally it is shown that, like its commutativeanalogue, the noncommutative $\CPn$-model also exhibits a non-BPS sector.Unlike the commutative case however, there are some surprises in thenoncommutative case that merit further study.
