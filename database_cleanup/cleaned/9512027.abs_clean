Title: B-V Quantization in 2-D Gravity and New Conformal Fields

Comments: 19 pages, latex, no figures

We investigate the properties of 2-D gravity in the Batalin and Vilkoviskyquantization scheme. We find a factorized structure which exhibits dualityproperties analogous to those existing in the topological theories of forms.New conformal field are introduced with their invariant action.
