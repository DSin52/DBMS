We describe the construction of new configurations of self-gravitatingp-branes with worldvolume geometries of the form R^{1,p-s} x S^s, with 1\leqs\leq p, ie, tubular branes. Since such branes are typically unstable againstcollapse of the sphere, they must be held in equilibrium by a fluxbrane. Wepresent solutions for string loops with non-singular horizons, as well asM5-branes intersecting over such loops. We also construct tubular branes whichcarry in their worldvolume a dissolved, lower dimensional brane (as in thedielectric effect), or an F-string. However, the connection between oursolutions and related configurations that have been studied earlier in theabsence of brane self-gravity, is unclear. It is argued that, at least in someinstances, the self-gravitating solutions do not appear to be able to reproducestable configurations of tubular branes.
