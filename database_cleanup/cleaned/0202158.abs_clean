It was recently shown that velocity-dependent forces between parallelfundamental strings moving apart in a $D-$dimensional spacetime implied anaccelerating expanding universe in $D-1$-dimensional space-time. Exactsolutions were obtained for the early time expansion in $D=5,6$. Here we showthat this result also holds for fundamental strings in the background of afivebrane, and argue that the feature of an accelerating universe would holdfor more general $p$-brane-seeded models.
