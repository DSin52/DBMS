Title: N=4 Supersymmetric Gauge Theory in the Derivative Expansion

Comments: 11 pages

Maximally supersymmetric gauge theories have experienced renewed interest dueto the AdS/CFT correspondence and its conjectured S-duality. These gaugetheories possess a large amount of symmetry and have quasi-integrableproperties. We derive the amplitudes in the derivative expansion of thespontaneously broken examples and perform all loop integrations. The S-matrixis found via an algebraic recursion and at each order is SL(2,Z) invariant.
