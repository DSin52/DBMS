changes in abstract and first section madeWe propose a new Doubly Special Relativity theory based on the generalizationof the $\kappa$-deformation of the Poincar\'e algebra acting along one of thenull directions. We recall the full quantum algebra (Hopf) structure of suchdeformed Poincar\'e algebra and use it to derive the (deformed) phase spacealgebra. As in the DSR based on the standard quantum $\kappa$-Poincar\'ealgebra we find that the space time is non-commutative. We investigate the fatealgebra of Lorentz and momentum generators into kinematical and dynamicalparts, the action of the kinematical boost $M^{+-}$, and the emergence of thetwo dimensional Galilean symmetry.
