We propose a ladder-operator method for obtaining the squeezed states ofgeneral symmetry systems. It is a generalization of the annihilation-operatortechnique for obtaining the coherent states of symmetry systems. We connectthis method with the minimum-uncertainty method for obtaining the squeezed andcoherent states of general potential systems, and comment on the distinctionsbetween these two methods and the displacement-operator method.
