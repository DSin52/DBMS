We suggest the Hamiltonian approach for fluid mechanics based on thedynamics, formulated in terms of Lagrangian variables. The construction of thecanonical variables of the fluid sheds a light of the origin of Clebshvariables, introduced in the previous century. The developed formalism permitsto relate the circulation conservation (Tompson theorem) with the invariance ofthe theory with respect to special diffiomorphisms and establish also the newconservation laws. We discuss also the difference of the Eulerian andLagrangian description, pointing out the incompleteness of the first. Theconstructed formalism is also applicable for ideal plasma. We conclude withseveral remarks on the quantization of the fluid.
