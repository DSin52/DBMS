We investigate several matrix models based on super Lie algebras,osp(1|32,R), u(1|16,16) and gl(1|32,R). They are natural generalizations of IIBmatrix model and were first proposed by Smolin. In particular, we study thesupersymmetry structures of these models and discuss possible reductions to IIBmatrix model. We also point out that diffeomorphism invariance is hidden ingauge theories on noncommutative space which are derived from matrix models.This symmetry is independent of the global SO(9,1) invariance in IIB matrixmodel and we report our trial to extend the global Lorentz invariance to localsymmetry by introducing u(1|16,16) or gl(1|32,R) super Lie algebras.
