Using ``Tate's algorithm,'' we identify loci in the moduli of F-theorycompactifications corresponding to enhanced gauge symmetry. We apply this totest the proposed F-theory/heterotic dualities in six dimensions. We recoverthe perturbative gauge symmetry enhancements of the heterotic side and thephysics of small $SO(32)$ instantons, and discover new mixedperturbative/non-perturbative gauge symmetry enhancements. Upon furthertoroidal compactification to 4 dimensions, we derive the chain of Calabi-Yauthreefolds dual to various Coulomb branches of heterotic strings.
