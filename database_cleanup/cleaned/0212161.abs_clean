We discuss several examples of three-dimensional critical phenomena that canbe described by Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\phi^4$ theories. We present anoverview of field-theoretical results obtained from the analysis of high-orderperturbative series in the frameworks of the $\epsilon$ and of thefixed-dimension d=3 expansions. In particular, we discuss the stability of theO(N)-symmetric fixed point in a generic N-component theory, the criticalbehaviors of randomly dilute Ising-like systems and frustrated spin systemswith noncollinear order, the multicritical behavior arising from thecompetition of two distinct types of ordering with symmetry O($n_1$) andO($n_2$) respectively.
