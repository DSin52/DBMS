A solution of a problem contained in it is proposed via asuitable definition of a derivative with respect to operator variables. Thisresults in a preservation of Euler-Lagrange equations and a change in theoperator structure of conserved quantities. Besides, it entails certainrelation between the field operators and their variations (which is identicallyvalid for some fields, e.g. for the free ones). The general theory isillustrated on a number of particular examples
