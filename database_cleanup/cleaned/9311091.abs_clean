In this letter, we discuss the extension of Feynman's derivation of theequation of motion to the case of spinning particles. We show that a spinningparticle interacts only with the electromagnetic and gravitational fields. Inthe absence of the electromagnetic interactions, we rederive Papapetrou'sequations for spinning particles in the background of the conformal gravity. Wealso find that the effect of spin coupled to non-constant electromagneticfields leads to further corrections to the Lorentz force equations. Somediscussions of these results are given at the end.
