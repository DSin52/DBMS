Authors: Theodora Ioannidou

Comments: 10 pages + 6 Figures, To Appear in Nonlinearity

SystemsThis paper investigates an integrable system which is related to hyperbolicmonopoles; ie the Bogomolny Yang-Mills-Higgs equations in (2+1) anti-de Sitterspace which are integrable and whose solutions can be obtained using analyticalmethods. In particular, families of soliton solutions have been constructedexplicitly and their dynamics has been investigated in some detail.
