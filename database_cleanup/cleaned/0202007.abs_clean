It is known that electric-magnetic duality transformations are symmetries ofthe generalized Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde (WDVV) equations. InSeiberg-Witten theory the solutions to these equations come in certain setsaccording to the gauge group. We show that the duality transformationstransform solutions within a set to another solution within the same set, byusing a subset of the Picard-Fuchs equations on the Seiberg-Witten family ofRiemann surfaces. The electric-magnetic duality transformations can be thoughtof as changes of a canonical homology basis on the surfaces which in ourderivation is clearly responsible for the covariance of the generalized WDVVsystem.
