We further study the nonperturbative formulation of two-dimensional blackholes. We find a nonlinear differential equation satisfied by the tachyon inthe black hole background. We show that singularities in the tachyon fieldconfigurations are always associated with divergent semiclassical expansionsand are absent in the exact theory. We also discuss how the Euclidian blackhole emerges from an analytically continued fermion theory that corresponds tothe right side up harmonic oscillator potential.
