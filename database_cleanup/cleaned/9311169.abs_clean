Comments: 9 pages, UICHEP-TH/93-16

A set of simple exactly solvable potentials are shown to have convergent WKBseries. The resulting all-orders quantisation conditions provide a unifieddescription of all known cases where an exact WKB quantisation condition hasbeen obtained by modifying the potential with Langer-style terms, together withseveral new examples.
