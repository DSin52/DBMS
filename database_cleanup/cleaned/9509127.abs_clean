Title: Status of String Cosmology

Comments: 37 pages, Plain TEX, 3 figures available by fax upon request, to

appear in Proc. of the Erice School on "String gravity and physics at thePlanck scale" (Erice, 8-19 September 1995)I report recent studies on the evolution of perturbations in the context ofthe ``pre-big-bang" scenario typical of string cosmology, with emphasis on theformation of a stochastic background of relic photons and gravitons, and itspossible direct/indirect observable consequences. I also discuss the possiblegeneration of a thermal microwave background by using, as example, a simplegravi-axio-dilaton model whose classical evolution connects smoothlyinflationary expansion to decelerated contraction. By including the quantumback-reaction of the produced radiation the model eventually approaches thestandard radiation-dominated (constant dilaton) regime.
