We obtain static and rotating electrically charged black holes of aEinstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory of the Brans-Dicke type in (2+1)-dimensions.The theory is specified by three fields, the dilaton, the graviton and theelectromagnetic field, and two parameters, the cosmological constant and theBrans-Dicke parameter. It contains eight different cases, of which onedistinguishes as special cases, string theory, general relativity and a theoryequivalent to four dimensional general relativity with one Killing vector. Wefind the ADM mass, angular momentum, electric charge and dilaton charge andcompute the Hawking temperature of the solutions. Causal structure and geodesicmotion of null and timelike particles in the black hole geometries are studiedin detail.
