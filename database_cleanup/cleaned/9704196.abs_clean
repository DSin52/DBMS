The supersymmetric generalization of dilatations in the presence of thedilaton is defined. This is done by defining the supersymmetric dilatongeometry which is motivated by the supersymmetric volume preservingdiffeomorphisms. The resulting model is classical superconformal field theorywith an additional dilaton-axion supermultiplet coupled to the supersymmetricgauge theory, where the dilaton-axion couplings are nonrenormalizable. Thepossibility of spontaneous scale symmetry breaking is investigated in thiscontext. There are three different types of vacua with broken scale symmetryspontaneously broken supersymmetry and softly broken supersymmetry. If thescale symmetry is broken in the bosonic vacuum, then the Poincar\'esupersymmetry must be broken at the same time. If the scale symmetry is brokenin the fermionic vacuum but the bosonic vacuum remains invariant, then thePoincar\'e supersymmetry can be preserved as long as the R-symmetry breaking isspecifically related to the scale symmetry breaking.
