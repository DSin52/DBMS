Title: Nonperturbative calculation of Green and vertex functions in terms of

particle contoursAuthors: N. G. Stefanis

Comments: LaTeX, using Worldstyle and comprising three eps files (7 pages in

total). Invited talk presented at the International Conference Problems ofQuantum Field Theory, May 13 - 18, 1996, Alushta, Crimea, Ukraine. To appearin the ProceedingsThe infrared regime of fermionic Green and vertex functions is studiedanalytically within a geometric approach which simulates soft interactions byan {\it effective} theory of contours. Expanding the particle path integral interms of dominant contours at large distances, all-order results in thecoupling constant are obtained for the renormalized fermion propagator and auniversal vertex function with physical characteristics close to thoseassociated with the Isgur-Wise function in the weak decays of heavy mesons. Theextension to the ultraviolet regime is scetched.
