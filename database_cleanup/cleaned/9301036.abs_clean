We find an explicit solution of the Schr\"odinger equation for a Chern-Simonstheory coupled to charged particles on a Riemann surface, when the coefficientof the Chern-Simons term is a rational number (rather than an integer) andwhere the total charge is zero. We find that the wave functions carry aprojective representation of the group of large gauge transformations. We alsoexamine the behavior of the wave function under braiding operations whichinterchange particle positions. We find that the representation of both thebraiding operations and large gauge transformations involve unitary matriceswhich mix the components of the wave function. The set of wave functions areexpressed in terms of appropriate Jacobi theta functions. The matrices form afinite dimensional representation of a particular (well known tomathematicians) version of the braid group on the Riemann surface. We find aconstraint which relates the charges of the particles, $q$, the coefficient ofmust be an integer. We discuss a duality between large gauge transformationsand braiding operations.
