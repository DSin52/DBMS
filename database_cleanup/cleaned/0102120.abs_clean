A gauge invariant Wilsonian effective action is constructed for pure SU(N)Yang-Mills theory by formulating the corresponding flow equation. Manifestlygauge invariant calculations can be performed i.e. without gauge fixing orghosts. Regularisation is implemented in a novel way which realises aspontaneously broken SU(N|N) supergauge theory. As an example we sketch thecomputation of the one-loop beta function, performed for the first time withoutany gauge fixing.
