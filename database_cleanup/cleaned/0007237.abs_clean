Title: Subsystem Entropy Exceeding Bekenstein's Bound

Authors: Don N. Page

Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX

If Bekenstein's conjectured bound on the microcanonical entropy, S < 2 pi ER, is applied to a closed subsystem of maximal linear size R and excitationenergy up through E, it can be violated by an arbitrarily large factor by ascalar field having a symmetric potential allowing domain walls, and by theelectromagnetic field modes in a coaxial cable.
