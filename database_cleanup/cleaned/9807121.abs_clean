The leading radiative correction to the Casimir energy for two parallelpenetrable mirrors is calculated within QED perturbation theory. It is found tobe of the order $\alpha$ like the known radiative correction for ideallyreflecting mirrors from which it differs only by a monotonic, powerlikefunction of the frequency at which the mirrors become transparent. This showsthat the $O(\alpha^2)$ radiative correction calculated recently by Kong andRavndal for ideally reflecting mirrors on the basis of effective field theorymethods remains subleading even for the physical case of penetrable mirrors.
