There is a relatively well understood class of deformable W-algebras,resulting from Drinfeld-Sokolov (DS) type reductions of Kac-Moody algebras,which are Poisson bracket algebras based on finitely, freely generated rings ofdifferential polynomials in the classical limit. The purpose of this paper isto point out the existence of a second class of deformable W-algebras, which inthe classical limit are Poisson bracket algebras carried by infinitely,nonfreely generated rings of differential polynomials. We present illustrativeexamples of coset constructions, orbifold projections, as well as first classHamiltonian reductions of DS type W-algebras leading to reduced algebras withsuch infinitely generated classical limit. We also show in examples that thereduced quantum algebras are finitely generated due to quantum correctionsarising upon normal ordering the relations obeyed by the classical generators.We apply invariant theory to describe the relations and to argue that classicalcosets are infinitely, nonfreely generated in general. As a by-product, we alsoexplain the origin of the previously constructed and so far unexplaineddeformable quantum W(2,4,6) and W(2,3,4,5) algebras.
