Examples of scalar conserved currents are presented for trigonometric,hyperbolic and elliptic versions of the Hubbard model with non-nearestneighbour variable range hopping. They support for the first time thehypothesis about the integrability of the elliptic version. The two- electronwave functions are constructed in an explicit form.
