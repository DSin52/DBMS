In this paper we study the creation of brane-worlds in $AdS$ bulk. We firstconsider the simplest case of onebranes in $AdS_3$. In this case we are able toproperly describe the creation of a spherically symmetric brane-world derivinga general expression for its wavefunction. Then, we sketch the $AdS_{d+1}$set-up within the context of the WKB approximation. Finally, we comment onthese scenarios in light of the $AdS/CFT$ correspondence.
