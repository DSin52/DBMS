We propose a perturbative improvement of the hierarchical approximation forgaussian models. The procedure is based on a relabeling of the momenta whichallows one to express the symmetries of the hierarchical model using a simplemultiplication group. The representations of this group are used to expand theaction. The perturbative expansion is treated as a problem of symmetry breakingusing Ward identity techniques.
