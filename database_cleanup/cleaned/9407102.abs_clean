We discuss the spectral curves and rational maps associated with $SU(2)$Bogomolny monopoles of arbitrary charge $k$. We describe the effect on therational maps of inverting monopoles in the plane with respect to which therational maps are defined, and discuss the monopoles invariant under suchinversion. We define the strongly centred monopoles, and show they form ageodesic submanifold of the $k$-monopole moduli space. The space of stronglycentred $k$-monopoles invariant under the cyclic group of rotations about afixed axis, $C_k$, is shown to consist of several surfaces of revolution,generalizing the two surfaces obtained by Atiyah and Hitchin in the 2-monopolecase. Geodesics on these surfaces give a novel type of $k$-monopole scattering.We present a number of curves in $TP_1$ which we conjecture are the spectralcurves of monopoles with the symmetries of a regular solid. These conjecturesare based on analogies with Skyrmions.
