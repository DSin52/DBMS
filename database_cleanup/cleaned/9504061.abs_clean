The classical and the quantum massive string model based on a modified BDHPaction is analyzed in the range of dimensions $1<d<25$. The discussionconcerning classical theory includes a formulation of the geometricalvariational principle, a phase-space description of the two-dimensionaldynamics, and a detailed analysis of the target space geometry of classicalsolutions. The model is quantized using "old" covariant method. In particularan appropriate construction of DDF operators is given and the no-ghost theoremis proved. For a critical value of one of free parameters of the model thequantum theory acquires an extra symmetry not present on the classical level.In this case the quantum model is equivalent to the noncritical Polyakov stringand to the old Fairlie-Chodos-Thorn massive string.
