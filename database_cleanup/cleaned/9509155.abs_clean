Recently Borchers has shown that in a theory of local observables, certainunitary and antiunitary operators, which are obtained from an elementaryconstruction suggested by Bisognano and Wichmann, commute with the translationoperators like Lorentz boosts and \pct-operators, respectively. We concludefrom this that as soon as the operators considered implement {\em any}symmetry, this symmetry can be fixed up to at most some translation. As asymmetry, we admit any unitary or antiunitary operator under whose adjointaction any algebra of local observables is mapped onto an algebra which can belocalized somewhere in Minkowski space.
