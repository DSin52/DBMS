We investigate the possibility of gravity localization on the brane in thecontext of supersymmetric theories. To realize this scenario one needs to finda theory with the supersymmetric flow stable in IR at two critical points, onewith positive and the other with negative values of the superpotential. Weperform a general study of the supersymmetric flow equations of gauged masslesssupergravity interacting with arbitrary number of vector multiplets anddemonstrate that localization of gravity does not occur. The same conclusionremains true when tensor multiplets are included. We analyze all recentattempts to find a BPS brane-world and conclude that localization of gravity onthe brane in supersymmetric theories remains a challenging but unsolvedproblem.
