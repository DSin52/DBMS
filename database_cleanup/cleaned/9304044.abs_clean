The global structure of 1 + 1 dimensional compact Universe is studied intwo-dimensional model of dilaton gravity.First we give a classical solution corresponding to the spacetime in which aclosed time-like curve appears, and show the instability of this spacetime dueto the existence of matters.We also observe quantum version of such a spacetime having closed timelikecurves never reappear unless the parameters are fine-tuned.
