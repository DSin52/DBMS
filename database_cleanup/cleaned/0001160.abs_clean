The reducible K\"ahler coset space G/S\otimesU(1)^k is discussed in ageometrical approach. We derive the formula which expresses the Riemanncurvature of the reducible K\"ahler coset space in terms of its Killingvectors. The formula manifests the group structure of G. On the basis of thisformula we establish an algebraic method to evaluate the four-fermi coupling ofthe supersymmetric non-linear sigma-model on G/S\otimesU(1)^k at the low-energylimit. As an application we consider the supersymmetric non-linear sigma-modelon E_7/SU(5)\otimesU(1)^3 which contains the three families of {10} + {5^*} +{1} of SU(5) as the pseudo NG fermions. The four-fermi coupling constants amongdiffferent families of the fermions are explicitly given at the low-energylimit.
