We establish a direct correspondence between certain higher-rank p-formChern-Simons topological type theories in the bulk of a manifold with boundaryand particular sectors of supergravity models on the boundary, provided thatcertain boundary conditions are satisfied. The cases we investigate includeeleven-dimensional supergravity and both of the type II theories in tendimensions.
