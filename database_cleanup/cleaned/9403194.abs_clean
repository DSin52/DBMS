We examine the conditions for superconformal invariance and the specific formof the K\"ahler potential for a two-dimensional lagrangian model with $N=2$supersymmetry and superpotential $gX^k$. Away from the superconformal point westudy the renormalization group flow induced by a particular class of K\"ahlerpotentials. We find trajectories which, in the infrared, reach the fixed pointwith a central charge whose value is that of the $N=2$, $A_{k-1}$ minimalmodel.
