We describe a topological effect on configurations of D-branes in thepresence of NS-NS and RR field strength fluxes. The fluxes induce theappearance of chiral anomalies on lower dimensional submanifolds of the D-braneworldvolume. This anomaly is not associated to a dynamical chiral fermiondegree of freedom, but rather should be regarded as an explicit flux-inducedanomalous term (Wess-Zumino term) in the action. The anomaly is cancelled by aninflow mechanism, which exploits the fact that fluxes can act as sources of RRfields. We discuss several applications of this flux-induced anomaly; amongothers, its role in understanding anomaly cancellation in compactificationswith D-branes and fluxes, and the possibility of phase transitions where achiral fermion disappears from the D-brane world-volume spectrum, beingreplaced by an explicit Wess-Zumino term. We comment on the relation amongdifferent mechanisms to obtain four-dimensional chirality in string theory.
