Title: The N U D problem

Authors: J.S.Dowker

Comments: 9 pages, JyTeX. References and comments added. Calculation corrected

The hybrid spectral problem where the field satisfies Dirichlet conditions(D) on part of the boundary of the relevant domain and Neumann (N) on theremainder is discussed in simple terms. A conjecture for the C_1 coefficient ispresented and the conformal determinant on a 2-disc, where the D and N regionsare semi-circles, is derived. Comments on higher coefficients are made.
