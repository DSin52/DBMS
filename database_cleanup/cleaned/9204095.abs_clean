An analysis of the BRST cohomology of the G/G topological models is performedfor the case of $A_1^{(1)}$. Invoking a special free field parametrization ofthe various currents, the cohomology on the corresponding Fock space isextracted. We employ the singular vector structure and fusion rules totranslate the latter into the cohomology on the space of irreduciblerepresentations. Using the physical states we calculate the characters andpartition function, and verify the index interpretation. We twist theenergy-momentum tensor to establish an intriguing correspondence between the${SL(2)\over SL(2)}$ model with level $k={p\over q}-2$ and $(p,q)$ modelscoupled to gravity.
