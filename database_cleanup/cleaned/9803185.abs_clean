We investigate nonperturbative effects in N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric theoriesusing a relation between perturbative and exact anomalies as a starting point.For N=2 supersymmetric SU(n) Yang-Mills theory we derive the general structureof the Picard-Fuchs equations; for N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories wefind holomorphic part of the superpotential (with gluino condensate) exactly.
