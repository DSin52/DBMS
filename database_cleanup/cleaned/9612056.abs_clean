Title: D-brane Interactions, World-sheet Parity and Anti-Symmetric Tensor

Authors: H. Arfaei and M.M. Sheikh-Jabbari

Comments: Tex, 8 pages, No figures, 20kb, a paragraph is added

Using world-sheet parity we show that mixed D and N components of D-stringsare dual to the anti-symmetric $B_{\mu\nu}$ field. The contribution of thelatter is responsible for the reduction and even removal of all theinteractions between two dissimilar D-branes.
