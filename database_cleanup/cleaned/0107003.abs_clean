The similarity of the commutation relations for bosons and quasibosons(fermion pairs) suggests the possibility that all integral spin particlespresently considered to be bosons could be quasibosons. The boson commutationrelations for integral spin particles could be just an approximation to thequasiboson commutation relations that contain an extra term. Although thecommutation relation for quasibosons are slightly more complex, it is simplerpicture of matter in that only fermions and composite particles formed offermions exist. Mesons are usually referred to as bosons, but they must bequasibosons since their internal structure is fermion (quark) pairs. The photonis usually considered to be an elementary boson, but as shown here, existingexperiments do not rule out the possibility that it is also a quasiboson. Weconsider how the quasiboson, composite nature of such a photon might manifestitself.
