We present a large $q$ expansion of the 2d $q$-states Potts model freeenergies up to order 9 in $1/\sqrt{q}$. Its analysis leads us to an ansatzwhich, in the first-order region, incorporates properties inferred from theknown critical regime at $q=4$, and predicts, for $q>4$, the $n^{\rm th}$energy cumulant scales as the power $(3 n /2-2)$ of the correlation length. Theparameter-free energy distributions reproduce accurately, without reference toany interface effect, the numerical data obtained in a simulation for $q=10$with lattices of linear dimensions up to $L=50$. The pure phase specific heatsare predicted to be much larger, at $q\leq10$, than the values extracted fromcurrent finite size scaling analysis of extrema. Implications for safenumerical determinations of interface tensions are discussed.
