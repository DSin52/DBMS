We have constructed a four-fermion theory coupled to aYang-Mills-Chern-Simons gauge field which admits static multi-vortex solutions.This is achieved through the introduction of an anomalous magnetic interationterm in addition to the usual minimal coupling, and the appropriate choice ofthe fermion quartic coupling constant.
