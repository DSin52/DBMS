A new formulation of $c\leq 1$ matter coupled to 2D gravity is proposed. Thismodel, being closely analogous to one in the Polyakov light-cone gauge,possesses well defined global properties which allow to calculate correlationfunctions. As an example, the three point correlation functions of discretestates are found.
