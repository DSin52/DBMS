We find all the classical solutions (minimal surfaces) of open or closedstrings in {\it any} two dimensional curved spacetime. As examples we considerthe SL(2,R)/R two dimensional black hole, and any 4D black hole in theSchwarzschild family, provided the motion is restricted to the time-radialcomponents. The solutions, which describe longitudinaly oscillating foldedstrings (radial oscillations in 4D), must be given in lattice-like patches ofthe worldsheet, and a transfer operation analogous to a transfer matrixdetermines the future evolution. Then the swallowing of a string by a blackhole is analyzed. We find several new features that are not shared by particlemotions. The most surprizing effect is the tunneling of the string into thebare singularity region that lies beyond the black hole that is classicallyforbidden to particles.
