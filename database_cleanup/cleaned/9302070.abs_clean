We study a string-inspired classical 2-D effective field theory with {\itnonsingular} black holes as well as Witten's black hole among its staticsolutions. By a dimensional reduction, the static solutions are related to the$(SL(2,R)_{k}\otimes U(1))/U(1)$ coset model, or more precisely its$O\bigl((\alpha')^{0}\bigr)$ approximation known as the 3-D charged blackstring. The 2-D effective action possesses a propagating degree of freedom, andthe dynamics are highly nontrivial. A collapsing shell is shown to bounce intoanother universe without creating a curvature singularity on its path, and thepotential instability of the Cauchy horizon is found to be irrelevent in thatsome of the infalling observers never approach the Cauchy horizon. Finally a$SL(2,R)_{k}/U(1)$ nonperturbative coset metric, found and advocated by R.Dijkgraaf et.al., is shown to be nonsingular and to coincide with one of thecharged spacetimes found above. Implications of all these geometries arediscussed in connection with black hole evaporation.
