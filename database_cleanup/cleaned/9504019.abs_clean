A number of attempts have recently been made to extend the conjectured $S$duality of Yang Mills theory to gravity. Central to these speculations has beenthe belief that electrically and magnetically charged black holes, the solitonsof quantum gravity, have identical quantum properties. This is not obvious,because although duality is a symmetry of the classical equations of motion, itchanges the sign of the Maxwell action. Nevertheless, we show that the chemicalpotential and charge projection that one has to introduce for electric but notmagnetic black holes exactly compensate for the difference in action in thesemi-classical approximation. In particular, we show that the pair productionof electric black holes is not a runaway process, as one might think if onejust went by the action of the relevant instanton. We also comment on thedefinition of the entropy in cosmological situations, and show that we need tobe more careful when defining the entropy than we are in an asymptotically-flatcase.
