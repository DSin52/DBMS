The collision of plane waves corresponding to massless states of closedstring is considered in $D$-dimensional space-time. The reduced tree leveleffective action is known to be manifestly $O(d,d)$ invariant, $d$ being thenumber of transverse spatial dimensions in the collision process. We adopt acoset space reformulation of the effective two dimensional theory and discussthe relation of this process with classical integrable systems in twodimensions in the presence of gravity. We show how it is possible to generatenew backgrounds for the scattering process, from known background solutions tothe equations of motion, in the coset reformulation. We present explicitcalculations for the case of four space-time dimensions as an illustrativeexample.
