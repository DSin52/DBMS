We prove that the Fourier transform of the exponential $e^{-\b V(R)}$ of the{\bf static} interquark potential in QCD is positive. It has been shown byEliott Lieb some time ago that this property allows in the same limit of staticspin independent potential proving certain mass relation between baryons withdifferent quark flavors.
