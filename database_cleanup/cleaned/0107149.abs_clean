Dual field theory realisations are given for linearised gravity in terms ofgauge fields in exotic representations of the Lorentz group. The fieldequations and dual representations are discussed for a wide class of higherspin gauge fields. For non-linear Einstein gravity, such transformations can beimplemented locally in light-cone gauge, or partially implemented in thepresence of a Killing vector. Sources and the relation to Kaluza-Kleinmonopoles are discussed.
