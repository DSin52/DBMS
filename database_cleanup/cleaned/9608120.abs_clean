Title: Concerning a natural compatibility condition between the action and the

renormalized operator productComments: 23 pages, Latex

In this article we note that in a number of situations the operator productand the classical action satisfy a natural compatibility condition. We consider(functoriality) of the compatibility condition suggests that it be used forgeometrical applications of renormalized functional integration. Second, thecompatibility can be used as the definition of a category; consideration ofthis category as the central object of study in quantum field theory seems tohave quite some advantages over previously introduced theories of the type``S-matrix theory'', ``Vertex operator algebras'', since this seems to be theonly category in which both the action and the expectation values enter, thetwo being linked roughly speaking by a combination of the Frobenius propertyand the renormalized Schwinger-Dyson equation.
