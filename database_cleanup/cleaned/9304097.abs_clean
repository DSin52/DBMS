We consider a Pauli particle in a Coulomb field. The supersymmetricHamiltonian is constructed, by explicitly giving the two supercharges $Q_{1}$and $ Q_{2}$ in the full three-dimensional space and which together with theHamiltonian, are shown to constitute an $S(2)$ superalgebra. This offers analternative way of grouping the energy eigenstates into irreduciblerepresentations of this symmetry group of the Hamiltonian.
