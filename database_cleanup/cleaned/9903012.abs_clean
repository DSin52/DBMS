We analyse the dipole solution of heterotic string theory in four dimensions.It has the structure of monopole and anti-monopole connected by flux line(string). Due to growing coupling near the poles, the length of the stringdiverges. However, exploiting the self-duality of heterotic string theory infour dimension, we argue that this string is correctly described in terms ofdual variables.
