Explicit expressions for the generators of the quantum superalgebra$U_q[gl(n/m)]$ acting on a class of irreducible representations are given. Thefor these a Gel'fand-Zetlin basis is known. The verification of the quantumsuperalgebra relations to be satisfied is shown to reduce to a set of$q$-number identities.
