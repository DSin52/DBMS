It is argued that the gauge anomalies are only the artefacts of quantum fieldtheory when certain subtleties are not taken into account. With the Berry'sphase needed to satisfy certain boundary conditions of the generating pathintegral, the gauge anomalies associated with homotopically nontrivial gaugetransformations are shown explicitly to be eliminated, without any extraquantum fields introduced. This is in contra-distinction to other quantisationsof `anomalous' gauge theory where extra, new fields are introduced toexplicitly cancel the anomalies.
