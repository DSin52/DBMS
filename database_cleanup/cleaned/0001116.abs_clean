AstronThe massive SU(2) gauge field theory coupled with fermions is considered in2+1 dimensions. Quark energy spectrum and radiative shift in constant externalnonabelian field, being exact solution of the gauge field equations with theChern-Simons term, are calculated. Under the condition $m = \theta/4$ the quarkstate is shown to be supersymmetric.
