Title: On Hurwitz Transformations

Authors: M. Hage Hassan and M. Kibler

Comments: 30 pages, Tex, LYCEN 9110

A bibliography on the Hurwitz transformations is given. We deal here, withsome details, with two particular Hurwitz transformations, viz, the $\grq \to\grt$ Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation and its $\grh \to \grc$ compactextension. These transformations are derived in the context ofFock-Bargmann-Schwinger calculus with special emphasis on angular momentumtheory.
