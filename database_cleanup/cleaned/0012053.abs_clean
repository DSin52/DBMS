We investigate how the integrability conditions for conformal anomaliesconstrain the form of the effective action in even-dimensional quantumgeometry. We show that the effective action of four-dimensional quantumgeometry (4DQG) satisfying integrability has a manifestly diffeomorphisminvariant and regularization scheme-independent form. We then generalize thearguments to six dimensions and propose a model of 6DQG. A hypothesized form ofthe 6DQG effective action is given.
