We study the quantum integrability of the O(N) nonlinear $\sigma$ (nls) modeland the O(N) Gross-Neveu (GN) model on the half-line. We show that the \nlsmodel is integrable with Neumann, Dirichlet and a mixed boundary condition, andthat the GN model is integrable if $\psi_+^a\x=\pm\psi_-^a\x$. We also commenton the boundary condition found by Corrigan and Sheng for the O(3) nls model.
