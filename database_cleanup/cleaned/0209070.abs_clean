Title: The problem of Initial Data in Cosmology and Conformal General

RelativityAuthors: Boris Barbashov, Piotr Flin, and Victor Pervushin

Comments: 17 pages, 2 figures. Talk submitted to the XXV International Workshop

on Fundamental Problems of High Energy Physics and Field Theory, Geometricaland topological ideas in modern physics (25-28 June 2002, Protvino, Russia)The problem of initial data in cosmology and general relativity is consideredby analogy with the Cauchy problem in Newton mechanics where initial datareveal the Galilei symmetry of physical laws, i.e., equations of motion.We list a set of theoretical and observational arguments (including thelatest Supernova data, primordial nucleosynthesis, CMB-temperature, and baryonasymmetry) in favour of conformal symmetry of physical laws in a unified fieldtheory of all interactions, where all dimensional parameters are hidden inmasses treated as a scalar (dilaton) field.
