The conditions that allow us to consider the vacuum expectation value of theenergy-momentum tensor as a statistical average, at some particulartemperature, are given. When the mean value of created particles is stationary,a planckian distribution for the field modes is obtained. In the masslessapproximation, the temperature dependence is as that corresponding to aradiation dominated Friedmann-like model.
