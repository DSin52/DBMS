We obtain the T-duality transformations of space-time spinors (thesupersymmetry transformation parameters, gravitinos and dilatinos) of type-IItheories in curved backgrounds with an isometry. The transformation of thespinor index is shown to be a consequence of the twist that T-dualityintroduces between the left and right-moving local Lorentz frames. The resultis then used to derive the T-duality action on Ramond-Ramond field strengthsand potentials in a simple way. We also discuss the massive IIA theory and,using duality, give a short derivation of ``mass''-dependent terms in theWess-Zumino actions on the D-brane worldvolumes.
