Title: Quantum field theory can be UV finite if it is taken as effective one

Comments: 11 pages, LaTex, no figures, an explanation of hep-th/9708104

This is a further explanation of a new and simple renormalization approachrecently proposed by the author (hep-th/9708104, Ref. [1], that is somewhatsketchy) for any ordinary QFT (whether renormalizable or not) in any spacetimedimension. We discussed the physical motivations of the new approach and itsefficiency when compared to the existent renormalization approaches. Some otherimportant issues related are briefly touched.
