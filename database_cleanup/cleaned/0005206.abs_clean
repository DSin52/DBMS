We discuss the compatibility between the weaker energy condition and thestability of Gregory, Rubakov and Sibiryakov (GRS) model. Because the GRSspacetime violates the weak energy condition, it may cause the instability. Inthe GRS model, the four dimensional gravity can be described by the massive KKmodes with the resonance. Hence, instead of considering the weaker energycondition for graviton modes ($h_{\mu\nu}$). No tachyonic condition ($m^2_h\geq 0$) is satisfied because the lowest state $m_h=0$ is supersymmetric vacuumstate. Further, no ghost state condition is achieved if one requires someturns out that, although the GRS spacetime does not satisfy the weaker energycondition, it is stable against small perturbation.
