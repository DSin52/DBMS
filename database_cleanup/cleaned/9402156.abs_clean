The $c=1$ matrix model is equivalent to $1+1$ dimensional string theory.However, the tachyon self-interaction in the former is local, while in thelatter it is nonlocal due to the gravitational, dilaton and higher stringfields. By studying scattering of classical pulses we show that the appropriatenonlocal field redefinition converts the local matrix model interaction intothe expected string form. In particular, we see how the asymptotic behavior ofthe gravitational field appears in the scattering.
