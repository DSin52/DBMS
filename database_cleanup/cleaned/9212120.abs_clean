A general solution to the $D=2$ 1-loop beta functions equations includingtachyonic back reaction on the metric is presented. Dynamical black hole(classical) solutions representing gravitational collapse of tachyons areconstructed. A discussion on the correspondence with the matrix-model approachis given.
