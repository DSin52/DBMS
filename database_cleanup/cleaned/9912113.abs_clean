This report is an extension of previous one hep-th/9812189. Several quantummechanical wave equations for $p$-branes are proposed. The most relevant$p$-brane quantum mechanical wave equations determine the quantum dynamicsinvolving the creation/destruction of $p$-dimensional loops of topology $S^p$,moving in a $D$ dimensional spacetime background, in the quantum state $\Phi$.To implement full covariance we are forced to enlarge the ordinary Relativityprinciple to a $new$ Relativity principle, suggested earlier by the authorbased on the construction of {\bf C}-space, and also by Pezzaglia'sPolydimensional Relativity, where all dimensions and signatures of spacetimeshould be included on the same footing.
