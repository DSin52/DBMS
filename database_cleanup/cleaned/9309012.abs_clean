We study fermionic one-matrix, two-matrix and $D$-dimensional gauge invariantmatrix models. In all cases we derive loop equations which unambiguouslydetermine the large-$N$ solution. For the one-matrix case the solution isobtained for an arbitrary interaction potential and turns out to be equivalentto the one for the Hermitean one-matrix model with a logarithmic potential and,therefore, belongs to the same universality class. The explicit solutions forthe fermionic two-matrix and $D$-dimensional matrix models are obtained atlarge $N$ (or in the spherical approximation) for the quadratic potential.
