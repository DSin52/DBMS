A method to determine the full structure of the space of local operators ofmassive integrable field theories, based on the form factor bootstrap approachis presented. This method is applied to the integrable perturbations of theIsing conformal point. It is found that the content of local operators can beexpressed in terms of fermionic sum representations of the characters $\c(q)$of the Virasoro irreducible representations of the minimal model $\M_{3,4}$.The space of operators factorises into chiral components as $Z=\sum \c(q)\c(\q)$, but with the relation $\q=q^{-1}$.
