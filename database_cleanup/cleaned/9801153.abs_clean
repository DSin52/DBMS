Title: Supersymmetric Structure of Spacetime and Matter -Superon Quintet

Hypothesis-Authors: Kazunari Shima

Comments: 13 pages, Latex

A unified description of spacetime and matter at the Planck scale is proposedby using the irreducible representation of N=10 extended Super-Poincar\'ealgebra, where all matters and all forces except the graviton are thesupersymmetric composites made of the fundamental objects with spin 1/2,superon quintet. All the local gauge interactions in GUTs are investigatedsystematically by using the superon diagrams. The proton is stable and theflavor changing neutral current process is suppressed in the superon picturesof GUTs. The fundamental action of the superon model is proposed. Thecharacteristic predictions which can be tested in the (coming) high energyexperiments are discussed briefly.
