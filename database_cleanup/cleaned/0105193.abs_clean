Title: Recursive Graphical Construction of Tadpole-Free Feynman Diagrams and

Their Weights in phi^4-TheoryAuthors: Axel Pelster and Konstantin Glaum

Comments: The article is a contribution to the book "Fluctuating Paths and

Fields - Dedicated to Hagen Kleinert on the Occasion of His 60th Birthday",Eds. Wolfhard Janke, Axel Pelster, Hans-Juergen Schmidt, and Michael Bachmann(World Scientific, Singapore, 2001), p. 235-246We review different approaches to the graphical generation of thetadpole-free Feynman diagrams of the self-energy and the one-particleirreducible four-point function. These are needed for calculating the criticalexponents of the euclidean multicomponent scalar phi^4-theory withrenormalization techniques in d=4-epsilon dimensions.
