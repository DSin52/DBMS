A duality relationship between certain brane configurations in type IIA andtype IIB string theory is explored by exploiting the geometrical origins ofeach theory in M-theory. The configurations are dual ways of realising thenon-perturbative dynamics of a four dimensional N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) gaugetheory with four or fewer favours of fermions in the fundamental, and thespectral curve which organizes these dynamics plays a prominent role in eachcase. This is an illustration of how non-trivial F-theory backgrounds followfrom M-theory ones, hopefully demystifying somewhat the origins of the former.
