Comments: 13 pages Latex; Contribution to 2002 Peyresq - 7 workshop

This article treats the generalisation to brane dynamics of the covariantcanonical variational procedure leading to the construction of a conservedbilinear symplectic current in the manner originally developped by Witten,Zuckerman and others in the context of field theory. After a generalpresentation, including a review of the relationships between the various(Lagrangian, Eulerian and other) relevant kinds of variation, the procedure isillustrated by application to the particularly simple case of branes of theDirac-Goto-Nambu type, in which internal fields are absent.
