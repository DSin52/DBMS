It is noted that a finite Penrose limit for brane probes with non-zeroworldvolume fluxes does not generically exist; this is closely related to theobservation by Blau et al that for a brane probe the Penrose limit isequivalent to an infinite-tension limit. It is shown that when the limitexists, however, the number of supersymmetries preserved by the probe does notdecrease.
