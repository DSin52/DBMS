The quantum mechanics of a system of charged particles interacting with amagnetic field on Riemann surfaces is studied. We explicitly construct the wavefunctions of ground states in the case of a metric proportional to the Chernform of the $\theta$-bundle, and the wave functions of the Landau levels in thecase of the the Poincar{\' e} metric. The degeneracy of the the Landau levelsis obtained by using the Riemann-Roch theorem. Then we construct the Laughlinwave function on Riemann surfaces and discuss the mathematical structure hiddenin the Laughlin wave function. Moreover the degeneracy of the Laughlin statesis also discussed.
