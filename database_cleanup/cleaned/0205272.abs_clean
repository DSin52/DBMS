The Polyakov world-line path integral describing the propagation of gluonfield quanta is constructed by employing the background gauge fixing method andis subsequently applied to analytically compute the divergent terms of the one(gluonic) loop effective action to fourth order in perturbation theory. Themerits of the proposed approach is that, to a given order, it reduces toperforming two integrations, one over a set of Grassmann and one over a set ofFeynman-type parameters through which one manages to accomodate all Feynmandiagrams entering the computation at once.
