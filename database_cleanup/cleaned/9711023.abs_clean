We derive the large-N spectral correlators of complex matrix ensembles withweights that in the context of Dirac spectra correspond to N_f massivefermions, and prove that the results are universal in the appropriate scalinglimits. The resulting microscopic spectral densities satisfy exact spectral sumrules of massive Dirac operators in QCD.
