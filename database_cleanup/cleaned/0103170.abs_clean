We study string compactifications with sixteen supersymmetries. The modulispace for these compactifications becomes quite intricate in lower dimensions,partly because there are many different irreducible components. We focusprimarily, but not exclusively, on compactifications to seven or moreconstructions we study include toroidal compactifications of the heterotic/typeI strings, asymmetric orbifolds, and orientifolds. In addition, we describeless conventional M and F theory compactifications on smooth spaces. The lastclass of vacua considered are compactifications on singular spaces withnon-trivial discrete fluxes.We find a number of new components in the string moduli space. Contained insome of these components are M theory compactifications with novel kinds of``frozen'' singularities. We are naturally led to conjecture the existence ofnew dualities relating spaces with different singular geometries and fluxes. Asour study of these vacua unfolds, we also learn about additional topicssurfaces, and novel physics (and puzzles) from equivariant K-theory. Lastly, wecomment on how the data we gain about the M theory three-form might beinterpreted.
