The generalized kinetic term of a dilaton gives the classical superinflationwithout recourse to any potential, and the quantum version of the dilatongravity exhibits the finite curvature and graceful exit. For $p=2$ case, themodel corresponds to the RST quantization of the s-wave sector of thefour-dimensional Einstein cosmology. Further, the de Sitter universe isrealized for $p=8$ and the smooth transition to the Minkowski space-time ispossible. Even in the accelerating contraction case of the universe for$-4<p<0$, the curvature singularity does not appear in a certain branch.
