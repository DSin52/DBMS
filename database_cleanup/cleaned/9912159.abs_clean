The S-duality transformations in type IIB string theory can be seen as localU(1) transformations in type IIB supergravity. We use this approach toconstruct the $SL(2,Z)$ multiplets associated to supersymmetric backgrounds oftype IIB string theory and the transformation laws of their correspondingKilling spinors.
