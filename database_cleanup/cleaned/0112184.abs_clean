We construct a consistent quantum field theory of a free massless(pseudo)scalar field in 1+1-dimensional space-times free of infrareddivergences. We show that a continuous symmetry of (pseudo)scalar fieldtranslations is spontaneously broken. Goldstone bosons appear as quanta of afree massless (pseudo)scalar field. We show that the main inequality betweenvacuum expectation values of certain operators which has been used for thederivation of the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg theorem is fulfilled in the quantumfield theory of a free massless (pseudo)scalar field free of infrareddivergences.
