Conformally compactified phase space is conceived as an automorphism spacefor the global action of the extended conformal group. Space time and momentumspace appear then as conformally dual, that is conjugate with respect toconformal reflections. If now the former, as generally agreed, is appropriatefor the description of classical mechanics in euclidean geometrical form, thenthe latter results appropriate for the description of quantum mechanics inspinor geometrical form. In such description, fermion multiplets will naturallyappear as consequence of higher symmetries and furthermore, the euclideangeometry, bilinearly resulting from that of spinors, will a priori guaranteethe absence of ultraviolet divergences when dealing with quantum fieldtheories. Some further possible consequences of conformal reflections ofinterest for physics, are briefly outlined.
