Dynamics of quantized free fields ( of spin 0 and 1/2 ) contained in asubspace $V_*$ of an N+4 dimensional flat space $V$ is studied. The space $V_*$is considered as a neighborhood of a four dimensional submanifold $M$arbitrarily embedded into $V$. We show that Einstein SO(N)-Yang-Mills Higgstheory is induced as a low energy effective theory of the system. Gravity,SO(N) gauge fields and Higgs fields are obtained from embedding functions of$M$.
