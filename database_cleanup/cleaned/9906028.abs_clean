Title: Regularization of Automorphic Functions of Manifolds with Special

K\"ahler GeometryAuthors: Nelson Vanegas

Comments: LaTeX2e, 31 Pages

In this paper we find automorphic functions of coset manifolds with specialK\"ahler geometry. We use \zeta-functions to regularize an infinite productover integers which belong to a duality-invariant lattice, this product isknown to produce duality-invariant functions. In turn these functionscorrespond to Eisenstein series which can be understood as string theoryamplitudes that receive contributions from BPS states. The Ansatz isconstructed using the coset manifold SU(1,n)\over SU(n) \times U(1) as anexample but it can be generalized. Automorphic functions play an important rolein the calculation of threshold corrections to gauge coupling and other stringyphenomena. We also find some connections between the theory of Abelianvarieties and moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau manifolds
