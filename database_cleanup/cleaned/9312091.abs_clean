This is second of the two invited lectures presented (by D. V. Ahluwalia) atBeyond' 93.'' The text is essentially based on a recent publication by thepresent authors [Mod. Phys. Lett. A (in press)]. Here, after briefly reviewingthe $(j,0)\oplus(0,j)$ Dirac-like construct in the front form, we present adetailed construction of the $(j,0)\oplus(0,j)$ Majorana-like fields.
