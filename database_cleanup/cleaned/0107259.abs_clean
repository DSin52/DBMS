Title: Dark Matter and Dark Energy

Comments: Physics summary talk at the conference The Dark Universe

Energy and Gravity, Space Telescope Institute, April, 2001. Latex, 9 pagesFor physicists, recent developments in astrophysics and cosmology presentexciting challenges. We are conducting "experiments" in energy regimes some ofwhich will be probed by accelerators in the near future, and others which areinevitably the subject of more speculative theoretical investigations. Darkmatter is an area where we have hope of making discoveries both withaccelerator experiments and dedicated searches. Inflation and dark energy liein regimes where presently our only hope for a fundamental understanding liesin string theory.
