We present a topological version of two dimensional dilaton supergravity. Itis obtained by gauging an extension of the super-Poincar\'e algebra in twospace-time dimensions. This algebra is obtained by an unconventionalcontraction of the super de Sitter algebra. Besides the generators of the superde Sitter algebra it has one more fermionic generator and two more bosonicgenerators one of them being a central charge. The gauging of this algebra isperformed in the usual way. Unlike some proposals for a dilaton supergravitytheory we obtain a model which is non-local in the gravitino field.
