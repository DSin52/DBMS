In the AdS/CFT correspondence a chiral primary is described by a supergravitysolution with mass equaling angular momentum. For AdS_3 X S^3 we are led toconical defects, Aichelburg-Sexl type metrics generated by rotating particles,and metrics generated by giant gravitons. We find that the first two of theseare special cases of the complete family of chiral primary metrics which can bewritten down using the general solution in hep-th/0109154, but they correspondto two extreme limits - the conical defect metrics map to CFT states generatedby twist operators that are all identical, while the Aichelburg-Sexl metricsyield a wide dispersion in the orders of these twists. The giant gravitonsolutions in contrast do not represent configurations of the D1-D5 bound state;they correspond to fragmenting this system into two or more pieces. We look atthe large distance behavior of the supergravity fields and observe that theexcitation of these fields is linked to the existence of dispersion in theorders and spins of the twist operators creating the chiral primary in the CFT.
