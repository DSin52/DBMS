We complete the classification of (2,2) string vacua that can be constructedby diagonal twists of tensor products of minimal models with ADE invariants.Using the \LG\ framework, we compute all spectra from inequivalent models ofthis type. The completeness of our results is only possible by systematicallyavoiding the huge redundancies coming from permutation symmetries of tensorproducts. We recover the results for (2,2) vacua of an extensive computation ofsimple current invariants by Schellekens and Yankielowitz, and find 4additional mirror pairs of spectra that were missed by their stochastic method.For the model $(1)^9$ we observe a relation between redundant spectra andgroups that are related in a particular way.
