hep-th/0108152, see added notes at end of paperWe perform a canonical and BRST analysis of a seven-dimensional Chern-Simonstheory on a manifold with boundary. The main result is that the 7D theoryinduces for consistency a chiral two-form on the 6D boundary. We also commenton similar behaviour in a five-dimensional Chern-Simons theory relevant for$\N=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions.
