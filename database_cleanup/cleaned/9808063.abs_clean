Title: Initial Conditions in Pre-Big Bang

Comments: 5 pages, Latex with sprocl.sty, based on talks given at PASCOS-98 and

CAPP-98This note is a summary of the work reported in hep-th/9801073. We give abrief discussion of the fine tuning problem in pre-big bang cosmology. We usethe flatness problem as our test case, and in addition to the exact numericallimits on initial conditions, we highlight the differences between pre-big bangand standard inflation. The main difference is that in pre-big bang theuniverse must be smooth and flat in an exponentially large domain already atthe beginning of the dilaton-driven inflation.
