We investigate the existence of bound states in a one-dimensional quantumsystem of $N$ identical particles interacting with each other through aninverse square potential. This system is equivalent to the Calogero modelwithout the confining term. The effective Hamiltonian of this system in theradial direction admits a one-parameter family of self-adjoint extensions andthe negative energy bound states occur when most general boundary conditionsare considered. We find that these bound states exist only when $N=3,4$ and forcertain values of the system parameters. The effective Hamiltonian for thesystem is related to the Virasoro algebra and the bound state wavefunctionsexhibit a scaling behaviour in the limit of small inter-particle separation.
