We study the thermodynamic relations of conformal field theories (CFTs),which are holographically dual to anti-de Sitter-Schwarzschild bulkspace-times. A Cardy-Verlinde formula is derived thermodynamically for CFTsliving on S^n x R with S^n having an arbitrary radius. The Hawking-Page phasetransition of the CFT is described using Landau's theory of phase transitions,and an alternative derivation of the Cardy-Verlinde formula is presented. Thecondensate in the high temperature phase is identified as being composed ofradiational matter.
