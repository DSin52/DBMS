In this lecture we review some of the recent developments in string theory onan introductory and qualitative level. In particular we focus on S-T-Udualities of toroidally compactified ten-dimensional string theories andoutline the connection to M-theory. Dualities among string vacua with lesssupersymmetries in six and four space-time dimensions is discussed and theconcept of F-theory is briefly presented. (Lecture given by J. Louis at theWorkshop on Gauge Theories, Applied Supersymmetry and Quantum Gravity, ImperialCollege, London, UK, July 5--10, 1996.)
