Title: Komaba Lectures on Noncommutative Solitons and D-Branes

Authors: Jeffrey A.Harvey

Comments: 43 pages, harvmac (b)

These lectures provide an introduction to noncommutative geometry and itsorigins in quantum mechanics and to the construction of solitons innoncommutative field theory. These ideas are applied to the construction ofD-branes as solitons of the tachyon field in noncommutative open string theory.A brief discussion is given of the K-theory classification of D-brane charge interms of the K-theory of operator algebras. Based on lectures presented at theKomaba 2000 workshop, Nov. 14-16 2000.
