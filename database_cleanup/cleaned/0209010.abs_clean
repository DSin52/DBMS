We discuss the construction of multi-caloron solutions with non-trivialholonomy, both as approximate superpositions and exact self-dual solutions. Thecharge k SU(n) moduli space can be described by kn constituent monopoles. Exactsolutions help us to understand how these constituents can be seen asindependent objects, which seems not possible with the approximatesuperposition. An "impurity scattering" calculation provides relatively simpleexpressions. Like at zero temperature an explicit parametrization requiressolving a quadratic ADHM constraint, achieved here for a class of axiallysymmetric solutions. We will discuss the properties of these exact solutions indetail, but also demonstrate that interesting results can be obtained withoutexplicitly solving for the constraint.
