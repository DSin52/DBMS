A formula is proposed for continuing physical correlation functions tonon-integer numbers of dimensions, expressing them as infinite weighted sumsover the same correlation functions in arbitrary integer dimensions. Theformula is motivated by studying the strong coupling expansion, but the endresult makes no reference to any perturbation theory. It is shown that theformula leads to the correct dimension dependence in weak coupling perturbationtheory at one loop.
