The existence of non-local charges, generating a Yangian symmetry isdiscussed in generalized chiral Gross-Neveu models. Their conservation can beproven by a finite-loop perturbative computation, the order of which isdetermined from group theoretic constants and is independent of the number offlavors. Examples, where the 1-loop calculation is sufficient, include theSO(n)-models and other more exotic groups and representations.
