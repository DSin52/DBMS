Quantum $A_2$-Toda field theory in two dimensions is investigated based onthe method of quantizing canonical free field. Toda exponential operatorsassociated with the fundamental weights are constructed to the fourth order inthe cosmological constant. This leads us to a conjecture for the exact operatorsolution.
