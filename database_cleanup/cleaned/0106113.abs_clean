A holographic duality is proposed relating quantum gravity on dS_D(D-dimensional de Sitter space) to conformal field theory on a single S^{D-1}((D-1)-sphere), in which bulk de Sitter correlators with points on the boundaryare related to CFT correlators on the sphere, and points on I^+ (the futureboundary of dS_D) are mapped to the antipodal points on S^{D-1} relative tothose on I^-. For the case of dS_3, which is analyzed in some detail, thecentral charge of the CFT_2 is computed in an analysis of the asymptoticsymmetry group at I^\pm. This dS/CFT proposal is supported by the computationof correlation functions of a massive scalar field. In general the dual CFT maybe non-unitary and (if for example there are sufficently massive stablescalars) contain complex conformal weights. We also consider the physicalregion O^- of dS_3 corresponding to the causal past of a timelike observer,whose holographic dual lives on a plane rather than a sphere. O^- can befoliated by asymptotically flat spacelike slices. Time evolution along theseslices is generated by L_0+\bar L_0, and is dual to scale transformations inthe boundary CFT_2.
