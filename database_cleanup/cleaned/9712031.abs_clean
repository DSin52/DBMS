I discuss a realization of stress-tensor for parafermion theories followingthe generalized Frenkel-Kac construction for higher level Kac-Moody algebras.All the fields are obtained from $d$=rank free bosons compactified on torus.This gives an alternative realization of Virasoro algebra in terms of anon-local correction of a free field construction which does not fit the usualbackground charge of Feigin-Fuchs approach.
