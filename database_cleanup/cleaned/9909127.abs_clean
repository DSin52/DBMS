Title: Localized Gravity on Branes in anti-de Sitter Spaces

Comments: 9 pages in LaTex

We discuss the conditions under which 4D gravity is localized on domain wallsin 5D anti-de Sitter spaces. Our approach is based on considering the limits inwhich the localized gravity decouples. We find that gravity is localized if thewall is located a finite distance from the boundary of the anti-de Sitter spaceand has a finite tension. In addition, it has to be a $\delta$-function sourceof gravity.
