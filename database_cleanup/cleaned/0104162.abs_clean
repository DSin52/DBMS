We show that a suitable deformation of the algebra $h_k(1)$ of the creationand annihilation operators for a complex scalar field, initially quantized inMinkowski space--time, induces the canonical quantization of the same field ina generic gravitational background. This discloses the physical meaning of thedeformation parameter $q$ which turns out to be related to the gravitationalfield. The thermal properties are re-obtained in this formalism, and theapplication to Schwarzschild and Rindler space-times are carried out.
