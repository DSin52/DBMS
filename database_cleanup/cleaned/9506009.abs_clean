Title: Extra dimensions and color confinement

Comments: 9 pages, Revtex 3.0

We consider an extension of the ordinary four dimensional Minkowski space byintroducing additional dimensions which have their own Lorentz transformation.Particles can transform in a different way under each Lorentz group. We showthat only quark interactions are slightly modified and that color confinementis automatic since these degrees of freedom run only in the extra dimensions.No compactification of the extra dimensions is needed.
