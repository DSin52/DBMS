The AdS/CFT conjecture relates quantum gravity on Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaceto a conformal field theory (CFT) defined on the spacetime boundary. Weinterpret the CFT in terms of natural analogues of the bulk S-matrix. Our firstapproach finds the bulk S-matrix as a limit of scattering from an AdS bubbleimmersed in a space admitting asymptotic states. Next, we show how theperiodicity of geodesics obstructs a standard LSZ prescription for scatteringwithin global AdS. To avoid this subtlety we partition global AdS into patcheswithin which CFT correlators reconstruct transition amplitudes of AdS states.Finally, we use the AdS/CFT duality to propose a large N collective fieldtheory that describes local, perturbative supergravity. Failure of locality inquantum gravity should be related to the difference between the collective 1/Nexpansion and genuine finite N dynamics.
