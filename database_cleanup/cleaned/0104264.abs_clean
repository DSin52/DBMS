We formulate noncommutative three-dimensional (3d) gravity by making use ofits connection with 3d Chern-Simons theory. In the Euclidean sector, weconsider the particular example of topology $T^2 \times R$ and show that the 3dblack hole solves the noncommutative equations. We then consider the black holeon a constant U(1) background and show that the black hole charges (mass andangular momentum) are modified by the presence of this background.
