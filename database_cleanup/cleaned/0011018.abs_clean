We define an iterative procedure to obtain a non-abelian generalization ofthe Born-Infeld action. This construction is made possible by the use of thesevere restrictions imposed by kappa-symmetry. In this paper we will presentall bosonic terms in the action up to terms quartic in the Yang-Mills fieldstrength and all fermion bilinear terms up to terms cubic in the fieldstrength. Already at this order the fermionic terms do not satisfy thesymmetric trace-prescription.
