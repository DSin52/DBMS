Based on the extended BRST formalism of Batalin, Fradkin and Vilkovisky, weperform a general algebraic analysis of the BRST anomalies in superstringtheory of Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond. Consistency conditions on the BRST anomaliesare completely solved. The genuine super-Virasoro anomaly is identified withthe essentially unique solution to the consistency condition without anyreference to a particular gauge for the 2D supergravity fields. In aconfiguration space where metric and gravitino fields are properly constructed,general form of the super-Weyl anomaly is obtained from the super-Virasoroanomaly as its descendant.We give a novel local action of super-Liouville type, which plays a role ofWess-Zumino-Witten term shifting the super-Virasoro anomaly into the super-Weylanomaly. These results reveal a hierarchial relationship in the BRST anoamlies.
