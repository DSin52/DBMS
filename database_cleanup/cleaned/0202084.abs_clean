We give the general presciption for calculating the moduli of irreducible,stable SU(n) holomorphic vector bundles with positive spectral covers overelliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds. Explicit results are presented forHirzebruch base surfaces B=F_r. The transition moduli that are produced bychirality changing small instanton phase transitions are defined andspecifically enumerated. The origin of these moduli, as the deformations of thespectral cover restricted to the ``lift'' of the horizontal curve of theM5-brane, is discussed. We present an alternative description of the transitionmoduli as the sections of rank n holomorphic vector bundles over the M5-branecurve and give explicit examples. Vector bundle moduli appear as gauge singletscalar fields in the effective low-energy actions of heterotic superstrings andheterotic M-theory.
