We study superstrings with orientifold projections and with generalized openstring boundary conditions (D-branes). We find two types of consistencycondition, one related to the algebra of Chan-Paton factors and the other tocancellation of divergences. One consequence is that the Dirichlet 5-branes ofthe Type I theory carry a symplectic gauge group, as required by stringduality. As another application we study the Type I theory on a $K3$ $Z_2$orbifold, finding a family of consistent theories with various unitary andsymplectic subgroups of $U(16) \times U(16)$. We argue that the $K3$ orbifoldwith spin connection embedded in gauge connection corresponds to an interactingconformal field theory in the Type I theory.
