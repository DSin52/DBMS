We describe a real-time classical solution of $c=1$ string field theorywritten in terms of the phase space density, $u(p,q,t)$, of the equivalentfermion theory. The solution corresponds to tunnelling of a single fermionabove the filled fermi sea and leads to amplitudes that go as $\exp(- C/\gst)$. We discuss how one can use this technique to describe non-perturbativeeffects in the Marinari-Parisi model. We also discuss implications of this typeof solution for the two-dimensional black hole.
