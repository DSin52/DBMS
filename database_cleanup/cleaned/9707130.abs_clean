We perform a generalised Scherk-Schwarz reduction of the effective action ofthe heterotic string on T^6 to obtain a massive N=4 supergravity theory in fourdimensions. The local symmetry-group of the resulting d=4 theory includes aHeisenberg group, which is a subgroup of the global O(6,6+n) obtained in thestandard reduction. We show explicitly that the same theory can be obtained bygauging this Heisenberg group in d=4, N=4 supergravity.
