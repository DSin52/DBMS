We investigate gravitational effects of extreme, non-extreme and ultra-extreme domain walls in the presence of a dilaton field. The dilaton is ascalar field without self-interaction that couples to the matter po- tentialthat is responsible for the formation of the wall. Motivated by superstring andsupergravity theories, we consider both an exponential dilaton coupling(parametrized with the coupling constant alpha and the case where the couplingis self-dual, i.e. it has an extremum for a fi- nite value of the dilaton. Foran exponential dilaton coupling, extreme walls (which are static planarconfigurations with surface energy density sigma_ext saturating thecorresponding Bogomol'nyi bound) have a naked (planar) singularity outside thewall for alpha>1, while for alpha smaller or equal to 1 the singularity isnull. On the other hand, non-extreme walls (bubbles with two insides andsigma_non > sigma_ext and ultra-extreme walls bubbles of false vacuum decaywith sigma_ultra < sigma_ext always have naked singularities. There aresolutions with self-dual couplings, which reduce to singularity-free vacuumdomain wall space--times. However, only non- and ultra-extreme walls of such atype are dynamically stable.
