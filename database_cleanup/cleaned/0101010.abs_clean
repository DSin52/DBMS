We argue that type II string theories contain unstable NS4 branes, whichdescend from a conjectured unstable M4 brane of M-theory. Assuming that an M2brane can arise in M5 brane/anti-brane annihilation, the unstable M4 brane, andalso an unstable M3 brane, must exist as sphalerons. We compare the tensions ofthe unstable NS4 branes, M4 brane, and related type II unstable D-branes, andpresent 11d supergravity solutions for unstable Mp branes for all p. We studythe Z_2 gauge symmetry on the worldvolume of unstable branes, and argue that itcan never be unbroken in the presence of lower brane charge.
