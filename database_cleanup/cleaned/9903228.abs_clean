The holographic connection between large $N$ Super Yang Mills theory andgravity in anti deSitter space requires unfamiliar behavior of the SYM theoryin the limit that the curvature of the AdS geometry becomes small. Theparadoxical behavior includes superluminal oscillations and negative energydensity. These effects typically occur in the SYM description of events whichtake place far from the boundary of AdS when the signal from the event arrivesat the boundary. The paradoxes can be resolved by assuming a very richcollection of hidden degrees of freedom of the SYM theory which storeinformation but give rise to no local energy density. These degrees of freedom,called precursors, are needed to make possible sudden apparently acausal energymomentum flows. Such behavior would be impossible in classical field theory asa consequence of the positivity of the energy density. However we show thatthese effects are not only allowed in quantum field theory but that we canmodel them in free quantum field theory.
