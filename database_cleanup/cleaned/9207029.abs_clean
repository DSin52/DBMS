$Vect(N)$, the algebra of vector fields in $N$ dimensions, is studied. Someaspects of local differential geometry are formulated as $Vect(N)$representation theory. There is a new class of modules, {\it conformal fields},whose restrictions to the subalgebra $sl(N+1) \subset Vect(N)$ arefinite-dimensional $sl(N+1)$ representations. In this regard they are simplerthan tensor fields. Fock modules are also constructed. Infinities, which areunremovable even by normal ordering, arise unless bosonic and fermionic degreesof freedom match.
