Problems connected with a choice of the spinorial basis in the $(j,0)\oplus(0,j)$ representation space are discussed. As shown it has profoundsignificance in the relativistic quantum theory. From the methodologicalviewpoint this fact is related with the important dynamical role played byspace-time symmetries for all kind of interactions.
