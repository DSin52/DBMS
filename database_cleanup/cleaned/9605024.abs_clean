We consider a scalar field theory in Minkowski spacetime and define a coarsegrained Closed Time Path (CTP) effective action by integrating quantumfluctuations of wavelengths shorter than a critical value. We derive an exactCTP renormalization group equation and solve it using a derivative expansionapproach. Explicit calculation is performed for the $\lambda \phi^4$ theory. Wediscuss the relevance of the CTP average action in the study of non-equilibriumaspects of phase transitions in quantum field theory.
