The quantization law for the antisymmetric tensor field of $M$-theorycontains a gravitational contribution not known previously. When it isincluded, the low energy effective action of $M$-theory, including one-loop andChern-Simons contributions, is well-defined. The relation of $M$-theory to the$E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string greatly facilitates the analysis.
