We introduce a new concept of quasi-Yang-Baxter algebras. The quantumquasi-Yang-Baxter algebras being simple but non-trivial deformations ofordinary algebras of monodromy matrices realize a new type of quantum dynamicalsymmetries and find an unexpected and remarkable applications in quantuminverse scattering method (QISM). We show that applying to quasi-Yang-Baxteralgebras the standard procedure of QISM one obtains new wide classes of quantummodels which, being integrable (i.e. having enough number of commutingintegrals of motion) are only quasi-exactly solvable (i.e. admit an algebraicBethe ansatz solution for arbitrarily large but limited parts of the spectrum).These quasi-exactly solvable models naturally arise as deformations of knownexactly solvable ones. A general theory of such deformations is proposed. Thecorrespondence ``Yangian --- quasi-Yangian'' and ``$XXX$ spin models ---quasi-$XXX$ spin models'' is discussed in detail. We also construct theclassical conterparts of quasi-Yang-Baxter algebras and show that theynaturally lead to new classes of classical integrable models. We conjecturethat these models are quasi-exactly solvable in the sense of classical inversescattering method, i.e. admit only partial construction of action-anglevariables.
