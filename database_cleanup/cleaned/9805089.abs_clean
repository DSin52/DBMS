The semiclassical theory for the large-N field models is developed from anunusual point of view. Analogously to the procedure of the second quantizationin quantum mechanics, the functional Schrodinger large-N equation is presentedin a third-quantized form. The third-quantized creation and annihilationoperators depend on the field $\phi({\bf x})$. If the coefficient of the$\phi^4$-term is of order 1/N (this is a usual condition of applicability ofthe 1/N-expansion), one can rescale the third-quantized operators in such a waythat their commutator will be small, while the Heisenberg equations will notcontain large or small parameters. This means that classical equation of motionis an equation on the functional $\Phi[\phi(\cdot)]$. This equation being anonlinear analog of the functional Schrodinger equation for the one-fieldtheory is investigated. The exact solutions are constructed and therenormalization problem is analysed. We also perform a quantization procedureabout found classical solutions. The corresponding semiclassical theory is atheory of a variable number of fields. The developed third-quantizedsemiclassical approach is applied to the problem of finding the large-Nspectrum. The results are compared with obtained by known methods. We show thatnot only known but also new energy levels can be found.
