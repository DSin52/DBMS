We derive a general WKB energy splitting formula in a double-well potentialby incorporating both phase loss and anharmonicity effect in the usual WKBapproximation. A bare application of the phase loss approach to the usual WKBmethod gives better results only for large separation between two potentialminima. In the range of substantial tunneling, however, the phase loss approachwith anharmonicity effect considered leads to a great improvement on theaccuracy of the WKB approximation.
