The $q$-deformed harmonic oscillator within the framework of the recentlyintroduced Schwenk-Wess $q$-Heisenberg algebra is considered. It is shown, thatfor "physical" values $q\sim1$, the gap between the energy levels decreaseswith growing energy. Comparing with the other (real) $q$-deformations of theharmonic oscillator, where the gap instead increases, indicates that theformation of the macroscopic energy gap in the Schwenk-Wess $q$-QuantumMechanics may be avoided.
