We study open and unoriented strings in a Topological Membrane (TM) theorythrough orbifolds of the bulk 3D space. This is achieved by gauging discretesymmetries of the theory. Open and unoriented strings can be obtained from allpossible realizations of $C$, $P$ and $T$ symmetries. The important role of $C$symmetry to distinguish between Dirichlet and Neumman boundary conditions isdiscussed in detail.
