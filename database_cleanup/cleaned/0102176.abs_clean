We investigate a noncompact Gepner model, which is composed of a number ofSL(2,R)/U(1) Kazama-Suzuki models and N=2 minimal models. The SL(2,R)/U(1)Kazama-Suzuki model contains the discrete series among the SL(2,R) unitaryrepresentations as well as the continuous series. We claim that the discreteseries contain the vanishing cohomology and the vanishing cycles of theassociated noncompact Calabi-Yau manifold. We calculate the Elliptic genus andthe open string Witten indices. In the A_{N-1} ALE models, they actually agreewith the vanishing cohomology and the intersection form of the vanishingcycles.
