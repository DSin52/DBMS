We discuss light-cone gauge description of type IIB Green-Schwarz superstringin AdS_5 x S^5 with a hope to make progress towards understanding spectrum of(i) fixing kappa symmetry in such a way that the fermionic part of the actiondoes not depend on x^-; (ii) fixing 2-d reparametrizations by x^+ = tau and acondition on 2-d metric. In curved AdS space the latter cannot be the standardconformal gauge and breaks manifest 2-d Lorentz invariance. It is natural,therefore, to work in phase-space framework, imposing the GGRT gauge conditionsx^+= tau, P^+ =const. We obtain the resulting light cone superstringHamiltonian. This is a review of hep-th/0007036 and hep-th/0009171.
