Title: Strings from Logic

Comments: Talk, 19 pp, 7 figures

Statistical Mechanics; Mathematical PhysicsWhat are strings made of? The possibility is discussed that strings arepurely mathematical objects, made of logical axioms. More precisely, proofs insimple logical calculi are represented by graphs that can be interpreted as theFeynman diagrams of certain large-N field theories. Each vertex represents anaxiom. Strings arise, because these large-N theories are dual to stringtheories. These ``logical quantum field theories'' map theorems into the spacetheorems might be related to nonperturbative field theory effects.
