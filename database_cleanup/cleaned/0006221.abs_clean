Casimir effect at 9th Marcel Grossmann Meeting on Recent Developments inTheoretical and Experimental General Relativity, Gravitation and RelativisticField Theories (MG 9), Rome, Italy, 2-8 July 2000The zero-point energy of a conducting spherical shell is studied by imposingthe axial gauge via path-integral methods, with boundary conditions on theelectromagnetic potential and ghost fields. The coupled modes are then found tobe the temporal and longitudinal modes for the Maxwell field. The resultingsystem can be decoupled by studying a fourth-order differential equation withboundary conditions on longitudinal modes and their second derivatives.Complete agreement is found with a previous path-integral analysis in theLorenz gauge, and with Boyer's value. This investigation leads to a betterunderstanding of how gauge independence is achieved in quantum field theory onbackgrounds with boundary.
