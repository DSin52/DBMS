Title: A Possible Black Hole Background in c=1 Matrix Model

Comments: 10 pages

We propose a new space-time interpretation for c=1 matrix model withpotential $V(x)=-x^{2}/2-\m^{2}/2x^{2}$. It is argued that this particularpotential corresponds to a black hole background. Some related issues arediscussed.
