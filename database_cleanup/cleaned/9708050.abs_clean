Title: Unification of the General Non-Linear Sigma Model and the Virasoro

Master EquationAuthors: J. de Boer and M.B. Halpern

Comments: 18 pages, Latex. Talk presented by MBH at the NATO Workshop `New

Developments in Quantum Field Theory', June 14-20, 1997, Zakopane, PolandThe Virasoro master equation describes a large set of conformal fieldtheories known as the affine-Virasoro constructions, in the operator algebra(affine Lie algebra) of the WZW model, while the Einstein equations of thegeneral non-linear sigma model describe another large set of conformal fieldtheories. This talk summarizes recent work which unifies these two sets ofconformal field theories, together with a presumable large class of newconformal field theories. The basic idea is to consider spin-two operators ofthe form $L_{ij} \partial x^i \partial x^j$ in the background of a generalsigma model. The requirement that these operators satisfy the Virasoro algebraleads to a set of equations called the unified Einstein-Virasoro masterequation, in which the spin-two spacetime field $L_{ij}$ couples to the usualspacetime fields of the sigma model. The one-loop form of this unified systemis presented, and some of its algebraic and geometric properties are discussed.
