In this paper we study the finitely generated algebras underlying $W$algebras. These so called 'finite $W$ algebras' are constructed as Poissonreductions of Kirillov Poisson structures on simple Lie algebras. Theinequivalent reductions are labeled by the inequivalent embeddings of $sl_2$into the simple Lie algebra in question. For arbitrary embeddings a coordinatefree formula for the reduced Poisson structure is derived. We also prove thatany finite $W$ algebra can be embedded into the Kirillov Poisson algebra of a(semi)simple Lie algebra (generalized Miura map). Furthermore it is shown thatgeneralized finite Toda systems are reductions of a system describing a freeparticle moving on a group manifold and that they have finite $W$ symmetry. Inthe second part we BRST quantize the finite $W$ algebras. The BRST cohomologyis calculated using a spectral sequence (which is different from the one usedby Feigin and Frenkel). This allows us to quantize all finite $W$ algebras inone stroke. Explicit results for $sl_3$ and $sl_4$ are given. In the last partof the paper we study the representation theory of finite $W$ algebras. It isshown, using a quantum version of the generalized Miura transformation, thatthe representations of finite $W$ algebras can be constructed from therepresentations of a certain Lie subalgebra of the original simple Lie algebra.As a byproduct of this we are able to construct the Fock realizations ofarbitrary finite $W$ algebras.
