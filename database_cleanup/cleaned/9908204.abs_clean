appear in Yuri Golfand Memorial VolumeWe study instanton-corrected renormalization group flow in the twodimensional sigma models and four dimensional gauge theory. In two dimensionswe do that by replacing the non-linear supersymmetric ${\IC\IP}^{N-1}$ model bythe gauged linear sigma model which is in the same universality class. Wecompare the moduli spaces of the instantons in the non-linear model and that ofBPS field configurations in the linear model. We reduce the problem of matchingof the parameters of the two systems to the intersection theory on the compactmoduli space of the latter model. Both cases (2d and 4d) are unified by thenotion of the {\it freckled instantons}. We also put an end to the discussionof the nature of the superpotentials $W \sim {\s} {\rm log} {\s}$ in 2d and 4dand discover the surprising disconnectnessness of the effective target space.
