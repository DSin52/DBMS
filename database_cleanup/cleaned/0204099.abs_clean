It has long been known that strings wound around incontractible cycles canplay a vital role in cosmology. In particular, in a spacetime with toroidalspatial hypersurfaces, the dynamics of the winding modes may help yield threelarge spatial dimensions. However, toroidal compactifications arephenomenologically unrealistic. In this paper we therefore take a first steptoward extending these cosmological considerations to $D$-dimensional toroidalorbifolds. We use numerical simulation to study the timescales over which"pseudo-wound" strings unwind on these orbifolds with trivial fundamentalgroup. We show that pseudo-wound strings can persist for many ``Hubble times''in some of these spaces, suggesting that they may affect the dynamics in thesame way as genuinely wound strings. We also outline some possible extensionsthat include higher-dimensional wrapped branes.
