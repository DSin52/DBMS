Formation and SolitonsThe general model of nonlinear electrodynamics with dyon singularities isconsidered. We introduce the field configuration having two dyon singularitieswith identical electric and opposite magnetic charges and we name it as bidyon.We investigate the sum of two dyon solution as initial approximation to thebidyon solution. We consider the case when the velocities of the dyons haveequal modules and opposite directions on a common line. It is shown that theassociated field configuration has a constant full angular momentum which isindependent of the interdyonic distance and their speed. This property permitsa consideration of this bidyon configuration as an electromagnetic model forcharged particle with spin. We discuss the possible electrodynamic world withoscillating bidyons as particles.
