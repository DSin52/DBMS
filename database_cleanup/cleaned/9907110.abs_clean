Quantum group Fourier transform methods are applied to the study of processeson noncommutative Minkowski spacetime $[x^i,t]=\imath\lambda x^i$. A naturalwave equation is derived and the associated phenomena of {\it in vacuo}dispersion are discussed. Assuming the deformation scale $\lambda$ is of theorder of the Planck length one finds that the dispersion effects are largeenough to be tested in experimental investigations of astrophysical phenomenasuch as gamma-ray bursts. We also outline a new approach to the construction offield theories on the noncommutative spacetime, with the noncommutativityequivalent under Fourier transform to non-Abelianness of the `addition law' formomentum in Feynman diagrams. We argue that CPT violation effects of the typetestable using the sensitive neutral-kaon system are to be expected in such atheory.
