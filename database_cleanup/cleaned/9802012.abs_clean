We investigate Yang-Mills theories with arbitrary gauge group on $R^3\timesS^1$, whose symmetry is spontaneously broken by the Wilson loop. We show thatinstantons are made of fundamental magnetic monopoles, each of which has acorresponding root in the extended Dynkin diagram. The number of constituentmagnetic monopoles for a single instanton is the dual Coxeter number of thegauge group, which also accounts for the number of instanton zero modes. Inaddition, we show that there exists a novel type of the $S^1$ coordinatedependent magnetic monopole solutions in $G_2,F_4,E_8$.
