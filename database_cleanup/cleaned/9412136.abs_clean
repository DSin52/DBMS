We construct a relativistically covariant symmetry of QED. Previous local andnonlocal symmetries are special cases. This generalized symmetry need not benilpotent, but nilpotency can be arranged with an auxiliary field and a certaincondition. The Noether charge generating the symmetry transformation isobtained, and it imposes a constraint on the physical states.
