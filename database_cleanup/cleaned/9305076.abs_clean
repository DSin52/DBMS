Parity violation is a long standing problem in light-cone quantization.\REF\CPT{D. Soper, SLAC-REP-137, 1970, Chap. I . } \refend We propose a newquantization on the light-cone which treats both the $x^{+}$ and the $x^{-}$coordinates as light-cone 'times.'This quantization respects both parity andtime-reversal. We find that now both $P^{-}$ and $P^{+}$ become dynamical.
