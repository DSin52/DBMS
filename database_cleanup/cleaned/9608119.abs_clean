Title: Vanishing of Cosmological Constant in Dual Supergravity

Authors: M.V.Terentiev, K.N.Zyablyuk

Comments: 8 pages.

The vacuun configuration of dual supergravity in ten dimensions with one-loopfivebrane corrections is analyzed. It is shown that the compactification ofthis theory with rather general conditions to six-dimensional space leads tozero value of cosmological constant.
