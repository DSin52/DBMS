Title: Odd Poisson Bracket in Hamilton's Dynamics

Authors: V.A. Soroka

Comments: 10 pages, LATEX. This talk, given at the Workshop on Variational and

Local Methods in the Study of Hamiltonian Systems (24-28 October, ICTP,Trieste, Italy), is submitted for publication in the Proceeding of theWorkshop.Some applications of the odd Poisson bracket to the description of theclassical and quantum dynamics are represented.
