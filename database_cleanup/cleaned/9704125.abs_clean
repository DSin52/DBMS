We construct a system of bosonic closed string field theory coupled to aD-brane. The interaction between the D-brane and closed string field isintroduced using the boundary state which is a function of constant fieldstrength $F_{\mu\nu}$ and the tilt $\theta_\mu^i$ of the D-brane. We find thatthe gauge invariance requirement on the system determines the$(F_{\mu\nu},\theta_\mu^i)$-dependence of the normalization factor of theboundary state as well as the form of the purely $(F_{\mu\nu},\theta_\mu^i)$term of the action. Correspondence between the action in the present formalismand the low energy effective action (bulk + D-brane actions) in the$\sigma$-model approach is studied.
