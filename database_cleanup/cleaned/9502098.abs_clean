We study a modified two-dimensional dilaton gravity theory which is exactlysolvable in the semiclassical approximation including back-reaction. The vacuumsolutions of this modified theory are asymptotically flat static space-times.Infalling matter forms a black hole if its energy is above a certain threshold.The black hole singularity is initially hidden behind a timelike apparenthorizon. As the black hole evaporates by emitting Hawking radiation, thesingularity meets the shrinking horizon in finite retarded time to becomenaked. A natural boundary condition exists at the naked singularity such thatfor general infalling matter-configuration the evaporating black holegeometries can be matched continuously to a unique static end-state geometry.This end-state geometry is asymptotically flat at its right spatial infinity,while its left spatial infinity is a semi-infinite throat extending into thestrong coupling region.
