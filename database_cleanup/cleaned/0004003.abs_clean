Title: Supersymmetry at Large Distance Scales

Authors: Herman Verlinde

Comments: 17 pages, 3 figures

We propose that the UV/IR relation that underlies the AdS/CFT duality mayprovide a natural mechanism by which high energy supersymmetry can have largedistance consequences. We motivate this idea via (a string realization of) theRandall-Sundrum scenario, in which the observable matter is localized on amatter brane separate from the Planck brane. As suggested via the holographicinterpretation of this scenario, we argue that the local dynamics of the Planckbrane - which determines the large scale 4-d geometry - is protected by thehigh energy supersymmetry of the dual 4-d theory. With this assumption, we showthat the total vacuum energy naturally cancels in the effective 4-d Einsteinequation. This cancellation is robust against changes in the low energydynamics on the matter brane, which gets stabilized via the holographic RGwithout any additional fine-tuning.
