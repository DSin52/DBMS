A class of integrable models of 1+1 dimensional dilaton gravity coupled toscalar and electromagnetic fields is obtained and explicitly solved. Moregeneral models are reduced to 0+1 dimensional Hamiltonian systems, for whichtwo integrable classes (called s-integrable) are found and explicitly solved.As a special case, static spherical solutions of the Einstein gravity coupledto electromagnetic and scalar fields in any real space-time dimension arederived. A generalization of the `no-hair' theorem is pointed out and theHamiltonian formulation that enables quantizing the s-integrable systems isoutlined.
