Title: Low-Energy Effective Action of Superstring Theory

Authors: T.R. Taylor

Comments: 7 pages, LATEX, NUB-3059

A fundamental task for the heterotic superstring theory is the determinationof the effective action describing the physics of massless string excitationsat low energies. This is necessary for the phenomenological applications ofstring theory, in particular for the unification of gauge interactions and forthe gaugino condensation mechanism of supersymmetry breaking. In this talk, Ireport on the recent progress in computing the effective supergravity actionfrom superstring scattering amplitudes, at the tree level and beyond. I discussmoduli-dependent string loop corrections to gauge and Yukawa couplings. Talkpresented at the 7th Meeting of the American Physical Society Division ofParticles and Fields, Fermilab, November 10-14, 1992
