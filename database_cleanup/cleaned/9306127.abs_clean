Springer-Verlag, N.Y., Heidelberg, ed. G. HelminckA number of examples of Hamiltonian systems that are integrable by classicalmeans are cast within the framework of isospectral flows in loop algebras.systems and the sine-Gordon equation. Each system has an associated invariantspectral curve and may be integrated via the Liouville-Arnold technique. Thelinearizing map is the Abel map to the associated Jacobi variety, which isdeduced through separation of variables in hyperellipsoidal coordinates. Moregenerally, a family of moment maps is derived, identifying certain finitedimensional symplectic manifolds with rational coadjoint orbits of loopalgebras. Integrable Hamiltonians are obtained by restriction of elements ofthe ring of spectral invariants to the image of these moment maps. Theisospectral property follows from the Adler-Kostant-Symes theorem, and givesrise to invariant spectral curves. {\it Spectral Darboux coordinates} areintroduced on rational coadjoint orbits, generalizing the hyperellipsoidalcoordinates to higher rank cases. Applying the Liouville-Arnold integrationtechnique, the Liouville generating function is expressed in completelyseparated form as an abelian integral, implying the Abel map linearization inthe general case.
