Title: Duality and $4d$ String Dynamics

Comments: 13 pages, latex. Talk presented at the workshop ``Frontiers in

Quantum Field Theory'' in honor of K. Kikkawa's 60th birthday, Osaka, Japan,December 1995We review some examples of heterotic/type II string duality which shed lighton the infrared dynamics of string compactifications with N=2 and N=1supersymmetry in four dimensions.
