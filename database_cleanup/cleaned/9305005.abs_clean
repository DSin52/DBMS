We discuss the integrable hierarchies that appear in multi--matrix models.They can be envisaged as multi--field representations of the KP hierarchy. Wethen study the possible reductions of this systems via the Dirac reductionmethod by suppressing successively one by one part of the fields. We find inthis way new integrable hierarchies, of which we are able to write the Lax pairrepresentations by means of suitable Drinfeld--Sokolov linear systems. At thebottom of each reduction procedure we find an $N$--th KdV hierarchy. We discussin detail the case which leads to the KdV hierarchy and to the Boussinesquehierarchy, as well as the general case in the dispersionless limit.
