An N=1--supersymmetric version of the Cremmer-Scherk-Kalb-Ramond model withnon-minimal coupling to matter is built up both in terms of superfields and ina component-field formalism. By adopting a dimensional reduction procedure, the(diagonal) Chern-Simons term and an anomalous magnetic moment coupling betweenmatter and the gauge potential.
