A mechanism for localization of quantum fields on a $s$-brane, representingthe boundary of a s+2 dimensional bulk space, is investigated. Minkowski andAdS bulk spaces are analyzed. Besides the background geometry, the relevantparameters controlling the theory are the mass M and a real parameter \eta,specifying the boundary condition on the brane. The importance of exploring thewhole range of allowed values for these parameters is emphasized. Stability inMinkowski space requires \eta to be greater or equal to -M, whereas in the AdSbackground all real \eta are permitted. Both in the flat and in AdS case, theinduced field on the brane is a non-canonical generalized free field. For asuitable choice of boundary condition, corresponding to the presence of aboundary state, the induced field on the brane mimics standard s+1 dimensionalphysics. In a certain range of \eta, the spectral function in the the AdS caseis ominated by a massive excitation, which imitates the presence of massiveparticle on the brane. We show that the quantum field induced on the brane isstable.
