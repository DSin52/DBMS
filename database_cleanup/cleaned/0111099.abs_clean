We investigate homogeneous and isotropic cosmological solutions supported bythe SU(2) gauge field governed by the Born-Infeld lagrangian. In the frameworkof the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology, with or without cosmologicalconstant $\lambda$, we derive dynamical systems that give rather completedescription of the space of solutions. For $\lambda=0$ the effective equationof state $\ve(p)$ is shown to interpolate between $p=-\ve/3$ in the regime ofthe strong field and $p=\ve/3$ for the weak field. Correspondingly, theUniverse starts with zero acceleration and gradually enters the deceleratingregime, asymptotically approaching the Tolman solution.
