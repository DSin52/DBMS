The connection is obtained between Ward identities and W-constraints inGeneralized Kontsevich Model with the potential $X^4/4$. We show that Wardidentities include W-constraints (and do not include any other constraints) forthis potential and make some observations in favour of the same connection forthe model with the potential of the form $X^{(K+1)}/(K+1)$ for any $K\geq 2$.
