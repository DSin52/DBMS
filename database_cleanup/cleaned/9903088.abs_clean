Title: WDVV Equations and Seiberg-Witten theory

Comments: 19 pages, LaTeX; Talk delivered at the Workshop "Integrability

Seiberg-Witten and Whitham equations", Edinburgh, September 1998We present a review of the results on the associativity algebras and WDVVequations associated with the Seiberg-Witten solutions of N=2 SUSY gaugetheories. It is mostly based on the integrable treatment of these solutions. Weconsider various examples of the Seiberg-Witten solutions and correspondingintegrable systems and discuss when the WDVV equations hold. We also discuss acovariance of the general WDVV equations.
