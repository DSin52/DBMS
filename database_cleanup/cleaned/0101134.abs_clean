We reexamine the thermodynamics of adS black holes with Ricci flat horizonsusing the adS soliton as the thermal background. We find that there is a phasetransition which is dependent not only on the temperature, but also on theblack hole area, which is an independent parameter. As in the spherical adSblack hole, this phase transition is related via the adS/CFT correspondence toa confinement-deconfinement transition in the large N gauge theory on theconformal boundary at infinity.
