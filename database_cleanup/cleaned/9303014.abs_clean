Exact operator quantization is perfomed of a model of two-dimensional dilatongravity in Lorentzian spacetime, classically equivalent to the one proposed byCallan, Giddings, Harvey and Strominger, in the special case with 24 masslessmatter scalars. This is accomplished by developing a non-linear and non-localquantum canonical transformation of basic interacting fields into a set of freefields, rigorously taking into account the spatially closed boundary condition.The quantized model enjoys conformal invariance and the entire set of physicalstates and operators are obtained in the BRST formalism. In addition, a ratherdetailed discussion of the nature of the basic issues for exact treatment ofmodels of quantum gravity is provided.
