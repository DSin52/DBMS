We present a new method of formulating the classical theory of $SU(N+1)$non-Abelian Chern-Simons (NACS) particles for arbitrary $N\geq 1$ using thesymplectic reduction of $CP(N)$ manifold from $S^{2N+1}$. Quantizing the theoryusing BRST formulation and coherent state path integral method , we obtain aquantum mechanical model for $SU(N+1)$ NACS particles.
