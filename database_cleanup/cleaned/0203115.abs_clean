We propose a new form of dimensional reduction that constrains dilatationinstead of a component of momentum. It corresponds to replacing toroidalcompactification in a Cartesian coordinate with that in the logarithm of theradius. Massive theories in de Sitter or anti de Sitter space are thus producedfrom massless (scale invariant) theories in one higher space or time dimension.As an example, we derive free massive actions for arbitrary representations ofthe (anti) de Sitter group in arbitrary dimensions. (Previous general resultswere restricted to symmetric tensors.) We also discuss generalizations tointeracting theories.
