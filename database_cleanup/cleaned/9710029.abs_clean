Configurations of fivebranes, twobranes and fourbranes in type IIA stringtheory, which give (1+1) dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories in the lowenergy limit, are constructed. It is shown that these brane configurations areequivalent to a certain class of matrix string theories. This opens up anavenue for the investigation of matrix string dynamics via the geometry of thebrane configurations in type IIA string theory.
