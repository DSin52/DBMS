We construct a two parameter family of 2-particle Hamiltonians closed underthe duality operation of interchanging the (relative) momentum and coordinate.Both coordinate and momentum dependence are elliptic, and the modulus of themomentum torus is a non-trivial function of the coordinate. This model containsas limiting cases the standard Ruijsenaars-Calogero and Toda family ofHamiltonians, which are at most elliptic in the coordinates, but not in themomenta.
