In previous papers we built (multiple) D-branes in flat space-time asclassical solutions of the string field theory based on the tachyon vacuum. Inthis paper we construct classical solutions describing all D-branes in anyfixed space-time background defined by a two-dimensional CFT of central charge26. A key role is played by the geometrical definition of the sliver state ingeneral boundary CFT's. The correct values for ratios of D-brane tensions arisebecause the norm of the sliver solution is naturally related to the diskpartition function of the appropriate boundary CFT. We also explore thepossibility of reproducing the known spectrum of physical states on a D-braneas deformations of the sliver.
