To define a consistent perturbative geometric heterotic compactification thebundle is required to satisfy a subtle constraint known as ``stability,'' whichdepends upon the Kahler form. This dependence upon the Kahler form is highlynontrivial---the Kahler cone splits into subcones, with a distinct moduli spaceof bundles in each subcone---and has long been overlooked by physicists. Inthis article we describe this behavior and its physical manifestation.
