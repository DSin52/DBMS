We derive a class of solutions to the string sigma-model equations for theclosed bosonic string. The tachyon field is taken to form a constant condensateand the beta-function equations at one-loop level are solved for the evolutionof the metric and the dilaton. The solutions represent critical string theoriesin arbitrary dimensions. The spectrum of the subclass of models with a linearlyrising asymptotic dilaton is found using the Feigin-Fuks method. Certainapproximate solutions arising in string field theory are used to illustrate theresults explicitly. An argument based on conformal invariance leads to theconjecture that that stringy corrections to at least some singular spacetimesin general relativity result in non-singular metrics. We use the singularitiesof the big-bang/crunch type appearing in our models to examine this conjecture.
