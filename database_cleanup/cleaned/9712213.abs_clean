We study the hypermultiplet moduli space of an N=4, U(Q_1)xU(Q_5) gaugetheory in 1+1 dimensions to extract the effective SCFT description of nearextremal 5-dimensional black holes modelled by a collection of D1- andD5-branes. On the moduli space, excitations with fractional momenta arise dueto a residual discrete gauge invariance. It is argued that, in the infra-red,the lowest energy excitations are described by an effective c=6, N=4 SCFT onT^4, also valid in the large black hole regime. The ``effective stringtension'' is obtained using T-duality covariance. While at the microscopiclevel, minimal scalars do not couple to (1,5) strings, in the effective theorya coupling is induced by (1,1) and (5,5) strings, leading to Hawking radiation.These considerations imply that, at least for such black holes, the calculationof the Hawking decay rate for minimal scalars has a sound foundation in stringtheory and statistical mechanics and, hence, there is no information loss.
