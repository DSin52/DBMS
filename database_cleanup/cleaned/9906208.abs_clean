Title: The deconfinement phase transition as an Aharonov-Bohm effect

Authors: Janos Polonyi

Comments: 7 pages, talk delivered at the workshop "Understanding Deconfinement

in QCD", Trento, Italy, March, 1999A subjective and incomplete list of interesting and unique features of thedeconfinement phase transition is presented. Furthermore a formal similarity ofthe density matrix of the Aharonov-Bohm system and QCD is mentioned, as well.
