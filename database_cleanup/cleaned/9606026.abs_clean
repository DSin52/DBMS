Title: Quantum Hair on D-branes and Black Hole Information in String Theory

Comments: 11 pages, harvmac, some idiot forgot the \listrefs command

We introduce a notion of quantum hair which completely characterizes thestate of a D-brane in perturbative string theory. The hair manifests itself asa phase (more generally a unitary matrix in subspaces of degenerate stringeigenstates) in the scattering amplitudes of elementary strings on the D brane.As the separation of the D-brane and the string center of mass becomes large,the phase goes to zero if we keep the string excitation level fixed. However,by letting the level number increase with the distance, we can keep the phaseconstant. We argue that this implies that scattering experiments with highlyexcited strings can detect the state of a D-brane long after it has``fallen into a black hole'' .
