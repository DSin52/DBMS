We study the scaling limit of a model of a tethered crumpled D-dimensionalrandom surface interacting through an exclusion condition with a fixed impurityin d-dimensional Euclidean space by the methods of Wilson's renormalizationgroup. In this paper we consider a hierarchical version of the model and weprove rigorously the existence of the scaling limit and convergence to anon-Gaussian fixed point for $1 \leq D< 2$ and $\epsilon >0$ sufficientlysmall, where $\epsilon = D - (2-D) {d\over 2}$.
