Recently Berkovits and Vafa have shown that the bosonic string can be viewedas the fermionic string propagating in a particular background. Such abackground is described by a somewhat unusual $N=1$ superconformal system. Bycoupling it to $N=1$ supergravity I construct a local supersymmetric action forthe bosonic string.
