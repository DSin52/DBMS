The Hamiltonian formalism offers a natural framework for discussing thenotion of Poisson Lie T-duality. This is because the duality is inherent in thePoisson structures alone and exists regardless of the choice of Hamiltonian.Thus one can pose alternative dynamical systems possessing nonabelianT-duality. As an example, we find a dual Hamiltonian formulation of the O(3)nonlinear sigma-model. In addition, starting from a general quadraticHamiltonian, we easily recover the known dynamical systems having Poisson LieT-duality.
