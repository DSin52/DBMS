273-285A brief review is given of an adaptation of the coadjoint orbit methodappropriate for study of models with infinite-dimensional symmetry groups. Itis illustrated on several examples, including derivation of the WZNW action ofinduced $D=2\,$ $(N,0)\,$ supergravity. As a main application, we present thegeometric action on a generic coadjoint orbit of the deformed group of areapreserving diffeomorphisms. This action is precisely the anomalous effectiveWZNW action of $D=2 \,$ matter fields coupled to chiral $W_\infty$ gravitybackground. Similar actions are given which produce the {\em KP} hierarchy ason-shell equations of motion.
