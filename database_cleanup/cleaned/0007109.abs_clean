We obtain new consistent Kaluza-Klein embeddings of the gauged supergravitieswith half of maximal supersymmetry in dimensions D=7, 6, 5 and 4. They take theform of warped embeddings in type IIA, type IIB, M-theory and type IIBrespectively, and are obtained by performing Kaluza-Klein circle reductions orT-duality transformations on Hopf fibres in S^3 submanifolds of thepreviously-known sphere reductions. The new internal spaces are in some sense``mirror manifolds'' that are dual to the original internal spheres. The vacuumAdS solutions of the gauged supergravities then give rise to warped productswith these internal spaces. As well as these embeddings, which havesingularities, we also construct new non-singular warped Kaluza-Kleinembeddings for the D=5 and D=4 gauged supergravities. The geometry of theinternal spaces in these cases leads us to study Fubini-Study metrics oncomplex projective spaces in some detail.
