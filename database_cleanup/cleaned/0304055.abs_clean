Title: Scalar and spinning particles in a plane wave field

Authors: A. Barducci, R.Giachetti

Comments: 13 pages

We study the quantization problem of relativistic scalar and spinningparticles interacting with a radiation electromagnetic field by using the pathintegral and the external source method. The spin degrees of freedom aredescribed in terms of Grassmann variables and the Feynman kernel is obtainedthrough functional integration on both Bose and Fermi variables. We providerigourous proof that the Feynman amplitudes are only determined by theclassical contribution and we explicitly evaluate the propagators.
