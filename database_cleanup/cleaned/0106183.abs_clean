The field theory dual to the Freedman-Townsend model of a non-Abeliananti-symmetric tensor field is a nonlinear sigma model on the group manifold G.This can be extended to the duality between the Freedman-Townsend model coupledto Yang-Mills fields and a nonlinear sigma model on a coset space G/H. Wepresent the supersymmetric extension of this duality, and find that the targetspace of this nonlinear sigma model is a complex coset space, GC/HC.
