(1997) 1941-1958Semiclassical quantization of the SU(3)-skyrmions is performed by means ofthe collective coordinate method. The quantization condition known for theSU(2)-solitons quantized with SU(3) collective coordinates is generalized forthe SU(3) skyrmions with strangeness content different from zero. Quantizationof the dipole-type configuration with large strangeness content found recentlyis considered as an example, the spectrum and the mass splitting of thequantized states are estimated. The energy and baryon number density of SU(3)skyrmions are presented in the form emphasizing their symmetry in differentSU(2) subgroups of SU(3), and the lower boundary for the static energy of SU(3)skyrmions is derived.
