We construct a string field Hamiltonian for a noncritical string theory withthe continuum limit of the Ising model or its generalization as the mattertheory on the worldsheet. It consists of only three string vertices as in thecase for $c=0$. We also discuss a general consistency condition that should besatisfied by this kind of string field Hamiltonian.
