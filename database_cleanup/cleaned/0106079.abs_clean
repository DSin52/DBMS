We calculate partition functions for supersymmetric heterotic theories onMelvin background with Wilson line. These functions coincide with partitionfunctions for some of non-supersymmetric heterotic theories in appropriatelimits. This suggests that non-supersymmetric heterotic theories are equivalentto supersymmetric theories on supersymmetry-breaking backgrounds, just as inthe case of recently conjectured IIA-0A duality.
