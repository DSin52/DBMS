We discuss the role of conformal matter quantum effects (using large $N$anomaly induced effective action) to creation-annihilation of an Anti-de SitterUniverse. The arbitrary GUT with conformally invariant content of fields isconsidered. On a purely gravitational (supersymmetric) AdS background, thequantum effects act against an (already existing) AdS Universe. Theannihilation of such a Universe occurs, what is common for any conformal mattertheory. On a dilaton-gravitational background, where there is dilatoniccontribution to the induced effective action, the quantum creation of an AdSUniverse is possible assuming fine-tuning of the dilaton.
