Using a collective field method, we obtain explicit solutions of thegeneralized Calogero-Sutherland models that are characterized by the roots ofthe classical groups $B_N$ and $C_N$. Starting from the explicit wave functionsfor $A_{N-1}$ type expressed in terms of the singular vectors of the $W_N$algebra, we give a systematic method to construct wave functions and deriveenergy eigenvalues for other types of theories.
