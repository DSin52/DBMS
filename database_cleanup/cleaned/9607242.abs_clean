We show that the chiral soliton model recently introduced by Aglietti et al.can be made integrable by adding an attractive potential with a fixedcoefficient. The modified model is equivalent to the derivative nonlinearSchr\"{o}dinger model which does not possess parity and Galilean invariance. Weobtain explicit one and two classical soliton solutions and show that in theweak coupling limit, they correctly reproduce the bound state energy as well asthe time delay of two-body quantum mechanics of the model.
