We provide new expressions for the scattering amplitudes in thesoliton-antisoliton sector of the elliptic sine-Gordon model in terms of cosetsof the affine Weyl group corresponding to infinite products of q-deformed gammafunctions. When relaxing the usual restriction on the coupling constants, themodel contains additional bound states which admit an interpretation asbreathers. These breather bound states are unavoidably accompanied by Tachyons.We compute the complete S-matrix describing the scattering of the breathersamonst themselves and with the soliton-antisoliton sector. We carry out variousreductions of the model, one of them leading to a new type of theory, namely anelliptic version of the minimal D(n+1)-affine Toda field theory.
