Title: Supergravities from fields to branes

Comments: Invited Talk presented at the International Congress on Mathematical

Physics, London July 17-22, 2000. 7 pages LateXThe quest for unification of particles and fields and for reconciliation ofQuantum Mechanics and General Relativity has led us to gauge theories, stringis quantum mechanical but it admits semiclassical descriptions of various``complementary'' kinds that could be valid approximations in variouscircumstances. One of them might be supergravity in 11 dimensions the largestknown interacting theory of a finite number of fields with gauged Poincar\' esupersymmetry. Its solitons and their dual membranes would be states in itsquantum version called M-theory. We shall review the construction of itsclassical action by deformation of a globally supersymmetric free theory andits on-shell superspace formulation. Then we shall focus on the bosonic matterequations of the dimensional reductions on tori of dimensions 1 to 8 to exhibittheir common self-duality nature. In the concluding section we shall discusspossible remnants at the quantum level and beyond the massless sector ofgeneralised discrete U-dualities. We shall also comment on the variabledimension of spacetime descriptions and on the possibility of extending theself dual description to spacetime itself and its metric.
