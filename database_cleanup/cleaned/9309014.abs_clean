Using the fusion principle of Bauer et al. we give explicit expressions forsome null vectors in the highest weight representations of the \bc algebra intwo different forms. These null vectors are the generalization of the Virasoroones described by Benoit and Saint-Aubin and analogues of the $W_3$ onesconstructed by Bowcock and Watts. We find connection between quantum Todamodels and the fusion method.
