After reviewing some aspects of gravity in two dimensions, it is shown thatnon-trivial embeddings of sl(2) in a semi-simple (super) Lie algebra give riseto a very large class of extensions of 2D gravity. The induced action isconstructed as a gauged WZW model and an exact expression for the effectiveaction is given. (Talk presented at the Journees Relativistes '93, Brussels,April, 1993).
