We discuss some implications of the gravitational dressing of therenormalization group for conformal field theories perturbed by relevantoperators. The renormalization group flows are defined with respect to thedilatation operator associated with the $J_0^{(0)}$ mode of the $SL(2,R)$affine algebra. We discuss the possibility of passing under the $c=25$ barrieralong renormalization group flows in some models.
