In topologically massive QED$_{2+1}$ with $N$ flavours, there is thepossibility that two equal-charged fermions can form a bound state pair ineither s-wave or p-wave. We are concerned about the s-wave pairs and obtain thelow energy effective action describing them. It is shown that the fermion pairsbehave like doubly charged spin-1 bosons and, when they condense, the gaugefield aquires the longitudinal mass. The approximate $SU(2)$ symmetry due tothe similarity between the fermion pairs and the gauge field is discussed.
