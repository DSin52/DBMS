The complex unit appearing in the equations of quantum mechanics isgeneralised to a quaternionic structure on spacetime, leading to theconsideration of complex quantum mechanical particles whose dynamical behaviouris governed by inhomogeneous Dirac and Schr\"{o}dinger equations. Mixing ofhyper-complex components of wavefunctions occurs through their interaction withpotentials dissipative into the extra quaternionic degrees of freedom. Aninterferometric experiment is analysed to illustrate the effect.
