Two classes of stringy instanton effects, stronger than standard field theoryinstantons, are identified in the heterotic string theory. These contributionsare established using type IIA/heterotic and type I/heterotic dualities. Theyprovide examples for the heterotic case of the effects predicted by Shenkerbased on the large-order behavior of perturbation theory. The correctionsvanish as the radius of the compactification goes to infinity. For appropriateamplitudes, they are computable worldsheet or worldline instanton effects onthe dual side. Some potential applications are discussed.
