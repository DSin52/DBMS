Title: Towards the Construction of Wightman Functions of Integrable Quantum

Field TheoriesAuthors: H. Babujian and M. Karowski

Comments: LATEX 18 pages, Talk presented at the '6th International Workshop on

Conformal Field Theories and Integrable Models', in Chernologka, September2002The purpose of the ``bootstrap program'' for integrable quantum fieldtheories in 1+1 dimensions is to construct a model in terms of its Wightmanfunctions explicitly. In this article, this program is mainly illustrated interms of the sine-Gordon and the sinh-Gordon model and (as an exercise) thescaling Ising model. We review some previous results on sine-Gordon breatherform factors and quantum operator equations. The problem to sum overintermediate states is attacked in the short distance limit of the two pointWightman function for the sinh-Gordon and the scaling Ising model.
