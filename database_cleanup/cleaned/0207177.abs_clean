We develop a systematic method to solve the Cardy condition for the cosetconformal field theory G/H. The problem is equivalent to finding a non-negativeinteger valued matrix representation (NIM-rep) of the fusion algebra. Based onthe relation of the G/H theory with the tensor product theory G x H, we give amap from NIM-reps of G x H to those of G/H. Our map provides a large class ofNIM-reps in coset theories. In particular, we give some examples of NIM-repsnot factorizable into the G and the H sectors. The action of the simplecurrents on NIM-reps plays an essential role in our construction. As anillustration of our procedure, we consider the diagonal coset SU(2)_5 x SU(2)_3/SU(2)_8 to obtain a new NIM-rep based on the conformal embedding su(2)_3\oplus su(2)_8 \subset sp(6)_1.
