We consider quantization of open string theories in linear dilaton andconstant antisymmetric tensor backgrounds and discuss the noncommutativity ofspace-time coordinates arising in such theories, including their relationshipwith light-like noncommutativity as well as backgrounds with null isometries.It is argued that the results can also be understood using space-time equationsof motion of the string modes. We then present N= 2 supersymmetricgeneralization of these theories and the associated noncommutativity structure.
