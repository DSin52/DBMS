We formulate the basic postulate of pre-big bang cosmology as one of``asymptotic past triviality'', by which we mean that the initial state is ageneric perturbative solution of the tree-level low-energy effective action.Such a past-trivial ``string vacuum'' is made of an arbitrary ensemble ofincoming gravitational and dilatonic waves, and is generically prone togravitational instability, leading to the possible formation of many blackholes hiding singular space-like hypersurfaces. Each such singular space-likehypersurface of gravitational collapse becomes, in the string-frame metric, theusual big-bang t=0 hypersurface, i.e. the place of birth of a baby Friedmannuniverse after a period of dilaton-driven inflation. Specializing to thespherically-symmetric case, we review and reinterpret previous work on thesubject, and propose a simple, scale-invariant criterion for collapse/inflationin terms of asymptotic data at past null infinity. Those data should determinewhether, when, and where collapse/inflation occurs, and, when it does, fix itscharacteristics, including anisotropies on the big bang hypersurface whoseimprint could have survived till now. Using Bayesian probability concepts, wefinally attempt to answer some fine-tuning objections recently moved to thepre-big bang scenario.
