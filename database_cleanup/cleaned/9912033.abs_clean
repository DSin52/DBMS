Using relationships between open and closed strings, we present aconstruction of tree-level scattering amplitudes for gravitons minimallycoupled to matter in terms of gauge theory partial amplitudes. In particular,we present examples of amplitudes with gravitons coupled to vectors or to asingle fermion pair. We also present two examples with massive gravitonexchange, as would arise in the presence of large compact dimensions. The gaugecharges are represented by flavors of dynamical scalars or fermions. This alsoleads to an unconventional decomposition of color and kinematics in gaugetheories.
