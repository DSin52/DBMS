The renormalization-group improved effective potential for an arbitraryrenormalizable massless gauge theory in curved spacetime is found,thusgeneralizing Coleman-Weinberg's approach corresponding to flat space.Sometheory,scalar electrody namics,the asymptotically-free SU(2) gauge model,andthe SU(5) GUT theory. The possibility of curvature-induced phase transitions isanalyzed.It is shown that such a phase transition may take place in a SU(5)inflationary universe.The inclusion of quantum gravity effects isbrieflydiscussed.
