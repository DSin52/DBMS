Title: From Boundaries To Conditions Over Superspace

Authors: Zheng Yin

Comments: 25 pages

N=1 and 2 superconformal boundary conditions are shown to be the consequenceof a boundary on the worldsheet superspace with positive codimension in theanticommuting subspace. In addition to the well-known boundary conditions, Ialso find two new infinite series of N=2 boundary states. Their free fieldrealizations are given. A self-contained development of 2d superspace leads tonew perspectives on this subject.
