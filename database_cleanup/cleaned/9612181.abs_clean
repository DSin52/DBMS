We discuss some of the classical and quantum geometry associated to thedegeneration of cycles within a Calabi-Yau compactification. In particular, wefocus on the definition and properties of quantum volume, especially as itapplies to identifying the physics associated to loci in moduli space wherenonperturbative effects become manifest. We discuss some unusual features ofquantum volume relative to its classical counterpart.
