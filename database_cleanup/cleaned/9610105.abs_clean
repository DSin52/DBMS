We use heterotic/type-II prepotentials to study quantum/classical black holeswith half the $N=2, D=4$ supersymmetries unbroken. We show that, in the case ofheterotic string compactifications, the perturbatively corrected entropyformula is given by the tree-level entropy formula with the tree-level couplingconstant replaced by the perturbative coupling constant. In the case of type-IIcompactifications, we display a new entropy/area formula associated withaxion-free black-hole solutions, which depends on the electric and magneticcharges as well as on certain topological data of Calabi--Yau three-folds,namely the intersection numbers, the second Chern class and the Euler number ofthe three-fold. We show that, for both heterotic and type-II theories, there isthe possibility to relax the usual requirement of the non-vanishing of some ofthe charges and still have a finite entropy.
