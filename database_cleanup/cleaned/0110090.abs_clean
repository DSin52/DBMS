We test the consistency of the use of a noncommutative theory description forcharged particles in a strong magnetic field, by deriving the inducedChern-Simons (CS) term for an external Abelian gauge field in 2+1 dimensions.In this description, the system is modeled by a noncommutative matter fieldcoupled to a U(1) noncommutative gauge field, related to the original,commutative one, by a Seiberg-Witten transformation. We show that an Abelian CSterm for the commutative gauge field is indeed induced, and moreover that itmatches the result of previous commutative field theory calculations.
