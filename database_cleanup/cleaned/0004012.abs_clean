We consider the quantum mechanical notion of the geometrical (Berry) phase inSU(2) gauge theory, both in the continuum and on the lattice. It is shown thatin the coherent state basis eigenvalues of the Wilson loop operator naturallydecompose into the geometrical and dynamical phase factors. Moreover, for eachWilson loop there is a unique choice of U(1) gauge rotations which do notchange the value of the Berry phase. Determining this U(1) locally in terms ofinfinitesimal Wilson loops we define monopole-like defects and study theirproperties in numerical simulations on the lattice. The construction is gaugedependent, as is common for all known definitions of monopoles. We argue thatfor physical applications the use of the Lorenz gauge is most appropriate. And,indeed, the constructed monopoles have the correct continuum limit in thisgauge. Physical consequences are briefly discussed.
