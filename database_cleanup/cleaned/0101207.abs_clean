the AnnulusAuthors: R. Rashkov, K. S. Viswanathan, Y. Yang

Comments: 10 pages, no figure, Latex

We study Witten's background independent open-string field theory in thepresence of a constant B-field at one loop level. The Green's function and thepartition function with a constant B-field are evaluated for an annulus.
