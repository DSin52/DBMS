Comments: 44 pages, small clarifications; 1 figure added

Regular and black-hole solutions of the spontaneously brokenEinstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory with nonminimal coupling to gravity are shownto exist. The main characteristics of the solutions are presented anddifferences with respect to the minimally coupled case are studied. Sincenegative energy densities are found to be possible, traversable wormholesolutions might exist. We prove that they are absent.
