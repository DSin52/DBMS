The Jacobian for infinitesimal BRST transformations of path integrals forpure Yang-Mills theory, viewed as a matrix $\unity +\Delta J$ in the space ofYang-Mills fields and (anti)ghosts, contains off-diagonal terms. Naively, thetrace of $\Delta J$ vanishes, being proportional to the trace of the structureconstants. However, the consistent regulator $\cR$, constructed from a generalmethod, also contains off-diagonal terms. An explicit computation demonstratesthat the regularized Jacobian $Tr\ \Delta J\exp -\cR /M^2$ for $M^2\rightarrow\infty $ is the variation of a local counterterm, which we give. This is adirect proof at the level of path integrals that there is no BRST anomaly.
