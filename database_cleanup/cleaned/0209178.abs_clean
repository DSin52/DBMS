We construct an explicit 5-dimensional supergravity model that realizes the"no scale" mechanism for supersymmetry breaking with no unstable moduli.Supersymmetry is broken by a constant superpotential localized on a brane, andthe radion is stabilized by Casimir energy from supergravity and massivehypermultiplets. If the standard model gauge and matter fields are localized ona brane, then visible sector supersymmetry breaking is dominated by gravityloops and flavor-violating hypermultiplet loops, and gaugino masses are smallerthan scalar masses. We present a realistic model in which the the standardmodel gauge fields are partly localized. In this model visible sectorsupersymmetry breaking is naturally gaugino mediated, while masses of thegravitino and gravitational moduli are larger than the weak scale.
