We discuss the correlation functions of the SL(2,C)/SU(2) WZW model, or theCFT on the Euclidean AdS_3. We argue that their calculation is reduced to thatof a free theory by taking into account the renormalization and integrating outa certain zero-mode, which is an analog of the zero-mode integration inLiouville theory. Based on the resultant free field picture, we give a simpleprescription for calculating the correlation functions. The known exact two-and three-point functions of generic primary fields are correctly obtained,including numerical factors. We also obtain some four-point functions ofprimaries by solving the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation, and verify that ourprescription indeed gives them.
