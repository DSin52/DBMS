Title: Fractional spin through quantum affine algebras

Authors: M. Mansour, E.H. Zakkari

In this paper, we study the fractional decomposition of the quantumenveloping affine algebras $U_Q(\hat A(n))$ and $U_Q(\hat{C}(n))$ in the $Q\toq=e\frac{2i\pi}k$ limit. This decomposition is based on the bosonicrepresentation and can be related to the fractional supersymmetry and$k$-fermionic spin. The equivalence between the quantum affine algebras and theclassical ones in the fermionic realization is also established.
