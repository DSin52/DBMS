A field-enlarging transformation in the chiral electrodynamics is performed.This introduces an additional gauge symmetry to the model that is unitary andanomaly-free and allows for comparison of different models discussed in theliterature. The problem of superfluous degrees of freedom and their influenceon quantization is discussed. Several "mysteries" are explained from this pointof view.
