considerations, some other changesWe provide a new general setting for scalar interacting fields on thecovering of a d+1-dimensional AdS spacetime. The formalism is used at first toconstruct a one-paramater family of field theories, each living on acorresponding spacetime submanifold of AdS, which is a cylinder $R\timesS_{d-1}$. We then introduce a limiting procedure which directly producesLuescher-Mack CFT's on the covering of the AdS asymptotic cone. Our AdS/CFTcorrespondence is generally valid for interacting fields, and is illustrated bya complete treatment of two-point functions, the case of Klein-Gordon fieldsappearing as particularly simple in our context.We also show how the Minkowskian representation of these boundary CFT's canbe directly generated by an alternative limiting procedure involvingMinkowskian theories in horocyclic sections (nowadays called (d-1)-branes,3-branes for AdS_5). These theories are restrictions to the brane of theambient AdS field theory considered. This provides a more generalcorrespondence between the AdS field theory and a Poincare' invariant QFT onthe brane, satisfying all the Wightman axioms. The case of two-point functionsis again studied in detail from this viewpoint as well as the CFT limit on theboundary.
