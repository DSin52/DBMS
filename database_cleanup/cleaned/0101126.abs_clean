A self-contained review is given of the matrix model of M-theory. Theintroductory part of the review is intended to be accessible to the generalreader. M-theory is an eleven-dimensional quantum theory of gravity which isbelieved to underlie all superstring theories. This is the only candidate atpresent for a theory of fundamental physics which reconciles gravity andquantum field theory in a potentially realistic fashion. Evidence for theexistence of M-theory is still only circumstantial---no completebackground-independent formulation of the theory yet exists. Matrix theory wasfirst developed as a regularized theory of a supersymmetric quantum membrane.More recently, the theory appeared in a different guise as the discretelight-cone quantization of M-theory in flat space. These two approaches tomatrix theory are described in detail and compared. It is shown that matrixtheory is a well-defined quantum theory which reduces to a supersymmetrictheory of gravity at low energies. Although the fundamental degrees of freedomof matrix theory are essentially pointlike, it is shown that higher-dimensionalfluctuating objects (branes) arise through the nonabelian structure of thematrix degrees of freedom. The problem of formulating matrix theory in ageneral space-time background is discussed, and the connections between matrixtheory and other related models are reviewed.
