We extend Dirac's `extensible model of the electron' to include spin andfamily. $U(1)_{e.m.}$ charge conservation on the bubble is translated into asecondary $U(1)_{g}$ world-manifold gauge principle. Reflecting the secondarymagnetic monopole configuration on spatial $S^2$, the harmonic excitations mayfurnish half integer $SU(2)_{spin}\otimes U(1)_{g}$ representations. Ourspin--$1/2$ `electron' is described by four world-manifold scalar fields. Itsthree varieties are associated with different minima of the (6th--order)surface-tension scalar potential.
