Exact Renormalization GroupWe discuss the relation between the $c$--theorem and the the way varioussymmetries are realized in quantum field theory. We review our recent proof ofthe $c$--theorem in four dimensions. Based on this proof and further evidence,we conjecture that the realization of chiral symmetry be irreversible, flowingfrom the Wigner-Weyl realization at short distance to the Nambu--Goldstonerealization at long distance. We argue that three apparently independentconstraints based on the renormalization group, namely anomaly matching, thec-theorem and the conjectured symmetry realization theorem, are particularmanifestations of a single underlying principle.
