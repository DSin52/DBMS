We perform dimensional reductions of recently constructed self-dual $~N=2$~{\it supersymmetric} Yang-Mills theory in $~2+2\-$dimensions intotwo-dimensions. We show that the universal equations obtained in thesedimensional reductions can embed supersymmetric exactly soluble systems, suchas $~N=1$~ and $~N=2$~ supersymmetric Korteweg-de Vries equations, $~N=1$~supersymmetric Liouville theory or supersymmetric Toda theory. This is thefirst supporting evidence for the conjecture that the $~2+2\-$dimensionalself-dual {\it supersymmetric} Yang-Mills theory generates {\it supersymmetric}soluble systems in lower-dimensions.
