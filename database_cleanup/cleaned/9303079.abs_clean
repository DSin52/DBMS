Title: Matrix Models of Induced Large-N QCD

Authors: Yu. Makeenko

Comments: LaTex (5 LaTex figures), 17 pages, ITEP-YM-11-92. Talk at the Seminar

on Strings, Matrix Models and all thatI review recent works on the problem of inducing large-N QCD by matrixfields. In the first part of the talk I describe the matrix models which inducelarge-N QCD and present the results of studies of their phase structure by thestandard lattice technology (in particular, by the mean field method). Thesecond part is devoted to the exact solution of these models in the strongcoupling region by means of the loop equations.
