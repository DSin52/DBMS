The statistics-altering operators present in the limit $q=-1$ ofmultiparticle SU_q(2)-invariant subspaces parallel the action of such operatorswhich naturally occur in supersymmetric theories. We illustrate thisheuristically by comparison to a toy $N=2$ superymmetry algebra, and askwhether there is a supersymmetry structure underlying SU(2)_q at that limit. Weremark on the relevance of such alternating-symmetry multiplets to theconstruction of invariant hamiltonians.
