We discuss branes whose worldvolume dimension equals the target spacetimedimension, i.e. ``spacetime-filling branes''. In addition to the D9-branes,there are 9-branes in the NS-NS sectors of both the IIA and IIB strings. Theworldvolume actions of these branes are constructed, via duality, from theknown actions of branes with codimension larger than zero. Each of these typesof branes is used in the construction of a string theory with sixteensupercharges by modding out a type II string by an appropriate discretesymmetry and adding 32 9-branes. These constructions are related by a web ofdualities and each arises as a different limit of the Horava-Wittenconstruction.
