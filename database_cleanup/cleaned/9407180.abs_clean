The $\beta\gamma$ system is generalized by complex(rational) powers of thefields, which leads to a corresponding extension on the Fock space. Twodifferent approaches to compute the Green functions of the physical operatorsare proposed. First the complex(rational) powers are defined via an integralrepresentation,that allows to compute the conformal blocks, Green functions andstructure constants of OPA. Next an approach based on a system of recursionequations for the Green functions is developed. A number of solutions of thesystem is found. A lot of possible applications is briefly discussed.
