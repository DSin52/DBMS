We calculate the partition function of a harmonic oscillator withquasi-periodic boundary conditions using the zeta-function method. This workgeneralizes a previous one by Gibbons and contains the usual bosonic andfermionic oscillators as particular cases. We give an alternative prescriptionfor the analytic extension of the generalized Epstein function involved in thecalculation of the generalized thermal zeta-functions. We also conjecture aboutthe relation of our calculation to anyonic systems.
