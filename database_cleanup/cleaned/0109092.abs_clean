This dissertation is devoted to deriving the bosonic sectors of certaingauged supergravities in various dimensions from reducing eleven-dimensionalsupergravity, type IIA and type IIB supergravities in ten dimensions on certainspherical spaces. Explicit non-linear Kaluza-Klein ans\"atze for reductions ofeleven-dimensional supergravity and of type IIA and type IIB supergravities on$S^n$ and $S^n\times T^m$ are presented. Knowing explicit non-linear ans\"atzeis proven to be very useful in finding super Yang-Mills operators of gaugetheories via AdS/CFT correspondence. We present a sample calculation whichallows us to find a super Yang-Mills operator using a non-linear ansatz.Knowing non-linear ans\"atze is also useful for finding supergravity duals tocertain twisted supersymmetric gauge theories. These supergravity solutions arebranes wrapped on certain supersymmetric cycles. Some solutions, which are dualto gauge theories in three and five dimensions, are presented.
