We consider SU(N) gauge theory in 1+1 dimensions coupled to chiral fermionsin the adjoint representation of the gauge group. With all fields in theadjoint representation the gauge group is actually SU(N)/Z_N, which possessesnontrivial topology. In particular, there are N distinct topological sectorsand the physical vacuum state has a structure analogous to a \theta vacuum. Weshow how this feature is realized in light-front quantization for the case N=2,using discretization as an infrared regulator. In the discretized form of thetheory the nontrivial vacuum structure is associated with the zero momentummode of the gauge field A^+. We find exact expressions for the degeneratevacuum states and the analog of the \theta vacuum. The model also possess acondensate which we calculate. We discuss the difference between this chirallight-front theory and the theories that have previously been considered in theequal-time approach.
