We present the computation of threshold functions for Abelian orbifoldcompactifications. Specifically, starting from the massive, moduli-dependentstring spectrum after compactification, we derive the threshold functions astarget space duality invariant free energies (sum over massive string states).In particular we work out the dependence on the continuous Wilson line modulifields. In addition we concentrate on the physically interesting effect that atcertain critical points in the orbifold moduli spaces additional masslessstates appear in the string spectrum leading to logarithmic singularities inthe threshold functions. We discuss this effect for the gauge couplingthreshold corrections; here the appearance of additional massless states isdirectly related to the Higgs effect in string theory. In addition thesingularities in the threshold functions are relevant for the loop correctionsto the gravitational coupling constants.
