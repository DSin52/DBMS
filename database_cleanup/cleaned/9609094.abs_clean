Title: Supersymmetry, Duality and Bound States

Comments: 8 pages, harvmac, talk given at Strings '96

$P$-brane solutions of low-energy string actions have traditionally providedthe first evidence for the existence of string dualities, in which fundamentaland solitonic $p$-branes are identified with perturbative and non-perturbativeBPS states. In this talk we discuss the composite nature of solutions, whichallows for the interpretation of general solutions as bound states orintersections of maximally supersymmetric fundamental constituents. Thisfeature lies at the heart of the recent success of string theory in reproducingthe Beckenstein-Hawking black hole entropy formula.
