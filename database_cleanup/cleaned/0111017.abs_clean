We construct a supergravity dual to the cascading $SU(N+M) x SU(N)$supersymmetric gauge theory (related to fractional D3-branes on conifoldaccording to Klebanov et al) in the case when the 3-space is compactified on$S^3$ and in the phase with unbroken chiral symmetry. The size of $S^3$ servesas an infrared cutoff on the gauge theory dynamics. For a sufficiently large$S^3$ the dual supergravity background is expected to be nonsingular. Wesupergravity solution using a perturbation theory that is valid when the radiusof $S^3$ is large. We consider also the case with the euclidean world-volumebeing $S^4$ instead of $R x S^3$, where the supergravity solution is againfound to be regular. This ``curved space'' resolution of the singularity of thefractional D3-branes on conifold solution is analogous to the one in thenon-extremal (finite temperature) case discussed in our previous work.
