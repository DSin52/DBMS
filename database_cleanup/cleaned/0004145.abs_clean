We show that the BRST/anti-BRST invariant 3+1 dimensional 2-form gauge theoryhas further nilpotent symmetries (dual BRST /anti-dual BRST) that leave thegauge fixing term invariant. The generator for the dual BRST symmetry isanalogous to the co-exterior derivative of differential geometry. There existsa bosonic symmetry which keeps the ghost terms invariant and it turns out to bethe analogue of the Laplacian operator. The Hodge duality operation is shown tocorrespond to a discrete symmetry in the theory. The generators of all thesecontinuous symmetries are shown to obey the algebra of the de Rham cohomologyoperators of differential geometry. We derive the extended BRST algebraconstituted by six conserved charges and discuss the Hodge decompositiontheorem in the quantum Hilbert space of states.
