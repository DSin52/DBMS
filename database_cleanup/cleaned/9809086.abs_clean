Title: Three ideas on magnetic mass

Comments: 6 pages, REVTeX 2-column style, Talk given at the 5-th International

Workshop on Thermal Field Theory, Germany, August 1998, minor changes inwording, enlarged discussion in section 4Three topics, the self-consistent resummation of the perturbative expansionfor thermal Yang-Mills (YM) theory, nonperturbative analysis of Yang-Millstheories in (2+1) dimensions and modification of the Bose distribution forgluons, are discussed. These topics are related to the magnetic mass ormagnetic screening in the quark-gluon plasma. The value of the magnetic mass isargued to be close to $e^2N/2\pi=g^2TN/2\pi$ for an SU(N) gauge theory. Ananalytic calculation of the string tension for $YM_{2+1}$, which agrees withnumerical simulations to within 3%, is another result.
