Certain higher dimensional operators of the lagrangian may render the vacuuminhomogeneous. A rather rich phase structure of the phi4 scalar model in fourdimensions is presented by means of the mean-field approximation. One findspara- ferro- ferri- and antiferromagnetic phases andcommensurate-incommensurate transitions. There are several particles describedby the same quantum field in a manner similar to the species doubling of thelattice fermions. It is pointed out that chiral bosons can be introduced in thelattice regularized theory.
