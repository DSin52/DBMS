A previously introduced method to renormalize the one-loop stress tensor andthe one-loop vacuum fluctuations in a curved background by a direct local$\zeta$-function approach is checked in some thermal and nonthermal cases.First the method is checked in the case of a conformally coupled massless fieldin the static Einstein universe where all hypotheses initially requested by themethod hold true. Secondly, dropping the hypothesis of a closed manifold, themethod is checked in the open static Einstein universe. Finally, the method ischecked for a massless scalar field in the presence of a conical singularity inthe Euclidean manifold (i.e. Rindler spacetimes/ large mass black holemanifold/cosmic string manifold). In all cases, a complete agreement with otherapproaches is found. Concerning the last case in particular, the method isproved to give rise to the stress tensor already got by the point-splittingapproach for every coupling with the curvature regardless of the presence ofthe singular curvature. In the last case, comments on the measure employed inthe path integral, the use of the optical manifold and the different approachesto renormalize the Hamiltonian are made.
