Semiclassical Einstein's equation in five-dimension with a negativecosmological constant and conformally invariant bulk matter fields is examinedin the brane world scenario with the S^1/Z_2 compactification. When numbersN_{b,f} of bosonic and fermionic fields satisfy I<\kappa^2l^{-3}(N_b-N_f)<32I,we obtain an exact semiclassical solution which has two static branes withpositive tension and for which the warp factor can be arbitrarily large. Here,\kappa^2 is the five-dimensional gravitational constant, l is a length scaledetermined by the negative five-dimensional cosmological constant, and $I$ is adimensionless positive constant of order unity. However, in order to obtain alarge warp factor, fine tuning of brane tensions is required. Hence, in orderto solve the hierarchy problem, we need to justify the fine tuning by anothernew mechanism.
