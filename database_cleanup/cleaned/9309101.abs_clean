Duality symmetries for strings moving in non-trivial spacetime backgroundsare analysed. It is shown that, for backgrounds generated from compact WZW andcoset models, such duality symmetries are exact to all orders in stringperturbation theory. A global treatment of duality symmetries is given, byassociating them to the known symmetries of affine current algebras(affine-Weyl group and external automorphisms). It is argued that self-dualitysymmetries of WZW and coset models generate the duality symmetries of theirmoduli space. Some remarks are presented, concerning the survival of suchsymmetries in the non-compact case. The implications of duality symmetries forstring dynamics in non-trivial/singular spacetimes are discussed. (Talk givenat the "Strings 93" Conference at Berkeley, May 1993)
