We consider the polarization of unstable type IIB D0-branes in the presenceof a background five-form field strength. This phenomenon is studied from thepoint of view of the leading terms in the non-abelian Born Infeld action of theunstable D0-branes. The equations have SO(4) invariant solutions describing anon-commutative 3-sphere, which becomes a classical 3-sphere in the large Nlimit. We discuss the interpretation of these solutions as spherical D3-branes.The tachyon plays a tantalizingly geometrical role in relating the fuzzy S^3geometry to that of a fuzzy S^4.
