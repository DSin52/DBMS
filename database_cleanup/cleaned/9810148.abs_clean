We study how local symmetry transformations of (p, q) anti de Sittersupergravities in three dimensions act on fields on the two-dimensionalboundary. The boundary transformation laws are shown to be the same as those oftwo-dimensional (p, q) conformal supergravities for p, q \leq 2. Weyl and superWeyl transformations are generated from three-dimensional general coordinateand super transformations.
