We use the conjectured strong-weak coupling worldsheet duality between theSL(2)/U(1) and Sine-Liouville conformal field theories to study some propertiesof degenerate operators and to compute correlation functions in CFT on AdS_3.The same quantities have been computed in the past by other means. Theagreement between the different approaches provides new evidence for theduality. We also discuss the supersymmetric analog of this duality, thecorrespondence between SCFT on the cigar and N=2 Liouville. We show that in thespacetime CFT dual to string theory on AdS_3 via the AdS/CFT correspondence,the central term in the Virasoro algebra takes different values in differentsectors of the theory. In a companion paper we use the results described hereto study D-branes in AdS_3.
