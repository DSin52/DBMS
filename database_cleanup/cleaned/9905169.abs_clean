For N>2 we present static monopole solutions of the second order SU(N) BPSYang-Mills-Higgs equations which are not solutions of the first order Bogomolnyequations. These spherically symmetric solutions may be interpreted as monopoleanti-monopole configurations and their construction involves harmonic maps intocomplex projective spaces.
