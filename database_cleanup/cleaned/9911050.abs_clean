Title: The Contribution of Instanton-Antiinstanton Fluctuations to the Ground

State Energy in Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanical ModelsComments: 7 pages, no figures

I show that the method of finding if the ground state energy is nonzero ornot by saturating the functional integral directly withinstanton-anti-instanton type fluctuations is not reliable either for thedouble or for the triple well potential models in supersymmetric quantummechanics.
