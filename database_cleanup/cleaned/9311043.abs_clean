The review of the following results of the Refs. \cite{Sem} - \cite{Ans} isWigner function which has generic Gaussian form the photon distributionfunction is obtained and expressed expliciltly in terms of Hermite polynomialsof $2N$-variables.The momenta of this distribution are calculated and expressedas functions of matrix invariants of the dispersion matrix.The role of newuncertainty relation depending on photon state mixing parameter iselucidated.New sum rules for Hermite polynomials of several variables arefound.The photon statistics of polymode even and odd coherent light andsqueezed polymode Schr\"odinger cat light is qiven explicitly.Photondistribution for polymode squeezed number states expressed in terms ofmultivariable Hermite polynomials is discussed.
