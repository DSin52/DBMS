We show that thermal noncommutative field theories admit a version of`channel duality' reminiscent of open/closed string duality, where non-planarthermal loops can be replaced by an infinite tower of tree-level exchanges ofeffective fields. These effective fields resemble closed strings in threeinteraction vertices contain extra moduli, and they can be regarded aspropagating in a higher-dimensional `bulk' space-time. In noncommutative modelsthat can be embedded in a D-brane, we show the precise relation between theeffective `winding fields' and closed strings propagating off the D-brane. Thewinding fields represent the coherent coupling of the infinite tower ofclosed-string oscillator states. We derive a sum rule that expresses thiseffective coupling in terms of the elementary couplings of closed strings tothe D-brane. We furthermore clarify the relation between the effectivepropagating dimension of the winding fields and the true codimension of theD-brane.
