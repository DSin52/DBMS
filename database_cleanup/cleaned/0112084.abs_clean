Recently Maldacena, Moore, and Seiberg (MMS) have proposed a physicalinterpretation of the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, which roughlycomputes the K-homology groups that classify D-branes. We note that in IIBstring theory, this approach can be generalized to include NS charged objectsand conjecture an S-duality covariant, nonlinear extension of the spectralsequence. We then compute the contribution of the MMS double-instantonconfiguration to the derivation d_5. We conclude with an M-theoreticgeneralization reminiscent of 11-dimensional E_8 gauge theory.
