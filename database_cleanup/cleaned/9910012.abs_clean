S. Pinsky, U. Trittmann (Ohio State University), J. Hiller (University ofMinnesota-Duluth)Comments: Talk given at the TJNAF Workshop in honor of Stan Brodsky's 60th

Birthday, University of Georgia, September 17, 1999Journal-ref: Proc. from JLab/University of Georgia, Workshop "Transition from

low to high Q form factors", Athens, Georgia, Sep. 17, 1999, G. Strobel, D.Mack (eds.), pp. 165-179.In this talk we describe the application of discrete light cone quantization(DLCQ) to supersymmetric field theories. We find that it is possible toformulate DLCQ so that supersymmetry is exactly preserved in the discreteapproximation and call this formulation of DLCQ, SDLCQ. It combines the powerof DLCQ with all of the beauty of supersymmetry. We have applied SDLCQ toseveral interesting supersymmetric theories and discussed zero modes, vacuumdegeneracy, massless states, mass gaps, and theories in higher dimensions. Mostrecently we have used it to discuss the Maldacena conjecture.
