Two-particle scattering amplitudes for integrable relativistic quantum fieldtheory in 1+1 dimensions can normally have at most singularities of poles andzeros along the imaginary axis in the complex rapidity plane. It has beensupposed that single particle amplitudes of the exact boundary reflectionmatrix exhibit the same structure. In this paper, single particle amplitudes ofthe exact boundary reflection matrix corresponding to the Neumann boundarycondition for affine Toda field theory associated with twisted affine algebras$a_{2n}^{(2)}$ are conjectured, based on one-loop result, as having a new kindof square root singularity.
