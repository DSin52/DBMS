A new approximation scheme for non-perturbative calculations in a quantum fieldtheory is proposed. The scheme is based on investigation of solutions of theSchwinger equation with its singular character taken into account. As anecessary supplementary boundary condition the Green functions' connectedstructures correspondence principle is used. Besides the usual perturbationtheory expansion which is always available as a particular solution of ourscheme some non-perturbative solutions of an equation for the propagator arefound in the model of a self-interacting scalar field.
