The question of the integrability of real-coupling affine toda field theoryon a half-line is addressed. It is found, by examining low-spin conservedcharges, that the boundary conditions preserving integrability are stronglyconstrained. In particular, for the $a_n\ (n>1)$ series of models there can beno free parameters introduced by the boundary condition; indeed the onlyremaining freedom (apart from choosing the simple condition $\partial_1\phi=0$), resides in a choice of signs. For a special case of the boundarycondition, it is argued that the classical boundary bound state spectrum isclosely related to a consistent set of reflection factors in the quantum fieldtheory.
