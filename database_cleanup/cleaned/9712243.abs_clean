The conformal field theory based on the $g/u(1)^d$ coset construction istreated as the WZNW theory for the affine Lie algebra $\hat g$ with theconstrained $\hat u(1)^d$ subalgebra.Using a modification of the generalizedcanonical quantization method generators and primary fields of an extendedsymmetry algebra are found for arbitrary d.
