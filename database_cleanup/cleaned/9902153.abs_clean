We compute the two and three-point correlation functions of chiral primaryoperators in the large N limit of the (0,2), d=6 superconformal theory. We alsoconsider the operator product expansion of Wilson surfaces in the (0,2) theoryand compute the OPE coefficients of the chiral primary operators at large Nfrom the correlation functions of surfaces.
