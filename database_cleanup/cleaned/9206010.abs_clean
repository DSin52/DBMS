We investigate the evaluation of the Dirac index using symplectic geometry inthe loop space of the corresponding supersymmetric quantum mechanical model. Inparticular, we find that if we impose a simple first class constraint, we canevaluate the Callias index of an odd dimensional Dirac operator directly fromthe quantum mechanical model which yields the Atiyah-Singer index of an evendimensional Dirac operator in one more dimension. The effective action obtainedby BRST quantization of this constrained system can be interpreted in terms ofloop space symplectic geometry, and the corresponding path integral for theindex can be evaluated exactly using the recently developed localizationtechniques.
