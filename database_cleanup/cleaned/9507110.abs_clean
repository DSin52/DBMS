latest results on renormalization of the Chern-Simons theory. This does notchange the conclusion of the paperWe consider a large-N Chern-Simons theory for the attractive bosonic matter(Jackiw-Pi model) in the Hamiltonian, collective-field approach based on the1/N expansion. We show that the dynamics of density excitations around theground-state semiclassical configuration is governed by the Calogero or by theSutherland Hamiltonian, depending on the symmetry of the underlyingstatic-soliton configuration. The relationship between the Chern-Simonscoupling constant $\l$ and the Calogero-Sutherland statistical parameter $\l_c$signalizes some sort of statistical transmutation accompanying the dimensionalreduction of the initial problem.
