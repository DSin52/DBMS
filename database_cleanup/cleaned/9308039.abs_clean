Title: The Zamolodchikov C-Function, Classical Closed String Field Theory, The

Duistermaat-Heckman Theorem, The Renormalization Group, and all thatAuthors: Kelly Jay Davis

Comments: Pages 20, RU-93-33

In this article we formulate a `topological' field theory by employing ageneralization of the Duistermaat-Heckman Theorem to localize the path-integralof the `topological action' C^2 , where C is a slight modification of theZamolodchikov C-Function, over the space of all two-dimensional field theoriesto the fixed points of the renormalization group's identity component. Also, wepropose an interpretation of the background independent classical closed stringfield theory action S in terms of the Zamolodchikov C-Function's modification.
