We study classical solutions of a particular version of the modified Skyrmemodel in (3+1) dimensions. The model possesses Skyrmion solutions as well asstable domain walls that connect different vacua of the theory. We show thatthere is an attractive interaction between Skyrmions and domain walls. ThusSkyrmions can be captured by the domain walls. We show also that, when the massterm is of a special type, the model possesses bound states of Skyrmions and ofthe domain wall. They look like deformed 2-dimensional Skyrmions captured bythe wall. The field configurations of these solutions can interpreted as havingcome from the evolution of the 3-dimensional Skyrmions captured by the domainwall. For more conventional choices of the mass term of the model in the modelthe attraction between the Skyrmions and the wall leads to the capture of theSkyrmions which are then turned into topological waves which spread out on thewall. We have observed, numerically, such captures and the emission of thewaves.We speculate that this observation may be useful in the explanation of theproblem of baryogenesis and baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the Universe.
