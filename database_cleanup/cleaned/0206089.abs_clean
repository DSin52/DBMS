We consider, in 5 dimensions, the low energy effective action induced byheterotic string theory including the leading stringy correction of orderalpha'. In the presence of a single positive tension flat brane, and aninfinite extra dimension, we present a particular class of solutions withfinite 4-dimensional Planck scale and no naked singularity. A ``self-tuning''mechanism for relaxing the cosmological constant on the brane, without adrastic fine tuning of parameters, is discussed in this context. Our solutionsare distinct from the standard self-tuning solutions discussed in the contextof vanishing quantum corrections in alpha', and become singular in this limit.
