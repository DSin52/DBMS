Using a sequence of Bogoliubov transformations, we obtain an exact expressionfor the vacuum state of a Dirac field in 2+1 dimensions in presence of aconstant magnetic field. This expression reveals a peculiar two level pairingstructure for any value of the mass m greater than zero. This calculationclarifies the nature of the condensate in the lowest Landau level whoseexistence has been emphasized recently by a several authors.
