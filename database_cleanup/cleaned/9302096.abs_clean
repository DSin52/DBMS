ZYNDA@IASSNS.BITNET, IASSNS HEP/93-12Following Hawking, it is usual to mimic the effect of collapse space-timegeometry on quantum fields in a semi-classical approximation by imposingsuitable boundary conditions at the origin of coordinates, which effectivelybecomes a moving mirror. Suitable mirror trajectories induces a close analogueto the radiance of black holes, including a flux of outgoing radiation thatappears accurately thermal. If the acceleration of the mirror eventually ceasesthe complete state of the radiation field is a pure quantum state, even thoughit is indistinguishable from an accurately thermal state for an arbitrarilylong period of time and in a precise sense differs little from ``pure thermal''closely followed by ``vacuum''. Suspicions that the semiclassical calculationof black hole radiance gives evidence for the evolution of pure into mixedstates are criticized on this basis. Possible extensions of the model to mimicblack holes more accurately (including the effects of back reaction and partialtransparency), while remaining within the realm of tractable models, aresuggested.
