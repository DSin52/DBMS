For the classical principal chiral model with boundary, we give the subset ofthe Yangian charges which remains conserved under certain integrable boundaryconditions, and extract them from the monodromy matrix. Quantized versions ofthese charges are used to deduce the structure of rational solutions of thereflection equation, analogous to the 'tensor product graph' for solutions ofthe Yang-Baxter equation. We give a variety of such solutions, including somefor reflection from non-trivial boundary states, for the SU(N) case, andconfirm these by constructing them by fusion from the basic solutions.
