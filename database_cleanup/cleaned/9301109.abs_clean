We consider a string inspired effective Lagrangian for the graviton anddilaton, containing Einstein gravity at the zero slope limit. The numericalsolution of the problem shows asymptotically an inflationary universe. The timeis measured by the dilaton, as one expects. The result is independent of theintroduction of ad-hoc self interactions for the dilaton field.
