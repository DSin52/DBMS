We re-examine the graceful exit problem in the pre-big bang scenario ofstring cosmology, by considering the most general time-dependent classicalcorrection to the Lagrangian with up to four derivatives. By including possibleforms for quantum loop corrections we examine the allowed region of parameterspace for the coupling constants which enable our solutions to link smoothlythe two asymptotic low-energy branches of the pre-big bang scenario, andobserve that these solutions can satisfy recently proposed entropic bounds onviable singularity free cosmologies.
