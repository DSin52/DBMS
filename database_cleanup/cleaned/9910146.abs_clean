We propose a formulation of the holographic principle, suitable for abackground independent quantum theory of cosmology. It is stated as arelationship between the flow of quantum information and the causal structureof a quantum spacetime. Screens are defined as sets of events at which theobservables of a holographic cosmological theory may be measured, and such thatinformation may flow across them in two directions. A discrete backgroundindependent holographic theory may be formulated in terms of informationflowing in a causal network of such screens. Geometry is introduced by definingthe area of a screen to be a measure of its capacity as a channel of quantuminformation from its null past to its null future. We call this a ``weak'' formof the holographic principle, as no use is made of a bulk theory.
