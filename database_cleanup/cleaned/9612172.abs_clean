A `canonical mapping' is established between the c=-1 system of bosonicghosts and the c=2 complex scalar theory and, a similar mapping between thec=-2 system of fermionic ghosts and the c=1 Dirac theory. The existence of thismapping is suggested by the identity of the characters of the respectivetheories. The respective c<0 and c>0 theories share the same space of states,whereas the spaces of conformal fields are different. Upon this mapping fromtheir c<0 counterparts, the (c>0) complex scalar and the Dirac theories inherithidden nonlocal sl(2) symmetries.
