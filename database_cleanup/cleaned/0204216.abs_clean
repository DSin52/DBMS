"Confinement, Topology, and other Non-Perturbative Aspects of QCD", StaraLesna, Slovakia, 21-27 jan 2002We introduce some techniques to investigate dynamical mass generation. TheGross-Neveu model (GN) is used as a toy model, because the GN mass gap isexactly known, making it possible to check reliability of the various methods.Very accurate results are obtained. Also application to SU(N) Yang-Mills (YM)is discussed.
