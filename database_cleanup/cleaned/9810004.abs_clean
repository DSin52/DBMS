We consider two Dirichlet p-branes with lower dimensional brane charges andtheir scattering. We first calculate the cylinder amplitude of open string withsuitable boundary conditions. We compare this result with that in the IIBmatrix model. We find the agreement between them in the long distance, lowvelocity, or large field limit. We also find a way to investigate more generalboundary conditions for open string.
