In this paper we incorporate gauge fields into the tachyon field theorymodels for unstable D-branes in bosonic and in Type II string theories. Thechosen couplings yield massless gauge fields and an infinite set of equallyspaced massive gauge fields on codimension one branes. A lack of a continuumspectrum is taken as evidence that the stable tachyon vacuum does not supportconventional gauge excitations. For the bosonic string model we find twopossible solvable couplings, one closely related to Born-Infeld forms and theother allowing a detailed comparison to the open string modes on bosonicD-branes. We also show how to include fermions in the type II model. Theylocalize correctly on stable codimension one branes resulting in bose-fermidegeneracy at the massless level. Finally, we establish the solvability of alarge class of models that include kinetic terms with more than twoderivatives.
