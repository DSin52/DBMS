Two integrals along the world trajectory of its curvature and torsion areadded to the standard action for the point-like spinless relativistic particle.Since here the three-dimensional space-time is considered at the beginning, thetorsion of the world curve is defined with a sign in contrast to the previousa complete set of constraints in the phase space a generalized Hamiltoniandescription of a new version of the model is constructed. This enables one toquantize the model canonically and to derive exactly the relation between thespin and mass of the states.
