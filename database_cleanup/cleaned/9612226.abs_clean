The renormalized trajectory of massless $\phi^4$-theory on four dimensionalEuclidean space-time is investigated as a renormalization group invariant curvein the center manifold of the trivial fixed point, tangent to the$\phi^4$-interaction. We use an exact functional differential equation for itsdependence on the running $\phi^4$-coupling. It is solved by means ofperturbation theory. The expansion is proved to be finite to all orders. Theproof includes a large momentum bound on amputated connected momentum spaceGreen's functions.
