We discuss theories containing higher-order forms in various dimensions. Weexplain how Chern--Simons-type theories of forms can be defined from TQFTs inone less dimension. We also exhibit new TQFTs with interacting Yang--Millsfields and higher--order forms. They are obtained by the dimensional reductionof TQFTs whose gauge functions are free self-duality equations. Interactionsare due to the gauging of global internal symmetries after dimensionalreduction. We list possible symmetries and give a brief discussion on thepossible relation of such systems to interacting field theories.
