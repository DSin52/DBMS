Title: Spacetime locality of the antifield formalism

Authors: M. Henneaux

Comments: 15 pages in LaTeX, ULB-PMIF-93/08

Some general techniques and theorems on the spacetime locality of theantifield formalism are illustrated in the familiar cases of the free scalarfield, electromagnetism and Yang-Mills theory. The analysis explicitly showsthat recent criticisms of the usual approach to dealing with locality areill-founded.
