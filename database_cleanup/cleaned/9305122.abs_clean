Coherent states path integral formalism for the simplest quantum algebras,q-oscillator, SU_q(2) and SU_q(1,1) is introduced. In the classical limitcanonical structure is derived with modified symplectic and Riemannian metric.Non-constant deformation induced curvature for the phase spaces is obtained.
