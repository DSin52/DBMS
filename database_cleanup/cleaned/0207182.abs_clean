Title: More about generalized maximally superintegrable systems of Winternitz

typeAuthors: Cezary Gonera

Comments: 8 pages

Recently proposed procedure of constructing maximally superintegrable systemsof Winternitz type is further developed and illustrated by an example of systemadmitting an explicit construction of angle variables and additional integralsof motion. A possible application of the method to Liouville system is brieflypresented.
