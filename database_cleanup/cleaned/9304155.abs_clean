We discuss solutions of the heterotic string theory which are analogous tobosonic and superstring backgrounds related to coset conformal field theories.A class of exact `left-right symmetric' solutions is obtained by supplementingthe metric, antisymmetric tensor and dilaton of the superstring solutions bythe gauge field background equal to the generalised Lorentz connection withtorsion. As in the superstring case, these backgrounds are $\a'$-independent,i.e. have a `semiclassical' form. The corresponding heterotic string sigmamodel is obtained from the combination of the (1,0) supersymmetric gauged WZNWaction with the action of internal fermions coupled to the target space gaugefield. The pure (1,0) supersymmetric gauged WZNW theory is anomalous and doesnot describe a consistent heterotic string solution. We also find (to the order$\alpha'^3$) a two-dimensional perturbative heterotic string solution with thetrivial gauge field background. To the leading order in $\alpha'$ it coincideswith the known $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ bosonic or superstring solutions. This solutiondoes not correspond to a `heterotic' combination of the left superstring andright bosonic $L_0$-operators at the conformal field theory level. Some dualityproperties of the heterotic string solutions are studied.
