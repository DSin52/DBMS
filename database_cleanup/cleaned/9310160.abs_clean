We derive the Kac and new determinant formulae for an arbitrary (integer)level $K$ fractional superconformal algebra using the BRST cohomologytechniques developed in conformal field theory. In particular, we reproduce theKac determinants for the Virasoro ($K=1$) and superconformal ($K=2$) algebras.For $K\geq3$ there always exist modules where the Kac determinant factorizesinto a product of more fundamental new determinants. Using our results forgeneral $K$, we sketch the non-unitarity proof for the $SU(2)$ minimal series;as expected, the only unitary models are those already known from the cosetconstruction. We apply the Kac determinant formulae for the spin-4/3parafermion current algebra ({\em i.e.}, the $K=4$ fractional superconformalalgebra) to the recently constructed three-dimensional flat Minkowskispace-time representation of the spin-4/3 fractional superstring. We prove theno-ghost theorem for the space-time bosonic sector of this theory; that is, itsphysical spectrum is free of negative-norm states.
