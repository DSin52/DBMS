We argue that the effective field theory on D3-branes in a plane-wavebackground with 3-form flux is a nonlocal deformation of Yang-Mills theory. Inthe case of NSNS flux, it is a dipole field theory with lightlike dipolevectors. For an RR 3-form flux the dipole theory is strongly coupled. Wepropose a weakly coupled S-dual description for it. The S-dual description islocal at any finite order in string perturbation theory but becomes nonlocalwhen all perturbation theory orders are summed together.
