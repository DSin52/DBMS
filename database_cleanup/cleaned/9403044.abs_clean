Title: Integrable mappings and polynomial growth

Comments: 45 pages

SystemsWe describe birational representations of discrete groups generated byinvolutions, having their origin in the theory of exactly solvablevertex-models in lattice statistical mechanics. These involutions correspondinversion of the $q \times q$ matrix and an (involutive) permutation of theentries of the matrix. We concentrate on the case where these permutations areelementary transpositions of two entries. In this case the birationaltransformations fall into six different classes. For each class we analyze thefactorization properties of the iteration of these transformations. Thesefactorization properties enable to define some canonical homogeneouspolynomials associated with these factorization properties. Some mappings yielda polynomial growth of the complexity of the iterations. For three classes thesuccessive iterates, for $q=4$, actually lie on elliptic curves. This analysisalso provides examples of integrable mappings in arbitrary dimension, eveninfinite. Moreover, for two classes, the homogeneous polynomials are shown tosatisfy non trivial non-linear recurrences. The relations betweenfactorizations of the iterations, the existence of recurrences on one orseveral variables, as well as the integrability of the mappings are analyzed.
