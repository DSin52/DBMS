The thermodynamics of a gas of strings and D-branes near the Hagedorntransition is described by a coupled set of Boltzmann equations for weaklyinteracting open and closed long strings. The resulting distributions aredominated by the open string sector, indicating that D-branes grow to fillspace at high temperature.
