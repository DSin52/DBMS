We study N=4 super Yang Mills theory at finite U(1)_R charge density (andtemperature) using the AdS/CFT Correspondence. The ten dimensional backgroundsaround spinning D3 brane configurations split into two classes of solution. Oneclass describe spinning black holes and have previously been extensivelystudied, and interpreted, in a thermodynamic context, as the deconfined highdensity phase of the dual field theory. The other class have nakedsingularities and in the supersymmetric limit are known to correspond tomulti-centre solutions describing the field theory in the Coulomb phase. Weprovide evidence that the non-supersymmetric members of this class representnaked, spinning D-brane distributions describing the Coulomb branch at finitedensity. At a critical density a phase transition occurs to a spinning blackhole representing the deconfined phase where the higgs vevs have evaporated. Weperform a free energy calculation to determine the phase diagram of the Coulombbranch at finite temperature and density.
