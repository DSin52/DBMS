Title: Nonlinear Sigma Models and Symplectic Geometry on Loop Spaces of

(Pseudo)Riemannian ManifoldsComments: 5 pages, Bilkent University

In this paper we consider symplectic and Hamiltonian structures of systemsgenerated by actions of sigma-model type and show that these systems arenaturally connected with specific symplectic geometry on loop spaces ofRiemannian and (pseudo)Riemannian manifolds.
