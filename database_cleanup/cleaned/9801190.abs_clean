Title: D-brane conformal field theory

Authors: J. Fuchs, C. Schweigert

Comments: 7 pages, LaTeX2e. Slightly extended version of a talk given by J.

Fuchs at the 31st International Symposium Ahrenshoop on the Theory ofElementary Particles, Buckow, Germany, September 1997We outline the structure of boundary conditions in conformal field theory. Aboundary condition is specified by a consistent collection of reflectioncoefficients for bulk fields on the disk together with a choice of anautomorphism \omega of the fusion rules that preserves conformal weights.Non-trivial automorphisms \omega correspond to D-brane configurations forarbitrary conformal field theories.
