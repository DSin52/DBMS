In this letter we show that, in five-dimensional anti-deSitter space (AdS)truncated by boundary branes, effective field theory techniques are reliable athigh energy (much higher than the scale suggested by the Kaluza-Klein massgap), provided one computes suitable observables. We argue that in the model ofRandall and Sundrum for generating the weak scale from the AdS warp factor, thehigh energy behavior of gauge fields can be calculated in a {\em cutoffindependent manner}, provided one restricts Green's functions to externalpoints on the Planck brane. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we calculate theone-loop correction to the Planck brane gauge propagator due to charged bulkfields. These effects give rise to non-universal logarithmic energy dependencefor a range of scales above the Kaluza-Klein gap.
