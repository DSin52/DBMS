Title: The Construction of Pointlike Localized Charged Fields from Conformal

Haag-Kastler NetsComments: 15 pages, latex

Journal-ref: Lett.Math.Phys. 38 (1996) 257-274

Starting from a chiral conformal Haag-Kastler net on 2 dimensional Minkowskispace we construct associated charged pointlike localized fields whichintertwine between arbitrary superselection sectors with finite statistics ofthe theory. This amounts to a proof of the Spin-Statistics theorem, the PCTtheorem and the existence of operator product expansions. This papergeneralizes similar results of a recently published paper by Fredenhagen andthe author \cite{FrJ} from the neutral vacuum sector to the the full theorywith arbitrary charge and finite statistics.
