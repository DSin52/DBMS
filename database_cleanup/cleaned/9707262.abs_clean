We give a detailed analysis of pairs of vector and hypermultiplet theorieswith N=2 supersymmetry in four spacetime dimensions that are related by the(classical) mirror map. The symplectic reparametrizations of the specialK\"ahler space associated with the vector multiplets induce correspondingtransformations on the hypermultiplets. We construct the Sp(1)$\times$Sp($n$)one-forms in terms of which the hypermultiplet couplings are encoded andexhibit their behaviour under symplectic reparametrizations. Both vector andhypermultiplet theories allow vectorial central charges in the supersymmetryalgebra associated with integrals over the K\"ahler and hyper-K\"ahler forms,respectively. We show how these charges and the holomorphic BPS mass arerelated by the mirror map.
