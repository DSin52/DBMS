We study the U(1) and U(2) instanton solutions of gauge theory on generalnoncommutative $\bf{R}^4$. In all cases considered we obtain explicit resultsfor the projection operators. In some cases we computed numerically theinstanton charge and found that it is an integer, independent of thenoncommutative parameters $\theta_{1,2}$.
