We study a $U(N)$-invariant vector+matrix chain with the color structure of alattice gauge theory with quarks and interpret it as a theory of open andclosedstrings with target space $\Z$. The string field theory is constructed as aquasiclassical expansion for the Wilson loops and lines in this model. In aparticular parametrization this is a theory of two scalar massless fieldsdefined in the half-space $\{x\in \Z , \tau >0\} $. The extra dimension $\tau$is related to the longitudinal mode of the strings. The topology-changingstring interactions are described by a local potential. The closed stringinteraction is nonzero only at boundary $\tau =0$ while the open stringinteraction falls exponentially with $\tau$.
