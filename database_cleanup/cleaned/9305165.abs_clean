The formation and evaporation of two dimensional black holes are discussed.It is shown that if the radiation in minimal scalars has positive energy, theremust be a global event horizon or a naked singularity. The former would implyloss of quantum coherence while the latter would lead to an even worsebreakdown of predictability. CPT invariance would suggest that there ought tobe past horizons as well. A way in which this could happen with wormholes isdescribed.
