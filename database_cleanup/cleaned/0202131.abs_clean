We consider system of Dp-branes in the presence of a nonzero B field with oneleg along brane worldvolume and the other transverse to it. We study thecorresponding supergravity solutions and show that the worldvolume theoriesdecouple from gravity for $p\leq 5$. Therefore these solutions provide dualdescription of large N noncommutative dipole field theories. We shall onlyconsider those systems which preserve 8 supercharges in the branes worldvolume.We analyze the system of M5-branes and NS5-branes in the presence of nonzero Cfield and RR field with one leg along the transverse direction and the othersalong the worldvolume of the brane, respectively. This could provide a newdeformation of (2,0) and little string field theories. Finally, we study theWilson loops using the dual gravity descriptions.
