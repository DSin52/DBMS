Title: Non-Abelian Structures in BSFT and RR couplings

Authors: Emil T.Akhmedov (ITEP,Moscow)

Comments: Latex, 13pp., Minor correction (references added); This is the

extended version of the talk presented at 10th Tohwa International Symposiumon String theory which was held in Fukuoka, July 2001In this talk we show that the tachyon annihilation combined with anapproximation, in which string theory non-commutativity structure is capturedby the algebra of differential operators on space-time, gives a unified pointon $D$-branes; all RR couplings in type II string theory.
