We study the higher spin anologs of the six vertex model on the basis of itssymmetry under the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\slth)$. Using the methoddeveloped recently for the XXZ spin chain, we formulate the space of states,transfer matrix, vacuum, creation/annihilation operators of particles, andlocal operators, purely in the language of representation theory. We find that,regardless of the level of the representation involved, the particles have spin$1/2$, and that the $n$-particle space has an RSOS-type structure rather than asimple tensor product of the $1$-particle space. This agrees with the pictureproposed earlier by Reshetikhin.
