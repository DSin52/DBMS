"Problems of Quantum Field Theory" (July 13-17, 1998, Dubna, Russia),submitted to the Conference ProceedingsThe RG expansions for renormalized coupling constants g_6 and g_8 of the 3Dn-vector model are calculated in the 4-loop and 3-loop approximationsrespectively. Resummation of the RG series for g_6 by the Pade-Borel-Leroytechnique results in the estimates for its universal critical values g_6^*(n)which are argued to deviate from the exact numbers by less than 0.3%. The RGexpansion for g_8 demonstrates stronger divergence being much less suitable forgetting reliable numerical estimates.
