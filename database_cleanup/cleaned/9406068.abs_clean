Title: Equivariant Morse theory and quantum integrability

Comments: 37 pages

We investigate an equivariant generalization of Morse theory for a generalclass of integrable models. In particular, we derive equivariant versions ofthe classical Poincar\'e-Hopf and Gauss-Bonnet-Chern theorems and present thecorresponding path integral generalizations. Our approach is based onequivariant cohomology and localization techniques, and is closely related tothe formalism developed by Matthai and Quillen in their approach to Gaussianshaped Thom forms.
