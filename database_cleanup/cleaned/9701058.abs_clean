We use the method due to Batalin, Fradkin, Fradkina, and Tyutin (BFFT) inorder to convert second-class into first-class constraints for some quantummechanics supersymmetric theories. The main point to be considered is that theextended theory, where new auxiliary variables are introduced, has to besupersymmetric too. This leads to some additional restrictions with respect theconventional use of the BFFT formalism.
