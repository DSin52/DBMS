Configuration space heat-kernel methods are used to evaluate the determinantand hence the effective action for an SU(2) doublet of fermions in interactionwith a {\it covariantly constant} SU(2) background field. Exact results areexhibited which are applicable to {\it any} Abelian background on which theonly restriction is that $(B^{2}-E^{2})$ and $E\cdot B$ are constant. Suchfields include the uniform field and the plane wave field. The fermionpropagator is also given in terms of gauge covariant objects. An extension toinclude finite temperature effects is given and the probability for creation offermions from the vacuum at finite temperature in the presence of an electricfield is discussed.
