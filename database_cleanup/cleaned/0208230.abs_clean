schemeThe notion of Wigner particles is attached to irreducible unitaryrepresentations of the Poincare group, characterized by parameters m and s ofmass and spin, respectively. However, the Lorentz symmetry is broken intheories with long-range interactions, rendering this approach inapplicable(infraparticle problem). A unified treatment of both particles andinfraparticles via the concept of particle weights can be given within theframework of Local Quantum Physics. They arise as temporal limits of physicalstates in the vacuum sector and describe the asymptotic particle content. Inthis paper their definition and characteristic properties are worked out indetail. The existence of the temporal limits is established by use of suitablydefined seminorms which are also essential in proving the characteristicfeatures of particle weights.
