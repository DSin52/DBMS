We construct a one-parameter family of N=3 supersymmetric extensions of theKdV equation as a Hamiltonian flow on N=3 superconformal algebra and argue thatit is non-integrable for any choice of the parameter. Then we propose amodified N=3 super KdV equation which possesses the higher order conservedquantities and so is a candidate for an integrable system. Upon reduction toN=2, it yields the recently discussed ``would-be integrable'' version of theN=2 super KdV equation. In the bosonic core it contains a coupled system of theKdV type equation and a three-component generalization of the mKdV equation. Wegive a Hamiltonian formulation of the new N=3 super KdV equation as a flow onsome contraction of the direct sum of two N=3 superconformal algebras.
