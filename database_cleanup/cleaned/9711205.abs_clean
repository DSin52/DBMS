The worldvolume field equations of M-branes and D-branes are known to admitp-brane soliton solutions. These solitons are shown to saturate a BPS-typebound on their p-volume tensions, which are expressed in terms of centralcharges that are expected to appear in the worldvolume supertranslationalgebra. The cases we consider include vortices, `BIons', instantons and dyons(both abelian and non-abelian), and the string boundaries of M-2-branes in theM-5-brane.
