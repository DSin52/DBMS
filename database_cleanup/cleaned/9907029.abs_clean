Guided by the generalized conformal symmetry, we investigate the extension ofAdS-CFT correspondence to the matrix model of D-particles in the large N limit.We perform a complete harmonic analysis of the bosonic linearized fluctuationsaround a heavy D-particle background in IIA supergravity in 10 dimensions andfind that the spectrum precisely agrees with that of the physical operators ofMatrix theory. The explicit forms of two-point functions give predictions forthe large $N$ behavior of Matrix theory with some special cutoff. We discussthe possible implications of our results for the large N dynamics ofD-particles and for the Matrix-theory conjecture. We find an anomalous scalingbehavior with respect to the large N limit associated to the infinite momentumlimit in 11 dimensions, suggesting the existence of a screening mechanism forthe transverse extension of the system.
