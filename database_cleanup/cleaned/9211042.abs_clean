We present the {\it canonical} set of superspace constraints for self-dualsupergravity, a ``self-dual'' tensor multiplet and a self-dual Yang-Millsmultiplet with $~N=1~$ supersymmetry in the space-time with signature$(+,+,-,-)$. For this set of constraints, the consistency of the self-dualityconditions on these multiplets with supersymmetry is manifest. Theenergy-momentum tensors of all the self-dual ``matter'' multiplets vanish, tobe consistent with the self-duality of the Riemann tensor. In particular, thespecial significance of the ``self-dual'' tensor multiplet is noted. Thisresult fills the gap left over in our previous series of papers, with respectto the consistent couplings among the self-dual matter multiplets. We alsocouple these non-trivial backgrounds to a Green-Schwarz superstring$~\s\-$model, under the requirement of invariance under fermionic (kappa)symmetry. The finiteness of the self-dual supergravity is discussed, based onits ``off-shell'' structure. A set of exact solutions for the ``self-dual''tensor and self-dual Yang-Mills multiplets for the gauge group $~SL(2)$~ onself-dual gravitational instanton background is given, and its consistency withthe Green-Schwarz string ~$\s\-$model is demonstrated.
