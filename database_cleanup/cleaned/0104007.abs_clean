We present a formalism for local composite operators. The correspondingeffective potential is unique, multiplicatively renormalizable, it is the sumof 1PI diagrams and can be interpreted as an energy-density. First we applythis method to $\lambda \Phi^4$ theory where we check renormalizability up tothree loops and secondly to the Coleman-Weinberg model where the gaugeindependence of the effective potential for the local composite operator$\phi\phi^*$ is explicitely checked up to two loops.
