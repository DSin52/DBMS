The matching of global anomalies of a supersymmetric gauge theory and itsdual is seen to follow from similarities in their classical chiral rings. Thesesimilarities provide a formula for the dimension of the dual gauge group. Asexamples we derive 't Hooft consistency conditions for the duals ofsupersymmetric QCD and SU(N) theories with matter in the adjoint, and obtainthe dimension of the dual groups.
