We count the supersymmetric bound states of many distinct BPS monopoles inN=4 Yang-Mills theories and in pure N=2 Yang-Mills theories. The novelty hereis that we work in generic Coulombic vacua where more than one adjoint Higgsfields are turned on. The number of purely magnetic bound states is again foundto be consistent with the electromagnetic duality of the N=4 SU(n) theory, asexpected. We also count dyons of generic electric charges, which correspond to1/4 BPS dyons in N=4 theories and 1/2 BPS dyons in N=2 theories. Surprisingly,the degeneracy of dyons is typically much larger than would be accounted for bya single supermultiplet of appropriate angular momentum, implying manysupermutiplets of the same charge and the same mass.
