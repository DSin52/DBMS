We study D-branes on smooth noncompact toric Calabi-Yau manifolds that areresolutions of abelian orbifold singularities. Such a space has a distinguishedbasis {S_i} for the compactly supported K-theory. Using local mirror symmetrywe demonstrate that the S_i have simple transformation properties undermonodromy; in particular, they are the objects that generate monodromy aroundthe principal component of the discriminant locus. One of our examples, thetoric resolution of C^3/(Z_2 x Z_2), is a three parameter model for which weare able to give an explicit solution of the GKZ system.
