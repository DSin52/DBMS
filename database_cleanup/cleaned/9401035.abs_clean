Zero modes of first class secondary constraints in the two-dimensionalelectrodynamics and the four-dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory are consideredby the method of reduced phase space quantization in the context of the problemof a stable vacuum. We compare the description of these modes in the Diracextended method and reveal their connection with the topological structure ofthe gauge symmetry group. Within the framework of the "reduced" quantization weconstruct a new global realization of the homotopy group representation in theYang-Mills theory, where the role of the stable vacuum with a finite actionplays the Prasad-Sommerfield solution.
