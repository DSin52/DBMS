A new mechanism which leads to a linearized massless graviton localized onthe brane is found in the $AdS$/CFT setting, {\it i.e.} in a single copy of$AdS_5$ spacetime with a singular brane on the boundary, within theRandall-Sundrum brane-world scenario. With an help of a recent development inpath-integral techniques, a one-parameter family of propagators for linearizedgravity is obtained analytically, in which a parameter $\xi$ reflects variouskinds of boundary conditions that arise as a result of the half-lineconstraint. In the case of a Dirichlet boundary condition ($\xi = 0$) thegraviton localized on the brane can be massless {\it via} coupling constantrenormalization. Our result supports a conjecture that the usualRandall-Sundrum scenario is a regularized version of a certain underlyingtheory.
