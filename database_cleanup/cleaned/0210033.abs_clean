Title: Fat Branes in Infinite-Volume Extra Space

We study branes residing in infinite volume space and of finite extent in thetransverse directions. We calculate the graviton propagator in the harmonicgauge both inside and outiside the brane and discuss its dependence on thethickness of the brane. Our treatment includes the full tensor structure of thepropagator. In five dimensions, we show that the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov(vDVZ) discontinuity can be avoided by an appropriate choice of gauge. This newgauge is written explicitly in terms of the metric field without evoking thefield equations. It has a singular limit as the transverse size of the braneshrinks to zero, so no such simple representation is possible in that limit.
