381-394We give a representation, in terms of iterated Mellin-Barnes integrals, ofperiods on multi-moduli Calabi-Yau manifolds arising in superstring theory.Using this representation and the theory of multidimensional residues, wepresent a method for analytic continuation of the fundamental period in theform of Horn series.
