We discuss a generalization of the quantum group $\su$ to the $q$-Virasoroalgebra in two-dimensional electrons system under uniform magnetic field. It isshown that the integral representations of both algebras are reduced to thosein a (1+1)-dimensional fermion. As an application of the quantum groupsymmetry, we discuss a model of quantum group current on the analogy of theHall current.
