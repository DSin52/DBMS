We discuss non-relativistic scattering by a Newtonian potential. We show thatthe gray-body factors associated with scattering by a black hole exhibit thesame functional dependence as scattering amplitudes in the Newtonian limit,which should be the weak-field limit of any quantum theory of gravity. Thisbehavior arises independently of the presence of supersymmetry. The connectionto two-dimensional conformal field theory is also discussed.
