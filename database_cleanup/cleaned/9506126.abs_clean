Membrane/fivebrane duality in D=11 implies Type IIA string/Type IIA fivebraneduality in D=10, which in turn implies Type IIA string/heterotic string dualityin D=6. To test the conjecture, we reproduce the corrections to the 3-formfield equations of the D=10 Type IIA string (a mixture of tree-level andone-loop effects) starting from the Chern-Simons corrections to the 7-formBianchi identities of the D=11 fivebrane (a purely tree-level effect). K3compactification of the latter then yields the familiar gauge and LorentzChern-Simons corrections to 3-form Bianchi identities of the heterotic string.We note that the absence of a dilaton in the D=11 theory allows us to fix boththe gravitational constant and the fivebrane tension in terms of the membranetension. We also comment on an apparent conflict between fundamental andsolitonic heterotic strings and on the puzzle of a fivebrane origin ofS-duality.
