We study $n$-point functions at finite temperature in the closed time pathformalism. With the help of two basic column vectors and their dual partners wederive a compact decomposition of the time-ordered $n$-point functions with$2^n$ components in terms of $2^{n-1} -1$ independent retarded/advanced$n$-point functions. This representation greatly simplifies calculations in thereal-time formalism.
