Comments: harvmac, 13 pp. Revised discussion of (p,q) 7-branes

We develop and study a D-brane realization of 4D N=2 super Yang-Mills theory.It is a type IIB string theory compactified on R^6\times K3 and containingparallel 7-branes. It can also be regarded as a subsector of Vafa's F-theorycompactified on K3\times K3 and is thus dual to the heterotic string onK3\times T^2. We show that the one-loop prepotential in this gauge theory isexactly equal to the interaction produced by classical closed string exchange.A monopole configuration corresponds to an open Dirichlet 5-brane wrappingaround K3 with ends attached to two 7-branes.
