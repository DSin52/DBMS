In this work we compare the quantization of a massless scalar field in aninertial frame with the quantization in a rotating frame. We used theTrocheries-Takeno mapping to relate measurements in the inertial and therotating frames. An exact solution of the Klein-Gordon equation in the rotatingcoordinate system is found and the Bogolubov transformation between theinertial and rotating modes is calculated, showing that the rotating observerdefines a vacuum state different from the Minkowski one. We also obtain theresponse function of an Unruh-De Witt detector coupled with the scalar fieldtravelling in a uniformly rotating world-line. The response function isthe usual Minkowski vacuum state and when it is prepared in theTrocheries-Takeno vacuum state. We also consider the case of an inertialdetector interacting with the field in the rotating vacuum.
