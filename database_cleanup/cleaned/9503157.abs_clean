operator on the arbitrary genus curve are addedJournal-ref: Commun.Math.Phys. 180 (1996) 587-604

We show that spin generalization of elliptic Calogero-Moser system, ellipticextension of Gaudin model and their cousins can be treated as a degenerationsof Hitchin systems. Applications to the constructions of integrals of motion,angle-action variables and quantum systems are discussed. Explicit formulas forthe Lax operator on the higher genus surfaces are obtained in the Shottkyparameterization. The constructions are motivated by the Conformal FieldTheory, and their quantum counterpart can be treated as a degeneration of thecritical level Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equations.
