Title: The Dark Side of String Theory

Authors: Gary T. Horowitz

Solutions to low energy string theory describing black holes and blackstrings are reviewed. Many of these solutions can be obtained by applyingsimple solution generating transformations to the Schwarzschild metric. In afew cases, the corresponding exact conformal field theory is known. Variousproperties of these solutions are discussed including their global structure,singularities, and Hawking temperature. (This review is based on lectures givenat the 1992 Trieste Spring School on String Theory and Quantum Gravity.)
