We propose a new method to calculate the greybody factor in the $AdS_3$. Thisis based on both the non-normalizable modes of a test field($\Phi_i$) and$AdS_3$/CFT correspondence. Such non-normalizable modes serve as classical,non-fluctuating background and encode the choice of operator insertion(${\calO}^i$) in the boundary. Actually specifying the boundary condition at infinityof $AdS_3$ corresponds to turning on these non-normalizable modes. Hence we cancalculate the greybody factor of test fields without the Dirichlet(or Neumann)boundary condition. The result is consistent with those of the boundary CFT andeffective string calculations.
