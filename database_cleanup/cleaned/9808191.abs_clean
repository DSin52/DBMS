general class, more details given of quantization in the Lorentzian caseJournal-ref: Phys.Rev. D61 (2000) 084007

We show that there is a sector of quantum general relativity which may beexpressed in a completely holographic formulation in terms of states andoperators defined on a finite boundary. The space of boundary states is builtout of the conformal blocks of SU(2)_L + SU(2)_R, WZW field theory on then-punctured sphere, where n is related to the area of the boundary. TheBekenstein bound is explicitly satisfied. These results are based on a newlagrangian and hamiltonian formulation of general relativity based on aconstrained Sp(4) topological field theory. The hamiltonian formalism ispolynomial, and also left-right symmetric. The quantization uses balancedSU(2)_L + SU(2)_R spin networks and so justifies the state sum model of Barrettand Crane. By extending the formalism to Osp(4/N) a holographic formulation ofextended supergravity is obtained, as will be described in detail in asubsequent paper.
