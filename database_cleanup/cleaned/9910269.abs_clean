Black hole production in the collision of ultra-relativistic particles in thebrane-world approach is considered. In particular, stability of the brane undercollision with ultra-relativistic particles is discussed. As a toy model weconsider the 3 dimensional version of the Randall and Sundrum solution and showthat stability of the brane depends on a choice of continuation of the solutionacross the horizon. In the unstable case black holes can be produced in thecollision of a particle with the brane.
