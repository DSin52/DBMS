Title: On the Local Equilibrium Principle

Authors: Hermann Hessling (FHTW Berlin)

effect on the conclusionsA physical system should be in a local equilibrium if it cannot bedistinguished from a global equilibrium by ``infinitesimally localizedmeasurements''. This seems to be a natural characterization of localequilibrium, however the problem is to give a precise meaning to thequalitative phrase ``infinitesimally localized measurements''.A solution is suggested in form of a {\em Local Equilibrium Condition} (LEC)which can be applied to non-interacting quanta.The Unruh temperature of massless quanta is derived by applying LEC to anarbitrary point inside the Rindler Wedge.Massless quanta outside a hot sphere are analyzed. A stationary sphericallysymmetric local equilibrium does only exist according to LEC if the temperatureis globally constant.Using LEC a non-trivial stationary local equilibrium is found for rotatingmassless quanta between two concentric cylinders of different temperatures.This shows that quanta may behave like a fluid with a B\'enard instability.
