We discuss the classical 2-dim. black-hole in the framework of thenon-perturbative formulation (in terms of non-relativistic fermions) of c=1string field theory. We identify an off-shell operator whose classical equationof motion is that of tachyon in the classical graviton-dilaton black-holebackground. The black-hole `singularity' is identified with the fermi surfacein the phase space of a single fermion, and as such is a consequence of thesemi-classical approximation. An exact treatment reveals that stringy quantumeffects wash away the classical singularity.
