We examine for standard-like orbifold compactification models the constraintsdue to quarks and leptons generation non-universality of soft supersymmetrybreaking interactions. We follow the approach initiated by Ibanez and Lust anddeveloped by Brignole, Ibanez and Munoz. The breaking of supersymmetry isrepresented in terms of dilaton and moduli auxiliary field components and,consistently with a vanishing cosmological constant, is parametrized in termsof the dilaton-moduli mixing angle $\theta $ and the gravitino mass scale$m_g$. The soft breaking interactions (gaugino masses, squarks and sleptonsmass matrices, scalars interactions A and B coupling constants) are calculableas a function of these parameters and of the discrete set of modular weightparameters specifying the modular transformation properties of the low-energyfields. We solve the renormalization group one-loop equations for the full setof gauge, Yukawa and supersymmetry breaking coupling constants.
