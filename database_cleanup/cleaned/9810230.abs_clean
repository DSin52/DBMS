The OSp(2|2)-invariant planar dynamics of a D=4 superparticle near thehorizon of a large mass extreme black hole is described by an N=2superconformal mechanics, with the SO(2) charge being the superparticle'sangular momentum. The {\it non-manifest} superconformal invariance of thesuperpotential term is shown to lead to a shift in the SO(2) charge by thevalue of its coefficient, which we identify as the orbital angular momentum.The full SU(1,1|2)-invariant dynamics is found from an extension to N=4superconformal mechanics.
