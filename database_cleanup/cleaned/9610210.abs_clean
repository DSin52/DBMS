Taking the complex nature of quantum mechanics which we observe today as alow energy effect of a broken quaternionic theory we explore the possibilitythat dark matter arises as a consequence of this underlying quaternionicstructure to our universe. We introduce a low energy, effective, Lagrangianwhich incorporates the remnants of a local quaternionic algebra, investigatethe stellar production of the resultant exotic bosons and explore the possiblelow energy consequences of our remnant extended Hilbert space.
