The first quantization of the relativistic Brink-DiVecchia-Howe-Polyakov(BDHP) string in the range $1<d<25$ is considered. It is shown that using thePolyakov sum over bordered surfaces in the Feynman path integral quantizationscheme one gets a consistent quantum mechanics of relativistic 1-dim extendedobjects in the range $1<d<25$. In particular the BDHP string propagator isexactly calculated for arbitrary initial and final string configurations andthe Hilbert space of physical states of noncritical BDHP string is explicitlyconstructed. The resulting theory is equivalent to the Fairlie-Chodos-Thornmassive string model. In contrast to the conventional conformal field theoryapproach to noncritical string and random surfaces in the Euclidean targetspace the path integral formulation of the Fairlie-Chodos-Thorn string obtainedin this paper does not rely on the principle of conformal invariance. Someconsequences of this feature for constructing a consistent relativistic stringtheory based on the "splitting-joining" interaction are discussed.}
