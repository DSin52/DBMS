We give an expanded discussion of the proposal that spacetime supersymmetryrepresentations may be viewed as having their origins in 1D theories thatinvolve a special class of real Clifford algebras. These 1D theories reproducethe supersymmetric structures of spacetime supersymmetric theories after thelatter are reduced on a 0-brane.
