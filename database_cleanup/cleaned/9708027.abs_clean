We investigate the zero temperature chiral phase transition in(2+1)-dimensional QED in the presence of a Chern-Simons term, changing thenumber of fermion flavors. In the symmetric phase, there are no light degreesof freedom even at the critical point. Unlike the case without a Chern-Simonsterm, the phase transition is first-order.
