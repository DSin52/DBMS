We study geometric engineering of four-dimensional N=1 gauge models fromM-theory on a seven-dimensional manifold with G_2 holonomy. The manifold isconstructed as a K3 fibration over a three-dimensional base space with ADEgeometry. The resulting gauge theory is discussed in the realm of (p,q) webs.We discuss how the anomaly cancellation condition translates into a conditionon the associated affine ADE Lie algebras.
