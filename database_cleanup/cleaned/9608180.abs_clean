The propagator of a spinning particle in external Abelian field and inarbitrary dimensions is presented by means of a path integral. The problem hasdifferent solutions in even and odd dimensions. In even dimensions therepresentation is just a generalization of one in four dimensions (it has beenknown before). In this case a gauge invariant part of the effective action inthe path integral has a form of the standard (Berezin-Marinov) pseudoclassicalaction. In odd dimensions the solution is presented for the first time and, inparticular, it turns out that the gauge invariant part of the effective actiondiffers from the standard one. We propose this new action as a candidate todescribe spinning particles in odd dimensions. Studying the hamiltonization ofthe pseudoclassical theory with this action, we show that the operatorquantization leads to adequate minimal quantum theory of spinning particles inodd dimensions. In contrast with the models proposed formerly in this case thenew one admits both the operator and the path integral quantization. Finallythe consideration is generalized for the case of the particle with anomalousmagnetic moment.
