We critically review several recent approaches to solving the twocosmological constant problems. The "old" problem is the discrepancy betweenthe observed value of $\Lambda$ and the large values suggested by particlephysics models. The second problem is the "time coincidence" between the epochof galaxy formation $t_G$ and the epoch of $\Lambda$-domination $t_\L$. It isconceivable that the "old" problem can be resolved by fundamental physicsalone, but we argue that in order to explain the "time coincidence" we mustaccount for anthropic selection effects. Our main focus here is on thediscrete-$\Lambda$ models in which $\Lambda$ can change through nucleation ofbranes. We consider the cosmology of this type of models in the context ofinflation and discuss the observational constraints on the model parameters.The issue of multiple brane nucleation raised by Feng {\it et. al.} isdiscussed in some detail. We also review continuous-$\L$ models in which therole of the cosmological constant is played by a slowly varying potential of ascalar field. We find that both continuous and discrete models can in principlesolve both cosmological constant problems, although the required values of theparameters do not appear very natural. M-theory-motivated brane models, inwhich the brane tension is determined by the brane coupling to the four-formfield, do not seem to be viable, except perhaps in a very tight corner of theparameter space. Finally, we point out that the time coincidence can also beexplained in models where $\Lambda$ is fixed, but the primordial densitycontrast $Q=\delta\rho/\rho$ is treated as a random variable.
