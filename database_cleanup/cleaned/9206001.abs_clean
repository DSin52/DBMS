We study the thermodynamic properties of a family of integrable 1D spin chainhamiltonians associated with quantum groups at roots of unity. Thesehamiltonians depend for each primitive root of unit on a parameter $s$ whichplays the role of a continuous spin. The model exhibits ferrimagnetism eventhough the interaction involved is between nearest neighbors. The latterphenomenon is interpreted as a genuine quantum group effect with no``classical" analog. The discussion of conformal properties is given.
