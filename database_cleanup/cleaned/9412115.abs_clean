Title: The Moduli Space of N = 2 Superconformal Field Theories

Comments: LaTeX, 53 pages, 7 figures

We review the structure of the moduli space of particular N = (2,2)superconformal field theories. We restrict attention to those of particular usein superstring compactification, namely those with central charge c = 3d forsome integer d and whose NS fields have integer U(1) charge. The cases d = 1, 2and 3 are analyzed. It is shown that in the case d >= 3 it is important to usetechniques of algebraic geometry rather than rely on metric-based ideas. Thephase structure of these moduli spaces is discussed in some detail. (LecturesDelivered at Trieste Summer School, 1994.)
