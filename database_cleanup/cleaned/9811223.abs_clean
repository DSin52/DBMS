A linear degenerate odd Poisson bracket (antibracket) realized solely onGrassmann variables is presented. It is revealed that this bracket has at oncethree nilpotent $\Delta$-like differential operators of the first, the secondand the third orders with respect to the Grassmann derivatives. It is shownthat these $\Delta$-like operators together with the Grassmann-odd nilpotentCasimir function of this bracket form a finite-dimensional Lie superalgebra.
