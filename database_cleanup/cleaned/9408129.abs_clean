Title: Barriers in Quantum Gravity

Authors: Jan Ambjorn

Comments: standard latex, 10 pages. (one year old contribution to Trieste

workshop, but continued demand for preprints has motivated me to put it onthe bulletin board), NBI-HE-93-31I discuss recent progress in our understanding of two barriers in quantumEuclidean Einstein-Hilbert gravity formulated in space-time dimensions $D >2$.
