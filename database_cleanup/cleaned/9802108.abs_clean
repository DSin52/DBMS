We investigate the self-dual Yang-Mills gauge configurations on $R^3\timesS^1$ when the gauge symmetry SU(2) is broken to U(1) by the Wilson loop. Weconstruct the explicit field configuration for a single instanton by the Nahmmethod and show that an instanton is composed of two self-dual monopoles ofopposite magnetic charge. We normalize the moduli space metric of an instantonand study various limits of the field configuration and its moduli spacemetric.
