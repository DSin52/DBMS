All the three point couplings involving tachyons and/or discrete states areobtained in $c=1$ two-dimensional (2-D) quantum gravity by means of theoperator product expansion (OPE). Cocycle factors are found to be necessary inorder to maintain the analytic structure of the OPE, and are constructedexplicitly both for discrete states and for tachyons. The effective actioninvolving tachyons and discrete states is worked out to summarize all of thesethree point couplings.
