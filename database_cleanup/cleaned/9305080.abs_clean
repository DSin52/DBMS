We construct and classify topological lattice field theories in threedimensions. After defining a general class of local lattice field theories, weimpose invariance under arbitrary topology-preserving deformations of theunderlying lattice, which are generated by two new local lattice moves.Invariant solutions are in one--to--one correspondence with Hopf algebrassatisfying a certain constraint. As an example, we study in detail thetopological lattice field theory corresponding to the Hopf algebra based on thegroup ring $\C[G]$, and show that it is equivalent to lattice gauge theory atzero coupling, and to the Ponzano--Regge theory for $G=$SU(2).
