Title: sl(N) Onsager's Algebra and Integrability

We define an $ sl(N) $ analog of Onsager's Algebra through a finite set ofrelations that generalize the Dolan Grady defining relations for the originalOnsager's Algebra. This infinite-dimensional Lie Algebra is shown to beisomorphic to a fixed point subalgebra of $ sl(N) $ Loop Algebra with respectto a certain involution. As the consequence of the generalized Dolan Gradyrelations a Hamiltonian linear in the generators of $ sl(N) $ Onsager's Algebrais shown to posses an infinite number of mutually commuting integrals ofmotion.
