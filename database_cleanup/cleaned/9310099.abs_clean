We study dynamics of non-relativistic Chern-Simons solitons, both in theabsence and in the presence of external fields. We find that a phase, relatedto the $1$-cocyle of the Galileo group, must be included to give the correctdynamical behavior. We show that interactions among Chern-Simons solitons aremediated by an effective Chern-Simons gauge field induced by the solitons. Inthe two soliton case, we evaluate analytically the effective interactionLagrangian, which previously was found numerically.
