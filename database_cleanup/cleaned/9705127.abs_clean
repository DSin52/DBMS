String Theory, (Sokcho, Korea), February 24-28, 1997We construct nearly topological Yang-Mills theories on eight dimensionalmanifolds with a special holonomy group. These manifolds are the Joyce manifoldwith $Spin(7)$ holonomy and the Calabi-Yau manifold with SU(4) holonomy. Aninvariant closed four form $T_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$ on the manifold allows us todefine an analogue of the instanton equation, which serves as a topologicalgauge fixing condition in BRST formalism. The model on the Joyce manifold isrelated to the eight dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Topologicaldimensional reduction to four dimensions gives non-abelian Seiberg-Wittenequation.
