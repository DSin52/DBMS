Title: Some remarks on 't Hooft's S-matrix for black holes

Authors: N.Itzhaki

Comments: 12 pages

We discuss the limitations of 't Hooft's proposal for the black holeS-matrix. We find that the validity of the S-matrix implies violation of thesemi-classical approximation at scales large compared to the Planck scale. Wealso show that the effect of the centrifugal barrier on the S-matrix is crucialeven for large transverse distances.
