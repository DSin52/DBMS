We discuss a general pairing that occurs in compactifications of M-theory onAdS_4 x X^7 backgrounds between massless ultra short multiplets and theirmassive shadows, namely certain universal long multiplets with fixed protecteddimensions. In particular we consider the shadow of the short gravitonmultiplet in N=3 compactifications. It turns out to be a massive spin 3/2multiplet with scale dimension E_0=3 and with the quantum numbers of asuper-Higgs multiplet. Hence each N=3 AdS_4 x X^7 vacuum is actually to beinterpreted as a spontaneously broken phase of an N=4 theory. Comparison withstandard gauged N=4 supergravity in 4 dimensions reveals the unexpected boundE_0<3 on the dimension of the broken gravitino multiplet. This hints to theexistence of new versions of extended supergravities, in particular N=4 wheresuch upper bounds are evaded and where all possible vacua have a reducedsupersymmetry N_0<N. We name them shadow supergravities. In particular, usingarguments based on the solvable Lie algebra parametrization of the scalarmanifold, we discuss the possible structure of shadow N=4 supergravity. Usingour previous results on the SCFT dual of the AdS_4 x N^{0,1,0} vacuum wediscuss the SCFT realization of the universal N=3 shadow multiplet. RG flowsfrom an N=4 to an N=3 phase are ruled out by the fact that the N=4 vacuum is atinfinite distance in moduli space, denoting the presence of a topology change.
