When $N$ five-branes of M-theory coincide the world-volume theory containstensionless strings, according to Strominger's construction. This suggests alarge $N$ limit of tensionless string theories. For the small $E_8$ instantontheories, the definition would be a large instanton number. An adiabaticargument suggests that in the large $N$ limit an effective extra uncompactifieddimension might be observed. We also propose ``surface-equations'', which arean analog of Makeenko-Migdal loop-equations, and might describe correlators inthe tensionless string theories. In these equations, the anti-self-dual twoforms of 6D and the tensionless strings enter on an equal footing. Addition ofstrings with CFTs on their world-sheet is analogous to addition of matter in 4DQCD.
