We study the relationship between static p-brane solitons and cosmologicalsolutions of string theory or M-theory. We discuss two different ways in whichextremal p-branes can be generalised to non-extremal ones, and show how wideclasses of recently discussed cosmological models can be mapped intonon-extremal p-brane solutions of one of these two kinds. We also extendprevious discussions of cosmological solutions to include some that make use ofcosmological-type terms in the effective action that can arise from thegeneralised dimensional reduction of string theory or M-theory.
