We study the Type IIA limit of the M theory fivebrane configurationcorresponding to N=1 supersymmetric QCD with massless quarks. We identify theeffective gauge coupling constant that fits withNovikov-Shifman-Veinshtein-Zakharov exact beta function. We find two differentType IIA limits that correspond to the electric and magnetic descriptions ofSQCD, as observed in the massive case by Schmaltz and Sundrum. The analysis isextended to the case of symplectic and orthogonal gauge groups. In any of thecases considered in this paper, the electric and magnetic configurations aresmoothly interpolated via $M$ theory. This is in sharp contrast with theproposed derivation of N=1 duality within the weakly coupled Type IIA stringtheory where a singularity is inevitable unless one turns on a parameter thattakes the theory away from an interesting point.
