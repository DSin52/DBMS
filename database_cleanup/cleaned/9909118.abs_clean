We consider a two-dimensional integrable and conformally invariant fieldtheory possessing two Dirac spinors and three scalar fields. The interactioncouples bilinear terms in the spinors to exponentials of the scalars. Itsintegrability properties are based on the sl(2) affine Kac-Moody algebra, andit is a simple example of the so-called conformal affine Toda theories coupledto matter fields. We show, using bosonization techniques, that the classicalequivalence between a U(1) Noether current and the topological current holdstrue at the quantum level, and then leads to a bag model like mechanism for theconfinement of the spinor fields inside the solitons. By bosonizing the spinorswe show that the theory decouples into a sine-Gordon model and free scalars. Weconstruct the two-soliton solutions and show that their interactions lead tothe same time delays as those for the sine-Gordon solitons. The model providesa good laboratory to test duality ideas in the context of the equivalencebetween the sine-Gordon and Thirring theories.
