Title: BFT Embedding of Interacting Second-Class Systems

Comments: 22 pages, Latex

The embedding procedure of Batalin, Fradkin, and Tyutin, which allows toconvert a second-class system into a first-class one, is employed to convertsecond-class interacting models. Two cases are considered. One, is theSelf-Dual model minimally coupled to a Dirac fermion field. The other, theSelf-Dual model minimally coupled to a charged scalar field. In both cases,they are found equivalent interacting Maxwell-Chern-Simons type field theories.These equivalences are pushed beyond the formal level, by analysing some treelevel probability amplitudes associated to the models.
