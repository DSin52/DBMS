We compute the mass and multiplet spectrum of M theory compactified on theproduct of AdS(4) spacetime by the Stiefel manifold V(5,2)=SO(5)/SO(3), and weuse this information to deduce via the AdS/CFT map the primary operator contentof the boundary N=2 conformal field theory. We make an attempt for a candidatesupersymmetric gauge theory that, at strong coupling, should be related toparallel M2-branes on the singular point of the non-compact Calabi-Yaufour-fold $\sum_{a=1}^5 z_a^2 = 0$, describing the cone on V(5,2).
