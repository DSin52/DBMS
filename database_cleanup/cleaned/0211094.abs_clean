The nonlinear integral equations describing the spectra of the left and right(continuous) quantum KdV equations on the cylinder are derived from integrablelattice field theories, which turn out to allow the Bethe Ansatz equations of atwisted ``spin -1/2'' chain. A very useful mapping to the more common nonlinearintegral equation of the twisted continuous spin +1/2 chain is found. Thediagonalization of the transfer matrix is performed. The vacua sector isanalysed in detail detecting the primary states of the minimal conformal modelsand giving integral expressions for the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix.General expressions for the eigenvalues of the infinite-dimensional abelianalgebra of local integrals of motion are given and explicitly calculated at thefree fermion point.
