We consider the unoriented two-dimensional Abelian sandpile model on thehalf-plane with open and closed boundary conditions. We show that the operatoreffecting the change from closed to open, or from open to closed, is a boundaryprimary field of weight -1/8, belonging to a c=-2 logarithmic conformal fieldtheory.
