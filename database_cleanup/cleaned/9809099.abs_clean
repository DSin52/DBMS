International Workshop on Thermal Field Theories and Their Applications,Regensburg, Germany, August 10-14, 1998We compute the quadratic part of the thermal effective action for real scalarfields which are initially in thermal equilibrium and vary slowly in time usinga generalised real-time formalism proposed by Le Bellac and Mabilat\cite{belmab}. We derive both Real Time and Imaginary Time Formalisms and findthat the result is analytic at the limits of zero external four-momenta whenusing our full time contour. We expand the fields in time up to the secondderivative and discuss the initial time dependence of our result before andafter the expansion in terms of equilibrium.
