We discuss duality between Type IIA string theory, eleven-dimensionalsupergravity, and heterotic string theory in four spacetime dimensions with$N=1$ supersymmetry. We find theories whose infrared limit is trivial atenhanced symmetry points as well as theories with $N=1$ supersymmetry but thefield content of $N=4$ theories which flow to the $N=4$ fixed line in theinfrared.
