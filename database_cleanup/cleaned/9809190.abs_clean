We describe the partial breaking of $N=1 D=10$ supersymmetry down to $(1,0)d=6$ supersymmetry within the non-linear realization approach. The basicGoldstone superfield associated with this breaking is shown to be the $(1,0)d=6$ hypermultiplet superfield $q^{ia}$ subjected to a non-lineargeneralization of the standard hypermultiplet superfield constraint. Thedynamical equations implied by this constraint are identified as the manifestlyworldvolume supersymmetric equations of the Type I super 5-brane in D=10. Wegive arguments in favour of existence of an appropriate brane extension ofoff-shell hypermultiplet actions in harmonic superspace. Some related problems,in particular, the issue of utilizing other $(1,0) d=6$ supermultiplets asGoldstone ones, are shortly discussed.
