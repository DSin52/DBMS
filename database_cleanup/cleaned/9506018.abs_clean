Comments: 12 pages, revtex. Two minor figures can be obtained by request; to

appear in the Proceedings of the International Symposium on Vector BosonSelf-Interactions, UCLA, Feb. 1-3, 1995Radiation symmetry is briefly reviewed, along with its historical,experimental, computational, and theoretical relevance. A sketch of the proofof a theorem for radiation zeros is used to highlight the connection betweengauge-boson couplings and Poincare transformations. It is emphasized that whilemostly bad things happen to good zeros, the weak-boson self-couplings continueto be intimately tied to the best examples of exact or approximate zeros.
