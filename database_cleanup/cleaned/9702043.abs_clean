String cosmology solutions are examined in a generalized phase-spaceincluding sources representing arbitrary corrections to lowest orderstring-dilaton-gravity effective action. We find a set of necessary conditionsfor a graceful exit transition from a dilaton-driven inflationary phase to aradiation dominated era. We show that sources allowing such a transition haveto violate energy conditions similar to those appearing in singularity theoremsof general relativity. Since familiar classical sources, excepting spatialcurvature, obey these energy conditions we conclude that a generic gracefulexit in string cosmology requires a new effective phase of matter. Our resultsclarify and generalize previous analyses and enable us to critically reexamineproposed non-singular cosmologies.
