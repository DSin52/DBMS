The integrability of the N-cosine model, a N-field generalization of thesine-Gordon model, is investigated. We establish to first order in conformalperturbation theory that, for arbitrary N, the model possesses a quantumconserved current of Lorentz spin 3 on a submanifold of the parameter spacewhere the interaction becomes marginal. The integrability of the model on thissubmanifold is further studied using renormalization techniques. It is shownthat for N = 2, 3, and 4 there exist special points on the marginal manifold atwhich the N-cosine model is equivalent to models of Gross-Neveu type andtherefore is integrable. In the 2-field case we further argue that the pointsmentioned above exhaust all integrable cases on the marginal submanifold.
