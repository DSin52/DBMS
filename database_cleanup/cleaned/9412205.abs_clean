Title: Phase Transition in Scalar Theory Quantized on the Light-Front

Comments: 6 pages, Tex. Published in the Proceedings of the WORKSHOP ON HADRON

PHYSICS- HADRONS94, Gramado, RS, Brasil, World Scientific, SingaporeThe renormalization of the two dimensional light-front quantized $\phi^{4}$theory is discussed. The mass renormalization condition and the renormalizedconstraint equation are shown to contain all the information to describe thephase transition in the theory, which is found to be of the second order inagreement with the conjecture of Simons and Griffith. We argue that the sameresult is also be obtained in the conventional equal-time formulation.
