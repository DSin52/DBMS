An inflationary epoch driven by the kinetic energy density in a dynamicalPlanck mass is studied. In the conformally related Einstein frame it is easiestto see the demands of successful inflation cannot be satisfied by kineticinflation alone. Viewed in the original Jordan-Brans-Dicke frame, the obstacleis manifest as a kind of graceful exit problem and/or a kind of flatnessproblem. These arguments indicate the weakness of only the simplestformulation. {}From them can be gleaned directions toward successful kineticinflation.
