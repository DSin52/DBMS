Two-dimensional N=1,2 supersymmetric chiral models and their dual extensionsare introduced and canonically quantized. Working within a superspaceformalism, the non-manifest invariance under 2D-superPoincare' transformationsis proven. The N=1,2 superVirasoro algebras are recovered as current algebras.The non-anomalous quantum invariances under 1D-superdiffeomorphisms (for chiralmodels) and N=1,2 superconformal transformations (for dual models) are shown tobe a consequence of an N=1,2 super-Coulomb gas representation.
