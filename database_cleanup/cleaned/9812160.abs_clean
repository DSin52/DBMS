School in Contemporary Relativity, Villa Olmo, Como First Course, April 1998In these lectures we explain the concept of supergravity p-branes and BPSblack holes. Introducing an audience of general relativists to all thenecessary geometry related with extended supergravity (special geometry,symplectic embeddings and the like) we describe the general properties of N=2black holes, the structure of central charges in extended supergravity and thedescription of black hole entropy as an invariant of the U duality group. Then,after explaining the concept and the use of solvable Lie algebras we presentthe detailed construction of 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 supersymmetry preserving blackholes in the context of N=8 supergravity. The Lectures are meant to beintroductory and self contained for non supersymmetry experts but at the sametime fully detailed and complete on the subject.
