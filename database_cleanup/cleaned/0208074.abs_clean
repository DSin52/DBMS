We construct IIA GS superstring action on the ten-dimensional pp-wavebackground, which arises as the compactification of eleven-dimensional pp-wavegeometry along the isometry direction. The background geometry has 24 Killingspinors and among them, 16 components correspond to the non-linearly realizedkinematical supersymmetry in the string action. The remaining eight componentsare linearly realized and shown to be independent of x^+ coordinate, which isidentified with the world-sheet time coordinate of the string action in thelight-cone gauge. The resultant dynamical N=(4,4) supersymmetry isinvestigated, which is shown to be consistent with the field contents of theaction containing two free massive supermultiplets.
