Using a manifestly supersymmetric formalism, we determine the generalstructure of two- and three- point functions of the supercurrent and theflavour current of N = 2 superconformal field theories. We also express them interms of N = 1 superfields and compare to the generic N = 1 correlationfunctions. A general discussion of the N = 2 supercurrent superfield and themultiplet of anomalies and their definition as derivatives with respect to thesupergravity prepotentials is also included.
