We present extremal stationary solutions that generalize theIsrael-Wilson-Perjes class for the d+3-dimensional low-energy limit ofheterotic string theory with n >= d+1 U(1) gauge fields compactified on ad-torus. A rotating axisymmetric dyonic solution is obtained using the matrixErnst potential formulation and expressed in terms of a single d+1 X d+1-matrixharmonic function. By studying the asymptotic behaviour of the fieldconfigurations we define the physical charges of the field system. Theextremality condition makes the charges to saturate theBogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bound. The gyromagnetic ratios of thecorresponding field configurations appear to have arbitrary values. A subclassof rotating dyonic black hole-type solutions arises when the NUT charges areset to zero. In the particular case d=1, n=6, which correspond to N=4, D=4supergravity, the found dyon reproduces the supersymmetric dyonic solutionconstructed by Bergshoeff et al.
