We discuss the impact of quadratic quantum fluctuations on the Wilson loopextracted from classical string theory. We show that a large class of models,which includes the near horizon limit of D_p branes with 16 supersymmetries,admits a L\"{u}scher type correction to the classical potential. We confirmthat the quantum determinant associated with a BPS configuration of a singlequark in the AdS_5 \times S^5 model is free from divergences. We find that forthe Wilson loop in that model, unlike the situation in flat space-time, thefermionic determinant does not cancel the bosonic one. For string models thatcorrespond to gauge theories in the confining phase, we show that thecorrection to the potential is of a L\"{u}scher type and is attractive.
