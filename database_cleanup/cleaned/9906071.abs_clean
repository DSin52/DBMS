pages, tcilatex, to be published in a special Festschrift volume, dedicatedto Prof. E. Wichmann on the occasion of his seventieth birthdaySome of the consequences of Eyvind Wichmann's contributions to modular theoryand the QFT phase-space structure are presented. In order to show the power ofthose ideas in contemporary problems, I selected the issue of algebraicholography as well as a new nonperturbative constructive approach (based on themodular structur of wedge-localized algebras and modular inclusions) and showthat these ideas are recent consequences of the pathbreaking work whichWichmann together with his collaborator Bisognano initiated in the mid70$^{ies}.
