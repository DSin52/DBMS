Title: The dynamics of zeros of the finite-gap solutions to the Schrodinger

equationAuthors: A. Akhmetshin, Y. Volvovsky

Comments: 12 pages, LaTeX

Following the recent paper by J. F. van Diejen and H. Puschmann weinvestigate the behavior of zeros of the finite-gap solutions to theSchrodinger equation. As a result, a new system of particles on a puncturedRiemann surface is constructed. It is shown to be Hamiltonian and integrable.
