The (1+1)-dimensional bosonization relations for fermionic mass terms arederived by choosing a specific gauge in an enlarged gauge-invariant theorycontaining both fermionic and bosonic fields. The fermionic part of thegenerating functional subject to the gauge constraint can be cast into the formof a strongly coupled Schwinger model, which can be solved exactly. Theresulting bosonic theory coupled to the scalar sources then exhibits directlythe bosonic counterparts of the fermionic scalar and pseudoscalar massdensities.
