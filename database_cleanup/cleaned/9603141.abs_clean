Authors: Masako Kawamura, Shin'ichi Nojiri and Akio Sugamoto

Comments: Latex file, 5pp. Contributed to Asia Pacific Conference on

Gravitation and Cosmology, Seoul 2-6 Feb, 1996When the swimming of micro-organisms is viewed from the string and membranetheories coupled to the velocity field of the fluid, a number of interestingresults are derived; 1) importance of the area (or volume) preserving algebra,2) usefulness of the $N$-point Reggeon (membranic) amplitudes, and of the gasto liquid transition in case of the red tide issues, 3) close relation betweenthe red tide issue and the generation of Einstein gravity, and 4) possibleunderstanding of the three different swimming ways of micro-organisms from thesingularity structure of the shape space.
