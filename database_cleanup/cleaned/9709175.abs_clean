A natural geometry, arising from the embedding into a Hilbert space of theparametrised probability measure for a given lattice model, is used to studythe symmetry properties of real-space renormalisation group (RG) flow. In theterm, which generates a projective automorphism of the state space for eachgiven length scale; and an explicit correction. We then argue that thisstructure implies the absence of any symmetry of a geodesic type for the RGflow when restricted to the parameter space submanifold of the state space.This is demonstrated explicitly via a study of the one dimensional Ising modelin an external field. In this example we construct exact expressions for thebeta functions associated with the flow induced by infinitesimal rescaling.These constitute a generating vector field for RG diffeomorphisms on theparameter space manifold, and we analyse the symmetry properties of thistransformation. The results indicate an approximate conformal Killing symmetrynear the critical point, but no generic symmetry of the RG flow globally on theparameter space.
