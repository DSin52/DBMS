We study the chiral rings in N=2 and N=4 superconformal algebras. The chiralprimary states of N=2 superconformal algebras realized over hermitian triplesystems are given. Their coset spaces G/H are hermitian symmetric which can becompact or non-compact. In the non-compact case, under the requirement ofunitarity of the representations of G we find an infinite set of chiral primarystates associated with the holomorphic discrete series representations of G.Further requirement of the unitarity of the corresponding N=2 module truncatesthis infinite set to a finite subset. The chiral primary states of the N=2superconformal algebras realized over Freudenthal triple systems are alsostudied. These algebras have the special property that they admit an extensionto N=4 superconformal algebras with the gauge group SU(2)XSU(2)XU(1). Wegeneralize the concept of the chiral rings to N=4 superconformal algebras. Wefind four different rings associated with each sector (left or right moving).We also show that our analysis yields all the possible rings of N=4superconformal algebras.
