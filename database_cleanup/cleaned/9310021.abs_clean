The leading, planar diagrams of the $1/N_c$ expansion and the usual stringdescription suggest that quarks propagate on the boundary of a two-dimensionalworld surface. We restrict the quarks to the boundary of the world surface bygiving them infinitely large mass on the interior of the surface and zero masson its boundary and show that in this picture the QCD $\theta$--vacua can berepresented by the self-intersection number (or equivalently by the first Chernnumber of the normal bundle) of the surface.
