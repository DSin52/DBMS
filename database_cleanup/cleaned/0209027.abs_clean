We introduce a method to obtain deformed defects starting from a given scalarfield theory which possesses defect solutions. The procedure allows theconstruction of infinitely many new theories that support defect solutions,analytically expressed in terms of the defects of the original theory. Themethod is general, valid for both topological and non-topological defects, andwe show how it extends to quantum mechanics, and how it works when the scalarfield couples to fermions. We illustrate the general procedure with severalexamples, which support kink-like or lump-like defects.
