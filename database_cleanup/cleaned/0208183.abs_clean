The Bogoliubov transformation in thermofield dynamics, an operator formalismfor the finite-temperature quantum-field theory, is generalized to describe afield in arbitrary confined regions of space and time. Starting with the scalarfield, the approach is extended to the electromagnetic field and theenergy-momentum tensor is written via the Bogoliubov transformation. In thiscontext, the Casimir effect is calculated for zero and non-zero temperature,and therefore it can be considered as a vacuum condensation effect of theelectromagnetic field. This aspect opens an interesting perspective for usingthis procedure as an effective scheme for calculations in the studies ofconfined fields, including the interacting fields.
