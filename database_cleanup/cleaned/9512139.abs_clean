summer school in high energy physics and cosmology. Minor corrections and 1reference addedAn introduction to $N=2$ rigid and local supersymmetry is given. Theconstruction of the actions of vector multiplets is reviewed, defining specialK\"ahler manifolds. Symplectic transformations lead to either isometries orsymplectic reparametrizations. Writing down a symplectic formulation of specialgeometry clarifies the relation to the moduli spaces of a Riemann surface or aCalabi-Yau 3-fold. The scheme for obtaining perturbative and non-perturbativecorrections to a supersymmetry model is explained. The Seiberg-Witten model isreviewed as an example of the identification of duality symmetries withmonodromies and symmetries of the associated moduli space of a Riemann surface.
