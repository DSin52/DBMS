It is shown that Weyl spinors in 4D Minkowski space are composed of primaryfields of half-integer conformal weights. This yields representations offermionic 2-point functions in terms of correlators of primary fields with afactorized transformation behavior under the Lorentz group. I employ thisobservation to determine the general structure of the corresponding Lorentzcovariant correlators by methods similar to the methods employed in conformalfield theory to determine 2- and 3-point functions of primary fields. Inparticular, the chiral symmetry breaking terms resemble fermionic 2-pointfunctions of 2D CFT up to a function of the product of momenta. Theconstruction also permits for the formulation of covariant meromorphyconstraints on spinors in 3+1 dimensions.
