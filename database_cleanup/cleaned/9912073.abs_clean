We calculate the classical cross-section for absorption of a minimallycoupled scalar in the double-centered D3-brane geometry. The dual field theoryhas gauge symmetry broken to S(U(N_1)*U(N_2)) and is on the Coulomb branch ofN=4 Super Yang-Mills theory. Our analysis is valid at energy scales muchsmaller than the W particles mass, giving logarithmic corrections to the crosssection calculated at the IR conformal fixed points. These corrections areassociated with deformations of the N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory by irrelevantoperators that break conformal invariance and correspond to processes where avirtual pair of gauge particles or a virtual pair of W bosons interact with theincident wave to create a pair of gauge particles.
