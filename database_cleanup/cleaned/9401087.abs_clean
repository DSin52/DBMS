Title: Poincar\'{e} series of quantum matrix bialgebras determined by a pair of

quantum spacesComments: 12 pages

The dimension of the third homogeneous component of a matrix quantumbialgebra, determined by pair of quantum spaces, is calculated. ThePoincar\'{e} series of some deformations of $GL(n)$ is calculated. A newdeformation of $GL(3)$ with the correct dimension is given.
