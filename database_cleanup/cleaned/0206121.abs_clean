and "References" are revisedWe have extended the variational perturbative theory based on the back groundfield method to include the optimized expansion of Okopinska and the postGaussian effective potential of Stansu and Stevenson. This new method providesmuch simpler way to compute the correction terms to the Gausssian effectiveaction (or potential). We have also proposed a conceptually more appealingprescription for renormalization of the effective potential of the 4-dimensional scalar $\phi^4$ theory. Although this renormalization prescriptionleads to the same mathematical form for the renormalized effective potential asthat of Stansu and Stevenson it does not involve the expansion parameter($\epsilon$).
