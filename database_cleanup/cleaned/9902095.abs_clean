We study some aspects of short-distance interaction between parallelD3-branes in type 0 string theory as described by the correspondingworld-volume gauge theory. We compute the one-loop effective potential in thenon-supersymmetric SU(N) x SU(N) gauge theory (which is a Z_2 projection of theU(2N) n=4 SYM theory) representing dyonic branes composed of N electric and Nmagnetic D3-branes. The branes of the same type repel at short distances, butan electric and a magnetic brane attract, and the forces between self-dualbranes cancel. The self-dual configuration (with the positions of the electricand the magnetic branes, i.e. the diagonal entries of the adjoint scalarfields, being the same) is stable against separation of one electric or onemagnetic brane, but is unstable against certain modes of separation of severalsame-type branes. This instability should be suppressed in the large N limit,i.e. should be irrelevant for the large N CFT interpretation of the gaugetheory suggested in hep-th/9901101.
