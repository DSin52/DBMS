The effect of the Gauss--Bonnet term on the SU(2) non--Abelian regular stringysphaleron solutions is studied within the non--perturbative treatment. It isfound that the existence of regular solutions depends crucially on the value ofthe numerical factor $\beta$ in front of the Gauss--Bonnet term in thefour--dimensional effective action. Numerical solutions are constructed in theN=1, 2, 3 cases for different $\beta$ below certain critical values $\beta_N$which decrease with growing N (N being the number of nodes of the Yang--Millsfunction). It is proved that for any static spherically symmetricasymptotically flat regular solution the ADM mass is exactly equal to thedilaton charge. No solutions were found for $\beta$ above critical values, inparticular, for $\beta=1$.
