Homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation for simplest Wick-Cutkosky model isstudied in the case when the mass of the two-body system is more then the sumof constituent particles masses. It is shown that there is always a smallattraction between the like-sigh charged particles as a pure relativisticeffect. If the coupling constant exceeds some critical values there arisediscrete levels.The situation here is analogous to the so-called "abnormal"solutions.The signature of the norm of these discrete states coincides with the"time-parity".The states with the negative norms can be excluded from thephysical sector-the one-time (quasipotential) wave-function corresponding tothem vanishes identically.However the positive norm states survive andcontribute to the total Green function (and the S-matrix) with the proper sign.
