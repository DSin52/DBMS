A derivation of the cyclic form factor equation from quantum fieldtheoretical principles is given; form factors being the matrix elements of afield operator between scattering states. The scattering states are constructedfrom Haag-Ruelle type interpolating fields with support in a `comoving' Rindlerspacetime. The cyclic form factor equation then arises from the KMS property ofthe modular operators Delta associated with the field algebras of these Rindlerwedges. The derivation in particular shows that the equation holds in anymassive 1+1 dim. relativistic QFT, regardless of its integrability.
