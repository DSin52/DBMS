Baker, Ball and Zachariasen have developed an elegant formulation of the dualsuperconducting model of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which allows one to usethe field equations to eliminate the gluon and Higgs degrees of freedom andthus to express the interaction between quarks as an effective potential.Carrying out an expansion in inverse powers of the constituent quark masses,these authors succeeded in identifying the central part, the spin-dependentpart and the leading relativistic corrections to the central potential. Thepotential offers a good account of the energies and splittings of charmoniumand the upsilon system. Since all of the flavor dependence of the interactionis presumed to enter through the constituent masses, it is possible to test thepotential in other systems. Logical candidates are the heavy B-flavor charmedsystem and the heavy-light systems, which should be more sensitive to therelativistic corrections. Lattice gauge calculations furnish an additionalpoint of contact for the components of the BBZ potential. Some preliminarycalculations of the energies of B and D mesons are presented and the challengeof agreement with experiment is discussed. The spinless Salpeter equation isused to account for the effects of relativistic kinematics.
