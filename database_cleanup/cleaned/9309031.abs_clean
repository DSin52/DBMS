Title: Star products and deformed oscillators

Comments: 15 pages

A star-product formalism describing deformations of the standard quantummechanical harmonic oscillator is introduced. A number of existing generalizedoscillators occur as particular choises of star-products between the elementsof the ordinary oscillator algebra. Star dynamics and coherent states areintroduced and studied.
