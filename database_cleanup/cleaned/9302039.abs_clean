We study the quantum $N=2$ super-$W_{3}$ algebra using the free fieldrealization, which is obtained from the supersymmetric Miura transformationassociated with the Lie superalgebra $A(2|1)$. We compute the full operatorproduct expansions of the algebra explicitly. It is found that the resultsagree with those obtained by the OPE method.
