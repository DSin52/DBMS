contribution to proceedings of the 3rd European Congress of MathematicsRecent scenarios of phenomenologically realistic string compactificationsinvolve the existence of gauge sectors localized on D-branes at singular pointsof Calabi-Yau threefolds. The spectrum and interactions in these gauge sectorsare determined by the local geometry of the singularity, and can be encoded inquiver diagrams. We discuss the physical models arising for the simplest caseof orbifold singularities, and generalize to non-orbifold singularities andorientifold singularities. Finally we show that relatively simple singularitieslead to gauge sectors surprisingly close to the standard model of elementaryparticles.
