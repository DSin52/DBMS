In this paper we exhibit a one-parameter family of new Taub-NUT instantonsparameterized by a half-line. The endpoint of the half-line will be thereducible Yang-Mills instanton corresponding to the Eguchi-Hanson-Gibbons L^2harmonic 2-form, while at an inner point we recover the Pope-Yuille instantonconstructed as a projection of the Levi-Civita connection onto the positivesu(2) subalgebra of the Lie algebra so(4).Our method imitates the Jackiw-Nohl-Rebbi construction originally designedfor flat R^4. That is we find a one-parameter family of harmonic functions onthe Taub-NUT space with a point singularity, rescale the metric and project theobtained Levi-Civita connection onto the other negative su(2) subalgebra ofso(4). Our solutions will possess the full U(2) symmetry, and thus provide moresolutions to the recently proposed U(2) symmetric ansatz of Kim and Yoon.
