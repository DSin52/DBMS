In this note we show how Dijkgraaf and Vafa's hypothesis relating the exactsuperpotential of an N=1 theory to a matrix model can be used to describe allthe massive vacua of the N=1*, or mass deformed N=4, theory including the Higgsvacuum. The matrix model computation of the superpotential for each massivevacuum independently yields a modular function of the associated effectivecoupling in that vacuum which agrees with previously derived results up to avacuum-independent additive constant. The results in the different massivevacua can be related by the action of SL(2,Z) on the N=4 coupling, thusproviding evidence for modular invariance of the underlying N=4 theory.
