Title: A Model of Quantum Electrodynamics with Higher Derivatives

Authors: D.Ts. Stoyanov

Comments: 20 pages, latex, no figures

A new version of application Pauli-Villars regularized Green functions in thequantum field theory using higher derivatives is proposed. In this version theregularizing mass $M$ is large but finite. Our approach is demonstrated anddiscussed on the example of QED. It is shown that in our case there are noultraviolet divergences and - on the example of the selfenergy spinor Feynmandiagram - no infrared ones.
