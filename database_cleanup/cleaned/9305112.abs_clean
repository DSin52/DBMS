Static spherically symmetric asymptotically flat charged black hole solutionsare constructed within the magnetic SU(3) sector of the 4-dimensional heteroticstring effective action. They possess non-abelian hair in addition to theCoulomb magnetic field and are qualitatively similar to the Einstein-Yang-Millscolored SU(3) black holes except for the extremal case. In the extremalitylimit the horizon shrinks and the resulting geometry around the origincoincides with that of an extremal abelian dilatonic black hole with magneticcharge. Non-abelian hair exibits then typical sphaleron structure.
