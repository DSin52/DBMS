Comments: 74pages (Lectures)

The following two loosely connected sets of topics are reviewed in theseimplications for internal symmetries and edge states such as those in thequantum Hall effect. 2) Quantisation on multiply connected spaces and atopological proof the spin-statistics theorem which avoids quantum field theoryand relativity. Under 1), after explaining the meaning of gauge invariance andthe theory of constraints, we discuss boundary conditions on gaugetransformations and the definition of internal symmetries in gauge fieldtheories. We then show how the edge states in the quantum Hall effect can bederived from the Chern-Simons action using the preceding ideas. Under 2), afterexplaining the significance of fibre bundles for quantum physics, we reviewquantisation on multiply connected spaces in detail, explaining alsomathematical ideas such as those of the universal covering space and thefundamental group. These ideas are then used to prove the aforementionedtopological spin-statistics theorem.e of the universal covering space and thefundamental group.
