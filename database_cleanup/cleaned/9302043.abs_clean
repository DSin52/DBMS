We reformulate the method recently proposed for constructing quasitriangularHopf algebras of the quantum-double type from the R-matrices obeying theYang-Baxter equations. Underlying algebraic structures of the method areelucidated and an illustration of its facilities is given. The latter producesan example of a new quasitriangular Hopf algebra. The corresponding universalR-matrix is presented as a formal power series.
