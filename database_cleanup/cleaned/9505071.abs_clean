The exchange operator formalism previously introduced for the Calogeroproblem is extended to the three-body Calogero-Marchioro-Wolfes one. In theabsence of oscillator potential, the Hamiltonian of the latter is interpretedas a free particle Hamiltonian, expressed in terms of generalized momenta. Inthe presence of oscillator potential, it is regarded as a free modified bosonHamiltonian. The modified boson operators are shown to belong to a$D_6$-extended Heisenberg algebra. A proof of complete integrability is alsoprovided.
