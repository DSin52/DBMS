We consider the even parity superLax operator for the supersymmetric KPhierarchy of the form $L~=~D^2 + \sum_{i=0}^\infty u_{i-2} D^{-i+1}$ and obtainthe two Hamiltonian structures following the standard method of Gelfand andDikii. We observe that the first Hamiltonian structure is local and linearwhereas the second Hamiltonian structure is non-local and nonlinear among thesuperfields appearing in the Lax operator. We discuss briefly on theirconnections with the super $w_{\infty}$ algebra.
