SystemsWe consider an extension of the (t-U) Hubbard model taking into account newinteractions between the numbers of up and down electrons. We confine ourselvesto a one-dimensional open chain with L sites (4^L states) and derive theeffective Hamiltonian in the strong repulsion (large U) regime. ThisHamiltonian acts on 3^L states. We show that the spectrum of the latterHamiltonian (not the degeneracies) coincides with the spectrum of theanisotropic Heisenberg chain (XXZ model) in the presence of a Z field (2^Lstates). The wave functions of the 3^L-state system are obtained explicitlyfrom those of the 2^L-state system, and the degeneracies can be understood interms of irreducible representations of U_q(\hat{sl(2)}).
