introduction and conclusionsWe present a cosmological model in 1+m+p dimensions, where in m-dimensionalspace there are uniformly distributed p-branes wrapping over the extrap-dimensions. We find that during cosmological evolution m-dimensional spaceexpands with the exact power-law corresponding to pressureless matter while theextra p-dimensions contract. Adding matter, we also obtain solutions having thesame property. We show that this might explain in a natural way why the extradimensions are small compared to the observed three spatial directions.
