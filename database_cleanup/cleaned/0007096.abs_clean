We consider the contribution of the B-field into the RR charge of a sphericalD2-brane. Extending a recent analysis of Taylor, we show that the boundary andbulk contributions do not cancel in general. Instead, they add up to an integeras observed by Stanciu. The general formula is applied to compute the RRcharges of spherical D-branes of the SU(2) WZW model at level k and it showsthat these RR charges are only defined modulo k+2. We support this claim bystudying bound state formation of D0-branes using boundary conformal fieldtheory.
