On a slice of AdS_5, despite having a dimensionful coupling, gauge theoriescan exhibit logarithmic dependence on scale. In this paper, we utilizedeconstruction to analyze the scaling behavior of the theory, both above andbelow the AdS curvature scale, and shed light on position-dependentregularizations of the theory. We comment on applications to geometries otherthan AdS.
