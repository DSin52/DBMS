Title: A Dynamical Approach to Gauge Fixing

Authors: F. Loran

We study gauge fixing in the generalized Gupta-Bleuler quantization. In thismethod physical states are defined to be simultaneous null eigenstates of a setof quantum invariants. We apply the method to a solvable model proposed byFriedberg, Lee, Pang and Ren and show that no Gribov-type copies appears byconstruction.
