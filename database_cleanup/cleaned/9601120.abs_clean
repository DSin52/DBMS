It has been suggested that quantum fluctuations of the gravitational fieldcould give rise in the lowest approximation to an effective noncommutativeversion of Kaluza-Klein theory which has as extra hidden structure anoncommutative geometry. It would seem however from the Standard Model, atleast as far as the weak interactions are concerned, that a double-sheetedstructure is the phenomenologically appropriate one at present acceleratorenergies. We examine here to what extent this latter structure can beconsidered as a singular limit of the former.
