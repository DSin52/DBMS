We study the representation theory of finite W-algebras. After introducingparabolic subalgebras to describe the structure of W-algebras, we define theVerma modules and give a conjecture for the Kac determinant. This allows us tofind the completely degenerate representations of the finite W-algebras. Toextract the irreducible representations we analyse the structure of singularand subsingular vectors, and find that for W-algebras, in general the maximalsubmodule of a Verma module is not generated by singular vectors only.Surprisingly, the role of the (sub)singular vectors can be encapsulated interms of a `dual' analogue of the Kazhdan-Lusztig theorem for simple Liealgebras. These involve dual relative Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. We supportour conjectures with some examples, and briefly discuss applications and thegeneralisation to infinite W-algebras.
