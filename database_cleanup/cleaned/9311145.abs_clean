Two possibile applications of the optimized expansion for the free energy ofthe quantum-mechanical anharmonic oscillator are discussed. The first method isfor the finite temperature effective potential; the second one, for theclassical effective potential. The results of both methods show a quickconvergence and agree well with the exact free energy in the whole range oftemperatures.
