We introduce normal coordinates on the infinite dimensional group $G$introduced by Connes and Kreimer in their analysis of the Hopf algebra ofrooted trees. We study the primitive elements of the algebra and show that theyare generated by a simple application of the inverse Poincar\'e lemma, given aclosed left invariant 1-form on $G$. For the special case of the ladderprimitives, we find a second description that relates them to the Hopf algebraof functionals on power series with the usual product. Either approach showsthat the ladder primitives are given by the Schur polynomials. The relevance ofthe lower central series of the dual Lie algebra in the process ofrenormalization is also discussed, leading to a natural concept of$k$-primitiveness, which is shown to be equivalent to the one already in theliterature.
