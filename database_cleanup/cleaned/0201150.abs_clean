Title: Casimir force between partially transparent plane mirrors

Authors: R. M. Cavalcanti

Comments: 6 pages, 2 figures, LaTeX. Contribution to the Proceedings of the

XXII Brazilian National Meeting on Particles and Fields (Sao Lourenco,October 22-26, 2001)We compute the Casimir energy of a real scalar field in the presence of apair of partially transparent plane mirrors, modeled by Dirac delta potentials.
