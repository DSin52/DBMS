The effective action of N=2 gauge multiplets in general includeshigher-dimension UV finite nonholomorphic corrections integrated with the fullN=2 superspace measure. By adding a hypermultiplet in the adjointrepresentation we study the effective action of N=4 SYM. The nonanomalous SU(4)R-symmetry of the classical N=4 theory must be also present in the on-shelleffective action, and therefore we expect to find similar nonholomorphic termsfor each of the scalars in the hypermultiplet. The N=2 path integralquantization formalism developed in projective superspace allows us to computethese hypermultiplet nonholomorphic terms directly in N=2 superspace. Thecorresponding gauge multiplet expression can be successfully compared with theresult inferred from a N=1 calculation in the abelian subsector.
