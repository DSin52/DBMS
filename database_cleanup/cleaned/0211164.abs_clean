The consistent form of the gauge anomaly is worked out at first order in$\theta$ for the noncommutative three-point function of the ordinary gaugefield of certain noncommutative chiral gauge theories defined by means of theSeiberg-Witten map. We obtain that for any compact simple Lie group the anomalycancellation condition of this three-point function reads $\traza \T^a \T^b\T^c = 0$, if one restricts the type of noncommutative counterterms that can beadded to the classical action to restore the gauge symmetry to those which arerenormalizable by power-counting. On the other hand, if the power-countingremormalizability paradigm is relinquished and one admits noncommutativecounterterms (of the gauge fields, its derivatives and $\theta$) which are notpower-counting renormalizable, then, the anomaly cancellation condition for thenoncommutative three-point function of the ordinary gauge field becomes the
