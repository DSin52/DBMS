We present a survey of the calibrated geometries arising in the study of thelocal singularity structure of supersymmetric fivebranes in M-theory. We payparticular attention to the geometries of 4-planes in eight dimensions, forwhich we present some new results as well as many details of the computations.We also analyse the possible generalised self-dualities which these geometriescan afford.
