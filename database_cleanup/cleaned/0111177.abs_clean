In this note we study aspects of the interplay between fluxbranes andp-branes. We describe how a fluxbrane can be physically realized as a limit ofa brane-antibrane configuration, in a manner similar to the way a uniformelectric field appears in between the plates of a capacitor. We also study theevolution of a fluxbrane after nucleation of p-branes. We find thatKaluza-Klein fluxbranes do relax by forming brane-antibrane pairs or sphericalbranes, but we also find that for fluxtubes with dilaton coupling in adifferent range, the field strength does not relax, instead it becomes strongerafter each nucleation bounce. We speculate on a possible runaway instability ofsuch fluxtubes an an eventual breakdown of their classical description.
