Title: Spatial Geometry and the Wu-Yang Ambiguity

Authors: Daniel Z. Freedman and Ramzi R. Khuri

Comments: Based on talks given by R. Khuri at PASCOS-94, Syracuse University,

May 1994 and at Gursey Memorial Conference I, Istanbul, June 1994, 7 pages,TeX (typo in first Author's name is corrected.)We display continuous families of SU(2) vector potentials $A_i^a(x)$ in 3space dimensions which generate the same magnetic field $B^{ai}(x)$ (with det$B\neq 0$). These Wu-Yang families are obtained from the Einstein equation$R_{ij}=-2G_{ij}$ derived recently via a local map of the gauge field systeminto a spatial geometry with $2$-tensor $G_{ij}=B^a{}_i B^a{}_j\det B$ andconnection $\Gamma_{jk}^i$ with torsion defined from gauge covariantderivatives of $B$.
