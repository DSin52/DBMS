The Sine-Gordon theory at $\frac{\beta^{2}}{8\pi} = \frac{2}{(2n+3)},\; n=1,2,3 \cdots $ has a higher spin generalization of the $N=2$ supersymmetry withthe central terms which arises from the affine quantum group $U_{q}( \hat{s\ell} (2))$. Observing that the algebraic determination of $S$ matrices $(\approx {\rm quantum~ integrability })$ requires the saturation of thegeneralized Bogomolny bound, we construct a variant of the Sine-Gordon theoryat this value of the coupling in the framework of $S$ matrix theory. Thespectrum consists of a doublet of fractionally charged solitons as well as thatof anti-solitons in addition to the ordinary breathers. The constructiondemonstrates the existence of the theory other than the one by the truncationto the breathers considered by Smirnov. The allowed values for the fractionalpart of the fermion number is also determined.  The central charge in themassless limit is found to be $c= 1$ from the TBA calculation for nondiagonal Smatrices.  The attendant $c=1$ conformal field theory is the gaussian modelwith ${\bf Z_{2}}$ graded chiral algebra at the radius parameter $r=\sqrt{2n+3}$. In the course of the calculation, we find $4n+2$ zero modes fromthe (anti-)soliton distributions.
