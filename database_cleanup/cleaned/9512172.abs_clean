The four-point Green's function of static QED, where a fermion and anantifermion are located at fixed space positions, is calculated in covariantgauges. The bound state spectrum does not display any abnormal statecorresponding to excitations of the relative time. The equation that wasestablished by Mugibayashi in this model and which has abnormal solutions doesnot coincide with the Bethe$-$Salpeter equation. Gauge transformation from theCoulomb gauge also confirms the absence of abnormal solutions in theBethe$-$Salpeter equation.
