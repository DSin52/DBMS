We study $2d$ QCD coupled to fermions in the adjoint representation of thegauge group $SU(N)$ at large $N$, and its relation to string theory. It isshown that the model undergoes a deconfinement transition at a finitetemperature (analogous to the Hagedorn transition in string theory), withcertain winding modes in the Euclidean time direction turning tachyonic at hightemperature. The theory is supersymmetric for a certain ratio of quark mass andgauge coupling. For other values of that ratio, supersymmetry is softly broken.The spectrum of bound states contains an infinite number of approximatelylinear Regge trajectories, approaching at large mass $M$, $\alpha^\primeM^2=\sum_i i l_i$ $(l_i\in{\bf Z_+})$. Thus, the theory exhibits anexponentially growing density of bosonic and fermionic states at high energy.We discuss these results in light of string expectations.
