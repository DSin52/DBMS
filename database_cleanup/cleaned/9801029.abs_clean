conference on Strings, Branes and Dualities, Cargese, France, 26 May - 14June 1997In this note we discuss the theory of super-threebranes in a spacetime ofsignature (10,2). Upon reduction, the threebrane provides us with the classicalrepresentations of the M-2-brane and the type IIB superstring. Many features ofthe original super (2+2)-brane theory are clarified. In particular, the (10,2)superspace and the spinors required to construct the brane action arediscussed.
