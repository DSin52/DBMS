An effective Hamiltonian for the study of the quantum Hall effect isproposed. This Hamiltonian, which includes a ``current-current" interaction hasthe form of a Hamiltonian for a conformal field theory in the large $N$ limit.An order parameter is constructed from which the Hamiltonian may be derived.This order parameter may be viewed as either a collective coordinate for asystem of $N$ charged particles in a strong magnetic field; or as a field ofspins associated with the cyclotron motion of these particles.
