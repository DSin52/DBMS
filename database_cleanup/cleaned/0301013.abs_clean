Title: Color Reflection Invariance and Monopole Condensation in QCD

Authors: Y. M. Cho

Comments: 13 pages,1 figure

The quantum instability of the Savvidy-Nielsen-Olesen (SNO) vacuum of theone-loop effective action of SU(2) QCD is due to the lack of gauge invariance.We prove that the gauge invariance, in particular the color reflectioninvariance, restores the stability of the SNO vacuum, and thus guarantees thestability of the magnetic condensation in QCD.
