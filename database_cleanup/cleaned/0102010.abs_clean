We propose a supersymmetric generalization of Cardy's equation for consistentN=1 superconformal boundary states. We solve this equation for thesuperconformal minimal models SM(p/p+2) with p odd, and thereby provide aclassification of the possible superconformal boundary conditions. In additionto the Neveu-Schwarz (NS) and Ramond (R) boundary states, there are NS~ states.The NS and NS~ boundary states are related by a Z_2 "spin-reversal"transformation. We treat the tricritical Ising model as an example, and in anappendix we discuss the (non-superconformal) case of the Ising model.
