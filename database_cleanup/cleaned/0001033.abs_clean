We study gravity in backgrounds that are smooth generalizations of theRandall-Sundrum model, with and without scalar fields. These generalizationsinclude three-branes in higher dimensional spaces which are not necessarilyAnti-de Sitter far from the branes, intersecting brane configurations andconfigurations involving negative tension branes. We show that under certainmild assumptions there is a universal equation for the gravitationalfluctuations. We study both the graviton ground state and the continuum ofKaluza-Klein modes and we find that the four-dimensional gravitational mode islocalized precisely when the effects of the continuum modes decouple atdistances larger than the fundamental Planck scale. The decoupling iscontingent only on the long-range behaviour of the metric from the brane and wefind a universal form for the corrections to Newton's Law. We also comment onthe possible contribution of resonant modes. Given this, we find generalclasses of metrics which maintain localized four-dimensional gravity. We findthat three-brane metrics in five dimensions can arise from a single scalarfield source, and we rederive the BPS type conditions without any a prioriassumptions regarding the form of the scalar potential. We also show that asingle scalar field cannot produce conformally-flat locally intersecting braneconfigurations or a p-brane in greater than (p+2)-dimensions.
