We discuss the relation among some disk amplitudes with non-trivial boundaryconditions in two-dimensional quantum gravity. They are obtained by thetwo-matrix model as well as the three-matirx model for the case of thetricritical Ising model. We examine them for simple spin configurations, andfind that a finite number of insertions of the different spin states cannot beobserved in the continumm limit. We also find a closed set of eightSchwinger-Dyson equations which determines the disk amplitudes in thethree-matrix model.
