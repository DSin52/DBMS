We show that $~N=1$~ {\it supersymmetric} Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (SKP)equations can be embedded into recently formulated $~N=1$~ self-dual {\itsupersymmetric} Yang-Mills theories after appropriate dimensional reduction andtruncation, which yield three-dimensional supersymmetric Chern-Simons theories.Based on this result, we also give conjectural \hbox{$N=2~$} SKP equations.Subsequently some exact solutions of these systems including fermionic fieldsare given.
