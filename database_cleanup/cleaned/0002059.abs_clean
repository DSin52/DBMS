Title: D-Dimensional Conformal $\sigma$-models and Topological Excitations

Comments: 11 pages, Latex-2e

The D-dimensional conformal nonlinear sigma-models (NSM) sre constructed. Itis shown that the NSM on spaces with $\pi_{D-1} = \mathbb {Z}$ have thetopological solutions of a "hedgehog" and "anti-hedgehog" types withlogarithmic energies. For spaces with $\pi_D \ne 0$ they have also thetopological excitations of instanton types with finite energies.
