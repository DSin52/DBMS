We give a unified view of the relation between the $SL(2)$ KdV, the mKdV, andthe Ur-KdV equations through the Fr\'{e}chet derivatives and their inverses.For this we introduce a new procedure of obtaining the Ur-KdV equation, wherewe require that it has no non-local operators. We extend this method to the$SL(3)$ KdV equation, i.e., Boussinesq(Bsq) equation and obtain the hamiltonianstructure of Ur-Bsq equationin a simple form. In particular, we explicitlyconstruct the hamiltonian operator of the Ur-Bsq system which defines thepoisson structure of the system, through the Fr\'{e}chet derivative and itsinverse.
