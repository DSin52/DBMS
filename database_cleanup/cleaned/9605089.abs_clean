We present a numerical classification of the spherically symmetric, staticsolutions to the Einstein--Yang--Mills equations with cosmological constant$\Lambda$. We find three qualitatively different classes of configurations,where the solutions in each class are characterized by the value of $\Lambda$and the number of nodes, $n$, of the Yang--Mills amplitude. For sufficientlysmall, positive values of the cosmological constant, $\Lambda < \Llow(n)$, thesolutions generalize the Bartnik--McKinnon solitons, which are now surroundedby a cosmological horizon and approach the deSitter geometry in the asymptoticregion. For a discrete set of values $\Lambda_{\rm reg}(n) > \Lambda_{\rmcrit}(n)$, the solutions are topologically $3$--spheres, the ground state$(n=1)$ being the Einstein Universe. In the intermediate region, that is for$\Llow(n) < \Lambda < \Lhig(n)$, there exists a discrete family of globalsolutions with horizon and ``finite size''.
