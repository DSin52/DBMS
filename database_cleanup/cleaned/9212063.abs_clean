A brief review of a self-contained genuinely three-dimensionalmonodromy-matrix based non-perturbative covariant path-integral approach to{\it polynomial invariants} of knots and links in the framework of(topological) quantum Chern-Simons field theory is given. An idea of``physical'' observables represented by an auxiliary topologicalquantum-mechanics model in an external gauge field is introduced substitutingrather a limited notion of the Wilson loop. Thus, the possibility of usingvarious generalizations of the Chern-Simons action (also higher-dimensionalones) as well as a purely functional language becomes open. The theory isquantized in the framework of the best suited in this case {\itantibracket-antifield} formalism of Batalin and Vilkovisky. Using the Stokestheorem and formal translational invariance of the path-integral measure a {\itmonodromy matrix} corresponding to an arbitrary pair of irreduciblerepresentations of an arbitrary semi-simple Lie group is derived.
