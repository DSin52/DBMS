We construct the Euclidean Hopf algebra $U_q(e^N)$ dual of$Fun(\rn_q^N\lcross SO_{q^{-1}}(N))$ by realizing it as a subalgebra of thedifferential algebra $\DFR$ on the quantum Euclidean space $\rn_q^N$; in fact,we extend our previous realization \cite{fio4} of $U_{q^{-1}}(so(N))$ within$\DFR$ through the introduction of q-derivatives as generators ofq-translations. The fundamental Hilbert space representations of $U_q(e^N)$turn out to be of highest weight type and rather simple `` lattice-regularized'' versions of the classical ones. The vectors of a basis of the singlet (i.e.zero-spin) irrep can be realized as normalizable functions on $\rn_q^N$, goingto distributions in the limit $q\rightarrow 1$.
