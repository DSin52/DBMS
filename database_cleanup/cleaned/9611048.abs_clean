It is shown how to construct many-particle quantum-mechanical spectra ofparticles obeying multispecies exclusion statistics, both in one and in twodimensions. These spectra are derived from the generalized exclusion principleand yield the same thermodynamic quantities as deduced from Haldane'smultiplicity formula.
