"hasimoto@newton.apphy.fukui-u.ac.jp" for requestIt is shown that the difficulties in formulating the quantum field theory ondiscrete spacetime appear already in classical dynamics of one degree offreedom on discrete time. The difference equation of motion which maintains aconserved quantity like energy has a very restricted form that is not probablyderived by the least action principle. On the other hand, the classicaldynamics is possible to be canonically formulated and quantized, if theequation is derived from an action. The difficulties come mainly from thisincompatibility of the conserved quantity and the action principle. Weformulate a quantum field theory canonically on discrete spacetime in the casewhere the field equation is derived from an action, though there may be noexactly conserved quantity. It may, however, be expected that a conservedquantity exists for a low "energy" region.
