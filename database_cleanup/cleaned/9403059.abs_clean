Title: The Stable Representation of the algebra of functions on the quantum

group $SU_{q}(2)$Authors: S.V.Kozyrev

An operation of a coproduct of representations of a bialgebra is defined. Thecoproduct operation for representations of the Hopf algebra of functions on thequantum group $SU_{q}(2)$ is investigated. A notion of a stable representation$\Pi$ is introdused. This means that the representation $\Pi$ is invariantunder coproduct by arbitrary representation. Algebra of functions on thequantum group $SU_{q}(2)$ in the representation $\Pi$ is a factor of a typeII$_{\infty}$. Formula for the trace in the representation $\Pi$ is given . Theinvariant integral of Woronovich on $SU_{q}(2)$ will take the form $\int f d\mu= tr(f cc^{*})$.
