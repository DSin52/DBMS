The Lax pair formulation of the two dimensional induced gravity in thelight-cone gauge is extended to the more general $w_N$ theories. Afterpresenting the $w_2$ and $w_3$ gravities, we give a general prescription for anarbitrary $w_N$ case. This is further illustrated with the $w_4$ gravity topoint out some peculiarities. The constraints and the possible presence of thecosmological constants are systematically exhibited in the zero-curvaturecondition, which also yields the relevant Ward identities. The restrictions onthe gauge parameters in presence of the constraints are also pointed out andare contrasted with those of the ordinary 2d-gravity.
