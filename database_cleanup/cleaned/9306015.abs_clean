26th Workshop, ``From Superstrings to Supergravity'', Erice, Italy, December5-12 1992 and SUSY 93 Conference, Boston, MA, March 29-April 2, 1993) 12pages + 4 figs available upon request, UPR-566-TRecent developments in unifying treatment of domain wall configurations andtheir global space-time structure is presented. Domain walls between vacua ofnon-equal cosmological constant fall in three classes depending on the value ofplanar, static walls corresponding to the supersymmetric configurations, (ii)non-extreme walls with $\sigma>\sigma_{ext}$ are expanding bubbles with twoinsides, (iii) ultra-extreme walls with $\sigma<\sigma_{ext}$ are bubbles offalse vacuum decay. As a prototype exhibiting all three types of configurationsvacuum walls between Minkowski and anti-deSitter vacua are discussed.Space-times associated with these walls exhibit non-trivial causal structureclosely related to the one of the corresponding extreme and non-extreme chargedblack holes, however, without singularities. Recently discovered extremedilatonic walls, pertinent to string theory, are also addressed. They arestatic, planar domain walls with metric in the string frame being {\it flat}everywhere. Intriguing similarities between the global space-time of dilatonicwalls and that of charged dilatonic black holes are pointed out.
