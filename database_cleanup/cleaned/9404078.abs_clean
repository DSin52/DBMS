Ordinary QED formulated in the Feynman's space-time picture is equivalent toa one dimensional field theory. In the large N limit there is no phasetransition in such a theory. In this letter, we show a phase transition doesexist in a generalization of QED characterized by the addition of the curvatureof the world line (rigidity) to the Feynman's space-time action. The largedistance scale of the disordered phase essentially coincides with ordinary QED,while the ordered phase is strongly coupled. Although rigid QED exhibits thetypical pathologies of higher derivative theories at the classical level, weshow that both phases of the quantum theory are free of ghosts and tachyons.Quantum fluctuations prevent taking the naive classical limit and inherting theproblems of the classical theory.
