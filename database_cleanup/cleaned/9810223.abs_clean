Title: On Renormalization Group Flows and Exactly Marginal Operators in Three

DimensionsAuthors: Matthew J. Strassler

As in two and four dimensions, supersymmetric conformal field theories inthree dimensions can have exactly marginal operators. These are illustrated ina number of examples with N=4 and N=2 supersymmetry. The N=2 theory of threechiral multiplets X,Y,Z and superpotential W=XYZ has an exactly marginaloperator; N=2 U(1) with one electron, which is mirror to this theory, has onealso. Many N=4 fixed points with superpotentials W \sim Phi Q_i \tilde Q^i haveexactly marginal deformations consisting of a combination of Phi^2 and (Q_i\tilde Q^i)^2. However, N=4 U(1) with one electron does not; in fact theoperator Phi^2 is marginally irrelevant. The situation in non-abelian theoriesis similar. The relation of the marginal operators to brane rotations isbriefly discussed; this is particularly simple for self-dual examples where theprecise form of the marginal operator may be guessed using mirror symmetry.
