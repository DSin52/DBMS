A renormalization scheme is suggested where QCD input parameters - quark massand coupling constant - are expressed in terms of gauge invariant and infraredstable quantities. For the renormalization of coupling constant the quarkanomalous electromagnetic moment is used; the latter is calculated in a twoloop approximation. Examination of the renormalized S matrix indicatedconfinement phenomenon already in the framework of perturbation theory.
