We consider 1+1-dimensional QCD coupled to Majorana fermions in the adjointrepresentation of the gauge group $SU(N)$. Pair creation of partons (fermionquanta) is not suppressed in the large-$N$ limit, where the glueball-like boundstates become free. In this limit the spectrum is given by a linear \lc\ Schr\"odinger equation, which we study numerically using the discretized \lcq. Wefind a discrete spectrum of bound states, with the logarithm of the leveldensity growing approximately linearly with the mass. The wave function of atypical excited state is a complicated mixture of components with differentparton numbers. A few low-lying states, however, are surprisingly close tobeing eigenstates of the parton number, and their masses can be accuratelycalculated by truncated diagonalizations.
