In the context of a two-dimensional exactly solvable model, the dynamics ofquantum black holes is obtained by analytically continuing the description ofthe regime where no black hole is formed. The resulting spectrum of outgoingradiation departs from the one predicted by the Hawking model in the regionwhere the outgoing modes arise from the horizon with Planck-order frequencies.This occurs early in the evaporation process, and the resulting physicalpicture is unconventional. The theory predicts that black holes will onlyradiate out an energy of Planck mass order, stabilizing after a transitoryperiod. The continuation from a regime without black hole formationapproach and suggests in this way a possible solution to the problem ofinformation loss.
