We carry out the Hamiltonian analysis of non-Abelian gauge theories in (2+1)dimensions in a gauge-invariant matrix parametrization of the fields. Adetailed discussion of regularization issues and the construction of therenormalized Laplace operator on the configuration space, which is proportionalto the kinetic energy, are given. The origin of the mass gap is analyzed andthe lowest eigenstates of the kinetic energy are explicitly obtained; thesehave zero charge and exhibit a mass gap . The nature of the corrections due tothe potential energy, the possibility of an improved perturbation theory and aSchrodinger-like equation for the states are also discussed.
