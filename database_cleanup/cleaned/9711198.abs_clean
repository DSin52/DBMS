A variational calculation is presented of the ADM-energy of the quantizedgravitational field around a wormhole solution of the classical Einstein'sequations. One finds the energy of such state to be in general lower than theperturbative ground state, in which the quantized gravity field fluctuatesaround flat (Euclidean) space-time. As a result the strong indication emergesthat a gas (or a lattice) of wormholes of Planck mass and average distance$l_p$, the Planck length, may be a good approximation of the Ground State ofQuantum Gravity, some implications of which are reviewed.
