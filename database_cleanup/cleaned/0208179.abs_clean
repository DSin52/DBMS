The three string vertex for Type IIB superstrings in a maximallysupersymmetric plane-wave background is investigated. Specifically, we derive afactorization theorem for the Neumann coefficients that generalizes aflat-space result that was obtained some 20 years ago. The resulting formula isused to explore the leading large mu asymptotic behavior, which is relevant forcomparison with dual gauge theory results.
