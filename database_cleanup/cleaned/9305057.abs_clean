We consider the relationship between the conjectured uniqueness of theMoonshine Module, ${\cal V}^\natural$, and Monstrous Moonshine, the genus zeroproperty of the modular invariance group for each Monster group Thompsonseries. We first discuss a family of possible $Z_n$ meromorphic orbifoldconstructions of ${\cal V}^\natural$ based on automorphisms of the Leechlattice compactified bosonic string. We reproduce the Thompson series for all51 non-Fricke classes of the Monster group $M$ together with a new relationshipbetween the centralisers of these classes and 51 corresponding Conway groupcentralisers (generalising a well-known relationship for 5 such classes).Assuming that ${\cal V}^\natural$ is unique, we then consider meromorphicorbifoldings of ${\cal V}^\natural$ and show that Monstrous Moonshine holds ifand only if the only meromorphic orbifoldings of ${\cal V}^\natural$ give${\cal V}^\natural$ itself or the Leech theory. This constraint on themeromorphic orbifoldings of ${\cal V}^\natural$ therefore relates MonstrousMoonshine to the uniqueness of ${\cal V}^\natural$ in a new way.
