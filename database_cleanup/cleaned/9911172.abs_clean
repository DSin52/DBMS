We explicitly show the area law behavior of a circular Wilson loop inconfining theories from supergravity. We calculate the correlator of two Wilsonloops from supergravity in confining backgrounds. We find that it is dominatedby an exchange of a ``scalarball'' that is lighter than the glueballs. Weinterpret these results in terms of the meson-meson potential in such theories.
