of the Modified Sine-Gordon ModelAuthors: Sergei V. Pokrovsky

Comments: 31 pages Standard LaTex

A quantum group analysis is applied to the Sine-Gordon model (or may be itsversion) in a strong-coupling regime. Infinitely many bound states are foundtogether with the corresponding S-matrices. These new solutions of theYang-Baxter eqations are related to some reducible representations of thequantum $sl(2)$ algebra resembling the Kac-Moody algebra representations in theWess-Zumino-Witten-Novikov conformal field theory.
