In the search for the exact minimum of the tachyon potential in the Witten'scubic string field theory we try to learn as much as possible from the stringfield theory in the large B-field background. We offer a simple alternativeproof of the Witten's factorization, carry out the analysis of string fieldequations also for the noncommutative torus and find some novel relations tothe algebraic K-theory. We note an intriguing relation between Chern-Simons andChern classes of two noncommutative bundles. Finally we observe a certainpattern which enables us to make a plausible conjecture about the exact form ofthe minimum.
