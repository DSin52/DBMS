Title: Scalar fluctuations in dilatonic brane-worlds

Authors: V. Bozza, M. Gasperini, G. Veneziano

Comments: 10 pages. Talk presented by V. Bozza at COSMO-01 conference,

Rovaniemi, 2001We derive and solve the full set of scalar perturbation equations for a classof five-dimensional brane--world solutions, with a dilaton scalar field coupledto the bulk cosmological constant and to a 3-brane. The spectrum contains onelocalized massless scalar mode, to be interpreted as an effective dilaton onthe brane, inducing long--range scalar interactions. Two massive scalar modesyield corrections to Newton's law at short distances, which persist even in thelimit of vanishing dilaton (namely, in the standard Randall--Sundrumconfiguration).
