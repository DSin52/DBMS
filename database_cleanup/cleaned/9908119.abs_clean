The freedom one has in constructing locally gauge invariant charged fields ingauge theories is analyzed in full detail and exploited to construct, in QED,an electron field whose two-point function W(p), up to the fourth order in thecoupling constant, is normalized with on-shell normalization conditions and is,nonetheless, infra-red finite; as a consequence the radiative correctionsvanish on the mass shell $p^2=\mu^2$ and the free field singularity isdominant, although, in contrast to quantum field theories with mass gap, theeigenvalue $\mu^2$ of the mass operator is not isolated. The same construction,carried out for the quark in QCD, is not sufficient for cancellation ofinfra-red divergences to take place in the fourth order. The latterdivergences, however, satisfy a simple factorization equation. We speculate onthe scenario that could be drawn about infra-red asymptotic dynamics of QCD,should this factorization equation be true in any order of perturbation theory.
