In this note we explore the stringy interpretation of non-perturbativeeffects in N=1^* deformations of the A_{k-1} quiver models. For certain typesof deformations we argue that the massive vacua are described by Nk fractionalD3-branes at the orbifold polarizing into k concentric 5-brane spheres eachcarrying fractional brane charge. The polarization of the D3-branes induces apolarization of D-instantons into string world-sheets wrapped on the Myersspheres. We show that the superpotentials in these models are indeed generatedby these world-sheet instantons. We point out that for certain parameter valuesthe condensates yield the exact superpotential for a relevant deformation ofthe Klebanov-Witten conifold theory.
