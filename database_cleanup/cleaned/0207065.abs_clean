CosmologyAuthors: Soumitra SenGupta, Saurabh Sur

Comments: 8 pages, latex, 4 figures, version thoroughly revised

Existence of Bigbang singularity is considered to be the most seriousdrawback in the standard FRW cosmology. Furthermore, to explain theaccelerating phase of the Universe (recently detected experimentally) in such amodel one needs to include a non-vanishing cosmological constant by hand. Inthis note we show that a string originated torsion in the background spacetimeprovides natural solutions to both these problems. The Universe evolving in atorsioned spacetime is not only free of Bigbang singularity but also exhibitsacceleration during it's evolution. The role of dilaton in this context isbriefly discussed.
