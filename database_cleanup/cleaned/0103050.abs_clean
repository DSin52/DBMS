Title: Divergencies in the Casimir energy for a medium with realistic

ultraviolet behaviorAuthors: H. Falomir, K. Kirsten and K. R\'ebora

Comments: article style, 10 pages

We consider a dielectric medium with an ultraviolet behavior as it followsfrom the Drude model. Compared with dilute models, this has the advantage that,for large frequencies, two different media behave the same way. As a result oneexpects the Casimir energy to contain less divergencies than for the dilutemedia approximation. We show that the Casimir energy of a spherical dielectricball contains just one divergent term, a volume one, which can be renormalizedby introducing a contact term analogous to the volume energy counterterm neededin bag models.
