Title: Energy-Charge Dependence for Q-Balls

Authors: T.A. Ioannidou, V.B. Kopeliovich and N.D. Vlachos

Comments: 11 pages + 3 figures

We show that many numerically established properties of Q-balls can beunderstood in terms of analytic approximations for a certain type of potential.In particular, we derive an explicit formula between the energy and the chargeof the Q-ball valid for a wide range of the charge Q.
