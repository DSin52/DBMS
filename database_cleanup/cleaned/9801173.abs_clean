We present a systematic study of N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories which arein the Coulomb phase. We show how to find all such theories based on a simplegauge group and no tree-level superpotential. We find the low-energy solutionfor the new theories in terms of a hyperelliptic Seiberg-Witten curve. Thiswork completes the study of all N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories where theDynkin index of the matter fields equals the index of the adjoint (mu=G), andconsequently all theories for which mu<G.
