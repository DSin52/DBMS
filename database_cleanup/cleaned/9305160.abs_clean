Affine Toda theories with imaginary couplings associate with any simple Liealgebra ${\bf g}$ generalisations of Sine Gordon theory which are likewiseintegrable and possess soliton solutions. The solitons are \lq\lq created" byexponentials of quantities $\hat F^i(z)$ which lie in the untwisted affineKac-Moody algebra ${\bf\hat g}$ and ad-diagonalise the principal Heisenbergsubalgebra. When ${\bf g}$ is simply-laced and highest weight irreduciblerepresentations at level one are considered, $\hat F^i(z)$ can be expressed asa vertex operator whose square vanishes. This nilpotency property is extendedto all highest weight representations of all affine untwisted Kac-Moodyalgebras in the sense that the highest non vanishing power becomes proportionalto the level. As a consequence, the exponential series mentioned terminates andthe soliton solutions have a relatively simple algebraic expression whoseproperties can be studied in a general way. This means that various physicalproperties of the soliton solutions can be directly related to the algebraicstructure. For example, a classical version of Dorey's fusing rule follows fromthe operator product expansion of two $\hat F$'s, at least when ${\bf g}$ issimply laced. This adds to the list of resemblances of the solitons withrespect to the particles which are the quantum excitations of the fields.
