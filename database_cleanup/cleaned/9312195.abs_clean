Title: Solutions of quantum Yang-Baxter equation related to $U_q (gl(2))$

algebra and associated integrable lattice modelsComments: 17 pages

A coloured braid group representation (CBGR) is constructed with the help ofsome modified universal ${\cal R}$-matrix, associated to $U_q(gl(2))$ quantisedalgebra. Explicit realisation of Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan (FRT) algebra isbuilt up for this CBGR and new solutions of quantum Yang-Baxter equation aresubsequently found through Yang-Baxterisation of FRT algebra. These solutionsare interestingly related to nonadditive type quantum $R$-matrix and have anontrivial $q\rightarrow 1$ limit. Lax operators of several concrete integrablemodels, which may be considered as some `coloured' extensions of latticenonlinear Schr${\ddot {\rm o}}$dinger model and Toda chain, are finallyobtained by taking different reductions of such solutions.
