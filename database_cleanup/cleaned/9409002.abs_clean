We present a method for extracting effective Lagrangians from QCD. Theresulting effective Lagrangians are based on exact rewrites of cut-off QCD interms of these new collective field degrees of freedom. These cut-offLagrangians are thus ``effective'' in the sense that they explicitly containsome of the physical long-distance degrees of freedom from the outset. As anexample we discuss the introduction of a new collective field carrying thequantum numbers of the $\eta'$-meson. (Contribution presented by R.
