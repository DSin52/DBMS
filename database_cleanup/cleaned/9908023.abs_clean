We show how to construct chiral tachyon-free perturbative orientifold models,where supersymmetry is broken at the string scale on a collection of braneswhile, to lowest order, the bulk and the other branes are supersymmetric. Inhigher orders, supersymmetry breaking is mediated to the remaining sectors, butis suppressed by the size of the transverse space or by the distance from thebrane where supersymmetry breaking primarily occurred. This setting is ofinterest for orbifold models with discrete torsion, and is of direct relevancefor low-scale string models. It can guarantee the stability of the gaugehierarchy against gravitational radiative corrections, allowing an almost exactsupergravity a millimeter away from a non-supersymmetric world.
