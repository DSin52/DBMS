We discuss the relation between singletons in AdS_3 and logarithmic operatorsin the CFT on the boundary. In 2 dimensions there can be more logarithmicoperators apart from those which correspond to singletons in AdS, becauselogarithmic operators can occur when the dimensions of primary fields differ byan integer instead of being equal. These operators may be needed to account forthe greybody factor for gauge bosons in the bulk.
