A thorough analysis is presented of the class of central fields of force thatdimensional regularization, the two-dimensional delta-function potential andthe $D$-dimensional inverse square potential are studied. In particular, theboundary condition at the origin, the relationship between the bound-state andscattering sectors, and the similarities displayed by both potentials. It isfound that, for rotationally symmetric scale-invariant potentials, there is astrong-coupling regime, for which quantum-mechanical breaking of symmetry takesplace, with the appearance of a unique bound state as well as of a logarithmicenergy dependence of the scattering with respect to the energy.
