Title: Supersymmetric domain wall x G/H solutions of IIB supergravity

Authors: L. Castellani and L. Sommovigo

Comments: 8 pages, latex

1-brane nonmaximally supersymmetric solutions of D=10 chiral supergravity arediscussed. In the dual frame, their near brane geometry is the product of a3-dimensional domain wall spacetime and a 7-dimensional homogeneous Einsteinspace G/H.
