We show that all solutions to the vacuum Einstein field equations may bemapped to instanton configurations of the Ashtekar variables. These solutionsare characterized by properties of the moduli space of the instantons. Weexhibit explicit forms of these configurations for several well-knownsolutions, and indicate a systematic way to get new ones. Some interestingexamples of these new solutions are described.
