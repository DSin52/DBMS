Title: A Note on Non-Locality and Ostrogradski's Construction

Authors: K. Bering (IFT)

Comments: 11 pages, LaTeX

We consider the Hamiltonian treatment of non-local theories andOstrogradski's formalism. This has recently also been discussed by Woodard(hep-th/0006207) and by Gomis, Kamimura and Llosa (hep-th/0006235). In ourapproach we recast the second class constraints into first class constraintsand invoke the boundary Poisson bracket.
