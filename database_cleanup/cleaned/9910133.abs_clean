Nonlinear gauge theory is a gauge theory based on a nonlinear Lie algebra(finite W algebra) or a Poisson algebra, which yields a canonical star productfor deformation quantization as a correlator on a disk. We pursue nontrivialdeformation of topological gauge theory with conjugate scalars in twodimensions. This leads to two-dimensional nonlinear gauge theory exclusively,which implies its essential uniqueness. We also consider a possible extensionto higher dimensions.
