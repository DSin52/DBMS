Pure (2+1)-dimensional Einstein gravity is analysed in the Ashtekarformulation, when the spatial manifold is a torus. We have found a set ofglobally defined observables, forming a closed algebra. This allowed us tosolve the quantum constraints, and to show that the reduced phase space of theAshtekar formulation is greater then the corresponding space of the Wittenformulation. Furthermore, we have found a globally defined time variable whichsatisfies all the requiriments of an extrinsic time variable in quantumgravity.
