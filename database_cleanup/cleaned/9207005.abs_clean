The tensionless limit of the free bosonic string is space-time conformallysymmetric classically. Requiring invariance of the quantum theory in the lightcone gauge tests the reparametrization symmetry needed to fix this gauge. Thefull conformal symmetry gives stronger constraints than the Poincar\'esubalgebra. We find that the symmetry may be preserved in any space-timedimension, but only if the spectrum is drastically reduced (part of thisreduction is natural in a zero tension limit of the ordinary string spectrum).The quantum states are required to be symmetric ({\it i.e.} singlets) underspace-time diffeomorphisms, except for the centre of mass wave function.
