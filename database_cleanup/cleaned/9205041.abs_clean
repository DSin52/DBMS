We consider Calabi-Yau compactifications with one K\"ahler modulus. Followingthe method of Candelas et al. we use the mirror hypothesis to solve the quantumtheory exactly in dependence of this modulus by performing the calculation forthe corresponding complex structure deformation on the mirror manifold. Herethe information is accessible by techniques of classical geometry. It isencoded in the Picard-Fuchs differential equation which has to be supplementedby requirements on the global properties of its solutions.
