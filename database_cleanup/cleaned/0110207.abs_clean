Title: Heterotic string theory interrelations

Authors: Oleg V. Kechkin

Comments: 9 pages in LATEX

We establish a symmetry map which relates two low-energy heterotic stringtheories with different numbers of the Abelian gauge fields compactified fromthe diverse to three dimensions on a torus. We discuss two applications of thefrom the stationary Einstein-Maxwell fields and one non-trivial submersion ofthe heterotic string theory into the bosonic one.
