We reconsider the algebraic BRS renormalization of Witten's topologicalYang-Mills field theory by making use of a vector supersymmetry Ward identitywhich improves the finiteness properties of the model. The vectorsupersymmetric structure is a common feature of several topological theories.The most general local counterterm is determined and is shown to be a trivialBRS-coboundary.
