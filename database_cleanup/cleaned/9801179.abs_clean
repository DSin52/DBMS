Title: "Hodge strings" and elements of K.Saito's theory of the Primitive form

Comments: LaTeX, 32pp

The "Hodge strings" construction of solutions to associativity equations isproposed. From the topological string theory point of view this constructionformalizes the "integration over the position of the marked point" procedurefor computation of amplitudes. From the mathematical point of view the "Hodgestrings" construction is just a composition of elements of harmonic theory(known among physicists as a $t$-part of $t-t^*$ equations) and the K.Saitoconstruction of flat coordinates (starting from flat connection with a spectralparameter).We also show how elements of K.Saito theory of primitive form appearnaturally in the "Landau-Ginzburg" version of harmonic theory if we considerthe holomorphic pieces of germs of harmonic forms at the singularity.
