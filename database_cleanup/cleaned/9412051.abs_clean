in Wendisch-Rietz, Aug. 30 - Sep. 4, 1994, ed. D. Luest and G. WeigtThe renormalization group flow in two--dimensional field theories is modifiedif they are coupled to gravity. Beta function coefficients are changed, the$c$--theorem is no longer strictly valid, and flows from fixed points withcentral charge $c>25$ to fixed points with $c<25$ are forbidden. This isdiscussed in general and at two examples, the Kosterlitz--Thouless phasetransition and the Wess--Zumino--Witten model. A possible application to stringcosmology is pointed out.
