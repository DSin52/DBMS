Cubic interactions are considered in 3 and 7 space dimensions, respectively,for bosonic membranes in Poisson Bracket form. Their symmetries and vacuumconfigurations are discussed. Their associated first order equations aretransformed to Nahm's equations, and are hence seen to be integrable, for the3-dimensional case, by virtue of the explicit Lax pair provided. Theconstructions introduced also apply to commutator or Moyal Bracket analogues.
