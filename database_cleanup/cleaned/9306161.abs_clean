We discuss the functional Schroedinger picture for fermions in externalfields for both stationary and time-dependent problems. We give formal resultsfor the ground state and the solution of the time-dependent Schroedingerequation for QED in arbitrary dimensions, while more explicit results areobtained in two dimensions. For both the massless and massive Schwinger modelwe give an explicit expression for the ground state functional as well as forthe expectation values of energy, electric and axial charge. We also give thecorresponding results for non-abelian fields. We solve the functionalSchroedinger equation for a constant external field in four dimensions andobtain the amount of particle creation. We solve the Schroedinger equation forarbitrary external fields for massless QED in two dimensions and make a carefuldiscussionof the anomalous particle creation rate. Finally, we discuss somesubtleties connected with the interpretation of the quantized Gauss constraint.
