We show that the noncommutative Wess-Zumino (NCWZ) Lagrangian withpermutation terms in the interaction parts is renormalizable at one-loop levelby only a wave function renormalization. When the non-commutativity vanishes,the logarithmic divergence of the wave function renormalization of the NCWZtheory is the same as that of the commutative one. Next the algebras ofnoncommutative field theories (NCFT's) are studied. From Neother currents, thefield representation for the generators of NCFT's is extracted. Then based onthis representation, the commutation relations between the generators arecalculated for NCFT's. The symmetry properties of NCFT's inferred from thesecommutation relations are discussed and compared with those of the commutativeones.
