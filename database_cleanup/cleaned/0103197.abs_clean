We study the $c=-2$ model of logarithmic conformal field theory in thepresence of a boundary using symplectic fermions. We find boundary states withconsistent modular properties. A peculiar feature of this model is that thevacuum representation corresponding to the identity operator is asub-representation of a ``reducible but indecomposable'' larger representation.This leads to unusual properties, such as the failure of the Verlinde formula.Despite such complexities in the structure of modules, our results suggest thatlogarithmic conformal field theories admit bona fide boundary states.
