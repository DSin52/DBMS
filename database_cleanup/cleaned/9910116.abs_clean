The N=4 gauged SU(2)$\times$SU(1,1) supergravity in four-dimensionalEuclidean space is obtained via a consistent dimensional reduction of the N=1,D=10 supergravity on $S^3\times AdS_3$. The dilaton potential in the theory isproportional to the difference of the two gauge coupling constants, which isdue to the opposite signs of the curvatures of $S^3$ and $AdS_3$. As a result,the potential can be positive, negative, or zero-depending on the values of theconstants. A consistent reduction of the fermion supersymmetry transformationsis performed at the linearized level, and special attention is paid to theEuclidean Majorana condition. A further reduction of the D=4 theory isconsidered to the static, purely magnetic sector, where the vacuum solutionsare studied. The Bogomol'nyi equations are derived and their essentiallynon-Abelian monopole-type and sphaleron-type solutions are presented. Anysolution in the theory can be uplifted to become a vacuum of string orM-theory.
