Recently a new supersymmetric extension of the KdV hierarchy has appeared ina matrix-model-inspired approach to $2{-}d$ quantum supergravity. Here we provethat this hierarchy is essentially the KdV hierarchy, where the KdV field isnow replaced by an even superfield. This allows us to find the conservedcharges and the bihamiltonian structure, and to prove its integrability. Wealso extend the hierarchy by odd flows in a supersymmetric fashion.
