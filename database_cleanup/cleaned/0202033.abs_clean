discussions rewritten to clarify several aspects of the work; scale factorintroduced and consequently most of equations ammended; equations added,(2.29) effective potential, (2.32) units of several constants, (2.33)physical magnetic field, (4.7) assymptotic value of metric determinant,(4.10) physical monopole charge; References, acknowledgements and grantnumber addedIt is built a map between the Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT) 3Dcompact U(1) gauge Maxwell Chern-Simons and the nonrelativistic quantummechanics Azbel-Hofstadter model of Bloch-electrons. The $U_q(sl_2)$ quantumgroup and the magnetic translations group of the Azbel-Hofstadter modelcorrespond to discretized U(1) gauge transformations, they correspond tosubgroups with linear gauge parameter. The monopole confining and monopolecondensate phases in the TQFT are identified with the extended (energy bands)and localized (gaps) phases of the bloch electron. The monopole condensateinduces at the nonrelativistic level gravitational white holes due to deformedclassical gauge fields, furthermore these gravitational solutions render theexistence of finite energy pure magnetic monopoles possible. This mechanismconstitutes a dynamical symmetry breaking of the theory which regularizes thesolutions on those localized phases allowing physical solutions of theShr\"odinger equation which are chains of electron strings connecting severalmonopole-white holes. An experiment to test these results is suggested whichwould test the existence of magnetic monopoles and classical gravity to a scaleof $\sim 10^{-17}$ \textit{meters}, the dimension of the monopole-white hole.
