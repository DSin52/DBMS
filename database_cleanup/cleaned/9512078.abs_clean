We consider type IIA compactification on $K3$. We show that the instantonsubsectors of the worldvolume of $N$ 4-branes wrapped around $K3$ lead to aHagedorn density of BPS states in accord with heterotic-type IIA duality in 6dimensions. We also find evidence that the correct framework to understand theresults of Nakajima on the appearance of affine Kac-Moody algebras on thecohomology of moduli space of instantons on ALE spaces is in the context ofheterotic-type IIA string duality.
