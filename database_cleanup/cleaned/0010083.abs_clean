We construct and discuss solutions of SO(1,2) x SO(1,2) Chern-Simons theorywhich correspond to multiple BTZ black holes. These solutions typically haveadditional singularities, the simplest cases being special conicalsingularities with a 2 pi surplus angle. There are solutions with singularitiesinside a common outer horizon, and other solutions with naked conicalsingularities. Previously such singularities have been ruled out on physicalgrounds, because they do not obey the geodesic equation. We find however thatthe Chern-Simons gauge symmetry may be used to locate all such singularities tothe horizons, where they necessarily follow geodesics. We are therefore led toconclude that these singular solutions correspond to physically sensiblegeometries.Boundary charges at infinity are only sensitive to the total mass and spin ofthe black holes, and not to the distribution among the black holes. Wetherefore argue that a holographic description in terms of a boundary conformalfield theory should represent both single and multiple BTZ solutions with thesame asymptotic charges. Then sectors with multiple black holes wouldcontribute to the black hole entropy calculated from a boundary CFT.
