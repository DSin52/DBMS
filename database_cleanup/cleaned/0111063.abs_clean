In a generalized Heisenberg/Schroedinger picture we use an invariantspace-time transformation to describe the motion of a relativistic particle. Wediscuss the relation with the relativistic mechanics and find that thepropagation of the particle may be defined as space-time transition betweenstates with equal eigenvalues of the first and second Casimir operators of theLorentz algebra. In addition we use a vector on the light-cone. A massiverelativistic particle with spin 0 is considered. We also consider thenonrelativistic limit.
