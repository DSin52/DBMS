We give simple representations for quantum theories in which the positioncommutators are non vanishing constants. A particular representation reproducesresults found using the Moyal star product. The notion of exact localizationbeing meaningless in these theories, we adapt the notion of ``maximallylocalized states'' developed in another context . We find that gaussianfunctions play this role in a 2+1 dimensional model in which the noncommutation relations concern positions only. An interpretation of the wavefunction in this non commutative geometry is suggested. We also analyze higherdimensional cases. A possible incidence on the causality issue for a Q.F.T witha non commuting time is sketched.
