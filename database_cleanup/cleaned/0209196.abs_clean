The problem of confinement of fermions in 1+1 dimensions is approached with alinear potential in the Dirac equation by considering a mixing of Lorentzvector and scalar couplings. Analytical bound-states solutions are obtainedwhen the scalar coupling is of sufficient intensity compared to the vectorcoupling.
