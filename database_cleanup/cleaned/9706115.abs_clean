Inclusive absorption cross section of fundamental IIB string to D-string iscalculated perturbatively. The leading order result agrees with estimate basedon stringy Higgs mechanism via Cremmer-Scherk coupling. It is argued that thesubleading order correction is dominated by purely planar diagrams in the largemass limit. The correction represents conversion of binding energy into localrecoil process of the fundamental string and D-string bound state. We showtheir presence explicitly in the next leading order.
