For quantum field theories that flow between ultraviolet and infrared fixedpoints, central functions, defined from two-point correlators of the stresstensor and conserved currents, interpolate between central charges of the UVand IR critical theories. We develop techniques that allow one to calculate theflows of the central charges and that of the Euler trace anomaly coefficient ina general N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory. Exact, explicit formulas for$SU(N_c)$ gauge theories in the conformal window are given and analysed. TheEuler anomaly coefficient always satisfies the inequality $% a_{UV}-a_{IR}>0$.This is new evidence in strongly coupled theories that this quantity satisfiesa four-dimensional analogue of the $c$-theorem, supporting the idea ofirreversibility of the RG flow. Various other implications are discussed.
