Grossman Meeting, Rome July 2-8, 2000We discuss the interplay between IR and UV divergences in vacuumconfigurations with open and unoriented strings. We establish a generalone-to-one correspondence between anomalies and R-R tadpoles associated tosectors with non-trivial Witten index. The result does not require anysupersymmetry to be preserved by the configuration. Under very mild conditionsof supersymmetry, a similar correspondence is found between NS-NS tadpoles andRG-flows in gauge theories on D-branes and O-planes. We briefly comment on theAdS/CFT counterpart of the results.
