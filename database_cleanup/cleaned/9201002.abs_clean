The quantum deformed (1+1) Poincare' algebra is shown to be the kinematicalsymmetry of the harmonic chain, whose spacing is given by the deformationparameter. Phonons with their symmetries as well as multiphonon processes arederived from the quantum group structure. Inhomogeneous quantum groups are thusproposed as kinematical invariance of discrete systems.
