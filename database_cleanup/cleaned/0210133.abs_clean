A new systematic method is developed to study to what extent the symmetryrequirements alone, above all the invariance under 16 supersymmetries (SUSY),determine the completely off-shell effective action $\Gamma$ of a D-particle,i.e. without imposing any restrictions on its position $r^m(\tau)$ and spin$\theta_\alpha(\tau)$. Our method consists of (i) writing down the properclosure relations for general SUSY transformations $\delta_\epsilon$ (whichnecessarily involves $\Gamma$ itself) together with the invariance condition$\delta_\epsilon\Gamma=0$ (ii) and solving this coupled system of functionaldifferential equations for $\delta_\epsilon$ and $\Gamma$ simultaneously,modulo field redefinitions, in a consistent derivative expansion scheme. Ouranalysis is facilitated by a novel classification scheme introduced for theterms in $\Gamma$. At order 2 and 4, although no assumption is made on theunderlying theory, we reproduce the effective action previously obtained at thetree and the 1-loop level in Matrix theory respectively (modulo two constants),together with the quantum-corrected SUSY transformations which close properly.This constitutes a complete unambiguous proof of off-shell non-renormalizationtheorems.
