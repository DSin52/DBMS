Using canonical methods, we study the invariance properties of a bosonic$p$--brane propagating in a curved background locally diffeomorphic to $M\timesG$, where $M$ is spacetime and $G$ a group manifold. The action is that of agauged sigma model in $p+1$ dimensions coupled to a Yang--Mills field and a$(p+1)$--form in $M$. We construct the generators of Yang-Mills and tensorgauge transformations and exhibit the role of the $(p+1)$--form in cancellingthe potential Schwinger terms. We also discuss the Noether currents associatedwith the global symmetries of the action and the question of the existence ofinfinite dimensional symmetry algebras, analogous to the Kac-Moody symmetry ofthe string.
