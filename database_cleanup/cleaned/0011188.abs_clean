S.Duplij and J.Wess. Kluwer Acad. Press. NATO Sc. Series II. 22(2001)181-193We give a review of the works devoted to the treatment of the Kerr superblack hole solution as a spinning particle. The real, complex and stringystructures of the Kerr and super-Kerr geometries are discussed, as well as therecent results on the regular matter source for the Kerr spinning particle. Itis shown that the source has to represent a rotating bag-like bubble having(A)dS interior and a smooth domain wall boundary. The given by Morrissupersymmetric generalization of the U(I) x U'(I) field model (which was usedby Witten to describe cosmic superconducting strings) is considered, and it isshown that this model can be adapted for description of superconducting bagshaving a long range external electromagnetic field and another gauge fieldconfined inside the bag.
