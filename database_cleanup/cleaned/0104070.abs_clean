Title: Supersymmetric Potentials in Einstein-Cartan-Brans-Dicke Cosmology

Comments: Latex file

Cosmological inflation is discussed in the realm ofEinstein-Cartan-Brans-Dicke (ECBD) gravity by constructing an effectiveinflaton potential and computing the number of e-folds.It is shown thatspin-torsion density contributes to a decrease on the number of e-folds ofinflation when the ratio of spin-torsion density to matter density isaprecciable as happens in the Early Universe.Quantum fluctuations of spin andinflatons are also investigated.Our results seems to be in agreement withPalle's proposal that quantum fluctuations of spin may trigger the primordialera of the universe.The main esult of the paper is the appearence of asupersymmetric type inflaton potential from the ECBD gravity where thecoefficient of the one-loop type correction is a constant spin-torsion density.
