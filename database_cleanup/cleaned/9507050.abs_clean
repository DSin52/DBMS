Based on a simple adiabatic argument and by considering the heterotic stringcounterpart of certain symmetries of Type II superstrings such as $(-1)^{F_L}$and orientation reversal, we construct orbifold candidates for dual pairs ofheterotic and Type II string theories with $N=2$ and $N=1$ supersymmetry. Wealso analyze from a similar point of view the ${\rm K3}$ fibrations that enterin recently proposed $N=2$ candidates and use this structure together withcertain orientation-reversing symmetries to construct $N=1$ dual pairs. Thesepairs involve generalizations of Type I vacua which can be equivalent to$E_8\times E_8$ heterotic strings, while standard Type I vacua are related to$SO(32)$.
