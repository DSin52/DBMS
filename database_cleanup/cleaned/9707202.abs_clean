We examine the structure of spacetime symmetries of toroidally compactifiedstring theory within the framework of noncommutative geometry. Following aproposal of Frohlich and Gawedzki, we describe the noncommutative stringspacetime using a detailed algebraic construction of the vertex operatoralgebra. We show that the spacetime duality and discrete worldsheet symmetriesof the string theory are a consequence of the existence of two independentDirac operators, arising from the chiral structure of the conformal fieldtheory. We demonstrate that these Dirac operators are also responsible for theemergence of ordinary classical spacetime as a low-energy limit of the stringspacetime, and from this we establish a relationship between T-duality andchanges of spin structure of the target space manifold. We study theautomorphism group of the vertex operator algebra and show that spacetimeduality is naturally a gauge symmetry in this formalism. We show that classicalgeneral covariance also becomes a gauge symmetry of the string spacetime. Weexplore some larger symmetries of the algebra in the context of a universalgauge group for string theory, and connect these symmetry groups with some ofthe algebraic structures which arise in the mathematical theory of vertexoperator algebras, such as the Monster group. We also briefly describe how theclassical topology of spacetime is modified by the string theory, and calculatethe cohomology groups of the noncommutative spacetime. A self-contained,pedagogical introduction to the techniques of noncommmutative geometry is alsoincluded.
