We analyse in detail the local BRST cohomology in Einstein-Yang-Mills theoryusing the antifield formalism. We do not restrict the Lagrangian to be the sumof the standard Hilbert and Yang-Mills Lagrangians, but allow for more generaldiffeomorphism and gauge invariant actions. The analysis is carried out in allspacetime dimensions larger than 2 and for all ghost numbers. This covers theclassification of all candidate anomalies, of all consistent deformations ofthe action, as well as the computation of the (equivariant) characteristiccohomology, i.e. the cohomology of the spacetime exterior derivative in thespace of (gauge invariant) local differential forms modulo forms that vanishon-shell. We show in particular that for a semi-simple Yang-Mills gauge groupthe antifield dependence can be entirely removed both from the consistentdeformations of the Lagrangian and from the candidate anomalies. Thus, theallowed deformations of the action necessarily preserve the gauge structure,while the only candidate anomalies are those provided by previous works notdealing with antifields, and by ``topological" candidate anomalies which arepresent only in special spacetime dimensions (6,9,10,13,...). This result nolonger holds in presence of abelian factors where new candidate anomalies anddeformations of the action can be constructed out of the conserved Noethercurrents (if any). The Noether currents themselves are shown to becovariantizable, with a few exceptions discussed as well.
