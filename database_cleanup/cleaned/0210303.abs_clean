We explore the physical consequences of a recently discovered class of exactsolutions to five dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory. We find a number ofthere are arbitrarily large black holes with topology S^3. (2) In the presenceof a black hole or a black string, there are expanding bubbles (with de Sittergeometry) which never reach null infinity. (3) A bubble can hold two blackholes of arbitrary size in static equilibrium. In particular, two large blackholes can be close together without merging to form a single black hole.
