In the present version only jnl.tex is needed. It can be obtained directlyfrom the bulletin boardWe argue that the field theory that descibes randomly branched polymers isnot generally conformally invariant in two dimensions at its critical point. Inparticular, we show (i) that the most natural formulation of conformalinvariance for randomly branched polymers leads to inconsistencies; (ii) thatthe free field theory obtained by setting the potential equal to zero in thebranched polymer field theory is not even classically conformally invariant;and (iii) that numerical enumerations of the exponent $\theta (\alpha )$,defined by $T_N(\alpha )\sim \lambda^NN^{-\theta (\alpha ) +1}$, where$T_N(\alpha )$ is number of distinct configuratations of a branched polymerrooted near the apex of a cone with apex angel $\alpha$, indicate that $\theta(\alpha )$ is not linear in $1/\alpha$ contrary to what conformal invarianceleads one to expect.
