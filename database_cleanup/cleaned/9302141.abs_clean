Title: A characterization of the differential in semi-infinite cohomology

Comments: 19 pages (to appear in Journal of Algebra)

Semi-infinite cohomology is constructed from scratch as the propergeneralization of finite dimensional Lie algebra cohomology. The differential dand other operators are realized as universal inner deri- vations of acompleted algebra, which acts on any appropriate semi-infinite complex. Inparticular, d is shown to be the unique derivation satisfying the "Cartanidentity" and certain natural degree conditions. The proof that d issquare-zero may well be the shortest (arguably, the only) one in print.
