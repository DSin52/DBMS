Two subtle aspects of brane intersections are investigated. The firstconcerns the `half-branes' that arise in discussions of the Hanany-Witteneffect, often in the D0/D8 setting. The second involves the validity ofseemingly singular classical BPS brane intersections. A study of holomorphiccurves in the background of a Kaluza-Klein monopole and the associatedreduction to type IIA supergravity sheds light on both issues. Many seeminglysingular D2/D6 intersections are shown to lift to smooth configurations ofM2-branes in 11-dimensions, and a mechanism is found for certain $Z_2$confinement effects in type II string theories that eliminates any need forhalf-branes.
