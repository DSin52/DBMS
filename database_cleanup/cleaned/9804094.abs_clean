We have extended the perturbative expansion method around the Gaussianeffective action to the fermionic field theory, by taking the 2-dimensionalGross-Neveu model as an example. We have computed both the zero temperature andthe finite temperature effective potentials of the Gross-Neveu model up to thefirst perturbative correction terms, and have found that the criticaltemperature, at which dynamically broken symmetry is restored, is significantlyimproved for small value of the flavour number.
