We review the Seiberg-Witten construction of low-energy effective actions andBPS spectra in SUSY gauge theories and its formulation in terms of integrablesystems. It is also demonstrated how this formulation naturally appears fromthe compactified version of the theory with partially broken supersymmetry sothat the integrable structures arise from the relation between bare and quantumvariables and superpotentials of SUSY gauge theories. The Whitham integrablesystems, literally corresponding to the uncompactified theory, are thenrestored by averaging over fast variables in the decompactification limit.
