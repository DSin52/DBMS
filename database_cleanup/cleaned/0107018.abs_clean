Title: Bulk Fields in Delocalized Dilatonic p-Branes

Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX

We study localization properties of various bulk fields on a dilatonicp-brane which is delocalized along its transverse directions except one. Wefind that all the bosonic and fermionic bulk fields can be localized on thedelocalized dilatonic p-brane in a strict sense, namely the Kaluza-Klein zeromodes of the bulk fields are normalizable and are localized around the brane,for any values of the dilaton coupling parameter.
