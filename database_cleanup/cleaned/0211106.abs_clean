The singular part of the \textit{operator product expansion} (OPE) of a pairof \textit{globally conformal invariant} (GCI) scalar fields $\phi$ of(integer) dimension $d$ can be written as a sum of the 2-point function of$\phi$ and $d-1$ bilocal conformal fields $V_{\nu}(x_1, x_2)$ of dimension$(\nu, \nu)$, $\nu = 1, ..., d-1$. As the correlation functions of $\phi(x)$are proven to be rational [6], we argue that the correlation functions of$V_{\nu}$ can also be assumed rational. Each $V_{\nu}(x_1, x_2)$ is expandedinto local symmetric tensor fields of \textit{twist} (dimension minus rank)$2\nu$. The case $d=2$, considered previously [5], is briefly reviewed andcurrent work on the $d=4$ case (of a Lagrangean density in 4 space--timedimensions) is previewed.
