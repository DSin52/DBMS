When the gauge instantons on the N=2 string worldsheet are properly includedin the sum over topologies, the breaking of SO(2,2) Lorentz symmetry in R^{2,2}is parametrized by a spacetime twistor containing the string coupling and thetaangle. The resulting (tree-level) effective action for the open string is notYang's but Leznov's cubic action for self-dual Yang-Mills in a light-conegauge. In the closed case, Plebanski's action for self-dual gravity getsmodified analogously. In contrast to the N=1 NSR string, picture-changing isnot locally invertible, but produces a semi-infinite tower of massless physicalstates with ever-increasing spin, perhaps related to harmonic superspace. Atruncation yields the two-field action of Chalmers and Siegel.
