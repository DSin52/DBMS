(5.22) is added, the relation to SYM theories is revisedSystemsWe study the hermitean and normal two matrix models in planar approximationfor an arbitrary number of eigenvalue supports. Its planar graph interpretationis given. The study reveals a general structure of the underlying analyticcomplex curve, different from the hyperelliptic curve of the one matrix model.The matrix model quantities are expressed through the periods of meromorphicgenerating differential on this curve and the partition function of themultiple support solution, as a function of filling numbers and coefficients ofthe matrix potential, is shown to be the quasiclassical tau-function. Therelation to softly broken N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories is discussed.A general class of solvable multimatrix models with tree-like interactions isconsidered.
