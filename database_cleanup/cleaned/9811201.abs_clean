We investigate the classical moduli space of D-branes on a nonabelianCalabi-Yau threefold singularity and find that it admits topology-changingtransitions. We construct a general formalism of worldvolume field theories inthe language of quivers and give a procedure for computing the enlarged Kahlercone of the moduli space. The topology changing transitions achieved by varyingthe Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters correspond to changes of linearization of ageometric invariant theory quotient and can be studied by methods of algebraicgeometry. Quite surprisingly, the structure of the enlarged Kahler cone can becomputed by toric methods. By using this approach, we give a detaileddiscussion of two low-rank examples.
