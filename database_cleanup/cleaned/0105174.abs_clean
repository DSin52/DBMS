We propose a new prescription of how to represent D-branes in Gepner modelsin more general homology classes than those in the previous constructions. Thecentral role is played by a certain projection acting on theRecknagel-Schomerus boundary states. Consequently, the boundary states are inmost cases no longer a sum of products of N=2 Ishibashi states, butnevertheless preserve spacetime supersymmetry and satisfy the Cardy condition.We demonstrate these in the (k=1)^3 Gepner model in detail, and constructboundary states for D-branes wound around arbitrary rigid 1-cycles on thecorresponding 2-torus. We also emphasize the necessity of some angle-dependenttransformations in identifying a proper free-field realization for each branetilted at an angle. In particular, this is essential for the Witten index togive the correct intersection numbers between the different D-branes.
