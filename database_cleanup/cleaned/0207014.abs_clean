We discuss a general class of boundary conditions for bosons living in anextra spatial dimension compactified on S^1/Z_2. Discontinuities for bothfields and their first derivatives are allowed at the orbifold fixed points. Weanalyze examples with free scalar fields and interacting gauge vector bosons,deriving the mass spectrum, that depends on a combination of the twist and thejumps. We discuss how the same physical system can be characterized bydifferent boundary conditions, related by local field redefinitions that turn atwist into a jump or vice-versa. When the description is in term ofdiscontinuous fields, appropriate lagrangian terms should be localized at theorbifold fixed points.
