Title: 3_F_2(1) hypergeometric function and quadratic R-matrix algebra

Comments: 13 pages

AlgebraWe construct a class of representations of the quadratic R-matrix algebra,given by the reflection equation with the spectral parameter, in terms ofcertain ordinary difference operators. These operators turn out to act asparameter shifting operators on the 3_F_2(1) hypergeometric function and itslimit cases and on classical orthogonal polynomials. The relationship with thefactorization method will be discussed.
