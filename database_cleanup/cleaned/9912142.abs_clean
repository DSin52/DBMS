the Yuri Golfand memorial volumeAbelian theories in three dimensions can have linearly confining phases as aresult of monopole-instantons, as shown, for SU(2) Yang-Mills theory broken toits abelian subgroup, by Polyakov. In this article the generalization of thisphase for N=2 supersymmetric abelian theories is identified, using a dualdescription. Topologically stable BPS-saturated and unsaturated particle andstring solitons play essential roles. A plasma of chiral monopoles of charge 1and -1 (along with their antichiral conjugates) are required for a stableconfining vacuum. N=2 SU(2) Yang-Mills theory broken to U(1) lacks this phasebecause its chiral monopoles all have the same charge, leading to a runawayinstability. The possibility of analogous confining phases of string theory,and a dual field theoretic model thereof, are briefly discussed.
