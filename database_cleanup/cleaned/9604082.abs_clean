By using the spherical coordinates in 3+1 dimensions we study theself-adjointness of the Dirac Hamiltonian in an Aharonov-Bohm gauge field of aninfinitely thin magnetic flux tube. It is shown that the angular part of theDirac Hamiltonian requires self-adjoint extensions as well as its radial one.The self-adjoint extensions of the angular part are parametrized by 2x2 unitarymatrix.
