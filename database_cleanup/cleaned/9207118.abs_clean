We explore the possibility of string theories in only four spacetimedimensions without any additional compactified dimensions. We show that,provided the theory is defined in curved spacetime that has a cosmologicalinterpration, it is possible to construct consistent heterotic string theoriesbased on a few non-compact current algebra cosets. We classify these models.The gauge groups that emerge fall within a remarkably narrow range and includethe desirable low energy flavor symmetry of $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$. Thequark and lepton states, which come in color triplets and $SU(2)$ doublets, areexpected to emerge in several families.
