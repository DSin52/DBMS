We detail the global structure of the five-dimensional bulk for thecosmological evolution of Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati braneworlds. The picturearticulated here provides a framework and intuition for understanding howmetric perturbations leave (and possibly reenter) the brane universe. A bulkobserver sees the braneworld as a relativistically expanding bubble, viewedeither from the interior (in the case of theFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker phase) or the exterior (theself-accelerating phase). Shortcuts through the bulk in the first phase canlead to an apparent brane causality violation and provide an opportunity forthe evasion of the horizon problem found in conventional four-dimensionalcosmologies. Features of the global geometry in the latter phase anticipate adepletion of power for linear metric perturbations on large scales.
