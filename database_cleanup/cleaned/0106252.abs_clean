Using a Kaluza-Klein framework, we consider a relativistic fluid whoseprojection yields the supersymmetric non-relativistic Chaplygin gas introducedby Bergner-Jackiw-Polychronakos and by Hoppe. The conserved (super)charges ofthe Chaplygin gas are obtained as the projection of those arising in theextended model.
