Models of relativistic particle with Lagrangian ${\cal L}(k_1)$, depending onthe curvature of the worldline $k_1$, are considered. By making use of theFrenet basis, the equations of motion are reformulated in terms of theprincipal curvatures of the worldline. It is shown that for arbitraryLagrangian function ${\cal L}(k_1)$ these equations are completely integrable,i.e., the principal curvatures are defined by integrals. The constants ofintegration are the particle mass and its spin. The developed method is appliedto the study of a model of relativistic particle with maximal properacceleration, whose Lagrangian is uniquely determined by a modified form of theinvariant relativistic interval. This model gives us an example of a consistentrelativistic dynamics obeying the principle of a superiorly limited value ofthe acceleration, advanced recently.
