A new topological model is proposed in three dimensions as an extension ofthe BF-model. It is a three-dimensional counterpart of the two-dimensionalmodel introduced by Chamseddine and Wyler ten years ago. The BFK-model, as weshall call it, shows to be quantum scale invariant at all orders inperturbation theory. The proof of its full finiteness is given in the frameworkof algebraic renormalization.
