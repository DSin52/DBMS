We consider a series of duality transformations that leads to a constantshift in the harmonic functions appearing in the description of a configurationof branes. This way, for several intersections of branes, we can relate theoriginal brane configuration which is asymptotically flat to a geometry whichis locally isometric to adS_k x E^l x S^m. These results imply that certainbranes are dual to supersingleton field theories. We also discuss theimplications of our results for supersymmetry enhancement and for supergravitytheories in diverse dimensions.
