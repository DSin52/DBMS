We perform the sewing of two (dual) Ramond reggeon vertices and derive analgorithm by means of which the so obtained four-Ramond reggeon vertex may beexplicitly computed at arbitrary oscillator (mass) level. A closed form of thefour-vertex is then deduced on the basis of a comparison to all terms obtainedby sewing that contain only level zero and one oscillators. Results arepresented for both complex fermions and for the previously studied case of realfermions.
