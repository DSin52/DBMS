We consider the asymmetric orbifold that is obtained by acting with T-dualityon a 4-torus, together with a shift along an extra circle. The chiral algebraof the resulting theory has non-trivial outer automorphisms that act aspermutations on its simple factors. These automorphisms play a crucial role forconstructing D-branes that couple to the twisted sector of the orbifold.
