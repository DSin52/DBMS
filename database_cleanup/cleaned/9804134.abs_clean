We show that contrary to the claim made by Hallin and Liljenberg in Phys.Rev. D52 1150,(1995), (hep-th/9412188) the thermal correction tothe thermal decay or pair production rate for a system placed in a heat bath inthe presence of an external electric field, is always nonzero in the finite aswell as infinite time limit. Using the formalism outlined there, we reestimatethe decay rate for different values of temperature, mass and time.We also tryto identify the parameter ranges where the quantity of interest agrees withthat computed previously, at high temperature (in the infinite time limit),from the imaginary part of the effective action using imaginary time and realtime formalism of thermal field theory. We also point out that in the strictlyinfinite time limit, the correct decay rate as obtained from the work of Hallinet. al. tends to diverge.
