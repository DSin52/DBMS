The dynamics of superstring, supergravity and M theories and theircompactifications are probed by studying the various perturbation theories thatemerge in the strong and weak coupling limits for various directions incoupling constant space. The results support the picture of an underlyingnon-perturbative theory that, when expanded perturbatively in differentcoupling constants, gives different perturbation theories, which can beperturbative superstring theories or superparticle theories. The $p$-branespectrum is considered in detail and a criterion found to establish which$p$-branes govern the strong coupling dynamics. In many cases there arecompeting conjectures in the literature, and this analysis decides betweenthem. In other cases, new results are found. The chiral six-dimensional theoryresulting from compactifying the type IIB string on $K_3$ is studied in detailand it is found that certain strong coupling limits appear to give newtheories, some of which hint at the possibility of a twelve-dimensional origin.
