After giving a pedagogical review of the chiral gauge approach to 2D gravity,with particular emphasis on the derivation of the gravitational Wardidentities, we discuss in some detail the interpretation of matter correlationfunctions coupled to gravity in chiral gauge. We argue that in chiral gauge no{\it explicit} gravitational dressing factor, analogue to the Liouvilleexponential in conformal gauge, is necessary for left-right symmetric matteroperators. In particular, we examine the gravitationally dressed four-pointcorrelation function of products of left and right fermions. We solve thethis four-point function exhibits a logarithmic short-distance singularity,instead of the power-law singularity in the absence of gravity. This rathersurprising effect is non-perturbative in the gravitational coupling and is asign for logarithms in the gravitationally dressed operator product expansions.We also discuss some perturbative evidence that the chiral Gross-Neveu modelmay remain integrable when coupled to gravity.
