Title: Massive and Massless Monopoles and Duality

Authors: Erick J. Weinberg

Comments: 41 pages, 5 figures; Talks delivered at the Asia Pacific Center for

Theoretical Physics Third Winter School on Duality in Fields and Strings,Seogwipo, Cheju, Korea, January 1999I review some aspects of BPS magnetic monopoles and of electric-magneticduality in theories with arbitrary gauge groups. When the symmetry is maximallybroken to a U(1)^r subgroup, all magnetically charged configurations can beunderstood in terms of r species of massive fundamental monopoles. When theunbroken group has a non-Abelian factor, some of these fundamental monopolesbecome massless and can be viewed as the duals to the massless gauge bosons.Rather than appearing as distinct solitons, these massless monopoles aremanifested as clouds of non-Abelian field surrounding one or more massivemonopoles. I describe in detail some examples of solutions with such clouds.
