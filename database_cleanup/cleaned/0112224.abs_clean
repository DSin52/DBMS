We study the behavior of the four$-$dimensional Newton's law in warpedbraneworlds. The setup considered here is a $(3+n)$-brane embedded in $(5+n)$dimensions, where $n$ extra dimensions are compactified and a dimension isinfinite. We show that the wave function of gravity is described in terms ofthe Bessel functions of $(2+n/2)$-order and that estimate the correction toNewton's law. In particular, the Newton's law for $n=1$ can be exactlyobtained.
