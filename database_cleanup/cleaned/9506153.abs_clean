Title: Topological Aspects of Parasupersymmetry

Comments: LaTeX File, 10 pages

Parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics is exploited to introduce a topologicalinvariant associated with a pair of parameter dependent Fredholm (respectivelyelliptic differential) operators satisfying two compatibility conditions. Anexplicit algebraic expression for this topological invariant is provided. Thelatter identifies the parasupersymmetric topological invariant with the sum ofthe analytic (Atiyah-Singer) indices of the corresponding operators.
