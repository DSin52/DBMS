We study the fate of U(1) strings embedded in a non-Abelian gauge theory withV>>v. While in the low-energy limit the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen string (fluxtube) is perfectly stable, being considered in the full theory it isSU(2) gauge theory with adjoint and fundamental scalars. First, the adjointscalar develops a vacuum expectation value V breaking SU(2) down to U(1). Then,at a much lower scale, the fundamental scalar (quark) develops a vacuumexpectation value v creating the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen string. (We alsoconsider an alternative scenario in which the second breaking, U(1)->nothing,is due to an adjoint field.) We suggest an illustrative ansatz describing an"unwinding" in SU(2) of the winding inherent to the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesenstrings in U(1). This ansatz determines an effective 2D theory for the unstablemode on the string world-sheet. We calculate the decay rate (per unit length ofthe string) in this ansatz and then derive a general formula. The decay rate isexponentially suppressed. The suppressing exponent is proportional to the ratioof the monopole mass squared to the string tension, which is quite natural inview of the string breaking through the monopole-antimonopole pair production.We compare our result with the one given by Schwinger's formula dualized fordescribing the monopole-antimonopole pair production in the magnetic field.
