Title: On the Fermionic Quasi-particle Interpretation in Minimal Models of

Conformal Field TheoryComments: 5 pages of LateX

Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B409 (1997) 199-205

The conjecture that the states of the fermionic quasi-particles in minimalconformal field theories are eigenstates of the integrals of motion to certaineigenvalues is checked and shown to be correct only for the Ising model.
