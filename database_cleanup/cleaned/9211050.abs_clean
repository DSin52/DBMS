The general problems of three-dimensional quantum gravity are recatitulatedhere, putting the emphasis on the mathematical problems of defining the measureof the path integral over all three-dimensional metrics.This work should beviewed as an extension of a preceding one on the four dimensional casefinally put forward some suggestions on the lines one could expect furtherprogress in the field.
