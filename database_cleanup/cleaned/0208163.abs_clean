We discuss the high temperature behaviour of IIB strings in the maximallysymmetric plane wave background, and show that there is a Hagedorn temperature.Thermodynamic quantities diverge as we approach the Hagedorn temperature frombelow, suggesting that the Hagedorn temperature is a limiting temperature. Wediscuss the map between strings in the pp-wave background and the dualsuperconformal field theory in the thermal domain. The Hagedorn bound describesa curve in the R-charge chemical potential versus temperature phase diagram ofthe dual Yang-Mills theory, suggesting that the theory dual to the pp-wavestring exists only on one side. Yet, the dual theory itself manifestly existson both sides of the Hagedorn bound. One possibility is that this mismatch isan artifact of the ideal gas approximation, and that for finite coupling theHagedorn temperature ceases to be limiting.
