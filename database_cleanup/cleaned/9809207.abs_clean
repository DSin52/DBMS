International Conference on Path-Integrals from peV to TeV 50 Years fromFeynman's Paper, Florence, Italy, 25-29 August 1998, to appear in theProceedingsWe use variational methods to calculate quasilocal energy quantumcorrections. A comparison with the effective potential calculated at quadraticorder is made by means of gaussian wave functionals. The method is a particularcase of the effective action for composite operators used in quantum fieldtheory. In pure gravity the method is applied for the first time. Implicationson the foam-like scenario are discussed.
