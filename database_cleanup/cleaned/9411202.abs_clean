It is shown that in the absence of free abelian gauge fields, the conservedcurrents of (classical) Yang-Mills gauge models coupled to matter fields can bealways redefined so as to be gauge invariant. This is a direct consequence ofthe general analysis of the Wess-Zumino consistency condition for Yang-Millstheory that we have provided recently.
