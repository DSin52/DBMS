We study systematically VEVs of a gauge scalar field $\Sigma$ in bulk U(1)vector multiplet and scalar fields in brane/bulk hypermultiplets charged underthe U(1) in the 5D $S^1/Z_2$ orbifold model with generic FI terms. Anon-trivial VEV of $\Sigma$ generates bulk mass terms for U(1) charged fieldsand their zero-modes have non-trivial profiles. In particular, in the SUSYbreaking case, bosonic and fermionic zero modes have Gaussian profiles. Suchnon-trivial profiles are useful to explain hierarchical couplings. A toy modelfor SUSY breaking is studied and that results in the sizable $D$-termcontributions to scalar masses. Because the overall magnitude of $D$-termcontributions are same everywhere in bulk and also on both branes, we have totake into account these contributions and other SUSY breaking terms for arealistic scenario to explain Yukawa hierarchy. We also give profiles and masseigenvalues of higher modes.
