We derive the effective action for classical strings coupled to dilatonic,gravitational, and axionic fields. We show how to use this effective actionto the infrared (long-range) interaction between strings, (iii) bringingadditional light on the special cancellations that occur for fundamentalstrings, and (iv) pointing out the limitations of Dirac's celebratedfield-energy approach to renormalization.
