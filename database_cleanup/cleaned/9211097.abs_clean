We find a relation between the spectrum of solitons of massive $N=2$ quantumfield theories in $d=2$ and the scaling dimensions of chiral fields at theconformal point. The condition that the scaling dimensions be real imposesrestrictions on the soliton numbers and leads to a classification program forsymmetric $N=2$ conformal theories and their massive deformations in terms of asuitable generalization of Dynkin diagrams (which coincides with the A--D--EDynkin diagrams for minimal models). The Landau-Ginzburg theories are a propersubset of this classification. In the particular case of LG theories we relatethe soliton numbers with intersection of vanishing cycles of the correspondingsingularity; the relation between soliton numbers and the scaling dimensions inthis particular case is a well known application of Picard-Lefschetz theory.
