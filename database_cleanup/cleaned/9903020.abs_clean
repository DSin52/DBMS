Workshop, August 1998, Chalmers, SwedenWe review the basic structure of the higher spin extension of D=4, N=8 AdSsupergravity. The theory is obtained by gauging the higher spin superalgebrashs^E(8|4) by a procedure pioneered by Vasiliev. The algebra shs^E(8|4) is asubalgebra of the enveloping algebra of OSp(8|4). The physical states of thetheory are in one to one correspondence with the symmetric product of twoOSp(8|4) singletons. This singleton theory, which may be viewed in a certainlimit as the supermembrane theory on AdS_4 x S^7, is expected to describe thedynamics of the higher spin theory. Thus, the higher spin N=8 supergravity onAdS_4 is conjectured to describe the field theory limit of M-theory on AdS_4 xS^7.
