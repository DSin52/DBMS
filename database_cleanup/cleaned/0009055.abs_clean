We show that the two dimensional Calogero-Marchioro Model (CMM) without theharmonic confinement can naturally be embedded into an extended SU(1,1|2)superconformal Hamiltonian. We study the quantum evolution of thesuperconformal Hamiltonian in terms of suitable compact operators of the N=2extended de Sitter superalgebra with central charge and discuss the pattern ofsupersymmetry breaking. We also study the arbitrary D dimensional CMM havingdynamical OSp(2|2) supersymmetry and point out the relevance of this model inthe context of the low energy effective action of the dimensionally reducedYang-Mills theory.
