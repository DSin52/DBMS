We investigate a class of conformal Non-Abelian-Toda models representing anoncompact $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ parafermionions (PF) interacting with a specificabelian Toda theories and having a global U(1) symmetry. A systematicderivation of the conserved currents, their algebras and the exact solution ofthese models is presented. An important property of this class of models is theaffine $SL(2,R)_q$ algebra spanned by charges of the chiral and antichiralnonlocal currents and the U(1) charge. The classical (Poisson Brackets)algebras of symmetries $V{G_n}$ of these models appears to be of mixedPF-$W{G_n}$ type. They contain together with the local quadratic terms specificfor the $W_n$-algebras the nonlocal terms similar to the ones of the classicalPF-algebra. The renormalization of the spins of the nonlocal currents is themain new feature of the quantum $V{A_n}$-algebras. The quantum $V{A_2}$-algebraand its degenerate representations are studied in detail.
