The free non-critical string quantum model is constructed directly in thelight-cone variables in the range of dimensions $1<D<25$. The longitudinaldegrees of freedom are described by an abstract Verma module. The centralcharge of this module is restricted by the requirement of the closure of thenonlinear realization of the Poincare algebra. The spin content of the model isanalysed. In particular for D=4 the explicit formulae for the charactergenerating functions of the open and closed massive strings are given and thespin spectrum of first 12 excited levels is calculated. It is shown that forthe space-time dimension in the range $1<D<25$ the non-critical light-conestring is equivalent to the critical massive string and to the non-criticalNambu-Goto string.
