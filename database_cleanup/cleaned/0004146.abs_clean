We consider two-dimensional nonlinear sigma model from the viewpoint of theholography, which has been applied to the study of the Yang-Mills theory, basedon the non-critical string theory. We can see the renormalization group flowsfor both the nonlinear sigma model and the Yang-Mills theory at the same time,and the two theories are intimately related through a kind of dual relation ofthe coupling constants. We address the running behaviors of these couplingconstants and also the asymptotic freedom of the Yang-Mills theory.
