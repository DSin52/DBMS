Title: Another Length Scale in String Theory?

Comments: 19 pages, harvmac, one eps figure in separate uuencoded file

We suggest that some of the remarkable results on stringy dynamics which havebeen found recently indicate the existence of another dynamical length scale instring theory that, at weak coupling, is much shorter than the string scale.This additional scale corresponds to a mass $\sim m_{\rm s}/g_{\rm s}$ where$m_{\rm s}$ is the square root of the string tension and $g_{\rm s}$ is thestring coupling constant. In four dimensions this coincides with the Planckmass.
