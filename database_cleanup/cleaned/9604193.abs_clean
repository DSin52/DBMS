We suggest a duality invariant formula for the entropy and temperature ofnon-extreme black holes in supersymmetric string theory. The entropy is givenin terms of the duality invariant parameter of the deviation from extremalityand 56 SU(8) covariant central charges. It interpolates between the entropiesof Schwarzschild solution and extremal solutions with various amount ofunbroken supersymmetries and therefore serves for classification of black holesin supersymmetric string theories. We introduce the second auxiliary 56 viaE(7) symmetric constraint. The symmetric and antisymmetric combinations ofthese two multiplets are related via moduli to the corresponding twoCPT as well as C symmetry of the entropy formula and duality one can explainthe mysterious simplicity of the non-extreme black hole area formula in termsof branes and anti-branes.
