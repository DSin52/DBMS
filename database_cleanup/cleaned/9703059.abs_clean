We show the existence of a supersymmetry breaking mechanism in string theory,where N=4 supersymmetry is broken spontaneously to N=2 and N=1 with modulidependent gravitino masses. The spectrum of the spontaneously broken theorywith lower supersymmetry is in one-to-one correspondence with the spectrum ofthe heterotic N=4 string. The mass splitting of the N=4 spectrum depends on thecompactification moduli as well as the three R-symmetry charges. We also showthat, in string theory, chiral theories can be obtained after spontaneousbreaking of extended supersymmetry. This was impossible at the level of fieldtheory. In the large moduli limit a restoration of the N=4 supersymmetry isobtained. As expected the graviphotons and some of the gauge bosons becomemassive in N=1 vacua. At some special points of the moduli space some of theN=4 states with non-zero winding numbers and with spin 0 and {1/2} becomemassless chiral superfields of the unbroken N=1 supersymmetry. Such vaccua havea dual type II description, in which there are magnetically charged states withspin 0 and {1/2} that become massless. The heterotic-type II duality suggestssome novel non-perturbative transitions on the type II side. Such transitionsdo not seem to have a geometric interpretation, since they relate type IIvaccua with symmetric worlsheet structure to assymetric ones. The heteroricinterpretation of such a transition is an ordinary Higgsing of an SU(2) factor.In the case of N=4 --> N=2, the perturbative N=2 prepotential is determined bythe perturbative N=4 BPS states. This observation let us to suggest a methodwhich determines the exact non-perturbative prepotential of the effective N=2supergravity using the shifted spectrum of the non-perturbative BPS states ofthe underlying N=4 theory.
