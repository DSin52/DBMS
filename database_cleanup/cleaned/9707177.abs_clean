A quantum mechanical path integral derivation is given of a thermalpropagator in non-static Gui spacetime. The thermal nature of the propagator isunderstood in terms of homotopically non-trivial paths in the configurationspace appropriate to tortoise coordinates. The connection to thermal emissionfrom collapsing black holes is discussed.
