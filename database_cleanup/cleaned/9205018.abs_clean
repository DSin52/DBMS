The geometric interpretation of the antibracket formalism given by Witten isextended to cover the anti-BRST symmetry. This enables one to formulate thequantum master equation for the BRST--anti-BRST formalism in terms ofintegration theory over a supermanifold. A proof of the equivalence of thestandard antibracket formalism with the antibracket formalism for theBRST--anti-BRST symmetry is also given.
