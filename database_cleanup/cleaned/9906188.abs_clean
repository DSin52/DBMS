We show that the logarithmic behaviour seen in perturbative and nonperturbative contributions to Green functions of gauge-invariant compositeoperators in N=4 SYM with SU(N) gauge group can be consistently interpreted interms of anomalous dimensions of unprotected operators in long multiplets ofthe superconformal group SU(2,2|4). In order to illustrate the point we analysethe short-distance behaviour of a particularly simple four-point Green functionof the lowest scalar components of the N=4 supercurrent multiplet. Assuming thevalidity of the Operator Product Expansion, we are able to reproduce the knownvalue of the one-loop anomalous dimension of the single-trace operators in theKonishi supermultiplet. We also show that it does not receive anynon-perturbative contribution from the one-instanton sector. We briefly commenton double- and multi-trace operators and on the bearing of our results on theAdS/SCFT correspondence.
