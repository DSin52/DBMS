We extend the results found for Matrix String Theory to Heterotic MatrixString Theory, i.e. to a 2d O(N) SYM theory with chiral (anomaly free) matterand N=(8,0) supersymmetry. We write down the instanton equations for thistheory and solve them explicitly. The solutions are characterized by branchedcoverings of the basis cylinder, i.e. by compact Riemann surfaces withpunctures. We show that in the strong coupling limit the action becomes theheterotic string action plus a free Maxwell action. Moreover the amplitudebased on a Riemann surface with p punctures and h handles is proportional tog^{2-2h-p}, as expected for the heterotic string interaction theory with stringcoupling g_s=1/g.
