Comments: 5 pages. Contribution to the proceedings of the Cargese 2002 summer

schoolThis note is the written version of a talk which was presented at the Cargese2002 summer school. It gives a brief introduction to the paper hep-th/0205281,written in collaboration with R. Dijkgraaf and E. Verlinde. In this paper, wecalculate the euclidean partition function of the type IIA NS five-branewrapped on an arbitrary Calabi-Yau space in a double-scaling decoupling limitand in the presence of a flat RR 3-form background field. The result is theproduct of a theta function, coming from the classical fluxes of the self-dualtensor field, and a factor representing the quantum contributions. The quantumfactor turns out to be related to topological B-model string amplitudes, andboth factors satisfy a holomorphic anomaly equation. The result can teach usmore about little string theories and about instanton corrections tofour-dimensional effective quantities.
