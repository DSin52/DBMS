We present a simple derivation of vector supersymmetry transformations fortopological field theories of Schwarz- and Witten-type. Our method is similarto the derivation of BRST-transformations from the so-called horizontalityconditions or Russian formulae. We show that this procedure reproduces in aconcise way the known vector supersymmetry transformations of varioustopological models and we use it to obtain some new transformations of thistype for 4d topological YM-theories in different gauges.
