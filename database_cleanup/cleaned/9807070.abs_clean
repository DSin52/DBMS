Title: Characterization of Universal Behavior in QCD Dirac Spectra

Comments: 12 pages, Latex and 4 postscript figures; Invited talk given at the

3rd Workshop on Continuous Advances in QCD, Minneapolis, April 1998In this lecture we discuss correlations of the QCD Dirac eigenvalues. We findthat below a scale of $E_c\sim \Lambda/L^2$ they are given by chiral RandomMatrix Theory. This follows from analytical arguments based on partiallyquenched Chiral Perturbation Theory and is substantiated by lattice QCD andinstanton liquid simulations.
