For a class of generalized integrable hierarchies associated with affine(twisted or untwisted) Kac-Moody algebras, an explicit representation of theirlocal conserved densities by means of a single scalar tau-function is deduced.This tau-function acts as a partition function for the conserved densities,which fits its potential interpretation as the effective action of some quantumsystem. The class consists of multi-component generalizations of theDrinfel'd-Sokolov and the two-dimensional affine Toda lattice hierarchies. Therelationship between the former and the approach of Feigin, Frenkel andEnriquez to soliton equations of KdV and mKdV type is also discussed. Theseresults considerably simplify the calculation of the conserved charges carriedby the soliton solutions to the equations of the hierarchy, which is importantto establish their interpretation as particles. By way of illustration, wecalculate the charges carried by a set of constrained KP solitons recentlyconstructed.
