It is shown that classical decay of unstable D-branes in bosonic andsuperstring theories produces pressureless gas with non-zero energy density.The energy density is stored in the open string fields, even though around theminimum of the tachyon potential there are no open string degrees of freedom.We also give a description of this phenomenon in an effective field theory.
