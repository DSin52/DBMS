Title: Non-canonical quantization of electromagnetic fields and the meaning of

$Z_3$Authors: Marek Czachor

Comments: The formalism is simpler and more general if one quantizes with two

harmonic oscillators (extension to massive particles is natural). Appropriatemodifications are introduced, eqs. (86),(87),(93) and many other typos arecorrectedNon-canonical quantization is based on certain reducible representations ofcanonical commutation relations. Relativistic formalism for electromagneticnon-canonical quantum fields is introduced. Unitary representations of thePoincar\'e group at the level of fields and states are explicitly given.Multi-photon and coherent states are introduced. Statistics of photons in acoherent state is Poissonian if an appropriately defined thermodynamic limit isperformed. Radiation fields having a correct $S$ matrix are constructed. The$S$ matrix is given by a non-canonical coherent-state displacement operator, afact automatically eliminating the infrared catastrophe. This, together withearlier results on elimination of vacuum and ultraviolet infinities, suggeststhat non-canonical quantization leads to finite field theories. Renormalizationconstant $Z_3$ is found as a parameter related to wave functions ofnon-canonical vacua.
