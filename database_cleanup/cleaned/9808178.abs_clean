Applying the recently obtained results on the renormalization of softsupersymmetry-breaking parameters, we investigate the infrared behaviour of thesoftly broken supersymmetric QCD as well as its dual theory in the conformalwindow. Under general assumptions on $\beta$-functions, it is shown that thesoft supersymmetry-breaking parameters asymptotically vanish in the infraredlimit so that superconformal symmetry in softly broken supersymmetric QCD andin its dual theory revives at the infrared fixed point, provided the softscalar masses satisfy certain renormalization group invariant relations. Ifthese relations are not satisfied, there exist marginal operators in boththeories that lead to the breaking of supersymmetry and also colour symmetry.
