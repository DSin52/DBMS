Title: The differential geometry of Fedosov's quantization

Comments: 20 pages

AlgebraB. Fedosov has given a simple and very natural construction of a deformationquantization for any symplectic manifold, using a flat connection on the bundleof formal Weyl algebras associated to the tangent bundle of a symplecticmanifold. The connection is obtained by affinizing, nonlinearizing, anditeratively flattening a given torsion free symplectic connection. In thispaper, a classical analog of Fedosov's operations on connections is analyzedand shown to produce the usual exponential mapping of a linear connection on anordinary manifold. A symplectic version is also analyzed. Finally, some remarksare made on the implications for deformation quantization of Fedosov's indextheorem on general symplectic manifolds.
