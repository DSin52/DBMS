A natural first step in the classification of all `physical' modularinvariant partition functions $\sum N_{LR}\,\c_L\,\C_R$ lies in understandingthe commutant of the modular matrices $S$ and $T$. We begin this paperextending the work of Bauer and Itzykson on the commutant from the $SU(N)$ casethey consider to the case where the underlying algebra is any semi-simple Liealgebra (and the levels are arbitrary). We then use this analysis to show thatthe partition functions associated with even self-dual lattices span thecommutant. This proves that the lattice method due to Roberts and Terao, andWarner, will succeed in generating all partition functions. We then make somegeneral remarks concerning certain properties of the coefficient matrices$N_{LR}$, and use those to explicitly find all level 1 partition functionscorresponding to the algebras $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$, and the 5 exceptionals.Previously, only those associated to $A_n$ seemed to be generally known.
