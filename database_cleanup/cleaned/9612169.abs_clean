The dymamical chiral symmetry breaking in higher- derivative quantum gravityhas been investigated on the flat background. The Schwinger- Dyson equationsnumerical solutions have been found in the ladder approximation. Both two- andfour- dimensional cases have been considered. The dymamical fermion massgeneration accompanied by the second- order phase transition has been shown totake place in a different gauges.
