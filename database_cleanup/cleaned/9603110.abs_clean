The symmetries of the tree level string effective action are discussed. Anappropriate effective action is constructed starting from the manifestlySL(2,R) invarint form of string effective action introduced by Schwarz and Sen.The conserved charges are derived and generators of infinitesimaltransformations are obtained in the Hamiltonian formalism. Some interestingconsequences of the canonical transformations are explored.
