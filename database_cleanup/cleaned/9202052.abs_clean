Recently, a topological proof of the spin-statistics Theorem has beenproposed for a system of point particles which does not require relativity orfield theory, but assumes the existence of antiparticles. We extend this proofto a system of string loops in three space dimensions and show that by assumingthe existence of antistring loops, one can prove a spin-statistics theorem forthese string loops. According to this theorem, all unparametrized strings(suchas flux tubes in superconductors and cosmic strings ) should be quantized asbosons. Also, as in the point particle case, we find that the theorem excludesnonabelian statistics.
