The paper is devoted to quantization of polynomial momentum observables inthe cotangent bundle of a smooth manifold. A quantization procedure is proposedallowing to quantize a wide class of functions which are polynomials of anyorder in momenta. In the last part of the paper the quantum mechanics of scalarparticle in curved space-time is studied with the use of proposed approach.
