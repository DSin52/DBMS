In the event symmetric approach to quantum gravity it is assumed that thefundamental laws of physics must be invariant under exchange of any twospace-time events. The fact that this symmetry if obviously not observed isattributed to the possibility of a spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism inwhich the residual symmetry is diffeomorphism invariance on a continuum. Theapproach has a discrete nature while dimensionality, continuity of space-timeand causality are abandoned as fundamental principles. Consequently space-timeis a dynamical object which may undergo changes of topology or dimension. Anumber of different types of Event Symmetric model are described. The mostinteresting models are event symmetric superstring models based on discretestring supergroups.
