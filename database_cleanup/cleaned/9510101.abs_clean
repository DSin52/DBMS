The Coulomb branch of $N=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensionsis described in general by an integrable Hamiltonian system in the holomorphicsense. A natural construction of such systems comes from two-dimensional gaugetheory and spectral curves. Starting from this point of view, we propose anintegrable system relevant to the $N=2$ $SU(n)$ gauge theory with ahypermultiplet in the adjoint representation, and offer much evidence that itis correct. The model has an $SL(2,{\bf Z})$ $S$-duality group (with thecentral element $-1$ of $SL(2,{\bf Z})$ acting as charge conjugation);$SL(2,{\bf Z})$ permutes the Higgs, confining, and oblique confining phases inthe expected fashion. We also study more exotic phases.
