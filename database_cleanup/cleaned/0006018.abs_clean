We discuss the general structure of the non-abelian Born-Infeld action,together with all of the alpha-prime derivative corrections, in flatD-dimensional space-time. More specifically, we show how the connection betweenopen strings propagating in background magnetic fields and gauge theories onnon-commutative spaces can be used to constrain the form of the effectiveaction for the massless modes of open strings at week coupling. In particular,we exploit the invariance in form of the effective action under a change ofnon-commutativity scale of space-time to derive algebraic equations relatingthe various terms in the alpha- prime expansion. Moreover, we explicitly solvethese equations in the simple case D=2, and we show, in particular, how toconstruct the minimal invariant derivative extension of the NBI action.
