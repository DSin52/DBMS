Weak first-order phase transitions proceed with percolation of new phase. Thekinematics of this process is clarified from the point of view of subcriticalbubbles. We examine the effect of small subcritical bubbles around a largedomain of asymmetric phase by introducing an effective geometry. Thepercolation process can be understood as a perpetual growth of the large domainaided by the small subcritical bubbles.
