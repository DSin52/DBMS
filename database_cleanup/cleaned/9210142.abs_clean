Title: Recent Efforts in the Computation of String Couplings

Authors: Albrecht Klemm and Stefan Theisen

Comments: Talk hold at the `International Conference on Modern Problems in

Quantum Field Theorie, Strings and Quantum Gravity', Kiev, June 1992, 18pagesJournal-ref: Theor.Math.Phys. 95 (1993) 583-594; Teor.Mat.Fiz. 95 (1993)

293-306We review recent advances towards the computation of string couplings.Duality symmetry, mirror symmetry, Picard-Fuchs equations, etc. are some of thetools.
