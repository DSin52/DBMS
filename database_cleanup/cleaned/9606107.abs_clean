Utilizing (2,0) superfields, we write a supersymmetry-squared action andpartially relate it to the new formulation of the Green-Schwarz action given byBerkovits and Siegel. Recent results derived from this new formulation arediscussed within the context of some prior proposals in the literature. Amongthese, we note that 4D, N = 1 beta-FFC superspace geometry with a compositeconnection for R-symmetry has now been confirmed as the only presently knownlimit of 4D, N = 1 heterotic string theory that is derivable in a completelyrigorous manner.
