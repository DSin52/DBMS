For a one-parameter family of Calabi-Yau d-fold M embedded in ${{CP}^{d+1}}$,we consider a new quasi-topological field theory ${A^{\ast}}$(M)-model comparedwith the $A$(M)-model. The two point correlators on the sigma model modulispace (the hermitian metrics) are analyzed by the $A{A^{\ast}}$-fusion on theworld sheet sphere. A set of equations of these correlators turns out to be anon-affine A-type Toda equation system for the d-fold M. This non-affineproperty originates in the vanishing first Chern class of M. Using the resultsof the $A{A^{\ast}}$-equation, we obtain a genus one partition function of thesigma model associated to the M in the recipe of the holomorphic anomaly. Bytaking an asymmetrical limit of the complexified {\kae} parameters${\bar{t}\rightarrow \infty}$ and $t$ is fixed, the ${A^{\ast}}$(M)-model partis decoupled and we can obtain a partition function (or one point function ofthe operator ${{\cal O}^{(1)}}$ associated to a {\kae} form of M) of the$A$(M)-matter coupled with the topological gravity at the stringy one looplevel. The coefficients of the series expansion with respect to anvector bundle {\Large $\nu $} over the moduli space of stable maps withdefinite degrees.
