We determine the equations which govern the gauge symmetries of worldsheetswith local supersymmetry of arbitrary rank $(N,N')$, and their possibleanomalies. Both classical and ghost conformally invariant multiplets of theleft or right sector are assembled into the components of a single$O(N)$-superfield. The component with ghost number zero of this superfield isthe $N$-supersymmetric generalization of the Beltrami differential. In aLagrangian approach, and after gauge-fixing, it becomes the super-moduli ofRiemann surfaces coupled to local supersymmetry of rank $N$. It is also thesource of all linear superconformal currents derived from ordinary operatorproduct techniques. The interconnection between BRST invariant actions withdifferent values of $N\geq 3$, and their possible link to topological2D-gravity coupled to topological sigma models, are shown by straightforwardalgebraic considerations.
