We analyse the critical behaviour of anomalous currents in N=1four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories in the context ofelectric-magnetic duality. We show that the anomalous dimension of the Konishisuperfield is related to the slope of the beta function at the critical point.We construct a duality map for the Konishi current in the minimal SQCD. As abyproduct we compute the slope of the beta function in the strong couplingregime. We note that the OPE of the stress tensor with itself does not close,but mixes with the Konishi operator. As a result in superconformal theories infour dimensions (SCFT$_4$) there are {\sl two} central charges; they allow usto count both the vector multiplet and the matter multiplet effective degreesof freedom. Some applications to N=4 SYM are discussed.
