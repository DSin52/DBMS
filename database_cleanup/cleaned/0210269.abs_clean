We study pairs of planar D-branes intersecting on null hypersurfaces, andother related configurations. These are supersymmetric and have finite energydensity. They provide open-string analogues of the parabolic orbifold andnull-fluxbrane backgrounds for closed superstrings. We derive the spectrum ofopen strings, showing in particular that if the D-branes are shifted in aspectator dimension so that they do not intersect, the open strings joiningthem have no asymptotic states. As a result, a single non-BPS excitation can inthis case catalyze a condensation of massless modes, changing significantly theunderlying supersymmetric vacuum state. We argue that a similar phenomenon canmodify the null cosmological singularity of the time-dependent orbifolds. Thisis a stringy mechanism, distinct from black-hole formation and other stronggravitational instabilities, and one that should dominate at weak stringcoupling. A by-product of our analysis is a new understanding of the appearanceof 1/4 BPS threshold bound states, at special points in the moduli space oftoroidally-compactified type-II string theory.
