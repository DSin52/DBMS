Title: $Q$-Meromorphic Functions, Quantums sets and Homomorphisms of the

Quantum PlaneComments: 15 pages

In this paper which is the completion of [1], we construct the$A_0(q)$-algebra of $Q$-meromorphic functions on the quantum plane. This is thelargest non-commutative, associative, $A_0(q)$-algebra of functions constructedon the quantum plane. We also define the notion of quantum subsets of R$^2$which is a generalization of the notion of quantum disc and charactrize some oftheir properties. In the end we study the $Q$-homomorphisms of the quantumplane.
