Title: Construction of nonsingular cosmological solutions in string theories

Comments: 27 pages, 6 eps figures

We study nonsingular cosmological scenarios in a general $D$-dimensionalstring effective action of the dilaton-modulus-axion system in the presence ofthe matter source. In the standard dilatonic Brans-Dicke parameter($\omega=-1$) with radiation, we analytically obtain singularity-free bouncingsolutions where the universe starts out in a state with a finite curvature andevolves toward the weakly coupled regime. We apply this analytic method to thestring-gas cosmology including the massive state in addition to the leadingmassless state (radiation), with and without the axion. We numerically findbouncing solutions which asymptotically approach an almost radiation-dominantuniverse with a decreasing curvature irrespective of the presence of the axion,implying that inclusion of the matter source is crucial for the existence ofsuch solutions for $\omega=-1$. In the theories with $\omega \ne -1$, it ispossible to obtain complete regular bouncing solutions with a finite dilatonand curvature in both past and future asymptotics for the general dimension,$D$. We also discuss the case where dilatonic higher-order corrections areinvolved to the tree-level effective action and demonstrate that the presenceof axion/modulus fields and the matter source does not significantly affect thedynamics of the dilaton-driven inflation and the subsequent graceful exit.
