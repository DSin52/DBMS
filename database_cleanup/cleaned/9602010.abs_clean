We analyze $M$-theory compactified on $(K3\times S^1)/Z_2$ where the $Z_2$changes the sign of the three form gauge field, acts on $S^1$ as a paritytransformation and on K3 as an involution with eight fixed points preservingSU(2) holonomy. At a generic point in the moduli space the resulting theory hasas its low energy limit N=1 supergravity theory in six dimensions with eightvector, nine tensor and twenty hypermultiplets. The gauge symmetry can beenhanced (e.g. to $E_8$) at special points in the moduli space. At otherspecial points in the moduli space tensionless strings appear in the theory.
