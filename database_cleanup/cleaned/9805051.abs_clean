A wide class of Seiberg-Witten models constructed by M-theory techniques anddescribed by non-hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces are shown to possess anassociative algebra of holomorphic differentials. This is a first step towardsproving that also these models satisfy the Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlindeequation. In this way, similar results known for simpler Seiberg-Witten models(described by hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces and constructed without recourseto M-theory) are extended to certain non-hyperelliptic cases constructed inM-theory. Our analysis reveals a connection between the algebra of holomorphicdifferentials on the Riemann surface and the configuration of M-theory branesof the corresponding Seiberg-Witten model.
