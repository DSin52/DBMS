Recently interest in using generalized reductions to construct massivesupergravity theories has been revived in the context of M-theory andsuperstring theory. These compactifications produce mass parameters byintroducing a linear dependence on internal coordinates in various axionicfields. Here we point out that by extending the form of this simple ansatz, itis always possible to introduce the various mass parameters simultaneously.This suggests that the various ``distinct'' massive supergravities in theliterature should all be a part of a single massive theory.
