Title: The exceptional Jordan algebra and the matrix string

Authors: Lee Smolin

Comments: LaTex 15 pages, no figures

A new matrix model is described, based on the exceptional Jordan algebra. Theaction is cubic, as in matrix Chern-Simons theory. We describe acompactification that, we argue, reproduces, at the one loop level, anoctonionic compactification of the matrix string theory in which SO(8) isbroken to G2. There are 27 matrix degrees of freedom, which under Spin(8)transform as the vector, spinor and conjugate spinor, plus three singlets,which represent the two longitudinal coordinates plus an eleventh coordinate.Supersymmetry appears to be related to triality of the representations ofSpin(8).
