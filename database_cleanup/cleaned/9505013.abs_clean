A gauge invariant quantum field theory with a spacetime dependentChern-Simons coefficient is studied. Using a constraint formalism together withthe Schwinger action principle it is shown that non-zero gradients in thecoefficient induce magnetic-moment corrections to the Hall current andtransform vortex singularities into non-local objects. The fundamentalcommutator for the density fluctuations is obtained from the action principleand the Hamiltonian of the Chern-Simons field is shown to vanish only under therestricted class of variations which satisfy the gauge invariance constraint.
