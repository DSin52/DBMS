We study the Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory systematically in an effort togeneralize the Coleman-Hill result to the non-Abelian case. We show that, whilethe Chern-Simons coefficient is in general gauge dependent in a non-Abeliantheory, it takes on a physical meaning in the axial gauge. Using thenon-Abelian Ward identities as well as the analyticity of the amplitudes in themomentum variables, we show that, in the axial gauge, the Chern-Simonscoefficient does not receive any quantum correction beyond one loop. Thisallows us to deduce that the ratio ${4\pi m\over g^{2}}$ is unrenormalized, ina non-Abelian theory, beyond one loop in any infrared safe gauge. This is theappropriate generalization of the Coleman-Hill result to non-Abelian theories.Various other interesting properties of the theory are also discussed.
