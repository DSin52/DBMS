We present a topologically non-trivial generalization of gauged N=16supergravity on the coset E_8 / SO(16) in three-dimensions. This formulation isbased on a combination of BF-term and a Chern-Simons term for an SO(16) gaugefield A_\m{}^{I J}. The fact that an additional vector field B_\m{}^{I J} isphysical and propagating with couplings to \sigma-model fields makes our newgauging non-trivial and different from the conventional one. Even though thefield strength of the A_\m{}^{I J}-field vanishes on-shell, the action istopologically non-trivial due to non-vanishing \pi_3-homotopy. We also presentan additional modifications by an extra Chern-Simons term. As by-products, wegive also an application to N=9 supergravity coupled to a \sigma-model on thecoset F_4 / SO(9), and a new BF-Chern-Simons theory coupled to ^\forall Nextended supergravity.
