Most nonabelian gauge theories admit the existence of conserved and quantizedtopological charges as generalizations of the Dirac monopole. Theirinteractions are dictated by topology. In this paper, previous work in derivingclassical equations of motion for these charges is extended to quantizedparticles described by Dirac wave functions. The resulting equations showintriguing similarities to the Yang-Mills theory. Further, although the systemis not dual symmetric, its gauge symmetry is nevertheless doubled as in theabelian case from $G$ to $G \times G$, where the second $G$ has opposite parityto the first but is mediated instead by an antisymmetric second-rank tensorpotential.
