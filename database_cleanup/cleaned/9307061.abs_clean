In the present article we present exact solutions of the Dirac equation forelectric neutral particles with anomalous electric and magnetic moments. Usingthe algebraic method of separation of variables, the Dirac equation isseparated in cartesian, cylindrical and spherical coordinates, and exactsolutions are obtained in terms of special functions.
