We discuss $d=1, {\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric matrix models and exhibit theassociated $d=2$ collective field theory in the limit of dense eigenvalues.From this theory we construct, by the addition of several new fields, a $d=2$supersymmetric effective field theory, which reduces to the collective fieldtheory when the new fields are replaced with their vacuum expectation values.This effective theory is Poincare invariant and contains perturbative andnon-perturbative information about the associated superstrings. We exhibitinstanton solutions corresponding to the motion of single eigenvalues anddiscuss their possible role in supersymmetry breaking.
