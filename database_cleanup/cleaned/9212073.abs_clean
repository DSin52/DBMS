We consider a random surface representation of the three-dimensional Isingmodel.The model exhibit scaling behaviour and a new critical index $\k$ whichrelates $\g_{string}$ for the bosonic string to the exponent $\a$ of thespecific heat of the 3d Ising model is introduced. We try to determine $\k$ bynumerical simulations.
