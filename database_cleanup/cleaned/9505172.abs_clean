We discuss the definition of the average effective action in terms of theheat-kernel. As an example we examine a model describing a self-interactingscalar field, both in flat and curved background, and study the renormalizationgroup flow of some of the parameters characterizing its effective potential.Some implications of the running of these parameters for inflationary cosmologyare also briefly discussed.
