An off-shell formulation of two distinct tensor multiplets,a massive tensormultiplet and a tensor gauge multiplet, is presented in superconformal tensorcalculus in five-dimensional space-time. Both contain a rank 2 antisymmetrictensor field, but there is no gauge symmetry in the former, while it is a gaugefield in the latter. Both multiplets commonly have 4 bosonic and 4 fermionic{\em on-shell} modes, but the former consists of 16(boson)+16(fermion)component fields while the latter consists of 8(boson)+8(fermion) componentfields.
