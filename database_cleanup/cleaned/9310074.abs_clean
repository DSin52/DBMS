Representations of propagators by means of path integrals over velocities arediscussed both in nonrelativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics. It isshown that all the propagators can only be expressed through bosonic pathintegrals over velocities of space-time coordinates. In the representations theintegration over velocities is not restricted by any boundary conditions;matrices, which have to be inverted in course of doing Gaussian integrals, donot contain any derivatives in time, and spinor and isospinor structures of thepropagators are given explicitly. One can define universal Gaussian andquasi-Gaussian integrals over velocities and rules of handling them. Such atechnique allows one effectively calculate propagators in external fields.Thus, Klein-Gordon propagator is found in a constant homogeneouselectromagnetic field and its combination with a plane wave field.
