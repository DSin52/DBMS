We find a general class of pp-wave solutions of type IIB string theory suchthat the light cone gauge worldsheet lagrangian is that of an interactingmassive field theory. When the light cone Lagrangian has (2,2) supersymmetry wecan find backgrounds that lead to arbitrary superpotentials on the worldsheet.We consider situations with both flat and curved transverse spaces. We describein some detail the background giving rise to the N=2 sine Gordon theory on theworldsheet. Massive mirror symmetry relates it to the deformed $CP^1$ model (orsausage model) which seems to elude a purely supergravity target spaceinterpretation.
