We study the classical decay of unstable scalar solitons in noncommutativefield theory in 2+1 dimensions. This can, but does not have to, be viewed as atoy model for the decay of D-branes in string theory. In the infinite \thetalimit, in which the gradient term is absent, there are no propagating modes andthe soliton does not decay at all. If \theta is large, but finite, therotationally symmetric decay channel can be described as a highly excitednonlinear oscillator weakly coupled to a continuum of linear modes. This systemis closely akin to those studied in the context of discrete breathers. We herediagonalize the linear problem and compute the decay rate to first order usinga version of Fermi's Golden Rule, leaving a more rigorous treatment for futurework.
