We show that gravitational effects of global cosmic 3-branes can beresponsible for compactification from six to four space-time dimensions,naturally producing the observed hierarchy between electroweak andgravitational forces. The finite radius of the transverse dimensions followsfrom Einstein's equation, and is exponentially large compared with the scalesassociated with the 3-brane. The space-time ends on a mild naked singularity atthe boundary of the transverse dimensions; nevertheless unitary boundaryconditions render the singularity harmless.
