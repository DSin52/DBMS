We discuss stability of non-supersymmetric compactification of M-theory andstring theory of the form AdS * X, and their dual non-supersymmetricinteracting conformal field theories. We argue some of the difficulties incontrolling 1/N-corrections disappear in the cases that the large-N dualconformal field theory has no invariant marginal operators (and in some caseswith no exactly marginal operators only). We provide several examples of suchcompactifications of M-theory down to AdS4.
