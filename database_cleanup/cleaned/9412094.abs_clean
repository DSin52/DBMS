Certain criteria are demonstrated for a spatial derivation of a von Neumannalgebra to generate a one-parameter semigroup of endomorphisms of that algebra.These are then used to establish a converse to recent results of Borchers andof Wiesbrock on certain one-parameter semigroups of endomorphisms of vonNeumann algebras (specifically, Type III_1 factors) that appear as lightliketranslations in the theory of algebras of local observables.
