A generalisation of the non--perturbatively stable solutions of stringequations which respect the KdV flows, obtained recently for the $(2m-1,2)$conformal minimal models coupled to two--dimensional quantum gravity, ispresented for the $(p,q)$ models. These string equations are the most generalstring equations compatible with the $q$--th generalised KdV flows. Theyexhibit a close relationship with the bi-hamiltonian structure in thesehierarchies. The Ising model is studied as a particular example, for which areal non-singular numerical solution to the string susceptibility is presented.
