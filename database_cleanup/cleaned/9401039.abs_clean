Fermions on a cylinder coupled to gravity and gauge fields are examined bystudying the geometric action associated with the symmetries of such a system.The gauge coupling constant is shown to be constrained and the effect ofgravity on the masses is discussed. Furthermore, we introduce a newgravitational theory which couples to the fermions by promoting the coadjointvector of the diffeomorphism sector to a dynamical variable. This system,together with the gauge sector is shown to be equivalent to a one dimensionalsystem.
