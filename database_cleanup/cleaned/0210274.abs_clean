Title: The Static Gauge Potential with a Cutoff

Authors: Enrique Alvarez and Juan Jose Manjarin

Comments: 12 pages, 4 figures. to be published in Horizons in Physics Research,

Nova Science Publishers, IncThe static potential, corresponding to the interaction of two heavy sourcesis computed for $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang Mills in the strong 't Hooftcoupling regime by using the AdS/CFT conjecture and performing a computation ofa rectangular Wilson loop at a finite distance of the boundary.
