We present an unifying description of the graded $SL(p,q)$ KP-KdVhierarchies, including the Wronskian construction of their tau-functions aswell as the coefficients of the pertinent Lax operators, obtained viasuccessive applications of special Darboux-B\"{a}cklund transformations. Theemerging Darboux-B\"{a}cklund structure is identified as a constrainedgeneralized Toda lattice system relevant for the two-matrix string model. Also,the exact Wronskian solution for the two-matrix model partition function isfound.
