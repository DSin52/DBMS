We address the localization of a scalar field, whose bulk-mass M isconsidered in a wide range including the tachyonic region,on a three-brane. Thebrane with non-zero cosmological constant $\lambda$ is embedded in fivedimensional bulk space. We find in this case that the trapped scalar could havemass $m$ which has an upper bound and expressed as $m^2=m_0^2+\alpha M^2\leq\beta |\lambda|$ with the calculable numbers $m_0^2, \alpha, \beta$. We pointout that this result would be important to study the stability of the brane andcosmological problems based on the brane-world.
