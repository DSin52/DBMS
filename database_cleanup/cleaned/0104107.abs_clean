We consider the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian embedding of a first-order,massive spin-one, gauge non-invariant theory involving anti-symmetric tensorfield. We apply the BFV-BRST generalised canonical approach to convert themodel to a first class system and construct nil-potent BFV-BRST charge and anunitarising Hamiltonian. The canonical analysis of the St\"uckelbergformulation of this model is presented. We bring out the contrasting feature inthe constraint structure, specifically with respect to the reducibility aspect,of the Hamiltonian and the Lagrangian embedded model. We show that to obtainmanifestly covariant St\"uckelberg Lagrangian from the BFV embeddedHamiltonian, phase space has to be further enlarged and show how the reduciblegauge structure emerges in the embedded model.
