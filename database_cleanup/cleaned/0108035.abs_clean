Assuming the completeness condition for boundaries we derive trace formulasfor the annulus coefficients in 2-dimensional conformal field theory. We alsoderive polynomial equations that relate the annulus, Moebius and Klein bottlecoefficients, and conjecture an annulus trace formula that is sensitive to theorientation of the boundaries.
