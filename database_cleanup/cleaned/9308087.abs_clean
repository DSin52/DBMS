Through the analyses of volume-forms in differentiable manifolds, it is shownthat the usual way of defining minimal action principles for field theory oncurved space-times is not appropriate on non-riemannian manifolds. Analternative approach, based in a new volume-form, is proposed and confrontedwith the standard one.The new volume element is explicitly used in the study of Einstein-Cartantheory of gravity and its relation to string theory, in connection with somerecent results on the subject.
