The dynamics of the 3 dimensional perfect fluid is equivalent to the motionof vortex filaments or "strings". We study the action principle and find thatit is described by the Hopf term of the nonlinear sigma model. The Poissonbracket structure is described by the loop algebra, for example, the Virasoroalgebra or the analogue of O(3) current algebra. As a string theory, it isquite different from the standard Nambu-Goto string in its coupling to theextrinsic geometry. We also analyze briefly the two dimsensional case and givesome emphasis on the $w_{1+\infty}$ structure.
