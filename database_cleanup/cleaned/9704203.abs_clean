Title: Nonlinear realizations of the (super)diffeomorphism groups, geometrical

objects and integral invariants in the superspaceComments: LaTeX

It is shown that vielbeins and connections of any (super)space are naturallydescribed in terms of nonlinear realizations of infinite - dimensionaldiffeomorphism groups of the corresponding (super)space. The method ofconstruction of integral invariants from the invariant Cartan's differential$\Omega$ - forms is generalized to the case of superspace.
