We apply the method of angular quantization to calculation of the wavefunction renormali- zation constants in $D_{l}^{(1)}$ affine Toda quantum fieldtheories. A general formula for the wave function renormalization constants inADE Toda field theories is proposed. We also calculate all one-particle formfactors and some of the two-particle form factors of an exponential field.
