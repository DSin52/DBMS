The Lagrangian action for the D4-D5-E6 model of hep-th/9306011 has 8-dimspacetime V8 of the vector representation of Spin(0,8); 8-dim fermion fieldsS8+ = S8- of the half-spinor reps of Spin(0,8); and 28 gauge boson fields ofthe bivector adjoint rep of Spin(0,8). In this paper, the structure of thepositive definite Clifford algebra Cl(0,8) of Spin(0,8), and the trialityautomorphism V8 = S8+ = S8-, are used to reduce the spacetime to 4 dimensionsand thereby change the gauge group from Spin(0,8) to the realisticSU(3)xSU(2)xU(1), Higgs, and Gravity. The effect of dimensional reduction onfermions, to introduce 3 generations, has been described in hep-ph/9301210. Theglobal geometry of manifolds V8 = S8+ = S8- = RP1xS7, the effects ofdimensional reduction on them, and the calculation of force strength constants,has been described in hep-th/9302030.
