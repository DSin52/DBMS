Authors: Massimo Bianchi, Michael B. Green and Stefano Kovacs

Comments: 15 pages, JHEP macros, Strings 2001 talk

The one-instanton contribution to a circular BPS Wilson loop in N=4 SU(2)Yang--Mills theory is evaluated in semiclassical approximation. This articleamplifies part of a talk given by MBG at the Strings 2001 conference, Mumbai,India (January 5-10, 2001). The results are preliminary and a more completeexposition will be contained in a forthcoming paper.
