Tex, KCL-TH-93-9By replacing two of the bosonic scalar superfields of the N=2 string withfermionic scalar superfields (which shifts $d_{critical}$ from (2,2) to (9,1)),a quadratic action for the ten-dimensional Green-Schwarz superstring isobtained. Using the usual N=2 super-Virasoro ghosts, one can construct a BRSToperator, picture-changing operators, and covariant vertex operators for theGreen-Schwarz superstring. Superstring scattering amplitudes with an arbitrarynumber of loops and external massless states are then calculated by evaluatingcorrelation functions of these vertex operators on N=2 super-Riemann surfaces,and integrating over the N=2 super-moduli. These multiloop superstringamplitudes have been proven to be SO(9,1) super-Poincar\'e invariant (byconstructing the super-Poincar\'e generators and writing the amplitudes inmanifest SO(9,1) notation), unitary (by showing agreement with amplitudesobtained using the light-cone gauge Green-Schwarz formalism), and finite (byexplicitly checking for divergences in the amplitudes when the Riemann surfacedegenerates). There is no multiloop ambiguity in these Green-Schwarz scatteringamplitudes since spacetime-supersymmetry is manifest (there is no sum over spinstructures), and therefore the moduli space can be compactified.
