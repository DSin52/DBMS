A recent result concerning interacting theories of self-dual tensor gaugefields in six dimensions is generalized to include coupling to gravity. Theformalism makes five of the six general coordinate invariances manifest,whereas the sixth one requires a non-trivial analysis. The result should behelpful in formulating the world-volume action of the M theory five-brane.
