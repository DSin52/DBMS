Title: Introduction to spherical field theory

Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B439 (1998) 85-94

Spherical field theory is a new non-perturbative method for studying quantumfield theories. It uses the spherical partial wave expansion to reduce ageneral d-dimensional Euclidean field theory into a set of coupledone-dimensional systems. The coupled one-dimensional systems are then convertedto partial differential equations and solved numerically. We demonstrate themethods of spherical field theory by analyzing Euclidean phi^4 theory in twodimensions.
