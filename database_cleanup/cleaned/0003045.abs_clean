with hep-th/0002072In the framework of a five-dimensional three-brane model with quasi-localizedgravitons we evaluate metric perturbations induced on the positive tensionbrane by matter residing thereon. We find that at intermediate distances, theeffective four-dimensional theory coincides, up to small corrections, withGeneral Relativity. This is in accord with Csaki, Erlich and Hollowood and incontrast to Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati. We show, however, that at ultra-largedistances this effective four-dimensional theory becomes dramatically
