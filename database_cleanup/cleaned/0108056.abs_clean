We discuss the semiclassical instability of the Randall-Sundrum brane-worldmodel against a creation of a kind of Kaluza-Klein bubble. An exampledescribing such a bubble space-time is constructed from the five-dimensionalAdS-Schwarzschild metric. The induced geometry of the brane looks like theEinstein-Rosen bridge, which connects the positive and the negative tensionbranes. The bubble rapidly expands and there also form a trapped region aroundit.
