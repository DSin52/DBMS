Using a loop formulation approach of QCD$_2$, we study the potential betweentwo heavy quarks in the presence of adjoint scalar fields, and demonstrate how't Hooft's planar rule is manifested in this formulation. Based on somephysical assumptions, we argue that large adjoint loops ``confined'' inside anexternal fundamental one give a Casimir type contribution to the potentialenergy, while the small loops only renormalize the string tension. We alsoextend the results to the case of massive adjoint fields.
