Authors: Washington Taylor (MIT)

Comments: 80 pages, 4 figures, LaTeX; Lectures for NATO school "Quantum

These lecture notes give a pedagogical and (mostly) self-contained review ofsome basic aspects of the Matrix model of M-theory. The derivations of themodel as a regularized supermembrane theory and as the discrete light-conequantization of M-theory are presented. The construction of M-theory objectsfrom matrices is described, and gravitational interactions between theseobjects are derived using Yang-Mills perturbation theory. Generalizations ofthe model to compact and curved space-times are discussed, and the currentstatus of the theory is reviewed.
