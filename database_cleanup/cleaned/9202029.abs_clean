Title: Spin Singlet Quantum Hall Effect and Nonabelian Landau-Ginzburg Theory

Authors: Alexander Balatsky (Los Alamos National Laboratory,Theoretical

Division and Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, Moscow, USSR)In this paper we present a theory of Singlet Quantum Hall Effect (SQHE). Weshow that the Halperin-Haldane SQHE wave function can be written in the form ofa product of a wave function for charged semions in a magnetic field and a wavefunction for the Chiral Spin Liquid of neutral spin-$\12$ semions. We introducefield-theoretic model in which the electron operators are factorized in termsof charged spinless semions (holons) and neutral spin-$\12$ semions (spinons).Broken time reversal symmetry and short ranged spin correlations lead to$SU(2)_{k=1}$ Chern-Simons term in Landau-Ginzburg action for SQHE phase. Weconstruct appropriate coherent states for SQHE phase and show the existence of$SU(2)$ valued gauge potential. This potential appears as a result of ``spinrigidity" of the ground state against any displacements of nodes of wavefunction from positions of the particles and reflects the nontrivial monodromyin the presence of these displacements.
