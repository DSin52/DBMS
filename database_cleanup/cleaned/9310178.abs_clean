We study $E_8 \times E_8$-heterotic string on asymmetric orbifolds associatedwith semi-simple simply-laced Lie algebras. Using the fact that $E_6$-modelallows different twists, we present a new N=1 space-time supersymmetric modelwhose supercurrent appears from twisted sectors but not untwisted sector.
