We consider the analog in one spatial dimension of the Bose-Fermitransmutation for planar systems. A quantum mechanical system of a spin 1/2particle coupled to an abelian gauge field, which is classically invariantunder gauge transformations and charge conjugation is studied. It is found thatunless the flux enclosed by the particle orbits is quantized, and the spintakes a value $n+ 1/2$, at least one of the two symmetries would be anomalous.Thus, charge conjugation invariance and the existence of abelian instantonssimultaneously force the particles to be either bosons or fermions, but notanyons.
