We consider the Cartan subalgebra of any very extended algebra G+++ where Gis a simple Lie algebra and let the parameters be space-time fields. These areidentified with diagonal metrics and dilatons. Using the properties of thealgebra, we find that for all triple extensions G+++ of simple Lie algebrasthere are theories of gravity and matter, which admit classical solutionscarrying representations of the Weyl group of G+++. We also identify the T andS-dualities of superstrings and of the bosonic string with Weyl reflections andouter automorphisms of well-chosen very extended algebras and we exhibitspecific features of the triple extensions. We take these results as indicationthat very extended algebras underlie symmetries of any consistent theory ofgravity and matter, and might encode basic information for the construction ofsuch theory.
