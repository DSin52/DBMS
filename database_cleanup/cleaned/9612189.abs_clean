The theory of free relativistic fields is shown to arise in a unified mannerfrom higher-order, configuration-space, irreducible representations of thePoincar\'e group. A de Sitter subalgebra, in the massive case, and a Poincar\'esubalgebra, in the massless case, of the enveloping algebra of the Poincar\'egroup are the suitable higher-order polarizations. In particular, a simplegroup-theoretic derivation of the Dirac equation is given.
