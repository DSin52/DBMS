We investigate the effects of thermal fluctuations on the spontaneousmagnetic condensate in three dimensional QED coupled with P-odd Dirac fermions.Our results show that the phenomenon of the spontaneous generation of theconstant background magnetic field survives to the thermal corrections even atinfinite temperature. We also study the thermal corrections to the fermioniccondensate in presence of the magnetic field.
