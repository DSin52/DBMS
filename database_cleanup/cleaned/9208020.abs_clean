We study the lattice gauge model proposed recently by Kazakov and Migdal forinducing QCD. We discuss an extra local Z_N which is a symmetry of the modeland propose of how to construct observables. We discuss the role of the large-Nphase transition which should occur before the one associated with thecontinuum limit in order that the model describes continuum QCD. We formulatethe mean field approach to study the large-N phase transition for an arbitrarypotential and show that no first order phase transition occurs for thequadratic potential.
