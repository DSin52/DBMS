addedWe study relations between different kinds of non-commutative spheres whichhave appeared in the context of ADS/CFT correspondences recently, emphasizingthe connections between spaces that have manifest quantum group symmetry andspaces that have manifest classical symmetry. In particular we consider thequotient $SU_q(2)/U(1)$ at roots of unity, and find its relations with thefuzzy sphere with manifest classical SU(2) symmetry. Deformation maps betweenclassical and quantum symmetry, the $U_q(SU(2))$ module structure of quantumspheres and the structure of indecomposable representations of $U_q(SU(2))$ atroots of unity conspire in an interesting way to allow the relation betweenmanifestly $U_q(SU(2)$ symmetric spheres and manifestly U(SU(2)) symmetricspheres. The relation suggests that a subset of field theory actions on theq-sphere are equivalent to actions on the fuzzy sphere. The results here arecompatible with the proposal that quantum spheres at roots of unity appear aseffective geometries which account for finite N effects in the ADS/CFTcorrespondence.
