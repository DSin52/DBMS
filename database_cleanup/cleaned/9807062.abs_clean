We construct a bi-linear form on the periods of Calabi-Yau spaces. These areused to obtain the prepotentials around conifold singularities in type-IIstrings compactified on Calabi-Yau space. The explicit construction of thebi-linear forms is achieved for the one-moduli models as well as two modulimodels with K3-fibrations where the enhanced gauge symmetry is known to beobserved at conifold locus. We also show how these bi-linear forms are relatedwith the existence of flat coordinates. We list the resulting prepotentials intwo moduli models around the conifold locus, which contains alpha' correctionsof 4-D N=2 SUSY SU(2) Yang-Mills theory as the stringy effect.
