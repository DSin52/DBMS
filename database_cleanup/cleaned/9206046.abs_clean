We show that a class of models for particles with internal degrees of freedomare integrable. These systems are basically generalizations of the models ofCalogero and Sutherland. The proofs of integrability are based on a recentlydeveloped exchange operator formalism. We calculate the wave-functions for theCalogero-like models and find the ground-state wave-function for aCalogero-like model in a position dependent magnetic field. This last modelmight have some relevance for matrix models of open strings.
