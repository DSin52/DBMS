We consider solutions to low energy string theory which have a horizon and aspacelike symmetry. Each of these solutions has a geometrically different dualdescription. We show that the dual solution has a horizon with exactly the sameHawking temperature (surface gravity) and entropy (area) as the originalsolution.
