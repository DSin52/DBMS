We consider Dirac's free electron theory on the first quantized level. Wedecompose its canonical spin current \'a la Gordon and find a conserved``Gordon spin'' current which turns out to be equivalent to theHilgevoord-Wouthuysen spin. We can conclude therefrom that the Gordon-typedecomposition mentioned above corresponds to a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformationwhich transforms the Dirac wave function from the conventional Dirac-Pauli tothe Newton-Wigner representation.
