Using the method of Green's functions within a Bethe-Salpeter frameworkcharacterized by a pairwise qq interaction with a Lorentz-covariant 3D supportto its kernel, the 4D BS wave function for a system of 3 identical relativisticspinless quarks is reconstructed from the corresponding 3D form which satisfiesa fully connected 3D BSE. This result is a 3-body generalization of a similar2-body result found earlier under identical conditions of a 3D support to thecorresponding qq-bar BS kernel under Covariant Instaneity (CIA for short). (Thegeneralization from spinless to fermion quarks is straightforward).To set the CIA with 3D BS kernel support ansatz in the context ofcontemporary approaches to the qqq baryon problem, a model scalar 4D qqq BSEwith pairwise contact interactions to simulate the NJL-Faddeev equations isworked out fully, and a comparison of both vertex functions shows that the CIAvertex reduces exactly to the NJL form in the limit of zero spatial range. Thisconsistency check on the CIA vertex function is part of a fuller accounting forits mathematical structure whose physical motivation is traceable to the roleof `spectroscopy' as an integral part of the dynamics.
