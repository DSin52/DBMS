We analyze the possible soft breaking of $N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Millstheory with and without matter flavour preserving the analyticity properties ofthe Seiberg-Witten solution. We present the formalism for an arbitrary gaugegroup and obtain an exact expression for the effective potential. We describein detail the onset of the confinement description and the vacuum structure forthe pure $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills case and also some general features in the $SU(N)$case. A general mass formula is obtained, as well as explicit results for themass spectrum in the $SU(2)$ case.
