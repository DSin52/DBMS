We present all NSR superstring and super-D-string actions invariant under aset of prescribed gauge transformations, and characterize completely theirglobal symmetries. In particular we obtain locally supersymmetric Born-Infeldactions on general backgrounds in a formulation with extra target spacedimensions. The nontrivial global symmetries of the superstring actionscorrespond to isometries of the background, whereas super-D-string actions canhave additional symmetries acting nontrivially also on the coordinates of theextra dimensions.
