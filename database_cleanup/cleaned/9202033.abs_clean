The phase space of the Wess-Zumino-Witten model on a circle with target spacea compact, connected, semisimple Lie group $G$ is defined and the correspondingsymplectic form is given. We present a careful derivation of the Poissonbrackets of the Wess-Zumino-Witten model. We also study the canonical structureof the supersymmetric and the gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten models.
