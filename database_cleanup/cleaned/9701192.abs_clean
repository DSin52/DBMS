Framework for constructing Fock spaces associated either with certainsolutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation or with infinite dimensionalHecke algebra is presented. For the former case, the quantum deformedoscillator algebra associated with the solution of the quantum Yang-Baxterequation is found.
