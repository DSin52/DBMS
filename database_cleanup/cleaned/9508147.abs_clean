Title: A Non-Associative Deformation of Yang-Mills Gauge Theory

Comments: 18 pages, RevTeX, also uses aps.sty

An ansatz is presented for a possible non-associative deformation of thestandard Yang-Mills type gauge theories. An explicit algebraic structure forthe deformed gauge symmetry is put forward and the resulting gauge theorydeveloped. The non-associative deformation is constructed in such a way that anapparently associative Lie algebraic structure is retained modulo a closureproblem for the generators. It is this failure to close which leads to newphysics in the model as manifest in the gauge field kinetic term in theresulting Lagrangian. A possible connection between this model and quantumgroup gauge theories is also investigated.
