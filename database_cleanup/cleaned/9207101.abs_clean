We quantize $sl_n$ Toda field theories in a periodic lattice. We find thequantum exchange algebra in the diagonal monodromy (Bloch wave) basis in thecase of the defining representation. In the $sl_3$ case we extend the analysisalso to the second fundamental representation. We clarify, in particular, therelation of Jimbo and Rosso's quantum $R$ matrix with the quantum $R$ matrix inthe Bloch wave basis.
