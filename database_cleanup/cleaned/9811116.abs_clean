Title: D-branes and the Non-commutative Structure of Quantum Spacetime

Authors: Nick E. Mavromatos and Richard J. Szabo

Comments: 20 pages LaTeX, 3 eps figures, uses epsf.sty; Based on talks given by

R.J.S. at SUSY'98, Oxford, England, July 11-17, 1998, and by N.E.M. at the6th Hellenic School and Workshop on Elementary Particle Physics, TMR project"Physics Beyond the Standard Model", Corfu, Greece, September 15-18, 1998A worldsheet approach to the study of non-abelian D-particle dynamics ispresented based on viewing matrix-valued D-brane coordinate fields as couplingconstants of a deformed sigma-model which defines a logarithmic conformal fieldtheory. The short-distance structure of spacetime is shown to be naturallycaptured by the Zamolodchikov metric on the corresponding moduli space whichencodes the geometry of the string interactions between D-particles. Spacetimequantization is induced directly by the string genus expansion and leads to newforms of uncertainty relations which imply that general relativity at veryshort-distance scales is intrinsically described by a non-commutative geometry.The indeterminancies exhibit decoherence effects suggesting the naturalincorporation of quantum gravity by short-distance D-particle probes. Somepotential experimental tests are briefly described.
