on Appl. of Anal. and Geom. Meth. to Nonlinear Diff. Eqs., Exeter, July 1992We study a quantum Yang-Baxter structure associated with non-ultralocallattice models. We discuss the canonical structure of a class of integrablequantum mappings, i.e. canonical transformations preserving the basiccommutation relations. As a particular class of solutions we present twoexamples of quantum mappings associated with the lattice analogues of the KdVand MKdV equations, together with their exact quantum invariants. plain LaTeX,equations.sty appended
