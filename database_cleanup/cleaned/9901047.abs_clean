The theory of measured foliations which is discussed in PartI(hep-th/9901040)in connection with train tracks and meanders is shown to be related to thetheory of Jenkins-Strebel quadratic differentials by Hubbard and Masur (ActaMath.Vol.142,221(1979)). Use of quadratic differentials not only provides anadequate description of defects and textures in liquid crystals but also isideally suited for study of 2+1 classical gravity which was initiated in theseminal paper by Deser, Jackiw and 't Hooft (Ann.Phys.Vol.152,220(1984)). Inthis paper not only their results are reproduced but, in addition, many newresults are obtained. In particular, using the results of Rivin(Ann.Math.Vol.139,553(1994)) the restriction on the total mass of the 2+1Universe is removed. It is shown that the masses can have only discrete valuesand, moreover, the theoretically obtained sum rules forbid the existence ofsome of these values. The dynamics of 2+1 gravity which is associated with thedynamics of train tracks is being reinterpreted in terms of the emerginghyperbolic 3-manifolds. The existence of knots and links associated withcomplements of these 3-manifolds is highly nontrivial and requires carefulproofs. The paper provides a concise introduction into this topic. A briefdiscussion of connections with related physical problems, e.g.string theory,classical and quantum billiards, dynamics of fracture, protein folding, etc. isalso provided.
