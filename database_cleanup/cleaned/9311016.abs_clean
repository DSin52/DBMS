Recently, we proposed a new front-form quantization which treated both the$x^{+}$ and the $x^{-}$ coordinates as front-form 'times.' This quantizationwas found to preserve parity explicitly. In this paper we extend thisconstruction to fermion fields in the context of the Yukawa theory. We quantizethis theory using a method proposed originally by Faddeev and Jackiw . We findthat $P^-$ {\it and} $P^+$ become dynamical and that the theory is manifestlyinvariant under parity.
