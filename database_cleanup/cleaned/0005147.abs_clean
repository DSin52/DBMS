The low-energy effective theory of the IIB matrix model developed by H. Aokiet al. is written down explicitly in terms of bosonic variables only. Theeffective theory is then studied by Monte Carlo simulations in order toinvestigate the possibility of a spontaneous breakdown of Lorentz invariance.The imaginary part of the effective action, which causes the so-called signproblem in the simulation, is dropped by hand. The extent of the eigenvaluedistribution of the bosonic matrices shows a power-law large N behavior,consistent with a simple branched-polymer prediction. We observe, however, thatthe eigenvalue distribution becomes more and more isotropic in theten-dimensional space-time as we increase N. This suggests that if thespontaneous breakdown of Lorentz invariance really occurs in the IIB matrixmodel, a crucial role must be played by the imaginary part of the effectiveaction.
