We treat the horizons of charged, dilaton black extended objects as quantummechanical objects. We show that the S matrix for such an object can be writtenin terms of a p-brane-like action. The requirements of unitarity of the Smatrix and positivity of the p-brane tension equivalent severely restrict thenumber of space-time dimensions and the allowed values of the dilaton parametera. Generally, black objects transform at the extremal limit into p-branes.
