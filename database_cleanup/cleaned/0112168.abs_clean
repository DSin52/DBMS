Wigner's irreducible positive energy representations of the Poincare groupare often used to give additional justifications for the Lagrangianquantization formalism of standard QFT. Here we study another more recentaspect. We explain in this paper modular concepts by which we are able toconstruct the local operator algebras for all standard positive energyrepresentations directly i.e. without going through field coordinatizations. Inthis way the artificial emphasis on Lagrangian field coordinates is avoidedfrom the very beginning. These new concepts allow to treat also those cases of``exceptional'' Wigner representations associated with anyons and the famousWigner ``spin tower''which have remained inaccessible to Lagrangianquantization. Together with the d=1+1 factorizing models (whose modularconstruction has been studied previously), they form an interesting family oftheories with a rich vacuum-polarization structure (but no on shell realparticle creation) to which the modular methods can be applied for theirexplicit construction. We explain and illustrate the algebraic strategy of thisconstruction. We also comment on possibilities of formulating the Wigner theoryin a setting of a noncommutative spacetime substrate. This is potentiallyinteresting in connection with recent unitarity- and Lorentz invariance-preserving results of the special nonlocality caused by this kind ofnoncommutativity.
