In this paper we explore some of the features of large N supersymmetric andnonsupersymmetric gauge theories using Maldacena's duality conjectures. Weshall show that the resulting strong coupling behavior of the gauge theories isconsistent with our qualitative expectations of these theories. Some of theseconsistency checks are highly nontrivial and give additional evidence for thevalidity of the proposed dualities.
