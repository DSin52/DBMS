Title: Heterotic Yukawa couplings and continuous Wilson lines

Authors: Tatsuo Kobayashi and Oleg Lebedev

Comments: 10 pages, latex, no figure

Realistic heterotic string models require the presence of the Wilson lines.We study the effect of continuous Wilson lines on the heterotic Yukawacouplings and find that the presence of continuous Wilson lines affects themagnitude of the twisted Yukawa couplings resulting in their strongerhierarchy.
