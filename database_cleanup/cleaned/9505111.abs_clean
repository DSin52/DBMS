The long-time large-distance behaviour of free decaying two dimensionalturbulence is studied. Stochastic solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation areexplicitly shown to follow renormalisation group trajectories.It is proven that solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation asymptoticallyconverge to fixed points which are conformal field theories. A particular fixedpoint is given by the free Gaussian field with a charge at infinity. The streamfunction is identified with a vertex operator. It happens that this solutionalso admits constant $n$-enstrophy fluxes in the asymptotic regime, thereforefulfilling all requirements to represent an asymptotic state of two-dimensionalturbulence.The renormalisation basin of attraction of this fixed point consists of acharged Coulomb gas. This Coulomb gas gives an effective description ofturbulence.
