Authors: Monika Marquart, Daniel Waldram

Comments: 18 pages, 4 figures

In this note, we use results of Aspinwall and Morrison to discuss theF-theory duals of certain $T^4/\bbZ_N$ orbifold compactifications ofHo\v{r}ava--Witten theory. In the M-theory limit an interesting set of rules,based on anomaly cancellation, has been developed for what gauge and mattermultiplets must be present on the various orbifold fixed planes. Here we showhow several aspects of these rules can be understood directly from F-theory.
