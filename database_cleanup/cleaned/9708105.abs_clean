Title: A unique theory of all forces

Comments: 11 pages, Latex. Talk given at the Conference `Beyond the standard

model', V, Balholm, Norway, May 1997In discussing the construction of a consistent theory of quantum gravityunified with the gauge interactions we are naturally led to a string theory. Wereview its properties and the five consistent supersymmetric string theories inten dimensions. We finally discuss the evidence that these theories areactually special limits of a unique 11-dimensional theory, called M-theory, anda recent conjecture for its explicit formulation as a supersymmetric Matrixtheory.
