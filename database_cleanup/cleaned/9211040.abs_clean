We show that almost all string theories, including the bosonic string, thesuperstring and $W$-string theories, possess a twisted N=2 superconformalsymmetry. This enables us to establish a connection between topological gravityand the field theoretical description of matter coupled to gravity. We alsoshow how the \brs operators of the $W_n$-string can be obtained by hamiltonianreduction of $SL(n|n-1)$. The tachyonic and ground ring states of $W$-stringsare described in the light of the N=2 superconformal structure, and the groundring generators for the non-critical $W_3$-string are explicitly constructed.The relationship to $G/G$ models and quantum integrable systems is also brieflydescribed.
