We calculate the number spectrum of particles radiated during a scatteringinto a heat bath using the thermal largest-time equation and theDyson-Schwinger equation. We show how one can systematically calculate{d<N(\omega)>}/{d\omega} to any order using modified real timefinite-temperature diagrams. Our approach is demonstrated on a simple modelwhere two scalar particles scatter, within a photon-electron heat bath, into apair of charged particles and it is shown how to calculate the resultingchanges in the number spectra of the photons and electrons.
