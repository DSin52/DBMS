We study the canonical quantization of the induced 2d-gravity and the puregravity CGHS-model on a closed spatial section. The Wheeler-DeWitt equationsare solved in (spatially homogeneous) choices of the internal time variable andthe space of solutions is properly truncated to provide the physical Hilbertspace. We establish the quantum equivalence of both models and relate theresults with the covariant phase-space quantization. We also discuss therelation between the quantum wavefunctions and the classical space-timesolutions and propose the wave function representing the ground state.
