We discuss the explicit formulation of the transcendental constraintsdefining spectral curves of SU(2) BPS monopoles in the twistor approach ofHitchin, following Ercolani and Sinha. We obtain an improved version of theErcolani-Sinha constraints, and show that the Corrigan-Goddard conditions forconstructing monopoles of arbitrary charge can be regarded as a special case ofthese. As an application, we study the spectral curve of the tetrahedrallysymmetric 3-monopole, an example where the Corrigan-Goddard conditions need tobe modified. A particular 1-cycle on the spectral curve plays an important rolein our analysis.
