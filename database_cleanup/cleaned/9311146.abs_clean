The conformal symmetry in the Liouville theory is analysed by using theHamiltonian light--front formalism. The boundary conditions of dynamicalvariables are seen to involve an arbitrary function of time, so that thestandard methods for studying gauge symmetries do not work. We develop ageneral method for constructing the gauge generators, which enables aconsistent treatment of the boundary conditions present in the case of theconformal symmetry.
