We prove in two different ways that brane dynamics gives rise to allH-monopoles predicted by S-duality of N=4, 4-dimensional superstringcompactifications. One method uses heterotic-type II duality and the self-dual3-brane dynamics, the other uses the 5-brane description of small instantons inSO(32) superstrings.
