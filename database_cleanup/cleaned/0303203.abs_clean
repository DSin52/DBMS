We derive the low energy effective action for the dilatonic braneworld. Inthe case of the single-brane model, we find the effective theory is describedby the Einstein-scalar theory coupled to the dark radiation. Remarkably, thedark radiation is not conserved in general due to a coupling to the bulk scalarfield. The effective action incorporating Kaluza-Klein (KK) corrections isobtained and the role of the AdS/CFT correspondence in the dilatonic braneworldis revealed. In particular, it is shown that CFT matter would not be confinedto the braneworld in the presence of the bulk scalar field. The relationbetween our analysis and the geometrical projection method is also clarified.In the case of the two-brane model, the effective theory reduces to ascalar-tensor theory with a non-trivial coupling between the radion and thebulk scalar field.
