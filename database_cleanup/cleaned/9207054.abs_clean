Gott spacetime has closed timelike curves, but no locally anomalousstress-energy. A complete orthonormal set of eigenfunctions of the waveoperator is found in the special case of a spacetime in which the total deficitangle is $2\pi$. A scalar quantum field theory is constructed using theseeigenfunctions. The resultant interacting quantum field theory is not unitarybecause the field operators can create real, on-shell, particles in the acausalregion. These particles propagate for finite proper time accumulating anarbitrary phase before being annihilated at the same spacetime point as that atwhich they were created. As a result, the effective potential within theacausal region is complex, and probability is not conserved. The stress tensorof the scalar field is evaluated in the neighborhood of the Cauchy horizon; inthe case of a sufficiently small Compton wavelength of the field, the stresstensor is regular and cannot prevent the formation of the Cauchy horizon.
