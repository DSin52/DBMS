Title: Application of Conformal Gauge Theories Derived from Field-String

DualityComments: 18 pages LaTeX. Talk at BEYOND 99, June 6-12, 1999 at Castle

Ringberg, Tegernsee, GermanyIn this article I first give an abbreviated history of string theory and thendescribe the recently-conjectured field-string duality. This suggests a classof nonsupersymmetric gauge theories which are conformal (CGT) to leading orderof 1/N and some of which may be conformal for finite N. These models are veryrigid since the gauge group representations of not only the chiral fermions butalso the Higgs scalars are prescribed by the construction. If the standardmodel becomes conformal at TeV scales the GUT hierarchy is nullified, andmodel-building on this basis is an interesting direction. Some comments areadded about the dual relationship to gravity which is absent in the CGTdescription.
