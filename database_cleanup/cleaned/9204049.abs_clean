The ground ring structure of 1+1 dimensional string theory leads to aninfinite set of non linear recursion relations among the `bulk' scatteringamplitudes of open and closed tachyons on the disk, which fix them uniquely.The relations are generated by the action of the ring on the tachyon modules;associativity of this action determines all structure constants. This algebraicstructure may allow one to relate the continuum picture to a matrix model.
