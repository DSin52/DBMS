We study M theory compactifications on manifolds of $G_2$-holonomy with gaugeand matter fields supported at singularities. We show that, under certaintopological conditions, the combination of background $G$-flux and backgroundfields at the singularities induces a potential for the moduli with an isolatedminimum. The theory in the minimum is supersymmetric and has a negativecosmological constant in the simplest case. In a more realistic scenario, wefind that the fundamental scale is around 10 Tev and the heirarchy between thefour dimensional Planck and electroweak scales may be explained by the value ofa topological invariant. Hyperbolic three-manifolds enter the discussion in aninteresting way.
