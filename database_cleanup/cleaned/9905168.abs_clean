SystemsDiscrete analogs of the Darboux-Egoroff metrics are considered. It is shownthat the corresponding lattices in the Euclidean space are described bydiscrete analogs of the Lame equations. It is proved that up to a gaugetransformation these equations are necessary and sufficient for discreteanalogs of rotation coefficients to exist. Explicit examples of theDarboux-Egoroff lattices are constructed by means of algebro-geometric methods.
