It is shown that, for any K\"ahler manifold, there exist parametrizationssuch that the metric takes a block-form identical to the light-cone metricintroduced by Polyakov for two-dimensional gravity. Besides its possiblerelevence for various aspects of K\"ahlerian geometry, this fact allows us tochange gauge in W gravities, and explicitly go from the conformal (Toda) gaugeto the light-cone gauge using the W-geometry we proposed earlier (this will bediscussed in detail in a forthcoming article).
