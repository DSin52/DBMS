The low energy effective theory for the Randall-Sundrum two brane system isinvestigated with an emphasis on the role of the non-linear radion in the braneworld. The equations of motion in the bulk is solved using a low energyexpansion method. This allows us, through the junction conditions, to deducethe effective equations of motion for the gravity on the brane. It is shownthat the gravity on the brane world is described by a quasi-scalar-tensortheory with a specific coupling function omega(Psi) = 3 Psi / 2(1-Psi) on thepositive tension brane and omega(Phi) = -3 Phi / 2(1+Phi) on the negativetension brane, where Psi and Phi are non-linear realizations of the radion onthe positive and negative tension branes, respectively. In contrast to theusual scalar-tensor gravity, the quasi-scalar-tensor gravity couples with twokinds of matter, namely, the matters on both positive and negative tensionbranes, with different effective gravitational coupling constants. Inparticular, the radion disguised as the scalar fields Psi and Phi couples withthe sum of the traces of the energy momentum tensor on both branes. In thecourse of the derivation, it has been revealed that the radion plays anessential role to convert the non-local Einstein gravity with the generalizeddark radiation to the local quasi-scalar-tensor gravity. For completeness, wealso derive the effective action for our theory by substituting the bulksolution into the original action. It is also shown that thequasi-scalar-tensor gravity works as holograms at the low energy in the sensethat the bulk geometry can be reconstructed from the solution of thequasi-scalar-tensor gravity.
