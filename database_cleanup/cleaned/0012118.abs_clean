We propose CFT descriptions of the D1/D5 system in a class of freely actingZ_2 orbifolds/orientifolds of type IIB theory, with sixteen unbrokensupercharges. The CFTs describing D1/D5 systems involve N=(4,4) or N=(4,0)sigma models on $(R^3\times S^1\times T^4\times (T^4)^N/S_N)/Z_2$, where theaction of Z_2 is diagonal and its precise nature depends on the model. We alsodiscuss D1(D5)-brane states carrying non-trivial Kaluza-Klein charges. Theresulting multiplicities for two-charge bound states are shown to agree withthe predictions of U-duality. We raise a puzzle concerning the multiplicitiesof three-charge systems, which is generically present in all vacuumconfigurations with sixteen unbroken supercharges studied so far, including theby U-duality are apparently in contradiction with any CFT interpretation. Weargue that the presence of RR backgrounds appearing in the symmetric productCFT may provide a resolution of this puzzle.
