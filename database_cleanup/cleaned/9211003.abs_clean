We present a rigorous analysis of the Schr\"{o}dinger picture quantizationfor the $SU(2)$ Chern-Simons theory on 3-manifold torus$\times$line, withinsertions of Wilson lines. The quantum states, defined as gauge covariantholomorphic functionals of smooth $su(2)$-connections on the torus, areexpressed by degree $2k$ theta-functions satisfying additional conditions. Theconditions are obtained by splitting the space of semistable$su(2)$-connections into nine submanifolds and by analyzing the behavior ofstates at four codimension $1$ strata. We construct theKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard connection allowing to compare the states fordifferent complex structures of the torus and different positions of the Wilsonlines. By letting two Wilson lines come together, we prove a recursion relationfor the dimensions of the spaces of states which, together with the (unproven)absence of states for spins$\s>{_1\over^2}$level implies the Verlinde dimensionformula.
