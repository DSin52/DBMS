The ADM and Bondi mass for the RST model have been first discussed fromHawking and Horowitz's argument. Expressing the localized RST action in termsof the ADM formulation, the RST Hamiltonian can be derived, meanwhile keepingtrack of all boundary terms. Then the total boundary terms can be taken as thetotal energy for the RST model. It has been found that there is a newcontribution to the ADM and Bondi mass from the RST boundary due to theexistence of the hidden dynamical field. The ADM and Bondi mass have beendiscussed respectively in detail, and some new properties have been found.
