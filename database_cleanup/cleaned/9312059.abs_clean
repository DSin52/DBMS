We review nonlinear gauge theory and its application to two-dimensionalgravity. We construct a gauge theory based on nonlinear Lie algebras, which isan extension of the usual gauge theory based on Lie algebras. It is a newapproach to generalization of the gauge theory. The two-dimensional gravity isderived from nonlinear Poincar{\' e} algebra, which is the new Yang-Mills likeformulation of the gravitational theory. As typical examples, we investigate$R^2$ gravity with dynamical torsion and generic form of 'dilaton' gravity. Thesupersymmetric extension of this theory is also discussed.
