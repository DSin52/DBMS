We formulate and study a class of massive N=2 supersymmetric gauge fieldtheories coupled to boundary degrees of freedom on the strip. For some valuesof the parameters, the infrared limits of these theories can be interpreted asopen string sigma models describing D-branes in large-radius Calabi-Yaucompactifications. For other values of the parameters, these theories flow toCFTs describing branes in more exotic, non-geometric phases of the Calabi-Yaumoduli space such as the Landau-Ginzburg orbifold phase. Some simple propertiesof the branes (like large radius monodromies and spectra of worldvolumeexcitations) can be computed in our model. We also provide simple worldsheetmodels of the transitions which occur at loci of marginal stability, and ofHiggs-Coulomb transitions.
