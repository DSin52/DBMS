stylesThere has been recent interest in conformal twisted boundary conditions andtheir realisations in solvable lattice models. For the Ising and Potts quantumchains, these amount to boundary terms that are related to duality, which is aproper symmetry of the model at criticality. Thus, at criticality, theduality-twisted Ising model is translationally invariant, similar to the morefamiliar cases of periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions. The completefinite-size spectrum of the Ising quantum chain with this peculiar boundarycondition is obtained.
