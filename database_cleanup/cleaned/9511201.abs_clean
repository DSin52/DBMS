Some minor typos corrected,references added, figures slightly changed, a discussion expanded. PostscriptIn these lecture notes, we present a self-contained discussion of planargauge theories broken down to some finite residual gauge group H via the Higgsmechanism. The main focus is on the discrete H gauge theory describing the longdistance physics of such a model. The spectrum features global H charges,magnetic vortices and dyonic combinations. Due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect,these particles exhibit topological interactions. Among other things, we reviewthe Hopf algebra related to this discrete H gauge theory, which provides anunified description of the spin, braid and fusion properties of the particlesin this model. Exotic phenomena such as flux metamorphosis, Alice fluxes,Cheshire charge, (non)abelian braid statistics, the generalized spin-statisticsconnection and nonabelian Aharonov-Bohm scattering are explained andillustrated by representative examples.1.3.1 Coulomb screening, 1.3.2 Survival of the Aharonov-Bohm effect,1.3.3 Braid and fusion properties of the spectrum, 1.4 Nonabeliandiscrete gauge theories, 1.4.1 Classification of stable magneticvortices, 1.4.2 Flux metamorphosis, 1.4.3 Including matter,2.3 Fusion, spin, braid statistics and all that...,charges off Alice fluxes, 3.3 Nonabelian braid statistics,3.A Aharonov-Bohm scattering, 3.B B(3,4) and P(3,4),Concluding remarks and outlook
