There is a Nahm transform for two-dimensional gauge fields which establishesa one-to-one correspondence between the orbit space of U(N) gauge fields withtopological charge k defined on a torus and that of U(k) gauge fields withcharge N on the dual torus. The main result of this paper is to show that asimilar duality transform cannot exist for CPn instantons. This factestablishes a significative difference between 4-D gauge theories and CPnmodels. The result follows from the global analysis of the moduli space ofinstantons based on a complete and explicit parametrization of all self-dualsolutions on the two-dimensional torus. The boundary of the space of regularinstantons is shown to coincide with the space of singular instantons. Thisidentification provides a new approach to analyzing the role of overlappinginstantons in the infrared sector of CPn sigma models.
