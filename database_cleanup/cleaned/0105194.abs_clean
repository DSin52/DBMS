We consider the compactification of the IIA string to (1+1) dimensions onnon-compact 4-folds that are ALE fibrations. Supersymmetry requires that thecompactification include 4-form fluxes, and a particular class of these modelshas been argued by Gukov, Vafa and Witten to give rise to a set of perturbedsuperconformal coset models that also have a Landau-Ginzburg description. Weexamine all these ADE models in detail, including the exceptional cosets. Weidentify which perturbations are induced by the deformation of the singularity,and compute the Landau-Ginzburg potentials exactly. We also show how the theLandau-Ginzburg fields and their superpotentials arise from the geometric dataof the singularity, and we find that this is most naturally described in termsof non-compact, holomorphic 4-cycles.
