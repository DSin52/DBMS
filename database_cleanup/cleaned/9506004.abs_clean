The scale invariance of the $O(3)$ sigma model can be broken by gauging a$U(1)$ subgroup of the $O(3)$ symmetry and including a Maxwell term for thegauge field in the Lagrangian. Adding also a suitable potential one obtains afield theory of Bogomol'nyi type with topological solitons. These solitons arestable against rescaling and carry magnetic flux which can take arbitraryvalues in some finite interval. The soliton mass is independent of the flux,but the soliton size depends on it. However, dynamically changing the fluxrequires infinite energy, so the flux, and hence the soliton size, remainsconstant during time evolution.
