We construct, using harmonic superspace and the quaternionic quotientapproach, a quaternionic-K\"ahler extension of the most general two centreshyper-K\"ahler metric. It possesses $U(1)\times U(1)$ isometry, contains asspecial cases the quaternionic-K\"ahler extensions of the Taub-NUT andEguchi-Hanson metrics and exhibits an extra one-parameter freedom whichdisappears in the hyper-K\"ahler limit. Some emphasis is put on the relationbetween this class of quaternionic-K\"ahler metrics and self-dual Weylsolutions of the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations. The relation between ourexplicit results and the recent general ansatz of Calderbank and Pedersen forquaternionic-K\"ahler metrics with $U(1)\times U(1)$ isometries is traced indetail.
