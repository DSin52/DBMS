Title: Warped Compactifications and AdS/CFT

Authors: Yaron Oz

Comments: 11 pages, 2 figures. Talk presented at the TMR conference in Paris,

September 99; references addedIn this talk we discuss two classes of examples of warped products of AdSspaces in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The first class ofexamples appears in the construction of dual Type I' string descriptions tofive dimensional supersymmetric fixed points with E_{N_f+1} global symmetry.The background is obtained as the near horizon geometry of the D4-D8 branesystem in massive Type IIA supergravity. The second class of examples appearswhen considering the N=2 superconformal theories defined on a 3+1 dimensionalhyperplane intersection of two sets of M5 branes. We use the dual stringformulations to deduce properties of these field theories.
