We show that four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric SU(n) gauge theory for n>2necessarily contains vacua with mutually non-local massless dyons, using onlyanalyticity of the effective action and the weak coupling limit of the modulispace of vacua. A specific example is the Z_3 point in the exact solution forSU(3), and we study its effective Lagrangian. We propose that the low-energytheory at this point is an N=2 superconformal U(1) gauge theory containing bothelectrically and magnetically charged massless hypermultiplets.
