Comments: Summary of conference talk

20, 2002 (4 pages, latex)A re-formulated, non-Hermitian version of the Witten's supersymmetric quantummechanics is presented. Its use of pseudo-Hermitian (so called PT symmetric)Hamiltonians is reviewed and illustrated via several forms of an innovatedsupersymmetric partnership between strongly singular ("spiked") harmonicoscillators.
