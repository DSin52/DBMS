We formulate the basic properties of q-vertex operators in the context of theAndrews-Baxter-Forrester (ABF) series, as an example of face-interactionmodels, derive the q-difference equations satisfied by their correlationfunctions, and establish their connection with representation theory. We alsodiscuss the q-difference equations of the Kashiwara-Miwa (KM) series, as anexample of edge-interaction models. Next, the Ising model--the simplest specialcase of both ABF and KM series--is studied in more detail using theJordan-Wigner fermions. In particular, all matrix elements of vertex operatorsare calculated.
