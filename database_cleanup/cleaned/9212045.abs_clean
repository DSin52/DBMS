A general method of computing string corrections to the K\"ahler metric andYukawa couplings is developed at the one-loop level for a generalcompactification of the heterotic superstring theory. It also provides a directdetermination of the so-called Green-Schwarz term. The matter metric has aninfrared divergent part which reproduces the field-theoretical anomalousdimensions, and a moduli-dependent part which gives rise to thresholdcorrections in the physical Yukawa couplings. Explicit expressions are derivedfor symmetric orbifold compactifications.
