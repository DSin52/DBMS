We study the spectrum of the domain walls interpolating between differentchirally asymmetric vacua in supersymmetric QCD with the SU(3) gauge group andincluding 2 pairs of chiral matter multiplets in fundamental andanti-fundamental representations. For small enough masses m < m* = .286... (inthe units of \Lambda), there are two different domain wall solutions which areBPS-saturated and two types of ``wallsome sphalerons''. At m = m*, two BPSbranches join together and, in the interval m* < m < m** = 3.704..., BPSequations have no solutions but there are solutions to the equations of motiondescribing a non-BPS domain wall and a sphaleron. For m > m**, there are nosolutions whatsoever.
