confinement index and multiplication map index, refs added and to appear inJHEPWe extend the results of Cachazo, Seiberg and Witten to N=1 supersymmetricgauge theories with gauge groups SO(2N), SO(2N+1) and Sp(2N). By taking thesuperpotential which is an arbitrary polynomial of adjoint matter \Phi as asmall perturbation of N=2 gauge theories, we examine the singular pointspreserving N=1 supersymmetry in the moduli space where mutually local monopolesbecome massless. We derive the matrix model complex curve for the whole rangeof the degree of perturbed superpotential. Then we determine a generalizedKonishi anomaly equation implying the orientifold contribution. We turn to themultiplication map and the confinement index K and describe both Coulomb branchand confining branch. In particular, we construct a multiplication map fromSO(2N+1) to SO(2KN-K+2) where K is an even integer as well as a multiplicationmap from SO(2N) to SO(2KN-2K+2) (K is a positive integer), a map from SO(2N+1)to SO(2KN-K+2) (K is an odd integer) and a map from Sp(2N) to Sp(2KN+2K-2).has two different semiclassical limits corresponding to distinct gauge groups.
