We consider two-dimensional dilaton-gravity theories with a genericexponential potential for the dilaton, and obtain the most general black holesolutions in the Schwarzshild form. We discuss their geometrical andthermodynamical properties. We also study these models from the point of viewof gauge theories of the extended Poincar\'e group and show that they can beconsidered as gauge theories with broken symmetry. Finally, we examine thetheory in a hamiltonian formalism and discuss its quantization and itssymmetries.
