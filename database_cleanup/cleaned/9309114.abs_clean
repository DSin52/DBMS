Various properties of open strings in external constant E.M. fields arereviewed. In particular, the charged-particle pair production rate in anexternal electric field is evaluated, and shown to reduce to Schwinger'sformula in the limit of low-intensity fields. Open strings in external magneticfields are shown to undergo an infinite number of phase transitions as thestrenght of the field increases.
