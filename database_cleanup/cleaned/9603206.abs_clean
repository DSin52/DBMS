We analyze the effects of soft supersymmetry breaking terms on N=1supersymmetric QCD with $N_f$ flavors and color gauge group $SU(N_c)$. The masssquared of some squarks may be negative, as long as vacuum stability is ensuredby a simple mass inequality. For $N_f<N_c$, we include the dynamics of thenon-perturbative superpotential and use the original (s)quark and gauge fields,while for $N_f>N_c+1$, we formulate the dynamics in terms of dual (s)quarks anda dual gauge group $SU(N_f-N_c)$. The presence of negative squark mass squaredterms leads to spontaneous breakdown of flavor and color symmetry. We determinethis breaking pattern, derive the spectrum, and argue that the masses varysmoothly as one crosses from the Higgs phase into the confining phase.
