We study the Abelian Thirring Model when the fermionic fields havewe find for this model is the dependence of the Virasoro central charge on boththe Thirring coupling constant and $N$. We show how to evaluate correlationfunctions and in particular we compute the conformal dimensions for fermionsand fermionic bilinears, which depend on the fermionic chiral charge. Finallywe build primary fields with arbitrary conformal weight.
