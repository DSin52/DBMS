The metric on the moduli space of charge (2,1) SU(3)Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield monopoles is calculated and investigated. ThehyperKahler quotient construction is used to provide an alternative derivationof the metric. Various properties of the metric are derived using thehyperKahler quotient construction and the correspondence between BPS monopolesand rational maps. Several interesting limits of the metric are alsoconsidered.
