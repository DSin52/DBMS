We suggest and motivate a precise equivalence between uncompactified elevendimensional M-theory and the N = infinity limit of the supersymmetric matrixquantum mechanics describing D0-branes. The evidence for the conjectureconsists of several correspondences between the two theories. As a consequenceof supersymmetry the simple matrix model is rich enough to describe theproperties of the entire Fock space of massless well separated particles of thesupergravity theory. In one particular kinematic situation the leading largedistance interaction of these particles is exactly described by supergravity .The model appears to be a nonperturbative realization of the holographicprinciple. The membrane states required by M-theory are contained asexcitations of the matrix model. The membrane world volume is a noncommutativegeometry embedded in a noncommutative spacetime.
