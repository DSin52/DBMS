We construct an Sp(2,R) gauge invariant particle action which possessesmanifest space-time SO(d,2) symmetry, global supersymmetry and kappasupersymmetry. The global and local supersymmetries are non-abeliangeneralizations of Poincare type supersymmetries and are consistent with thepresence of two timelike dimensions. In particular, this action provides aunified and explicit superparticle representation of the superconformal groupsOSp(N/4), SU(2,2/N) and OSp(8*/N) which underlie various AdS/CFT dualities inM/string theory. By making diverse Sp(2,R) gauge choices our action reduces todiverse one-time physics systems, one of which is the ordinary (one-time)massless superparticle with superconformal symmetry that we discuss explicitly.We show how to generalize our approach to the case of superalgebras, such asOSp(1/32), which do not have direct space-time interpretations in terms of onlyzero branes, but may be realizable in the presence of p-branes.
