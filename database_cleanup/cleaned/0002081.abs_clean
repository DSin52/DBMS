Comments: Latex, 11 pages. Invited talk presented at the International

Conference on Conformal Field Theory and Integrable Models, Landau Institute,Moscow (Russia), June 1999, and at the 6th International Wigner Symposium,Bogazici University, Istambul (Turkey), August 1999the 6th International Wigner SymposiumIn the last six years remarkable developments have taken place concerning therepresentation theory of N=2 superconformal algebras. Here we present thehighlights of such developments.
