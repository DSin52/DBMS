It is shown that an alternative supersymmetric version of the Liouvilleequation extracted from D=3 Green-Schwarz superstring equations naturallyarises as a super-Toda model obtained from a properly constrainedsupersymmetric WZNW theory based on the $sl(2, R)$ algebra. Hamiltonianreduction is performed by imposing a nonlinear superfield constraint whichturns out to be a mixture of a first- and second-class constraint onsupercurrent components. Supersymmetry of the model is realized nonlinearlyand is spontaneously broken. The set of independent current fields whichsurvive the Hamiltonian reduction contains (in the holomorphic sector) onebosonic current of spin 2 (the stress--tensor of the spin 0 Liouville mode)and two fermionic fields of spin ${3/2}$ and $-1/2$. The $n=1$ superconformalsystem thus obtained is of the same kind as one describing noncriticalfermionic strings in a universal string theory. The generalization of thisprocedure allows one to produce from any bosonic Lie algebra super--Todamodels and associated super-W algebras together with their nonstandardrealizations.
