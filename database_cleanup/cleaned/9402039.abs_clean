Fusion is defined for arbitrary lowest weight representations of$W$-algebras, without assuming rationality. Explicit algorithms are given. Acategory of quasirational representations is defined and shown to be stableunder fusion. Conjecturally, it may coincide with the category ofrepresentations of finite quantum dimensions.
