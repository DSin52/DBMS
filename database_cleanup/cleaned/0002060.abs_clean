The self-duality of chiral p-forms was originally investigated by Pasti,Sorokin and Tonin in a manifestly Lorentz covariant action with non-polynomialauxiliary fields. The investigation was then extended to other chiral p-formactions. In this paper we point out that the self-duality appears in a widercontext of theoretical models that relate to chiral p-forms. We demonstratethis by considering the interacting model of Floreanini-Jackiw chiral bosonsand gauge fields, the generalized chiral Schwinger model (GCSM) and thelatter's gauge invariant formulation, and discover that the self-duality of theGCSM corresponds to the vector and axial vector current duality.
