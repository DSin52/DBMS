A new formalism is given for the renormalization of quantum field theories toall orders of perturbation theory, in which there are manifestly no overlappingdivergences. We prove the BPH theorem in this formalism, and show how the localsubtractions add up to counterterms in the action. Applications include therenormalization of lattice perturbation theory, the decoupling theorem,Zimmermann oversubtraction, the renormalization of operator insertions, and theoperator product expansion.
