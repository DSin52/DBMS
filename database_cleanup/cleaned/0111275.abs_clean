`Old' String Theory is a theory of one-dimensional extended objects, whosevibrations correspond to excitations of various target-space field modesincluding gravity. In these lectures I will give an introduction to low-energyEffective Target-Space Actions derived from conformal invariance conditions ofthe underlying sigma models in string theory, discuss cosmology, emphasizingthe role of the dilaton field in inducing inflationary scenaria and in generalexpanding string universes. Specifically, I shall analyse some exact solutionsof string theory with a linear dilaton, and discuss their role in inducingexpanding Robertson-Walker Universes. I will mention briefly pre-Big-Bangscenaria of String Cosmology, in which the dilaton plays a crucial role. Inview of recent claims on experimental evidence on the existence of cosmicacceleration in the universe today, with a positive non-zero cosmologicalconstant (de Sitter type), I shall also discuss difficulties of incorporatingsuch Universes with eternal acceleration in the context of critical stringtheory, and present scenaria for a graceful exit from such a phase.
