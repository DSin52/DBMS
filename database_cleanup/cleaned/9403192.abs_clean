Families of exact $(0,2)$ supersymmetric conformal field theories ofmagnetically and electrically charged extremal 4D black hole solutions ofheterotic string theory are presented. They are constructed using a $(0,1)$supersymmetric $SL(2,R)\times SU(2)$ WZW model where anomalously embedded$U(1)\times U(1)$ subgroups are gauged. Crucial cancelations of the $U(1)$anomalies coming from the supersymmetric fermions, the current algebra fermionsand the gauging ensure that there is a consistency of these models at thequantum level. Various 2D models, which may be considered as building blocksfor extremal 4D constructions, are presented. They generalise the class of 2Dmodels which might be obtained from gauging $SL(2,R)$ and coincide with knownheterotic string backgrounds. The exact conformal field theory presented byGiddings, Polchinski and Strominger describing the angular sector of theextremal magnetically charged black hole is a special case of thisconstruction. An example where the radial and angular theories are mixednon--trivially is studied in detail, resulting in an extremal dilatonicTaub--NUT--like dyon.
