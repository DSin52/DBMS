This review describes the role of magnetic symmetry in 2+1 dimensional gaugetheories. In confining theories without matter fields in fundamentalrepresentation the magnetic symmetry is spontaneously broken. Under some mildassumptions, the low-energy dynamics is determined universally by thisspontaneous breaking phenomenon. The degrees of freedom in the effective theoryare magnetic vortices. Their role in confining dynamics is similar to thatplayed by pions and sigma in the chiral symmetry breaking dynamics.I give an explicit derivation of the effective theory in (2+1)-dimensionalweakly coupled confining models and argue that it remains qualitatively thesame in strongly coupled (2+1)-dimensional gluodynamics. Confinement in thiseffective theory is a very simple classical statement about the long rangeinteraction between topological solitons, which follows (as a result of asimple direct classical calculation) from the structure of the effectiveLagrangian. I show that if fundamentally charged dynamical fields are presentthe magnetic symmetry becomes local rather than global. The modifications tothe effective low energy description in the case of heavy dynamical fundamentalmatter are discussed. This effective lagrangian naturally yields a bag likedescription of baryonic excitations. I also discuss the fate of the magneticsymmetry in gauge theories with the Chern-Simons term.
