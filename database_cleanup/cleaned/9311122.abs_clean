We derive a charged black hole solution in four dimensions described by$SL(2,R)\times SU(2)\times U(1)/U(1)^2$ WZW coset model. Using the algebraicHamiltonian method we calculate the corresponding solution that is exact to allorders in ${1\over k}$. It is shown that unlike the 2D black hole, thesingularity remains also in the exact solution, and moreover, in some range ofthe gauge parameter the space-time does not fulfil the cosmic censorconjecture, $i.e.$ we find a naked singularity outside the black hole. Exactdual models are derived as well, one of them describes a 4D space-time with anaked singularity. Using the algebraic Hamiltonian approach we also find theexact to all orders $O(d,d)$ transformation of the metric and the dilaton fieldfor general WZW coset models and show the correction with respect to thetransformations in one loop order.
