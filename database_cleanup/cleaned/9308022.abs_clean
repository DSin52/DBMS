This paper is concerned with theories describing spinning particles that areformulated in terms of actions possessing either local world-line supersymmetryor local fermionic {\it kappa} invariance. These classical actions are obtainedby adding a finite number of spinor or vector coordinates to the usualspace-time coordinates. Generalizing to superspace leads to corresponding typesof \lq spinning superparticle' theories in which the wave-functions aresuperfields in some (generally reducible) representation of the Lorentz group.A class of these spinning superparticle actions possesses the same spectrum asten-dimensional supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory, which it is shown can beformulated in terms of either vector or spinor superfields satisfyingsupercovariant constraints. The models under consideration include some thatwere known previously and some new ones.
