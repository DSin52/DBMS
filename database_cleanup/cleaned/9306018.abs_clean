We show that the connection between certain integrable perturbations of $N=2$superconformal theories and graphs found by Lerche and Warner extends to abroader class. These perturbations are such that the generators of theperturbed chiral ring may be diagonalized in an orthonormal basis. This allowsto define a dual ring, whose generators are labelled by the ground states ofthe theory and are encoded in a graph or set of graphs, that reproduce thepattern of the ground states and interpolating solitons. All knownperturbations of the $ADE$ potentials and some others are shown to satisfy thiscriterion. This suggests a test of integrability.
