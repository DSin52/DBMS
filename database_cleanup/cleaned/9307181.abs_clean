It is shown in a variant of two dimensional dilaton gravity theories that anarbitrary, localized massive source put in an initially regular spacetime givesrise to formation of the wormhole classically, without accompanying thecurvature singularity. The semiclassical quantum correction under this wormholespacetime yields Hawking radiation. It is expected, with the quantum backreaction added to the classical equation, that the information loss paradox maybe resolved in this model.
