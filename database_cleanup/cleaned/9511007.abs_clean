Title: Dispersion Relations in Gauge Theories with Confinement

Comments: Plenary talk presented at the XVIIIth International Workshop on High

Energy Physics and Field Theory, Moscow-Protvino, June 1995. To be publishedin the Proceedings. 13 pages, LatexThe analytic structure of {\it physical} amplitudes is considered for gaugetheories with confinement of excitations corresponding to the elementaryfields. Confinement is defined in terms of the BRST algebra. BRST-invariant,local, composite fields are introduced, which interpolate between physicalasymptotic states. It is shown that the singularities of physical amplitudesare the same as in an effective theory with only physical fields. Inparticular, there are no structure singularities (anomalous thresholds)associated with confined constituents, like quarks and gluons. The old proofsof dispersion relations for hadronic amplitudes remain valid in QCD.
