We show that a non-trivial topological effect breaks the conformal invarianceof pure Yang-Mills theory. Thus it is possible that classic particle-likesolutions exists in pure non-Abelian Yang-Mills theory. We find a static,non-singular solution in source-free SU(2) Yang-Mills theory infour-dimensional Minkowski space. This solution is a stable solitoncharacterized by non-trivial topology and imaginary $A_0^a$, i.e.,$A_0^aA_0^a<0$. It yields hermitian Hamilton, and finite, positive energy.
