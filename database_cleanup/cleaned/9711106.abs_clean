Recent work on solutions to the Born-Infeld theory used to describe D-branessuggests that fundamental strings can be viewed, in a certain limit, asD-branes whose worldvolumes have collapsed to string-like configurations. Herewe address the possibility of undoing this collapse, by inducing the string totunnel to an extended brane configuration. Using semiclassical methods we arguethat, by putting one of these Born-Infeld strings in the background of auniform 4-form RR field strength, the string can nucleate a spheroidal bulge ofD2-brane, or, if the string is wrapped around a small enough circle, it cantunnel to a toroidal D2-brane. This process can also be interpreted in terms ofthe M2-brane. We also address the extension to other D$p$-branes, and discussthe range of validity of the approximations involved.
