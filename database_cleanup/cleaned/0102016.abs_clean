We find soliton solutions in the 2+1 dimensional non-commutative MaxwellChern-Simons Higgs theories. In the limit of the Chern-Simons coefficient goingto zero, these solutions go over to the previously found solutions in thenon-commutative Maxwell Higgs theories. The new solutions may have relevance inthe theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect and possibly in string vacuacorresponding to open strings terminating on D2 branes in the presence of D0branes.
