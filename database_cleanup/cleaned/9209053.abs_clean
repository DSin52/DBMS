Optimal hypercontractivity bounds for the fermion oscillator semigroup areobtained. These are the fermion analogs of the optimal hypercontractivitybounds for the boson oscillator semigroup obtained by Nelson. In the process,several results of independent interest in the theory of non-commutativeintegration are established. {}.
