We present theories of N=2 hypermultiplets in four spacetime dimensions thatare invariant under rigid or local superconformal symmetries. The target spacesof theories with rigid superconformal invariance are (4n)-dimensional {\itspecial} hyper-K\"ahler manifolds. Such manifolds can be described as conesover tri-Sasakian metrics and are locally the product of a flatfour-dimensional space and a quaternionic manifold. The latter manifolds appearin the coupling of hypermultiplets to N=2 supergravity. We employ localsections of an Sp$(n)\times{\rm Sp}(1)$ bundle in the formulation of theLagrangian and transformation rules, thus allowing for arbitrarycoordinatizations of the hyper-K\"ahler and quaternionic manifolds.
