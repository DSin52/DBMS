Title: Anomalies and Locality in Field Theories and M theory

Authors: L.Bonora, C.S.Chu and M.Rinaldi

Comments: 16 pages, LaTeX

We review some basic notions on anomalies in field theories and superstringtheories, with particular emphasis on the concept of locality. The aim is toprepare the ground for a discussion on anomalies in theories with branes. Inthis light we review the problem of chiral anomaly cancellation in M-theorywith a 5-brane.
