Title: Graviphoton and graviscalars delocalization in braneworld scenarios

University)Comments: Talk delivered at COSMO-01 Workshop, Rovaniemi, Finland, August 30 -

September 4, 2001. 14 pages, LaTeXA manifestly gauge-invariant theory of gravitational fluctuations ofbrane-world scenarios is discussed. Without resorting to any specific gaugechoice, a general method is presented in order to disentangle the fluctuationsof the brane energy-momentum from the fluctuations of the metric. As anapplication of the formalism, the localization of metric fluctuations on scalarbranes breaking spontaneously five-dimensional Poincar\'e invariance isaddressed. Only assuming that the four-dimensional Planck mass is finite andthat the geometry is regular, it is demonstrated that the vector and scalarfluctuations of the metric are not localized on the brane.
