MobilevisionAuthors: D. Juriev (Yur'ev; Mathematical Division, Research Institute for

System Studies of Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia)Comments: 9 pages Amstex, revised version

Systems; Pattern Formation and SolitonsThis article is devoted to some interesting geometric and informaticinterpretations of peculiarities of 2D quantum field theory, which become re-vealed after its visualization. Contents.1.1. Interpretational geometry and anomalous virtual realities;1.2. Quantum projective field theory and Mobilevision;1.3. Quantum conformal and q_R conformal field theories; quantum-fieldanalogs of Euler-Arnold top;1.4. Organizing MV cyberspace;1.5. Non-Alexandrian geometry of Mobilevision.IAVR-teleaesthesy.
