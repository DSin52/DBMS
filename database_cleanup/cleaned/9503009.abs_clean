Title: Thermodynamics of Black Hole in (N+3)-dimensions from Euclidean N-brane

TheoryJournal-ref: Mod.Phys.Lett. A10 (1995) 2775-2782

In this article we consider an N-brane description of an (N+3)-dimensionalblack hole horizon. First of all, we start by reviewing a previous work where astring theory is used as describing the dynamics of the event horizon of a fourdimensional black hole. Then we consider a particle model defined on onedimensional Euclidean line in a three dimensional black hole as a targetspacetime metric. By solving the field equations we find a ``world lineinstanton'' which connects the past event horizon with the future one. Thissolution gives us the exact value of the Hawking temperature and to leadingorder the Bekenstein-Hawking formula of black hole entropy. We also show thatthis formalism is extensible to an arbitrary spacetime dimension. Finally wemake a comment of one-loop quantum correction to the black hole entropy .
