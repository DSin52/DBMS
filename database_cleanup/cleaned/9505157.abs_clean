We present a direct approach for the calculation of functional determinantsof the Laplace operator on balls. Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions areconsidered. Using this approach, formulas for any value of the dimension, $D$,of the ball, can be obtained quite easily. Explicit results are presented herefor dimensions $D=2,3,4,5$ and $6$.
