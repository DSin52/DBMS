We look at vacuum solutions for fields confined in cavities where theboundary conditions can rule out constant field configurations, other than thezero field. If the zero field is unstable, symmetry breaking can occur to afield configuration of lower energy which is not constant. The stability of thezero field is determined by the size of the length scales which characterizethe cavity and parameters that enter the scalar field potential. There can be acritical length at which an instability of the zero field sets in. In additionto looking at the rectangular and spherical cavity in detail, we describe ageneral method which can be used to find approximate analytical solutions whenthe length scales of the cavity are close to the critical value.
