Geometric optics is analysed using the techniques of Presymplectic Geometry.We obtain the symplectic structure of the space of light rays in a medium of anon constant refractive index by reduction from a presymplectic structure, andusing adapted coordinates, we find Darboux coordinates. The theory isillustrated with some examples and we point out some simple physicalapplications
