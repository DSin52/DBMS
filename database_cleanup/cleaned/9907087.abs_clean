improvedWe discuss string theory on AdS(3)xS(3)xM(4) with particular emphasis onunitarity and state-operator correspondence. The AdS-CFT correspondence, in theMinkowski signature, is re-examined by taking into account the only allowedalgebra SL(2,R) supplemented with zero modes. Zero modes play an important rolein the description of on-shell states as well as of windings in space-time atthe AdS(3) boundary. The theory is presented as part of the supersymmetric WZWmodel that includes the supergroup SU(2/1,1) or OSp(4/2) or D(2,1;\alpha) withcentral extension k. A free field representation is given and the vertexoperators are constructed in terms of free fields in SL(2,R) principal seriesrepresentation bases that are labeled by position space or momentum space atthe boundary of AdS(3). The vertex operators have the correct operator productswith the currents and stress tensor, all of which are constructed from freefields, including the subtle zero modes. It is shown that as k goes toinfinity, AdS(3) tends to flat 3D-Minkowski space and the AdS(3) vertexoperators in momentum space tend to the vertex operators of flat 3D-stringtheory (furthermore the theory readjusts smoothly in the rest of the dimensionsin this limit).
