Title: Supersymmetry and Superfields in Three Euclidean Dimensions

Authors: D.G.C. McKeon (University of Western Ontario), T.N. Sherry (National

University of Ireland, Galway)The simplest supersymmetry algebra and superspace in three dimensionalEuclidean (3dE) space is examined. Representations of the algebra areconsidered and the implications of restricting the space of states to stateswith positive definite norm are determined.A superspace is defined and superfields are introduced. Supersymmetric fieldtheory models in 3dE are described both in superfield and component fieldforms. The relationship between these models, and similar models in fourdimensional Minkowski space is described.
