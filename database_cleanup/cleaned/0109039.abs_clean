We construct D=11 supergravity solutions dual to the twisted field theoriesarising when M-theory fivebranes wrap supersymmetric cycles. The casesconsidered are M-fivebranes wrapped on (i) a complex Lagrangian four-cycle in aD=8 hyper-Kaehler manifold corresponding to a D=2 field theory with (2,1)supersymmetry (ii) a product of two holomorphic two-cycles in a product of twoCalabi-Yau two-folds corresponding to a D=2 field theory with (2,2)supersymmetry and (iii) a product of a holomorphic two-cycle and a SLAGthree-cycle in a product of a Calabi-Yau two-fold and a Calabi-Yau three-foldcorresponding to a quantum mechanics with two supercharges. In each case weconstruct BPS equations and find IR superconformal fixed points correspondingto new examples of AdS/CFT duality arising from the twisted field theories.
