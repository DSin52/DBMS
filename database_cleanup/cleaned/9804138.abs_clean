We investigate the quantization of even-dimensional topological actions ofChern-Simons form which were proposed previously. We quantize the actions byLagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations {\`a} la Batalin, Fradkin andVilkovisky. The models turn out to be infinitely reducible and thus we needinfinite number of ghosts and antighosts. The minimal actions of Lagrangianformulation which satisfy the master equation of Batalin and Vilkovisky havethe same Chern-Simons form as the starting classical actions. In theHamiltonian formulation we have used the formulation of cohomologicalperturbation and explicitly shown that the gauge-fixed actions of bothformulations coincide even though the classical action breaks Dirac'sregularity condition. We find an interesting relation that the BRST charge ofHamiltonian formulation is the odd-dimensional fermionic counterpart of thetopological action of Chern-Simons form. Although the quantization of twodimensional models which include both bosonic and fermionic gauge fields areinvestigated in detail, it is straightforward to extend the quantization intoarbitrary even dimensions. This completes the quantization of previouslyproposed topological gravities in two and four dimensions.
