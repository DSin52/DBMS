We propose a unitary matrix model as a regularization of the IIB matrix modelof Ishibashi-Kawai-Kitazawa-Tsuchiya (IKKT). The fermionic part is incorporatedusing the overlap formalism in order to avoid unwanted ``doublers'' whilepreserving the global gauge invariance. This regularization, unlike the oneadopted by IKKT, has manifest U(1)^10 symmetry, which corresponds to theten-dimensional translational invariance of the space time. We calculateone-loop effective action around some typical BPS-saturated configurations inthe weak coupling limit. We also discuss a possible scenario for the dynamicalgeneration of the four-dimensional space time through spontaneous breakdown ofthe U(1)^10 symmetry in the double scaling limit.
