Title: Topological excitations in N=1 Supersymmetric QFT

Comments: 10 pages, LaTex file, 4 figures, one macro included, extra references

The present paper deals with N=1 2D supersymmetric integrable quantum fieldtheory. The S-matrix proposed to describe the interactions betweensupersymmetric particles is applied to theories involving topologicalexcitations of zero central charge. Bound states can fit consistently withinthis type of theories, since the bootstrap can be shown to close. Thetopological character of the excitations and the similarity with the scatteringof particles is fully understood when a kink sector is introduced in thetheory.
