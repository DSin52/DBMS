Title: Closed strings in uniform magnetic field backgrounds

Comments: 22 pages, harvmac

We consider a class of conformal models describing closed strings in axiallysymmetric stationary magnetic flux tube backgrounds. These models are closedstring analogs of the Landau model of a particle in a magnetic field or themodel of an open string in a constant magnetic field. They are interestingexamples of solvable unitary conformal string theories with non-trivial4-dimensional curved space-time interpretation. In particular, their quantumHamiltonian can be expressed in terms of free fields and the physical spectrumand string partition function can be explicitly determined. In addition to thepresence of tachyonic instabilities and existence of critical values ofmagnetic field the closed string spectrum exhibits also some novel featureswhich were absent in the open string case.
