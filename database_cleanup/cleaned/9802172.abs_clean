Black-Hole Puzzles SolvedComments: 9 pages, plain TeX, no figures

Statistical mechanics explains thermodynamics in terms of (quantum) mechanicsby equating the entropy of a microstate of a closed system with the logarithmof the number of microstates in the macrostate to which it belongs, but thequestion `what is a macrostate?' has never been answered except in a vague,subjective, way. However Hawking's discovery of black hole evaporation led to aformula for black hole entropy with no subjective element. In this letter, weargue from this result, together with the assumption that `black holethermodynamics is just ordinary thermodynamics applied to black holes', that amacrostate for a general (quantum gravitational) closed system is anequivalence class of matter-gravity microstates with the same expectationvalues for the matter degrees of freedom alone. Not only does this finallyanswer the question `what is entropy?', but it also predicts the equality ofthe thermodynamic entropy of a black hole with the matter and the gravityentropy-like quantities derived from the Euclidean path integral. Furthermoreit gives us a clear glimpse of an ultimate synthesis of quantum theory andgravity in which we see that (a) gravity acts as a universal environment, thuspredicting that, if the initial state of the universe is unentangled, itsentropy must go on increasing forever, (b) the gravitational field has degreesof freedom, but no observables, thus enabling gravity to perform the trick ofproviding an objective continual process of decoherence. All the above rests onthe validity of unitarity. The `information-loss puzzle' had raised doubtsabout that. But we suggest a resolution for this puzzle.
