Title: Difference-elliptic operators and root systems

Recently a new technique in the harmonic analysis on symmetric spaces wassuggested based on certain remarkable representations of affine and doubleaffine Hecke algebras in terms of Dunkl and Demazure operators instead of Liegroups and Lie algebras. In the classic case it resulted (among otherapplications) in a new theory of radial part of Laplace operators and theirdeformations including a related concept of the Fourier transform.In the present paper we demonstrate that the new technique works well even inthe most general difference-elliptic case conjecturally corresponding to the$q$-Kac-Moody algebras. We discuss here only the construction of thegeneralized radial (zonal) Laplace operators and connect them with thedifference-elliptic Ruijsenaars operators generalizing in its turn theOlshanetsky-Perelomov differential elliptic operators.
