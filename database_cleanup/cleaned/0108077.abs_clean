The sinh-Gordon model on a half-line with integrable boundary conditions isconsidered in low order perturbation theory developed in affine Toda fieldtheory. The quantum corrections to the classical reflection factor of the modelare studied up to the second order in the difference of the two boundaryparameters and to one loop order in the bulk coupling. It is noticed that thegeneral form of the second order quantum corrections are consistent withGhoshal's formula.
