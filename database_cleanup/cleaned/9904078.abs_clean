The one-instanton contribution to the prepotential for N=2 supersymmetricgauge theories with classical groups exhibits a universality of form. Weextrapolate the observed regularity to SU(N) gauge theory with twoantisymmetric hypermultiplets and N_f \leq 3 hypermultiplets in the definingrepresentation. Using methods developed for the instanton expansion ofnon-hyperelliptic curves, we construct an effective quartic Seiberg-Wittencurve that generates this one-instanton prepotential. We then interpret thiscurve in terms of an M-theoretic picture involving NS 5-branes, D4-branes,D6-branes, and orientifold sixplanes, and show that for consistency, aninfinite chain of 5-branes and orientifold sixplanes is required, correspondingto a curve of infinite order.
