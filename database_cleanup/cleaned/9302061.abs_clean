Quantum canonical transformations are defined in analogy to classicalcanonical transformations as changes of the phase space variables whichpreserve the Dirac bracket structure. In themselves, they are neither unitarynor non-unitary. A definition of quantum integrability in terms of canonicaltransformations is proposed which includes systems which have fewer commutingintegrals of motion than degrees of freedom. The important role of non-unitarytransformations in integrability is discussed.
