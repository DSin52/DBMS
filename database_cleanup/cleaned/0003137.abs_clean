We investigate the noncommutative analogue of the spontaneously broken linearsigma model at the one-loop quantum level. In the commutative case,renormalization of a theory with a spontaneously broken continuous globalsymmetry depends on cancellations that enable the limited set of countertermsconsistent with that symmetry to remove the divergences even after itsspontaneous breaking, while preserving the masslessness of the associatedGoldstone modes. In the noncommutative case, we find that these cancellationsare violated, and the renormalized one-loop correction to the inverse pionpropagator explicitly yields a mass shift which depends on the ultravioletcutoff. Thus, we cannot naively take the ultraviolet cutoff to infinity first,and then take the external momentum to zero to verify Nambu-Goldstone symmetryrealization. However, from the Wilsonian perspective where the cutoff is fixedand physical, the zero external momentum limit of the inverse pion propagatorstill vanishes, and implies the masslessness of the pion fields at one-loop.This is another demonstration of the failure of ultraviolet and infrared limitsto commute in noncommutative field theories, and signals the incompatibility ofNambu-Goldstone symmetry realization with the continuum renormalization ofthese theories.
