All four dimensional orbit spaces of compact coregular linear groups havebeen determined. The results are obtained through the integration of auniversal differential equation, that only requires as input the number ofelements of an integrity basis of the ideal of polynomial invariants of thelinear group. Our results are relevant and lead to universality properties inthe physics of spontaneous symmetry breaking at the classical level.
