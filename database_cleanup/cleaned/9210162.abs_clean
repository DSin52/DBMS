Title: On the KP Hierarchy, $\hat{W}_{\infty}$ Algebra, and Conformal

SL(2,R)/U(1) Model --- The Classical and Quantum CasesAuthors: Feng Yu and Yong-Shi Wu

Comments: (Invited talk given the second at the XXI International Conference on

Differential Geometric Methods in Theoretical Physics, Nankai Institute ofMathematics, Tianjin, China; June 5-9, 1992; to appear in Proceedings.), 12p,Latex fileWe give a unified description of our recent results on the theinter-relationship between the integrable infinite KP hierarchy, nonlinear$\hat{W}_{\infty}$ current algebra and conformal noncompact $SL(2,R)/U(1)$coset model both at the classical and quantum levels. In particular, we presentthe construction of a quantum version of the KP hierarchy by deforming thesecond KP Hamiltonian structure through quantizing the $SL(2,R)_k/U(1)$ modeland constructing an infinite set of commuting quantum $\hat{W}_{\infty}$charges (at least at $k$=1).
