645-648We study the Toda field theory with finite Lie algebras using an extension ofthe Goulian-Li technique. In this way, we show that, after integrating over thezero mode in the correlation functions of the exponential fields, the resultingcorrelation function resembles that of a free theory. Furthermore, it is shownthat for some ratios of the charges of the exponential fields the four-pointcorrelation functions which contain a degenerate field satisfy the Riemannordinary differential equation. Using this fact and the crossing symmetry, wederive a set of functional equations for the structure constants of the A_2Toda field theory.
