We consider a class of higher order corrections with arbitrary power $n$ ofthe curvature tensor to the standard gravity action in arbitrary space-timedimension $D$. The corrections are in the form of Euler densities and areunique at each $n$ and $D$. We present a generating functional and an explicitform of the corresponding conserved energy-momentum tensors. The case ofconformally flat metrics is discussed in detail. We show that this class ofcorrections allows for domain wall solutions since, despite the presence ofhigher powers of the curvature tensor, the singularity structure at the wall isof the same type as in the standard gravity. However, models with higher ordercorrections have larger set of domain wall solutions and the existence of thesesolutions no longer depends on the presence of cosmological constants. We findfor example that the Randall-Sundrum scenario can be realized without any needfor bulk and/or brane cosmological constant.
