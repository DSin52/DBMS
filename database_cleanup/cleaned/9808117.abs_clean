We construct supergravity backgrounds representing non-homogeneouscompactifications of d=10,11 supergravities to four dimensions, which cannot bewritten as a direct product. The geometries are regular and approach$AdS_7\times S^4$ or $AdS_5\times S^5$ at infinity; they are genericallynon-supersymmetric, except in a certain "extremal" limit, where a Bogomol'nyibound is saturated and a naked singularity appears. By using these spaces, onecan construct a model of QCD that generalizes by one (or two) extra parametersa recently proposed model of QCD based on the non-extremal D4 brane. Thisallows for some extra freedom to circumvent some (but not all) limitations ofthe simplest version.
