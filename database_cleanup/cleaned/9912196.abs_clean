We apply the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz to investigate the high energybehaviour of a class of scattering matrices which have recently been proposedto describe the Homogeneous sine-Gordon models related to simply laced Liealgebras. A characteristic feature is that some elements of the suggestedS-matrices are not parity invariant and contain resonance shifts which allowfor the formation of unstable bound states. From the Lagrangian point of viewthese models may be viewed as integrable perturbations of WZNW-coset models andin our analysis we recover indeed in the deep ultraviolet regime the effectivecentral charge related to these cosets, supporting therefore the S-matrixproposal. For the $SU(3)_k$-model we present a detailed numerical analysis ofthe scaling function which exhibits the well known staircase pattern fortheories involving resonance parameters, indicating the energy scales of stableand unstable particles. We demonstrate that, as a consequence of the interplaybetween the mass scale and the resonance parameter, the ultraviolet limit ofthe HSG-model may be viewed alternatively as a masslessultraviolet-infrared-flow between different conformal cosets. For $k=2$ werecover as a subsystem the flow between the tricritical Ising and the Isingmodel.
