We discuss properties of a 4-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole in aspacetime where one of the spatial dimensions is compactified. As a result ofthe compactification the event horizon of the black hole is distorted. We useWeyl coordinates to obtain the solution describing such a distorted black hole.We study the properties of the compactified Schwarzschild black hole, anddevelop an approximation which allows one to find the size, shape, surfacegravity and other characteristics of the distorted horizon with a very highaccuracy in a simple analytical form. We also discuss possible instabilities ofa black hole in the compactified space.
