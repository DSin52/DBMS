Correlation functions can be calculated on Riemann surfaces using theoperator formalism. The state in the Hilbert space of the free field theory onthe punctured disc, corresponding to the Riemann surface, is constructed atinfinite genus, verifying the inclusion of these surfaces in the Grassmannian.In particular, a subset of the class of $O_{HD}$ surfaces can be identifiedwith a subset of the Grassmannian. The concept of flux through the idealboundary is used to study the connection between infinite-genus surface and thedomain of string perturbation theory. The different roles of effectively closedsurfaces with Dirichlet boundaries in a more complete formulation of stringtheory are identified.
