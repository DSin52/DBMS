We attempt to construct new superstring actions with a $D$-plet of Majoranafermions $\psi^{\cal B}_A$, where ${\cal B}$ is the $D$ dimensional space-timeindex and $A$ is the two dimensional spinor index, by deforming the Schildunder N=1 (the world-sheet) supersymmetry transformation and thearea-preserving diffeomorphism. The second contains the Yukawa typeinteraction. The last possesses some non-locality because of bilinear terms of$\psi^{\cal B}_A$. The reasons why completing a Schild type superstring actionwith $\psi^{\cal B}_A$ is difficult are finally discussed.
