Some recent literature has examined the holographic-induced cosmology of abrane universe in the background of an anti-de Sitter-black hole geometry. Inthis regard, curved-brane scenarios have begun to receive considerableattention. Our current interest is in a formal discrepancy that exists betweentwo such works by Padilla (hep-th/0111247) and Youm (hep-th/0111276). Inparticular, these authors have incorporated different values for a conformalfactor that is used to relate the thermodynamics of the relevant (AdS bulk andCFT brane) spacetimes. After a more general review, we clarify this issue anddiscuss the implications on the prior results.
