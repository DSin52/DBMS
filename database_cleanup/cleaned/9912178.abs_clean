Physics, Ideas and Recent DevelopmentsA gauge transformation in quantum electrodynamics involves the product offield operators at the same space-time point and hence does not have awell-defined meaning. One way to avoid this difficulty is to generalize thegauge transformation by using different space-time points in the spirit ofDirac's point splitting. Such a generalization indeed exists and the resultinginfinitesimal gauge transformation takes the form of an infinite series in thecoupling constant. In this text I will present two examples of generalizedgauge transformations.
