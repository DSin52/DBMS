We study the one-loop effective action for $N$ 4D conformally invariantscalars on the spherically symmetric background. The main part of effectiveaction is given by integration of 4D conformal anomaly. This effective action(in large $N$ approximation and partial curvature expansion) is applied toinvestigate the quantum evolution of Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) black holesof maximal mass. We find that the effect (recently discovered by Bousso andHawking for $N$ minimal scalars and another approximate effective action) ofanti-evaporation of nearly maximal SdS (Nariai) black holes takes also place inthe model under consideration. Careful treatment of quantum corrections andperturbations modes of Nariai black hole is given being quite complicated. Itis shown that exists also perturbation where black hole radius shrinks, i.e.black hole evaporates. We point out that our result holds for wide class ofmodels including conformal scalars, spinors and vectors. Hence,anti-evaporationof SdS black holes is rather general effect which should be taken into accountin quantum gravity considerations.
