Authors: Dian-Min Tong, Shan-De Yang (Jilin University, China) and Zhong-Qi Ma

(Institute of High Energy Physics, Beijing)In this note, a new class of representations of the braid groups $B_{N}$ isconstructed. It is proved that those representations contain three kinds of$N$-dimensional one. The explicit form of the $N$-dimensional irreduciblerepresentation of the braid group $B_{N}$ is given here.
