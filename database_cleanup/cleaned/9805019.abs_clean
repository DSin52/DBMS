S-duality symmetry of type IIB string theory predicts the existence of astable non-BPS state on an orbifold five plane of the type IIB theory if theorbifold group is generated by the simultaneous action of (-1)^{F_L} and thereversal of sign of the four coordinates transverse to the orbifold plane. Wecalculate the mass of this state by starting from a pair of D-strings carryingthe same charge as this state, and then identifying the point in the modulispace where this pair develops a tachyonic mode, signalling the appearance of abound state of this configuration into the non-BPS state.
