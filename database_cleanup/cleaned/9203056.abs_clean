It is shown that the currently studied ``string-inspired'' model for gravityon a line can be formulated as a gauge invariant theory based on the Poincar\'egroup with central extension -- a formulation that complements and simplifiesH.~Verlinde's construction based on the unextended Poincar\'e group.
