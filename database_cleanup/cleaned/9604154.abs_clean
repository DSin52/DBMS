A new $N=1$ superfield model in $D=4$ flat superspace is suggested. Thismodel describes dynamics of chiral compensator and can be treated as alow-energy limit of $D=4$, $N=1$ quantum superfield supergravity.Renormalization structure of this model is studied and one-loop countertermsare calculated. It is shown that the theory is infrared free. An effectiveaction for the model under consideration is investigated in infrared domain.The lower contributions to the one-loop effective action are computed inexplicit form.
