Title: Further results on Functional Determinants of Laplacians in Simplicial

Complexesof Technology)We investigate the functional determinant of the laplacian on piece-wise flattwo-dimensional surfaces, with conical singularities in the interior and/orcorners on the boundary. Our results extend earlier investigations of thedeterminants on smooth surfaces with smooth boundaries. The differences to thesingularities than one would expect from a naive extrapolation of the resultsfor a smooth surface; and b) ``self-energies'' of the singularities.
