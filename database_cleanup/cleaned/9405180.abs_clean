We investigate the spin $1/2$ fermions on quantum two spheres. It is shownthat the wave functions of fermions and a Dirac Operator on quantum two spherescan be constructed in a manifestly covariant way under the quantum group$SU(2)_q$. The concept of total angular momentum and chirality can be expressedby using $q$-analog of Pauli-matrices and appropriate commutation relations.
