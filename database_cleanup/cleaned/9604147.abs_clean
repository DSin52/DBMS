We calculate the Kahlerian and the lowest order non-Kahlerian contributionsto the one loop effective superpotential using super-Feynman graphs in themassless Wess-Zumino Model, the massive Wess-Zumino Model and N=1, U(1) gaugetheory. We also calculate the Kahlerian term in Yang-Mills Theory for a generalgauge group. Using this latter result we find the one loop Kahleriancontribution for N=2 Yang-Mills Theory in terms of N=1 superfields and we showthat it can only come from non-holomorphic contributions to the N=2 effectivepotential.
