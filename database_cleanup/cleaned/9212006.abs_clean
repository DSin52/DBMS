These are the lecture notes for the Les Houches Summer School on QuantumGravity held in July 1992. The notes present some general critical assessmentof other (non-string) approaches to quantum gravity, and a selected set oftopics concerning what we have learned so far about the subject from stringtheory. Since these lectures are long (133 A4 pages), we include in thisabstract the table of contents, which should help the user of the bulletinboard in deciding whether to latex and print the full file.Supergravity; Kaluza-Klein theories; Quantum field theory and classicalgravity; Euclidean approach to Quantum Gravity; Canonical quantization ofgravity; Gravitational Instantons.2n dimensions; When can we expect to find anomalies?; The Atiyah-Singer Indexmechanism and Witten's SU(2) global anomaly.Quantization of the bosonic string; Interaction in string theory and thecharacterization of the moduli space; Bosonic strings with background fields.Stringy corrections to Einstein equations; Toroidal compactifications.$R$-duality; Operator formalismStrings at finite temperature; Is string theory finite?and Related Subjects
