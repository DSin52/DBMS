A low-energy background field solution describing D-membrane configurationsis constructed which is distinguished by the appearance of a Hermitian metricon the internal space. This metric is composed of a number of independentharmonic functions on the transverse space. Thus this construction generalizesthe usual harmonic superposition rule. The BPS bound of these solutions isshown to be saturated indicating that they are supersymmetric. By means ofT-duality, we construct more solutions of the IIA and IIB theories.
