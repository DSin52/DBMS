The properties of Dirac gamma matrices in a four-dimensional space-time withthe $(2,2)$ signature are studied. The basic spinors are classified, and theexistence of Majorana-Weyl spinors is noted. Supersymmetry in $2 + 2$dimensions is discussed, and the existence of the {\it real chiral} scalarsupermultiplet is discovered. Supersymmetric {\it self-dual} Yang-Millstheories and {\it self-dual} supergravity model in $2 + 2$ dimensions, that areapparently relevant to integrable systems, are formulated for the first time.
