We give a complete classification of the real forms of simple nonlinearsuperconformal algebras (SCA) and quasi-superconformal algebras (QSCA) andpresent a unified realization of these algebras with simple symmetry groups.This classification is achieved by establishing a correspondence between simplenonlinear QSCA's and SCA's and quaternionic and super-quaternionic symmetricspaces of simple Lie groups and Lie supergroups, respectively. The unifiedrealization involves a dimension zero boson (dilaton), dimension one symmetrycurrents and dimension 1/2 free bosons for QSCA'a and dimension 1/2 freefermions for SCA's. The dimension 1/2 free bosons and fermions are associatedwith the quaternionic and super-quaternionic symmetric spaces of correspondingLie groups and Lie supergroups, respectively. We conclude with a discussion ofpossible applications of our results.
