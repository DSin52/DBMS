We analyze the algebra of observables and the physical Fock space of thefinite Chern-Simons matrix model. We observe that the minimal algebra ofobservables acting on that Fock space is identical to that of the Calogeromodel. Our main result is the identification of the states in the l-th tower ofthe Chern-Simons matrix model Fock space and the states of the Calogero modelwith the interaction parameter nu=l+1. We describe quasiparticle and quasiholestates in the both models in terms of Schur functions, and discuss somenontrivial consequences of our algebraic approach.
