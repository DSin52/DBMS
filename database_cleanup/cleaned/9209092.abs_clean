The Feigin-Fuks construction of irreducible lowest-weight Virasororepresentations is reviewed using physics terminology. The procedure consistsattempt to generalize this construction to the diffeomorphism algebra in higherdimensions. The first step is straightforward, but the second is difficult, dueto the appearence of infinite Schwinger terms. This might be avoided byimposing constraints on the fields, which should be of the recently discoveredconformal type. The resulting representations are reminiscent of quantumgravity.
