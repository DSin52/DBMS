CERN-La Plata-Santiago de Compostela Workshop on Trends in TheoreticalPhysics held at La Plata in May 1997GeometryIn these lectures we present a general introduction to topological quantumfield theories. These theories are discussed in the framework of theMathai-Quillen formalism and in the context of twisted N=2 supersymmetrictheories. We discuss in detail the recent developments in Donaldson-Wittentheory obtained from the application of results based on duality for N=2supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. This involves a description of thecomputation of Donaldson invariants in terms of Seiberg-Witten invariants.Generalizations of Donaldson-Witten theory are reviewed, and the structure ofthe vacuum expectation values of their observables is analyzed in the contextof duality for the simplest case.
