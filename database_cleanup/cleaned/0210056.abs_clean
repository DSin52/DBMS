We investigate the black hole solutions in the $R^2$-gravity, where theaction contains the square of the curvature. In case that the action does notcontain the square of the Riemann tensor and in case that the $R^2$-terms arethe Gauss-Bonnet (GB) combination, we find exact solutions. We investigate thethermodynamics of these theories and find the Hawking-Page like phasetransition, which is the phase transition between the black hole (BH) spacetimeand the pure anti-deSitter (AdS) spacetime. From the viewpoint of the AdS/CFTcorrespondence, such a phase transition may correspond to thermal transition ofdual CFT.An interesting feature of $R^2$-gravity is the possibility of the negative(or zero) dS (or AdS) BH entropy, which depends on the parameters of the$R^2$-terms. We speculate that the appearence of negative entropy may indicatea new type instability where a transition between dS (AdS) BH with negativeentropy and AdS (dS) BH with positive entropy occurs.We also apply the GB gravity to the brane cosmology, where the brane moves inthe bulk AdS BH spacetime. By investigating the FRW-like equation, whichdescribes the motion of the brane, we find the behavior of the matter on thebrane. When the radius of the brane is large, the matter fields behave as CFTbut when the radius is small, the brane universe behaves as the universe withdust or curvature dominant universe, depending on the parameters.
