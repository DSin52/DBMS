Complete constraint analysis and choice of gauge conditions consistent withequations of motion is done for Abelian Chern Simons field interactingminimally with a complex scalar field. The Dirac-Schwinger consistencycondition is satisfied by the reduced phase space Hamiltonian density withrespect to the the Dirac bracket. It is shown that relativistic invarianceunder boosts can be obtained only if gauge conditions were chosen consistentwith the equations of motion. Moreover all gauge invariant quantities are shownto be free of transformation anomaly.
