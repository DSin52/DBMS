We analyze the hypermultiplet moduli space describing the universal sector oftype IIA theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold. The classical modulispace is described in terms of the coset $SU(2,1)/U(2)$. The flux quantizationcondition of the antisymmetric tensor field of M-theory implies discreteidentifications for the scalar fields describing this four- dimensionalquaternionic geometry. Non-perturbative corrections of the classical theory aredescribed in terms of a membrane- fivebrane instanton action which we constructherein.
