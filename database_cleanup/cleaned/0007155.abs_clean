Starting from the Moyal formulation of M-theory in the large N-limit, wepropose to reexamine the associated membrane equations of motion in 10dimensions formulated in terms of Poisson bracket. Among the results obtained,we rewrite the coupled first order Nahm's equations into a simple form leadingin turn to their systematic relation with $SU(\infty)$ Yang Mills equations ofmotion. The former are interpreted as the vanishing condition of some conservedcurrents which we propose. We develop also an algebraic analysis in which anansatz is considered and find an explicit form for the membrane solution of ourproblem. Typical solutions known in literature can also emerge as special casesof the proposed solution
