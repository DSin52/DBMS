We consider the $N\!=\!1$ supersymmetric $\sigma$-model and we examine thetransformation properties of the partition function under target-space duality.Contrary to what one would expect, we find that it is not, in general,invariant. In fact, besides the dilaton shift emerging from the Jacobian of theduality transformation of the bosonic part, there also exist a Jacobian for thefermionic part since fermions are also transform under the duality process. Thelatter is just the parity of the spin structure of the word sheet and since itcannot be compensated, the dual theory is not equvalent to the original one.
