We present a systematic study of high energy scattering of non-abelian gaugeparticles in (3+1) dimensional Einstein gravity using semi-classical techniquesof Verlinde and Verlinde. It is shown that the BRST gauge invariance of theYang-Mills action in presence of quantum gravity at Planckian energy regime ismaintained and the vertex operator is invariant under the BRST transformations.The presence of gravitational shock wave describing the gauge particles isdiscussed in the resulting (3+1) dimensional effective theory of Yang-Millsgravity.
