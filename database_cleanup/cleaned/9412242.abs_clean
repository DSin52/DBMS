Title: From N=2 Fermionic Strings to Superstrings?

Comments: 15 pages, latex, no figures, macros included, 52 kb Talk at Symposium

in Wendisch-Rietz, 8/94I review the covariant quantization of the critical $N{=}2$ fermionic stringwith and without a global ${\bf Z}_2$ twist. The BRST analysis yields masslessbosonic and fermionic vertex operators in various ghost and picture numbersectors, as well as picture-changers and their inverses, depending on the fieldbasis chosen for bosonization. Two distinct GSO projections exist, one(untwisted) retaining merely the known bosonic scalar and its spectral-flowpartner, the other (twisted) yielding two fermions and one boson, on themassless level. The absence of interactions in the latter case rules outstandard spacetime supersymmetry. In the untwisted theory, the$U(1,1)$-invariant three-point and vanishing four-point functions are confirmedat tree level. I comment on the $N{=}2$ string field theory, the integrationover moduli and the realization of spectral flow.
