When gravity couples to scalar fields in Anti-de Sitter space, the geometrybecomes non-AdS and develops singularities generally. We propose a criterionthat the singularity is physically admissible if the integral of the on-shellLagrangian density over the finite range is finite everywhere. For all classesof the singularities studied here, the criterion suggested in this papercoincides with an independent proposal made by Gubser that the potential shouldbe bounded from above in the solution. This gives a reason why Gubser'sconjecture works.
