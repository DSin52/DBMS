We investigate the relation between instantons and monopoles in the LaplacianAbelian Gauge using analytical methods in the continuum. Our starting point isthe fact that the 't Hooft instanton with its high symmetry leads to apointlike defect with Hopf invariant one. In order to generalise this result wepartly break the symmetry by a local perturbation. We find that for genericconfigurations near the 't Hooft instanton the defects become loops. Theanalytical results show explicitly that these defects are magnetic monopoleswith unit charge. In addition, the monopoles are twisted to account for theinstanton number of the background.
