We discuss the physics of a single Dp-brane in the presence of a backgroundelectromagnetic field B_{ij}. It has recently been shown \cite{SW} that, in aspecific \alpha ' \to 0 limit, the physics of the brane is correctly describedby noncommutative Yang-Mills theory, where the noncommutative gauge potentialis given explicitly in terms of the ordinary U(1) field. In a previous paper\cite{SC} the physics of a D2-brane was analyzed in the Sen-Seiberg limit ofM(atrix) theory by considering a specific coordinate change on the braneworld-volume. We show in this note that the limit considered in \cite{SC} isthe same as the one described in \cite{SW}, in the specific case p=2, rk B_{ij}= 2. Moreover we show that the coordinate change in \cite{SC} can bereinterpreted, in the spirit of \cite{SW}, as a field redefinition of theordinary Yang-Mills field, and we prove that the transformations agree forlarge backgrounds. The results are finally used to considerably streamline theproof of the equivalence of the standard Born-Infeld action with noncommutativeYang-Mills theory, in the large wave-length regime.
