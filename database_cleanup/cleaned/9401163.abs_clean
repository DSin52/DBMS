In the context of the fractional quantum Hall effect, we investigateLaughlin's celebrated ansatz for the groud state wave function at fractionalfilling of the lowest Landau level. Interpreting its normalization in terms ofa one component plasma, we find the effect of an additional quadrupolar fieldon the free energy, and derive estimates for the thermodynamically equivalentspherical plasma. In a second part, we present various methods for expandingthe wave function in terms of Slater determinants, and obtain sum rules for thecoefficients. We also address the apparently simpler question of counting thenumber of such Slater states using the theory of integral polytopes.
