Title: The Meaning of Maximal Symmetry in Presence of Torsion

Authors: Debashis Gangopadhyay and Soumitra Sengupta

Comments: latex, 12 pages

We show that the usual physical meaning of maximal symmetry can be made toremain unaltered even if torsion is present. All that is required is that thetorsion fields satisfy some mutually consistent constraints. We also give anexplicit realisation of such a scenario by determining the torsion fields, themetric and the associated Killing vectors.
