The possibility that extremely long-lived, time-dependent, and localizedfield configurations (``oscillons'') arise during the collapse of asymmetricalbubbles in 2+1 dimensional phi^4 models is investigated. It is found thatoscillons can develop from a large spectrum of elliptically deformed bubbles.symmetric; and b) linearly stable against small arbitrary radial and angularperturbations. The latter is based on a dynamical approach designed toinvestigate the stability of nonintegrable time-dependent configurations thatis capable of probing slowly-growing instabilities not seen through the usual``spectral'' method.
