Using the method of renormalization group, we improve the two-loop effectivepotential of the massive $\phi^4$ theory to obtain the next-next-to-leadinglogarithm correction in the $\bar{MS}$ scheme. Our result well reproduces thenext-next-to-leading logarithm parts of the ordinary loop expansion resultknown up to the four-loop order.
