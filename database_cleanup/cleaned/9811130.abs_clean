The N=1 superspace generalization of the 3-brane action in 6 dimensions withpartially broken N=2 supersymmetry can be constructed using N=1 chiral, complexlinear, or real linear superfields. The physical scalars of these multipletsgive equivalent descriptions of the two transverse coordinates. The secondsupersymmetry is realized nonlinearly in all these actions. We derive thesuperspace brane actions and their nonlinear supersymmetry for both kinds oflinear superfields when we break N=2 supersymmetry spontaneously. This breakingis realized in the free action of hypermultiplets that live in N=2 projectivesuperspace by constraining the N=2 multiplets to reduce them to a pureGoldstone multiplet. For the chiral superfield, the superspace brane action andnonlinear supersymmetry can be deduced by dualizing the brane action of eitherlinear superfield. We find that the dual action is unique up to fieldredefinitions that introduce arbitrariness in the dependence on the auxiliaryfields.
