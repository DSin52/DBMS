We present a detailed analysis of the domain walls in supersymmetricgluodynamics and SQCD. We use the (corrected) Veneziano-Yankielowicz effectiveLagrangians to explicitely obtain the wall profiles and check recent results ofthe walls; (ii) the exact expressions for the wall energy density which dependonly on global features of dynamics (the existence of a non-trivial centralextension of N=1 superalgebra in the theories which admit wall-like solutions).If supersymmetry is softly broken by the gluino mass, the degeneracy of thedistinct vacua is gone, and one can consider the decay rate of the "false"vacuum into the genuine one. We do this calculation in the limit of the smallgluino mass. Finally, we comment on the controversy regarding the existence of$N$ distinct chirally asymmetric vacua in SU(N) SUSY gluodynamics.
