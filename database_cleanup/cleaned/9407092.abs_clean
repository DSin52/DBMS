Title: Realization of compact Lie algebras in K\"ahler manifolds

Journal-ref: J.Phys. A27 (1994) 6287-6298

The Berezin quantization on a simply connected homogeneous K\"{a}hlermanifold, which is considered as a phase space for a dynamical system, enablesa description of the quantal system in a (finite-dimensional) Hilbert space ofholomorphic functions corresponding to generalized coherent states. The Liealgebra associated with the manifold symmetry group is given in terms offirst-order differential operators. In the classical theory, the Lie algebra isrepresented by the momentum maps which are functions on the manifold, and theLie product is the Poisson bracket given by the K\"{a}hler structure. TheK\"{a}hler potentials are constructed for the manifolds related to all compactsemi-simple Lie groups. The complex coordinates are introduced by means of theBorel method. The K\"{a}hler structure is obtained explicitly for any unitarygroup representation. The cocycle functions for the Lie algebra and the Killingvector fields on the manifold are also obtained.
