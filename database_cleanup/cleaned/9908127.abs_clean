Comments: 12 pages, REVTeX, some typographical errors and few mistakes in the

references are corrected. Few comments are addedSolvable and Integrable SystemsA method is developed to construct the solutions of one and many variable,linear differential equations of arbitrary order. Using this, the $N$-particleSutherland model, with pair-wise inverse sine-square interactions among theparticles, is shown to be equivalent to free particles on a circle.Applicability of our method to many other few and many-body problems is alsoillustrated.
