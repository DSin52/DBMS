We investigate the embedding variable approach to geometrodynamics advocatedin work by Isham, Kucha\v{r} and Unruh for a general class of coordinateconditions that mirror the Isham-Kucha\v{r} Gaussian condition but allow forarbitrary algebraic complexity. We find that the same essential structurepresent in the ultralocal Gaussian condition is repeated in the general case.The resultant embedding--extended phase space contains a full representation ofthe Lie algebra of the spacetime diffeomorphism group as well as a consistentpure gravity sector.
