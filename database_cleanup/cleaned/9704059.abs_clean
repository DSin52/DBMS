In this paper we discuss some aspects of N=1 type I-heterotic string dualityin four dimensions. We consider a particular example of a (weak-weak) dual pairwhere on the type I side there are only D9-branes corresponding to perturbativeheterotic description in a certain region of the moduli space. We match theperturbative type I and heterotic tree-level massless spectra via givingcertain scalars appropriate vevs, and point out the crucial role of theperturbative superpotential (on the heterotic side) for this matching. We alsodiscuss the role of anomalous U(1) gauge symmetry present in both type I andheterotic models. In the perturbative regime we match the (tree-level) modulispaces of these models. Since both type I and heterotic models can be treatedperturbatively, we are able to discuss a dictionary that in generic models mapstype I description onto heterotic one, and vice-versa. Finally, we discusspossible directions to study perturbative quantum corrections to the modulispace, as well as outline ways to learn about the non-perturbative effects inboth descriptions.
