We propose a universal geometric construction of complex non-Kaehlermanifolds with intrinsic SU(3) structure, used in supersymmetric stringcompactifications. All these manifolds are some T^2 fibrations over aCalabi-Yau base. We show that the conditions of N=1 supersymmetry in theheterotic string theory specify a subclass of manifolds that we constructed,which generalizes the examples known in the literature. Moreover, many knownexamples of internal manifolds in type II string compactifications can also bedescribed in our construction, although supersymmetry restrictions of thegeometry are not known yet. Mathematically, we construct complex, Hermitiannon-Kaehler (n+1)-folds with a holomorphically trivial canonical bundlefibering over Calabi-Yau n-folds. We show that one can lift Special Lagrangiansubmanifolds and fibrations from the base Calabi-Yau to Special Lagrangian(calibrated) submanifolds and fibrations upstairs. We discuss in detail theexample with the compact K3 CY as the base manifold.
