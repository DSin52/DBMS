We analyse dependence of the partition function on the boundary condition forthe longitudinal component of the electric field strength in gauge fieldtheories. In a physical gauge the Gauss law constraint may be resolvedexplicitly expressing this component via an integral of the physicaltransversal variables. In particular, we study quantum electrodynamics with anexternal charge and SU(2) gluodynamics. We find that only a charge distributionslowly decreasing at spatial infinity can produce a nontrivial dependence inthe Abelian theory. However, in gluodynamics for temperatures below somecritical value the partition function acquires a delta-function like dependenceon the boundary condition, which leads to colour confinement.
