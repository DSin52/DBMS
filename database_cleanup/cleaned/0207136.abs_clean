The AdS/dCFT correspondence is used to show that a planar q-dimensionalsuperconformal CFT defect expands, under the addition of electric charge andangular momentum, to a supersymmetric higher-dimensional defect of geometry R^qx C, where C is an arbitrary curve. The dual string theory process is theexpansion of D-branes and fundamental strings into a supertube in an AdSbackground.
