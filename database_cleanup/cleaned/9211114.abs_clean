Boundary conditions compatible with integrability are obtained for twodimensional models by solving the factorizability equations for the reflectionmatrices $K^{\pm}(\theta)$. For the six vertex model the general solutiondepending on four arbitrary parameters is found. For the $A_{n-1}$ models alldiagonal solutions are found. The associated integrable magnetic Hamiltoniansare explicitly derived.
