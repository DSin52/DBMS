Title: On Poisson-Lie structure on the external algebra of the classical Lie

groupsComments: 12 pages

The general expression for the bicovariant bracket for odd generators of theexternal algebra on a Poisson-Lie group is given. It is shown that the gradedPoisson-Lie structures derived before for $GL(N)$ and $SL(N)$ are the specialcases of this bracket. The formula is the universal one and can be applied tothe case of any matrix Lie group.
