In this letter we introduce a generalization of the Knizhnik- Zamolodchikovequations from affine Lie algebras to a wide class of conformal field theories(not necessarily rational). The new equations describe correlations functionsof primary fields and of a finite number of their descendents. Our proposal isbased on Nahm's concept of small spaces which provide adequate substitutes forthe lowest energy subspaces in modules of affine Lie algebras. We explain howto construct the first order differential equations and investigate propertiesof the associated connections, thereby preparing the grounds for an analysis ofquantum symmetries. The general considerations are illustrated in examples ofVirasoro minimal models.
