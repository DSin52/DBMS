The time dependent-integrals of motion, linear in position and momentumoperators, of a quantum system are extracted from Noether's theoremprescription by means of special time-dependent variations of coordinates. Forthe stationary case of the generalized two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, thetime-independent integrals of motion are shown to correspond to specialBragg-type symmetry properties. A detailed study for the non-stationary case ofthis quantum system is presented. The linear integrals of motion areconstructed explicitly for the case of varying mass and coupling strength. Theyare obtained also from Noether's theorem. The general treatment for amulti-dimensional quadratic system is indicated, and it is shown that thetime-dependent variations that give rise to the linear invariants, as conservedquantities, satisfy the corresponding classical homogeneous equations of motionfor the coordinates.
