We consider quon statistics in a dynamically evolving curved spacetime inwhich prior to some initial time and subsequent to some later time is flat. Byconsidering the Bogoliubov transformations associated with gravitationallyinduced particle creation, we find that the consistent evolution of thegeneralized commutation relations from the first flat region to the second flatregion can only occur if $q = \pm 1$.
