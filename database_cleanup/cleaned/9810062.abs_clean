We show that the Casimir, or zero-point, energy of a dilute dielectric ball,or of a spherical bubble in a dielectric medium, coincides with the sum of thevan der Waals energies between the molecules that make up the medium. Thatenergy, which is finite and repulsive when self-energy and surface effects areremoved, may be unambiguously calculated by either dimensional continuation orby zeta function regularization. This physical interpretation of the Casimirenergy seems unambiguous evidence that the bulk self-energy cannot be relevantto sonoluminescence.
