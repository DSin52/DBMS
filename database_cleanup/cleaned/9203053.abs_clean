We provide a non-perturbative geometrical characterization of the partitionfunction of $n$-dimensional quantum gravity based on a coarse classification ofriemannian geometries. We show that, under natural geometrical constraints, thetheory admits a continuum limit with a non-trivial phase structure parametrizedby the homotopy types of the class of manifolds considered. The resultsobtained qualitatively coincide, when specialized to dimension two, with thoseof two-dimensional quantum gravity models based on random triangulations ofsurfaces.
