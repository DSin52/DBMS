The integrality of Ooguri-Vafa disk invariants is verified using discretesymmetries of the superpotential of the mirror Landau-Ginzburg theory tocalculate quantum corrections to the boundary variables. We show that thesequantum corrections are completely determined if we assume that the discretesymmetry of the superpotential also holds in terms of the quantum correctedvariables. We discuss the case of local P^2 blown up at three points and localF_2 blown up at two points in detail.
