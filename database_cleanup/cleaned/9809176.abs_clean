Title: Perturbative String Dynamics Near the Photon Sphere

Authors: Mariusz P. Dabrowski and Alexander A. Zheltukhin

Comments: REVTEX, 8 pages, no figures

String dynamics near the photon sphere in Schwarzschild spacetime isconsidered on the basis of a perturbative approach with respect to a rescaledstring tension as a small parameter. The perturbative string solution in thezeroth and first approximation is presented. The perturbative solutioncorresponds to a small deformations of the photon sphere in Schwarzschildspacetime.
