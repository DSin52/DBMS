Title: All-orders finite $N=1$ super-Yang-Mills Theories

Comments: 6 pages, no figures, plain LATEX file

I present a criterion for all-order finiteness in $N=1$ SYM theories. Thestructure of the supercurrent anomaly, the Callan-Symanzik equation and thesupersymmetric non-renormalization theorem for chiral anomalies are theessential ingredients of the proof.
