We construct a four dimensional chiral N=1 space-time supersymmetricperturbative Type I vacuum corresponding to a compactification on a toroidalZ_2 X Z_2 X Z_3 orbifold with a discrete Wilson line. This model isnon-perturbative from the heterotic viewpoint. It has three chiral families inthe SU(4)_c X SU(2)_w X U(1) subgroup of the total gauge group. We compute thetree-level superpotential in this model. There appears to be no obviousobstruction to Higgs the gauge group down to SU(3)_c X SU(2)_w X U(1)_Y andobtain the Standard Model gauge group with three chiral families.
