We develop a systematic approach to G_2 holonomy manifolds with anSU(2)xSU(2) isometry using maximal eight-dimensional gauged supergravity todescribe D6-branes wrapped on deformed three-spheres. A quite general metricansatz that generalizes the celebrated Bryant-Salamon metric involves ninefunctions. We show that only six of them are the independent ones and derivethe general first order system of differential equations that they obey. As abyproduct of our analysis, we generalize the notion of the twist that relatesthe spin and gauge connections in a way that involves non-trivially the scalarfields.
