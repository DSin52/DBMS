Two-dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills theory is endowed with a non-trivial vacuumstructure (k-sectors). The presence of k-sectors modifies the energy spectrumof the theory and its instanton content, the (Euclidean) space-time beingcompactified on a sphere. For the exact solution, in the limit in which thesphere is decompactified, a k-sector can be mimicked by the presence ofk-fundamental charges at infinity, according to a Witten's suggestion. However,this property neither holds before decompactification nor for the genuineperturbative solution which corresponds to the zero-instanton contribution onthe sphere.
