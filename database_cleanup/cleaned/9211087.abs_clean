We consider the q-deformed Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation for the two pointfunction of q-deformed vertex operators of $U_q(sl_2^)$. We give explicitly thefundamental solutions, the connection matrices and the exchange relations forthe q-vertex operators of spin 1/2 and $j \in {1\over 2}{\bf Z}_{\geq 0}$.Consequently, we confirm that the connection matrices are equivalent to theelliptic Boltzman weights of IRF type obtained by the fusion procedure from ABFmodels.
