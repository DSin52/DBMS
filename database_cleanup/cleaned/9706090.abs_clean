We prove D=11 supermembrane theories wrapping around in an irreducible wayover $S^{1} \times S^{1}\times M^{9}$ on the target manifold, have ahamiltonian with strict minima and without infinite dimensional valleys at theminima for the bosonic sector. The minima occur at monopole connections of anassociated U(1) bundle over topologically non trivial Riemann surfaces ofarbitrary genus. Explicit expressions for the minimal connections in terms ofmembrane maps are presented. The minimal maps and corresponding connectionssatisfy the BPS condition with half SUSY.
