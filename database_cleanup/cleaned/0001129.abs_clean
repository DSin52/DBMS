The perturbative treatment of quantum field theory is formulated within theframework of algebraic quantum field theory. We show that the algebra ofinteracting fields is additive, i.e. fully determined by its subalgebrasassociated to arbitrary small subregions of Minkowski space. We also give analgebraic formulation of the loop expansion by introducing a projective system${\cal A}^{(n)}$ of observables ``up to $n$ loops'' where ${\cal A}^{(0)}$ isthe Poisson algebra of the classical field theory. Finally we give a localalgebraic formulation for two cases of the quantum action principle and compareit with the usual formulation in terms of Green's functions.
