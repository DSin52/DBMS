We determine the non-abelian Born-Infeld action, including fermions, as itresults from the four-point tree-level open superstring scattering amplitudesat order alpha'^2. We find that, after an appropriate field redefinition allterms at this order can be written as a symmetrised trace. We confront thisaction with the results that follow from kappa-symmetry and conclude that therecently proposed non-abelian kappa-symmetry cannot be extended to cubic ordersin the Born-Infeld curvature.
