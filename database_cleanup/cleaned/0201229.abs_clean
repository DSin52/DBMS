A previous calculation on the tachyon state arising as fluctuations of a $D$brane in vacuum string field theory is extended to include the vector state. Weuse the boundary conformal field theory approach of Rastelli, Sen and Zwiebachto construct a vector state. It is shown that the vector field satisfies thelinearized equations of motion provided the two conditions $k^2=0$ and $k^\muA_\mu=0$ are satisfied. Earlier calculations using Fock space techniques byHata and Kawano have found massless vector states that are not necessarilytransverse.
