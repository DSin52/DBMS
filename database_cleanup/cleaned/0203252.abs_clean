Comments: Written version of the review lecture presented during the winter

school Geometry and Physics (Srni, Czech Republic, 12. - 19. January 2002),submitted to its proceedings. Latex, 13 pp, 2 figuresUsing a PT symmetric regularization technique we reminad the reader that andhow (a) the SUSY is re-established between the two shifted harmonic oscillatorpotentials $ V(q)=q^2+{G}/{q^2}+ const$ and (b) many non-equivalent Hermitianand non-Hermitian (PT symmetric) systems may often be studied in parallel (witha schematic solvable illustrative example added).
