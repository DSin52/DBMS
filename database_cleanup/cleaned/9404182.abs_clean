publication in Phys.Rev.D(Rapid Communications) )We present two examples of parity-invariant $[U(1)]^{2}$ Chern-Simons-Higgsmodels with spontaneously broken symmetry. The models possess topologicalvortex excitations. It is argued that the smallest possible flux quanta arecomposites of one quantum of each type $(1,1)$. These hybrid anyons willdominate the statistical properties near the ground state. We analyse theirstatistical interactions and find out that unlike in the case of Jackiw-Pisolitons there is short range magnetic interaction which can lead to formationof bound states of hybrid anyons. In addition to mutual interactions theypossess internal structure which can lead upon quantisation to discretespectrum of energy levels.
