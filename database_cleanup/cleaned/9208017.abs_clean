Coherent states $(CS)$ of the $SU(N)$ groups are constructed explicitly andtheir properties are investigated. They represent a nontrivial generalizationof the spining $CS$ of the $SU(2)$ group. The $CS$ are parametrized by thepoints of the coset space, which is, in that particular case, the projectivespace $CP^{N-1}$ and plays the role of the phase space of a correspondingclassical mechanics. The $CS$ possess of a minimum uncertainty, they minimizean invariant dispersion of the quadratic Casimir operator. The classical limitis ivestigated in terms of symbols of operators. The role of the Planckconstant playes $h=P^{-1}$, where $P$ is the signature of the representation.The classical limit of the so called star commutator generates the Poissonbracket in the $CP^{N-1}$ phase space. The logarithm of the modulus of the $CS$overlapping, being interpreted as a symmetric in the space, gives theFubini-Study metric in $CP^{N-1}$. The $CS$ constructed are useful for thequasi-classical analysis of the quantum equations of the $SU(N)$ gaugesymmetric theories.
