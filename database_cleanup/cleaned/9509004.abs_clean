We study the perturbation theory for the general non-integrable chiral Pottsmodel depending on two chiral angles and a strength parameter and show how theanalyticity of the ground state energy and correlation functions dramaticallyincreases when the angles and the strength parameter satisfy the integrabilitycondition. We further specialize to the superintegrable case and verify that asum rule is obeyed.
