Over the past decade it has become clear that fundamental strings are not theonly fundamental degrees of freedom in string theory. D-branes are also part ofthe spectrum of fundamental states. In this paper we explore some possibleeffects of D-branes on early Universe string cosmology, starting with two keydense, hot gas in which all degrees of freedom were in thermal equilibrium, andsecondly that the topology of the background space admits one-cycles. We argueby t-duality that in this context the cosmological singularities are notpresent. We derive the equation of state of the brane gases and apply theresults to suggest that, in an expanding background, the winding modes offundamental strings will play the most important role at late times. Inparticular, we argue that the string winding modes will only allow fourspace-time dimensions to become large. The presence of brane winding modes with$p > 1$ may lead to a hierarchy in the sizes of the extra dimensions.
