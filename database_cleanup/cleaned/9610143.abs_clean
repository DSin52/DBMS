The phase structure of the scalar field theory with arbitrary powers of thegradient operator and a local non-analytic potential is investigated by thehelp of the RG in Euclidean space. The RG equation for the generating functionof the derivative part of the action is derived. Infinitely many non-trivialfixed points of the RG transformations are found. The corresponding effectiveactions are unbounded from below and do probably not exhibit any particlecontent. Therefore they do not provide physically sensible theories.
