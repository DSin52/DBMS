A universal Lagrangian that defines various four-dimensional massiveYang-Mills theories without Higgs bosons is presented. Each of the theories ischaracterized by a constant k contained in the Lagrangian. For k=0, theLagrangian reduces to one defining the topologically massive Yang-Mills theory,and for k=1, the Lagrangian reduces to one defining the Freedman-Townsendmodel. New massive Yang-Mills theories are obtained by choosing k to be realnumbers other than 0 and 1.
