We consider various aspects of compactifications of the Type I/heterotic$Spin(32)/\Z_2$ theory on K3. One family of such compactifications includes thestandard embedding of the spin connection in the gauge group, and is on thesame moduli space as the compactification of the heterotic $E_8\times E_8$theory on K3 with instanton numbers (8,16). Another class, which includes anorbifold of the Type I theory recently constructed by Gimon and Polchinski andwhose field theory limit involves some topological novelties, is on the modulispace of the heterotic $E_8\times E_8$ theory on K3 with instanton numbers(12,12). These connections between $Spin(32)/\Z_2$ and $E_8\times E_8$ modelscan be demonstrated by T duality, and permit a better understanding ofnon-perturbative gauge fields in the (12,12) model. In the transformationbetween $Spin(32)/\Z_2$ and $E_8\times E_8$ models, the strong/weak couplingduality of the (12,12) $E_8\times E_8$ model is mapped to T duality in the TypeI theory. The gauge and gravitational anomalies in the Type I theory arecanceled by an extension of the Green-Schwarz mechanism.
