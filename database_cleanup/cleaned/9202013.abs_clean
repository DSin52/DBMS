Within the standard quantum mechanics a q-deformation of the simplest N=2supersymmetry algebra is suggested. Resulting physical systems do not haveconserved charges and degeneracies in the spectra. Instead, superpartnerHamiltonians are q-isospectral, i.e. the spectrum of one can be obtained fromanother by the q^2-factor scaling. A special class of the self-similarpotentials is shown to obey the dynamical conformal symmetry algebra su_q(1,1).These potentials exhibit exponential spectra and corresponding raising andlowering operators satisfy the q-deformed harmonic oscillator algebra ofBiedenharn and Macfarlane.
