In this paper a non-relativistic particle moving on a hypersurface in acurved space and the multidimensional rotator are investigated using theHamilton-Jacobi formalism. The equivalence with the Dirac Hamiltonian formalismis demonstrated in both Cartesian and curvilinear coordinates. The energyspectrum of the multidimensional rotator is equal to that of a pureLaplace-Beltrami operator with no additional constant arising from thecurvature of the sphere.
