Integral representation for the eigenfunctions of quantum periodic Toda chainis constructed for N-particle case. The multiple integral is calculated usingthe Cauchy residue formula. This gives the representation which reproduces theparticular results obtained by Gutzwiller for N=2,3 and 4-particle chain. Ourmethod to solve the problem combines the ideas of Gutzwiller and R-matrixapproach of Sklyanin with the classical results in the theory of the Whittakerfunctions. In particular, we calculate Sklyanin's invariant scalar product fromthe Plancherel formula for the Whittaker functions derived bySemenov-Tian-Shansky thus obtaining the natural interpretation of the Sklyaninmeasure in terms of the Harish-Chandra function.
