We study the invariant unstable manifold of the trivial renormalization groupfixed point tangent to the $\phi^{4}$-vertex in three dimensions. Weparametrize it by a running $\phi^{4}$-coupling with linear step$\beta$-function. It is shown to have a renormalized double expansion in therunning coupling and its logarithm.
