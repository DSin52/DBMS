Recently N. Seiberg has shown that certain N=1 supersymmetric Yang -- Millstheories have the property that their infrared physics can be equivalentlydescribed by {\it two different} gauge theories, with the strong couplingregion of one corresponding to the weak coupling region of the other. Thisduality leads to interesting results about the infrared dynamics of thesetheories. We generalize Seiberg's ideas to a new class of models for which asimilar duality allows one to obtain rather detailed dynamical informationabout the long distance physics.
