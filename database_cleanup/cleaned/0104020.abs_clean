We generalize the Goldberger-Wise mechanism and study the stability of theCrystal Universe models. We show that the model can be stabilized, however forconfigurations of Crystal Universe in the absence of fine-tuning, branecrystals are not equidistant, i.e. a $"-+"$ pair is far away from adjacent$"-+"$ pair, except for the fixed points of the orbifold, which differs fromthe assumptions taken in the literature.
