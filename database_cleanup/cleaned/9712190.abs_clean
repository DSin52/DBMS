Comments: 15 pages, LATEX with no macros, To appear in Proceedings of the

CRM-FIELDS-CAP Workshop "Solitons" at Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario,July 1997 (Springer, New York 1998)Intrinsically stable or `fundamental' solitons may be decorated withconserved charges which are pieces of those carried by elementary particles inthe same medium. These `hairs' are always significant in principle, and in thestrong-coupling regime (where solitons and particles exchange roles) may becomemajor factors in dynamics.
