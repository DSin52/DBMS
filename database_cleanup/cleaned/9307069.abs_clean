Title: On the Necessity of Rational Velocities

Authors: M.C. Nemes and Saulo C.S. Silva

Comments: 4 pages IFUSP/P-1058

In the present contribution we propose a gedankenexperiment in which therestriction of rational values on the velocities emerges as a necessarycondition from Classical Electromagnetism and Quantum Mechanics. Thisrestriction is shown to be intimately connected to Dirac's electric chargequantization condition.
