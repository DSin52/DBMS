Recently effective actions have been extensively used to describe tachyoncondensation in string theory. While the various effective actions which haveappeared in the literature have very similar properties for staticconfigurations, they differ for time-dependent tachyons. In this paper wediscuss general properties of non-linear effective Lagrangians which are firstorder in derivatives. In particular we show that some observed properties, suchas asymptotically vanishing pressure, are rather generic features, although thequantative features differ. On the other hand we argue that certain features ofmarginal tachyon profiles are beyond the reach of any first order Lagrangiandescription. We also point out that an effective action, proposed earlier,captures the dynamics of tachyons well.
