Quantum field theory of space-like particles is investigated in the frameworkof absolute causality scheme preserving Lorentz symmetry. It is related to anappropriate choice of the synchronization procedure (definition of time). Inthis formulation existence of field excitations (tachyons) distinguishes aninertial frame (privileged frame of reference) via spontaneous breaking of theso called synchronization group. In this scheme relativity principle is brokenbut Lorentz symmetry is exactly preserved in agreement with local properties ofthe observed world. It is shown that tachyons are associated with unitaryorbits of Poincar\'e mappings induced from $SO(2)$ little group instead of$SO(2,1)$ one. Therefore the corresponding elementary states are labelled byhelicity. The cases of the helicity $\lambda = 0$ and $\lambda =\pm\frac{1}{2}$ are investigated in detail and a corresponding consistent fieldtheory is proposed. In particular, it is shown that the Dirac-like equationproposed by Chodos et al., inconsistent in the standard formulation of QFT, canbe consistently quantized in the presented framework. This allows us to treatmore seriously possibility that neutrinos might be fermionic tachyons as it issuggested by experimental data about neutrino masses.
