In this paper we calculate the effects produced by temperature in therenormalized vaccum expectation value of the square of the massless scalarfield in the pointlike global monopole spacetime. In order to develop thiscalculation, we had to construct the Euclidean thermal Green functionassociated with this field in this background. We also calculate thehigh-temperature limit for the thermal average of the zero-zero component ofthe energy-momentum tensor.
