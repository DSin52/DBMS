Title: On Coherent States and q-Deformed Algebras

Authors: Demosthenes Ellinas

Comments: Presented at the 'International Symposium on Coherent States' June

1993, USA 14 pages, plain LATEX, FTUV/93-37, IFIC/93-20We review some aspects of the relation between ordinary coherent states andq-deformed generalized coherent states with some of the simplest cases ofquantum Lie algebras. In particular, new properties of (q-)coherent states areutilized to provide a path integral formalism allowing to study a modified formof q-classical mechanics, to probe some geometrical consequences of theq-deformation and finally to construct Bargmann complex analytic realizationsfor some quantum algebras.
