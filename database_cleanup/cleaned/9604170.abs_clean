We consider 4D quantum-dilaton gravity with the most general coupling in ahomogeneous and isotropic universe, especially an inflationary one, which isessentially characterized by an exponentially expanding scale factor with time.We show that on the inflationary background this theory can be miraculouslyrenormalized, at least at the one-loop level, which must be an effective theoryduring the inflation of the un-constructed complete quantum theory of gravity.
