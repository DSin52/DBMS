renormalizability proof for noncommutative Maxwell theory turned out to beincomplete, therefore, we have to restrict the proof to the noncommutativephoton self-energyJournal-ref: JHEP 0106 (2001) 013

We show that the photon self-energy in quantum electrodynamics onnoncommutative $\mathbb{R}^4$ is renormalizable to all orders (both in $\theta$and $\hbar$) when using the Seiberg-Witten map. This is due to the enormousfreedom in the Seiberg-Witten map which represents field redefinitions andgenerates all those gauge invariant terms in the $\theta$-deformed classicalaction which are necessary to compensate the divergences coming from loopintegrations.
