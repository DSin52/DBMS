We revisit the quantization of matter-coupled, two-dimensional dilatongravity. At the classical level and with a cosmological term, a series of fieldtransformations leads to a set of free fields of indefinite signature. Withoutmatter the system is represented by two scalar fields of opposite signature.With a particular quantization for the scalar with negative kinetic energy, thesystem has zero central charge and we find some physical states satisfying {\itall} the Virasoro conditions. With matter, the constraints cannot be solvedbecause of the Virasoro anomaly. We discuss two avenues for consistentavenue appears to lead to very few physical states. The second, which roughlycorresponds to satisfying half of the Virasoro conditions, results in a richspectrum of physical states. This spectrum, however, differs significantly fromthat of free matter fields propagating on flat two-dimensional space-time.
