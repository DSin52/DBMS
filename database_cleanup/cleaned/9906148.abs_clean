We discuss supersymmetry breaking in the field-theoretical limit of thestrongly-coupled heterotic string compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold, fromthe different perspectives of four and five dimensions. The former applies tolight degrees of freedom below the threshold for five-dimensional Kaluza-Kleinexcitations, whereas the five-dimensional perspective is also valid up to theCalabi-Yau scale. We show how, in the latter case, two gauge sectors separatedin the fifth dimension are combined to form a consistent four-dimensionalsupergravity. In the lowest order of the $\kappa^{2/3}$ expansion, we show howa four-dimensional supergravity with gauge kinetic function $f_{1,2}=S$ isreproduced, and we show how higher-order terms give rise to four-dimensionaloperators that differ in the two gauge sectors. In the four-dimensionalapproach, supersymmetry is seen to be broken when condensates form on one orboth walls, and the goldstino may have a non-zero dilatino component. As in thefive-dimensional approach, the Lagrangian is not a perfect square, and we havenot identified a vacuum with broken supersymmetry and zero vacuum energy. Wederive soft supersymmetry-breaking terms for non-standard perturbativeembeddings, that are relevant in more general situations such as type I/typeIIB orientifold models.
