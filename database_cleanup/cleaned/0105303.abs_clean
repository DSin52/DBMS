We study a system of spinless electrons moving in a two dimensionalnoncommutative space subject to a perpendicular magnetic field $\vec B$ andconfined by a harmonic potential type ${1\over 2}mw_{0}r^2$. We look for theorbital magnetism of the electrons in different regimes of temperature $T$,magnetic field $\vec B$ and noncommutative parameter $\te$. We prove that thedegeneracy of Landau levels can be lifted by the $\te$-term appearing in theelectron energy spectrum at weak magnetic field. Using the {\it Berezin-Lieb}inequalities for thermodynamical potential, it is shown that in the hightemperature limit, the system exibits a magnetic $\te$-dependent behaviour,which is missing in the commutative case. Moreover, a correction tosusceptibility at low $T$ is observed. Using the {\it Fermi-Dirac} traceformulas, a generalization of the thermodynamical potential, the average numberof electrons and the magnetization is obtained. There is a critical point wherethe thermodynamical potential becomes infinite in both of two methods above. Soat this point we deal with the partition function by adopting another approach.The standard results in the commutative case for this model can be recovered byswitching off the $\te$-parameter.
