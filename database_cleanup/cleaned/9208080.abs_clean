The Liouville approach is applied to the quantum treatment of the dilatongravity in two dimensions. The physical states are obtained from the BRSTcohomology and correlation functions are computed up to three-point functions.For the $N=0$ case (i.e., without matter), the cosmological term operator isfound to have the discrete momentum that plays a special role in the $c=1$Liouville gravity. The correlation functions for arbitrary numbers of operatorsare found in the $N=0$ case, and are nonvanishing only for specific``chirality'' configurations.
