The elements of the wide class of quantum universal enveloping algebras areprooved to be Hopf algebras $H$ with spectrum $Q(H)$ in the category of groups.Such quantum algebras are quantum groups for simply connected solvable Liegroups $P(H)$. This provides utilities for a new algorithm of constructingquantum algebras especially useful for nonsemisimple ones. The quantizationprocedure can be carried out over an arbitrary field. The properties of thealgorithm are demonstrated on examples.
