Title: Seiberg Duality in Matrix Model

Authors: Bo Feng

Comments: 5 pages. Short notes. Abstract rewritten. Typo fixed

In this paper, we use the matrix model of pure fundamental flavors (withoutthe adjoint field) to check the Seiberg duality in the case of complete massdeformation. We show that, by explicit integration at both sides of electricand magnetic matrix models, the results agree with the prediction in the fieldtheory.
