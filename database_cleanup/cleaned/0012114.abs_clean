We analyze the superfield constraints of the D=4, N=3 SYM-theory usinglight-cone gauge conditions. The SU(3)/U(1) x U(1) harmonic variables areinterpreted as auxiliary spectral parameters, and the transform to theharmonic-superspace representation is considered. The harmonic superfieldequations of motion are drastically simplified in our gauge, in particular, thebasic matrix of the harmonic transform and the corresponding harmonic analyticgauge connections become nilpotent on-shell. It is shown that these harmonicSYM-equations are equivalent to the finite set of solvable linear iterativeequations.
