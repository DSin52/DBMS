We study the equivalence between the self-dual and the Maxwell-Chern-Simons(MCS) models coupled to dynamical, U(1) charged matter, both fermionic andbosonic. This is done through an iterative procedure of gauge embedding thatproduces the dual mapping of the self-dual vector field theory into aMaxwell-Chern-Simons version. In both cases, to establish this equivalence acurrent-current interaction term is needed to render the matter sectorunchanged. Moreover, the minimal coupling of the original self-dual model isreplaced by a non-minimal magnetic like coupling in the MCS side. Unlike thefermionic instance however, in the bosonic example the dual mapping proposedhere leads to a Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory immersed in a field dependentmedium.
