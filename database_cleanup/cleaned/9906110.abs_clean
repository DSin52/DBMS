Title: Vector Symmetries and Theta-Vacuum

Authors: V. Azcoiti, A. Galante

Comments: 11 pages, no figures

Under very general assumptions we show that Vafa-Witten theorem on vectorsymmetries in vector-like theories can be extended to some physically relevantgauge theories with non-positive definite integration measure as QCD with atheta-vacuum term.
