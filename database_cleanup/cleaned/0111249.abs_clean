The energy spectrum of a nonrelativistic particle on a noncommutative spherein the presence of a magnetic monopole field is calculated. The system istreated in the field theory language, in which the one-particle sector of acharged Schroedinger field coupled to a noncommutative U(1) gauge field isidentified. It is shown that the Hamiltonian is essentially the angularmomentum squared of the particle, but with a nontrivial scaling factorappearing, in agreement with the first-quantized canonical treatment of theproblem. Monopole quantization is recovered and identified as the quantizationof a commutative Seiberg-Witten mapped monopole field.
