Title: Nuclearity and split for thermal quantum field theories

Authors: Christian Jaekel

Comments: plain tex, 29 pages; heuristic arguments leading to the nuclearity

conditon revisedWe review the heuristic arguments suggesting that any thermal quantum fieldtheory, which can be interpreted as a quantum statistical mechanics of(interacting) relativistic particles, obeys certain restrictions on its numberof local degrees of freedom. As in the vacuum representation, theserestrictions can be expressed by a `nuclearity condition'. If a model satisfiesthis nuclearity condition, then the net of von Neumann algebras representingthe local observables in the thermal representation has the split property.
