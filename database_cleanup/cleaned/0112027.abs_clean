The Seiberg-Witten map links noncommutative gauge theories to ordinary gaugetheories, and allows to express the noncommutative variables in terms of thecommutative ones. Its explicit form can be found order by order in thenoncommutative parameter theta and the gauge potential A by the requirementthat gauge orbits are mapped on gauge orbits. This of course leavesambiguities, corresponding to gauge transformations, and there is an infinityof solutions. Is there one better, clearer than the others ? In the abeliancase, we were able to find a solution, linked by a gauge transformation toalready known formulas, which has the property of admitting a recursiveformulation, uncovering some pattern in the map. In the special case of a puregauge, both abelian and non-abelian, these expressions can be summed up, andthe transformation is expressed using the parametrisation in terms of the gaugegroup.
