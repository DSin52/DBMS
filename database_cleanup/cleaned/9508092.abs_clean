Soc., Providence,RI, 1997, 1-18Some recent results on the applications of duality (and related)transformations to general four-dimensional, spherically symmetric,asymptotically flat and time-independent string configurations are summarized.Two classes of results have been obtained. First, these transformations areused to generate the general such solution to the lowest-order field equationsin the alpha' expansion. Second, the action and implications of duality (basedon time-translation) on the general configuration is determined. It is found tointerchange two pairs of the six parameters which label these configurations,Taub-NUT parameter. For the special case of the Schwarzshild black hole thisimplies the relation M -> - k/M, where k is a known, positive, quantity. It isargued that, in some circumstances, dual theories need not be equivalent in thesimplest sense.
