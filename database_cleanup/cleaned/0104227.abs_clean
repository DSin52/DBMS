A general solution to the Einstein field equations with Gauss-Bonnet(GB) termin the $AdS_5$ bulk background implies that the GB coupling $\alpha$ can takeeither sign (+ or -), though a positive $\alpha$ will be more meaningful. Byconsidering linearized gravity with the GB term in the Randall-Sundrum(RS) asingular 3-brane model, we study the gravitational interactions between mattersources localized on the brane. With a correctly defined boundary condition onthe brane, we find a smooth behavior of graviton propagator and hence thezero-mode solution as a 4d massless graviton localized on the brane withcorrect momentum and tensor structures. The coupling $\alpha$ modifies thegraviton propagators both on the brane and in the bulk. The issue on ghoststate of the GB term is resolved, and we find that there is no real ghost(negative norm) state of the GB term in the RS single brane picture. The lattercondition leads to a consistency in the coupling between the brane matter andthe bulk gravity. We also elucidate about the possibilities for behavior of atest particle on the brane and in the bulk.
