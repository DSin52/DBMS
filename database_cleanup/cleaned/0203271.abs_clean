We discuss the impact of a bulk photon mass in a Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati typebrane model with Maxwell terms both on the brane and in the bulk, as proposedby Dvali, Gabadadze and Shifman. The motivation to include the bulk photon massis to suppress radiation loss into the bulk. We point out that this modifiesthe photon propagator in such a way that it generates a small photon mass onthe brane. Compatibility with present bounds on a photon mass imply that thetransition to five-dimensional distance laws for the electromagnetic potentialswould appear only at super-horizon length scales, thus excluding any directdetection possibility of a transition from four-dimensional to five-dimensionaldistance laws in electromagnetic interactions. We also include results onfermion propagators with Dirac terms on the brane and in the bulk.
