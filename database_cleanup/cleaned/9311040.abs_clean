Title: Jackson Integral Representations for Solutions to the Quantized

Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov EquationAuthors: Vitaly Tarasov and Alexander Varchenko

Comments: 50 pages. (Misprints are corrected.)

The quantized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations associated with thetrigonometric R-matrix or the rational R-matrix of the A-type are considered.Jackson integral representations for solutions of these equations aredescribed. Asymptotic solutions for a holonomic system of difference equationsare constructed. Relations between the integral representations and the Betheansatz are indicated.
