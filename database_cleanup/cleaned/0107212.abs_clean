Two- and three-point correlation functions of arbitrary protected operatorsare constructed in N=4 SYM using analytic superspace methods. The OPEs of twochiral primary multiplets are given. It is shown that the $n$-point functionsof protected operators for $n\leq4$ are invariant under $U(1)_Y$ and it isargued that this implies that the two- and three-point functions are notrenormalised. It is shown explicitly how unprotected operators can beaccommodated in the analytic superspace formalism in a way which is fullycompatible with analyticity. Some new extremal correlators are exhibited.
