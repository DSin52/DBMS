The most prominent class of integrable quantum field theories in 1+1dimensions is affine Toda theory. Distinguished by a rich underlying Liealgebraic structure these models have in recent years attracted much attentionnot only as test laboratories for non-perturbative methods in quantum fieldtheory but also in the context of off-critical models. After a shortintroduction the mathematical preliminaries such as root systems, Coxetergeometry, dual algebras, q-deformed Coxeter elements and q-deformed Cartanmatrices are introduced. Using this mathematical framework the bootstrapanalysis of the affine Toda S-matrices with real coupling is performed andseveral universal Lie algebraic formulae proved. The Lie algebraic methods arethen extended to define a new class of colour valued S-matrices and also hereuniversal expressions are derived. The second part of the thesis presents adetailed analysis of the high-energy regime of the integrable models discussedin the first part. By means of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz the centralcharges of the ultraviolet conformal field theories are calculated and in caseof affine Toda theories also the first order term in the scaling function isanalytically obtained. For the colour valued S-matrices the connection to WZNWcoset models is discussed. A particular subclass of them, the so-calledHomogeneous Sine-Gordon models, is investigated in some detail and it is foundthat the presence of unstable particles in these theories gives rise to astaircase pattern in the corresponding scaling function. This thesis summarizesthe results of previously published articles listed in the introduction.
