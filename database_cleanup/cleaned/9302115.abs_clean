RSOS models based on the Lie algebras $B_m$, $C_m$ and $D_m$ are derived fromthe braiding of conformal field theory. This gives the first systematicderivation of these models earlier described by Jimbo et al. The general twofield Boltzmann weights associated to any RCFT are described, giving inparticular the off critical thermalized Boltzmann weights. Crossing propertiesare discussed and are shown to agree with the general theory which connectsthese with toroidal modular transformations. The soliton systems based on theselattice models are described and are conjectured based on the mass formulae andthe spins of the integrals of motions to describe perturbations of the RCFT$G_k\times G_1\over G_{k+1}$, where $G$ is the corresponding Lie algebra.
