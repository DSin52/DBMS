Title: Effective Potential in String Induced Action

Authors: Kazuo Ghoroku and Kazunari Kaneko

Comments: 12 pages, 7 figures, Latex

The dynamical properties of the gauge theory of Born-Infeld type action,which is expected as the high-energy effective theory, are investigated byadding a complex scalar field to this gauge system. Especially theColeman-Weinberg mechanism is addressed in this theory.
