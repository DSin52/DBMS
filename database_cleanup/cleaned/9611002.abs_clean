In this letter the algebraic renormalization method, which is independentof any kind of regularization scheme, is presented for the parity-preservingQED_3 coupled to scalar matter in the broken regime, where the scalar assumesa finite vacuum expectation value, $<\vf> = v$. The model shows to be stableunder radiative corrections and anomaly free.
