We employ projection operator techniques in Hilbert space to derive acontinuous sequence of effective Hamiltonians which describe the dynamics onsuccessively larger length scales. We show for the case of \phi^4 theory thatthe masses and couplings in these effective Hamiltonians vary in accordancewith 1-loop renormalization group equations. This is evidence for an intimateconnection between Wilson's renormalization and the venerable Bloch-Feshbachformalism.
