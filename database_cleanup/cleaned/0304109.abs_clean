Unified N=2 Maxwell-Einstein supergravity theories (MESGTs) are supergravitytheories in which all the vector fields, including the graviphoton, transformin an irreducible representation of a simple global symmetry group of theLagrangian. As was established long time ago, in five dimensions there existonly four unified Maxwell-Einstein supergravity theories whose target manifoldsare symmetric spaces. These theories are defined by the four simple EuclideanJordan algebras of degree three. In this paper, we show that, in addition tothese four unified MESGTs with symmetric target spaces, there exist threeinfinite families of unified MESGTs as well as another exceptional one. Thesenovel unified MESGTs are defined by non-compact (Minkowskian) Jordan algebras,and their target spaces are in general neither symmetric nor homogeneous. Themembers of one of these three infinite families can be gauged in such a way asto obtain an infinite family of unified N=2 Yang-Mills-Einstein supergravitytheories, in which all vector fields transform in the adjoint representation ofa simple gauge group of the type SU(N,1). The corresponding gaugings in theother two infinite families lead to Yang-Mills-Einstein supergravity theoriescoupled to tensor multiplets.
