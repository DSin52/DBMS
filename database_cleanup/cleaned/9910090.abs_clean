We consider heterotic string compactifications to four dimensions wheninstantons shrink to zero size. If the standard model gauge group originatesfrom the new gauge symmetry associated with the small instantons singularity,then the weakly or strongly coupled heterotic string scales can be taken to bearbitrarily low. The SO(32) and E_8\times E_8 gauge groups can then be veryweakly coupled even at the string scale and behave as non-abelian globalsymmetries. We comment on a possible role of small instantons in supersymmetrybreaking.
