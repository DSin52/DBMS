their representationsComments: 12 pages

Journal-ref: J.Phys. A26 (1993) 7031-7040

In this paper a new quasi-triangular Hopf algebra as the quantum double ofthe Heisenberg-Weyl algebra is presented.Its universal R-matrix is built andthe corresponding representation theory are studied with the explictconstruction for the representations of this quantum double. \newpage
