Comments: 11 pages, LaTeX, One figure included; To appear in the proceedings of

NATO ASI on Masses of Fundamental Particles, C\`argese, France, Aug. 5-17,1996This talk is a brief review of gaugino condensation in superstring effectivefield theories and some related issues (such as renormalization of the gaugecoupling in the effective supergravity theories and modular anomalycancellation). As a specific example, we discuss a model containingperturbative (1-loop) corrections to the K\"ahler potential and approximateS-duality symmetry.
