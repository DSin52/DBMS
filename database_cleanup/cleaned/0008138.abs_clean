A (2+1)-static black hole solution with a nonlinear electric field isderived. The source to the Einstein equations is a nonlinear electrodynamics,satisfying the weak energy conditions, and it is such that the energy momentumtensor is traceless. The obtained solution is singular at the origin ofcoordinates. The derived electric field E(r) is given by $E(r)=q/r^2$, thus ithas the Coulomb form of a point charge in the Minkowski spacetime. Thissolution describes charged (anti)--de Sitter spaces. An interestingasymptotically flat solution arises for $\Lambda=0$.
