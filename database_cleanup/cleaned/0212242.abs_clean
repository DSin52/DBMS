Big bang/crunch curvature singularities in exact CFT string backgrounds canbe removed by turning on gauge fields. This is described within a family of{SL(2)xSU(2)xU(1)_x}/{U(1)xU(1)} quotient CFTs. Uncharged incomingwavefunctions from the ``whiskers'' of the extended universe can be fullyreflected if and only if a big bang/crunch curvature singularity, from whichthey are scattered, exists. Extended BTZ-like singularities remain as long asU(1)_x is compact.
