Paulo, Brazil, 1-6 Jul 2002Nonlinear sigma models (NLSM) in d=3 have many interesting and non-trivialfeatures, which were explored poorly in contrast with NLSM in d=2 and d=4. Wepresent a few results from our study of the perturbative and non-perturbativeproperties of three-dimensional (3D) NLSM. i) We have shown that cancellationof ultra-violet (UV) divergences takes place in 3D extended (N=2,4)supersymmetric NLSM in low orders of the 1/n expansion. ii) We considernoncommutative extension of the 3D CP(n) model, and study low-energy dynamicsof BPS solitons in this model. We also discuss briefly dynamics of non-BPSsolutions.
