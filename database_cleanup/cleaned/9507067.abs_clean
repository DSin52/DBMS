A perturbative approach for non renormalizable theories is developed. It isshown that the introduction of an extra expansion parameter allows one to getrid of divergences and express physical quantities as series with finitecoefficients. The method is demonstrated on the example of massive non abelianfield coupled to a fermion field.
