We present a new general topological tensor current of $\tilde{p}$-branes bymaking use of the $\phi $-mapping theory. It is shown that the current isidentically conserved and behave as $\delta (\vec{\phi}),$ and every isolatedzero of the vector field $\vec{\phi}(x)$ corresponds to a `magnetic'$\tilde{p}$-brane. Using this topological current, the generalized Nambu actionfor multi $\tilde{p}$-branes is given, and the field strength $F$ correspondingto this topological tensor current is obtained. It is also shown that the`magnetic' charges carried by $\tilde{p}$-branes are topologically quantizedand labeled by Hopf index and Brouwer degree, the winding number of the$\phi$-mapping.
