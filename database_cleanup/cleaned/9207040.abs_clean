We prove a useful identity valid for all $ADE$ minimal S-matrices, thatclarifies the transformation of the relative thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA)from its standard form into the universal one proposed by Al.B.Zamolodchikov.By considering the graph encoding of the system of functional equations for theexponentials of the pseudoenergies, we show that any such system having thesame form as those for the $ADE$ TBA's, can be encoded on $A,D,E,A/Z_2$ only.This includes, besides the known $ADE$ diagonal scattering, the set of all$SU(2)$ related {\em magnonic} TBA's. We explore this class sistematically andfind some interesting new massive and massless RG flows. The generalization toclasses related to higher rank algebras is briefly presented and an intriguingrelation with level-rank duality is signalled.
