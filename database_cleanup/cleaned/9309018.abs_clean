We apply the method of collective coordinate quantization to a model ofsolitons in two spacetime dimensions with a global $U(1)$ symmetry. Inparticular we consider the dynamics of the charged states associated withrotational excitations of the soliton in the internal space and theirinteractions with the quanta of the background field (mesons). By solving asystem of coupled saddle-point equations we effectively sum all tree-graphscontributing to the one-point Green's function of the meson field in thebackground of a rotating soliton. We find that the resulting one-point functionevaluated between soliton states of definite $U(1)$ charge exhibits a pole onthe meson mass shell and we extract the corresponding S-matrix element for thedecay of an excited state via the emission of a single meson using the standardLSZ reduction formula. This S-matrix element has a natural interpretation interms of an effective Lagrangian for the charged soliton states with anexplicit Yukawa coupling to the meson field. We calculate the leading-ordersemi-classical decay width of the excited soliton states discuss theconsequences of these results for the hadronic decay of the $\Delta$ resonancein the Skyrme model.
