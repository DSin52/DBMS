In a series of papers Amati, Ciafaloni and Veneziano and 't Hooft conjecturedthat black holes occur in the collision of two light particles at planckianenergies. In this paper we discuss a possible scenario for such a process byusing the Chandrasekhar-Ferrari-Xanthopoulos duality between the Kerr blackhole solution and colliding plane gravitational waves. We clarify issuesarising in the definition of transition amplitude from a quantum statecontaining only usual matter without black holes to a state containing blackholes. Collision of two plane gravitational waves producing a space-time regionwhich is locally isometric to an interior of black hole solution is considered.The phase of the transition amplitude from plane waves to white and black holeis calculated by using the Fabbrichesi, Pettorino, Veneziano and Vilkoviskyapproach. An alternative extension beyond the horizon in which the space-timeagain splits into two separating gravitational waves is also discussed. Such aprocess is interpreted as the scattering of plane gravitational waves throughcreation of virtual black and white holes.
