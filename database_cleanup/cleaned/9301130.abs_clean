The mechanism underlying any bosonisation or fermionisation is exposed.It isshown that any local theory of fermions on a lattice in any spatial dimensiongreater than one is equivalent to a local theory of Ising spins coupled to a$Z_{2}$ gauge field.There is a close relation to the description of anyonsusing a Chern-Simons term.
