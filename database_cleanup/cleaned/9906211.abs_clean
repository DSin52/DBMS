Correlators of Wilson loop operators with O_4=Tr(F_{\mu\nu}^2+...) arecomputed in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory using the AdS/CFT correspondence. Theresults are compared with the leading order perturbative computations. As aconsequence of conformal invariance, these correlators have identical forms inthe weak and strong coupling limits for circular loops. They are essentiallydifferent for contours not protected by conformal symmetry.
