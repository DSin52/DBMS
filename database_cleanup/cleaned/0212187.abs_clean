2002; a slightly extended version of the contribution to the proceedingsQuantum Yang-Mills theory and the Wilson loop can be rewritten identically interms of local gauge-invariant variables being directly related to the metricof the dual space. In this formulation, one reveals a hidden high localsymmetry of the Yang-Mills theory, which mixes up fields with spins up to J=Nfor the SU(N) gauge group. In the simplest case of the SU(2) group the dualspace seems to tend to the de Sitter space in the infrared region. Thisobservation suggests a new mechanism of gauge-invariant mass generation in theYang-Mills theory.
