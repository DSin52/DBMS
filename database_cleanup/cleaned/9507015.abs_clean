The $O(3)$ nonlinear sigma model with its $U(1)$ subgroup gauged, where thegauge field dynamics is solely governed by a Chern-Simons term, admits bothtopological as well as nontopological self-dual soliton solutions for aspecific choice of the potential. It turns out that the topological solitonsare infinitely degenerate in any given sector.
