500-508We consider 3-point and 4-point correlation functions in a conformal fieldtheory with a W-algebra symmetry. Whereas in a theory with only Virasorosymmetry the three point functions of descendants fields are uniquelydetermined by the three point function of the corresponding primary fields thisis not the case for a theory with $W_3$ algebra symmetry. The generic 3-pointfunctions of W-descendant fields have a countable degree of arbitrariness. Wefind, however, that if one of the fields belongs to a representation with nullstates that this has implications for the 3-point functions. In particular ifone of the representations is doubly-degenerate then the 3-point function isdetermined up to an overall constant. We extend our analysis to 4-pointfunctions and find that if two of the W-primary fields are doubly degeneratethen the intermediate channels are limited to a finite set and that thecorresponding chiral blocks are determined up to an overall constant. Thiscorresponds to the existence of a linear differential equation for the chiralblocks with two completely degenerate fields as has been found in the work ofBajnok~et~al.
