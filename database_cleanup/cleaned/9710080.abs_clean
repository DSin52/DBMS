Title: The dual superconductor picture for confinement

Authors: A. Di Giacomo

Comments: 23 pages, 10 figures, contribution to the Workshop "Confinement,

Duality and Non-Perturbative Aspects of QCD", Cambridge (UK), 24 June - 4July 1997. Latex file including plenum.styEvidence is discussed, from lattice simulations, that QCD vacuum is a dualsuperconductor in the confining phase, and undergoes a phase transition tonormal at the deconfining temperature.
