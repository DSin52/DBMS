We study Type IIB supergravity in the presence of (euclidean) D3 branes andnonzero self-dual B-fields. We point out that the Einstein frame metric isidentical to the full geometry for D3 branes without B fields turned on.Furthermore, in a decoupling limit in which the theory is conjectured to bedual to noncommutative Yang-Mills theory, the entire Einstein metric remainsintact, and in particular, is asymptotically flat. We construct D-instantonsolutions in this geometry. We show that in the decoupling limit theD-instanton action agrees with the action of the corresponding instanton in thenoncommutative Yang-Mills theory and is expressed in terms of the open stringcoupling. Some other aspects of this correspondence, which have unusualfeatures because the underlying metric is asymptotically flat, are explored.
