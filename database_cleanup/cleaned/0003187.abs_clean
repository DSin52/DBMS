Branes in non-trivial backgrounds are expected to exhibit interestingdynamical properties. We use the boundary conformal field theory approach tostudy branes in a curved background with non-vanishing Neveu-Schwarz 3-formfield strength. For branes on an $S^3$, the low-energy effective action iscomputed to leading order in the string tension. It turns out to be a fieldtheory on a non-commutative `fuzzy 2-sphere' which consists of a Yang-Mills anda Chern-Simons term. We find a certain set of classical solutions that have noanalogue for flat branes in Euclidean space. These solutions show, inparticular, how a spherical brane can arise as bound state from a stack ofD0-branes.
