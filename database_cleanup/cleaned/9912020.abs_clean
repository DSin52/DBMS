We consider the question of gauge invariance of the Wilson loop in the lightof a new treatment of axial gauge propagator proposed recently based on afinite field-dependent BRS (FFBRS) transformation. We remark that as under theFFBRS transformation the vacuum expectation value of a gauge invariantobservable remains unchanged, our prescription automatically satisfies theWilson loop criterion. Further, we give an argument for {\it direct}verification of the invariance of Wilson loop to O(g^4) using the earlier workby Cheng and Tsai. We also note that our prescription preserves the thermalWilson loop to O(g^2).
