We show that an infinite number of non-unitary minimal models may describe twodimensional turbulent magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), both in the presence andabsence of the Alf'ven effect.We argue that the existence of a critical dynamical index results in theAlf'ven effect or equivelently the equipartition of energy. We show that thereare an infinite number of conserved quantities in $2D-MHD$ turbulent systemsboth in the limit of vanishing the viscocities and in force free case. In theforce free case, using the non-unitary minimal model $ M_{2,7} $ we derive thecorrelation functions for the velocity stream function and magnetic fluxfunction. Generalising this simple model we find the exponents of the energyspectrum in the inertial range for a class of conformal field theories.
