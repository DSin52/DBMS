Title: Quantum Group Sheaf and Quantum Manifolds

Comments: 12 pages

The problem of introducing a dependence of elements of quantum group onclassical parameters is considered. It is suggested to interpret a homomorphismfrom the algebra of functions on quantum group to the algebra of sections of asheaf of algebras on a classical manifold as describing such a dependence. Itis argued that the functorial point of view of group schemes is moreappropriate in quantum group field theory. A sheaf of the Hopf algebras overthe manifold (quantum sheaf) is constructed by using bosonization formulas forthe algebra of functions on the quantum group $SU_{q}(2)$ and the theory ofrepre- sentations of canonical commutation relations. A family of automorphismsof the Hopf algebra depending on classical variables is described. Quantummanifolds, i.e. manifolds with commutative and non-commutative coordinates arediscussed as a generalization of supermanifolds. Quantum group chiral fieldsand relations with algebraic differential calculus are discussed.
