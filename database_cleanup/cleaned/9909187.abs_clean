We analyse field strength configurations in U(N) Yang-Mills theory on T^{2n}that are diagonal and constant, extending early work of Van Baal on T^4. Thespectrum of fluctuations is determined and the eigenfunctions are givenexplicitly in terms of theta functions on tori. We show the relevance of theanalysis to higher dimensional D-branes and discuss applications of the resultsin string theory.
