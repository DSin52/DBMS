Title: A geometric approach to D-branes in group manifolds

Authors: Sonia Stanciu

Comments: 6 pages; based on talks given at the conference "Modern trends in

string theory" (Lisbon, July 2001), and the RTN meeting "The quantumstructure of spacetime and the geometric nature of fundamental interactions"(Corfu, September 2001)Journal-ref: Fortsch.Phys. 50 (2002) 980-985

This is a brief review of some recent results on the geometric approach tosymmetric D-branes in group manifolds, both twisted and untwisted. We describethe geometry of the gluing conditions and the quantisation condition in theboundary WZW model, and we illustrate this by determining the consistenttwisted and untwisted D-branes in the Lie group SU_3.
