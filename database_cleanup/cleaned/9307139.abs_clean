We consider the topological interactions of vortices on general surfaces. Ifthe genus of the surface is greater than zero, the handles can carry magneticflux. The classical state of the vortices and the handles can be described by amapping from the fundamental group to the unbroken gauge group. The allowedconfigurations must satisfy a relation induced by the fundamental group. Uponquantization, the handles can carry ``Cheshire charge.'' The motion of thevortices can be described by the braid group of the surface. How the motion ofthe vortices affects the state is analyzed in detail.
