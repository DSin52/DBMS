The study of general two dimensional models of gravity allows to tackle basicquestions of quantum gravity, bypassing important technical complications whichmake the treatment in higher dimensions difficult. As the physically importantexamples of spherically symmetric Black Holes, together with string inspiredmodels, belong to this class, valuable knowledge can also be gained for thesesystems in the quantum case. In the last decade new insights regarding theexact quantization of the geometric part of such theories have been obtained.They allow a systematic quantum field theoretical treatment, also ininteractions with matter, without explicit introduction of a specific classicalbackground geometry. The present review tries to assemble these results in acoherent manner, putting them at the same time into the perspective of thequite large literature on this subject.
