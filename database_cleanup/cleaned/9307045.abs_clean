We construct the Hamiltonian operator of the string field theory for $c=0$string theory. It describes how strings evolve in the coordinate frame, whichis defined by using the geodesic distance on the worldsheet. The Hamiltonianconsists of three-string interaction terms and a tadpole term. We show that onecan derive the loop amplitudes of $c=0$ string theory from this Hamiltonian.
