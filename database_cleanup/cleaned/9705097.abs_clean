We show that the low-lying excitations of the one-dimensional Bose gas aredescribed, at all orders in a 1/N expansion and at the first order in theinverse of the coupling constant, by an effective hamiltonian written in termsof an extended conformal algebra, namely the Cartan subalgebra of the$W_{1+\infty}\times \bar{W}_{1+\infty}$ algebra. This enables us toconstruct the first interaction term which corrects the hamiltonian of freefermions equivalent to a hard-core boson system.
