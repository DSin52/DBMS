The causal boundary of string propagation -- defined as the hypersurface inloop space bordering the timelike(spacelike) domains in which two successivemeasurements of the string field do(do not) interfere with one another -- isargued to be $0=\int d\sigma\bigl(\delta X(\sigma)\bigr)^2 =\sum_{\ell=-\infty}^\infty \delta x^\mu_{-\ell}\delta x_{\mu \ell}.$ Somepossible consequences are discussed.
