We discuss, in terms of the AdS_3-CFT_2 correspondence, a one-parameterfamily of (asymptotically AdS_3) conical geometries which are generated bypoint masses and interpolate between AdS_3 and BTZ spacetimes. We show thatthese correspond to spectral flow in N= (4,4) SCFT_2 which interpolate betweenNS and R sectors. Our method involves representing the conical spaces assolutions of three-dimensional supergravity based on the supergroup SU(1,1|2)\times SU(1,1|2). The boundary CFT we use is based on the D1/D5 system. Thecorrespondence includes comparing the Euclidean free energies betweensupergravity and SCFT for the family of conical spaces including BTZ blackholes.
