Following recent advances in the local theory of current-algebraic orbifoldswe present the basic dynamics - including the {\it twisted KZ equations} - ofeach twisted sector of all outer-automorphic WZW orbifolds on so(2n). Physics-friendly Cartesian bases are used throughout, and we are able in particular toassemble two $Z_3$ triality orbifolds and three $S_3$ triality orbifolds onso(8).
