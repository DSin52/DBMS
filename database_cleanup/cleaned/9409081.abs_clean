The BRST transformations for the Yang-Mills gauge fields in the presence ofgravity described by Ashtekar variables are obtained by using the so-calledMaurer-Cartan horizontality conditions. The BRST cohomology group expressed bythe Wess-Zumino consistency condition is solved with the help of an operator$\delta$ introduced by S.P. Sorella which in our case has a very simple formand generates, together with the differential $d$ and the BRST operator $s$, asimpler algebra than in the pure Yang-Mills theory. In this way we shall findthe Yang-Mills Lagrangians, the Chern-Simons terms and the gauge anomalies.
