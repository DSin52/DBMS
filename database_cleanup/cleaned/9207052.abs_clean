A systematic way of formulating the Batalin-Vilkovisky method of quantizationwas obtained in terms of the ``odd time'' formulation. We show that in a classof gauge theories it is possible to find an ``odd time lagrangian'' yielding,by a Legendre transformation, an ``odd time hamiltonian'' which is the minimalsolution of the master equation. This constitutes a very simple method offinding the minimal solution of the master equation which is usually a tedioustask. To clarify the general procedure we discussed its application toYang-Mills theory, massive (abelian) theory in Stueckelberg formalism,relativistic particle and the self-interacting antisymmetric tensor field.
