We study the spin factor problem both in $3+1$ and $2+1$ dimensions which areessentially different for spin factor construction. Doing all Grassmannintegrations in the corresponding path integral representations for Diracpropagator we get representations with spin factor in arbitrary external field.Thus, the propagator appears to be presented by means of bosonic path integralonly. In $3+1$ dimensions we present a simple derivation of spin factoravoiding some unnecessary steps in the original brief letter (Gitman,Shvartsman, Phys. Lett. {\bf B318} (1993) 122) which themselves need someadditional justification. In this way the meaning of the surprising possibilityof complete integration over Grassmann variables gets clear. In $2+1$dimensions the derivation of the spin factor is completely original. Then weuse the representations with spin factor for calculations of the propagator insome configurations of external fields. Namely, in constant uniformelectromagnetic field and in its combination with a plane wave field.
