We consider an infinite-volume brane world setup where a codimension onebrane is coupled to bulk gravity plus a scalar field with vanishing potential.The latter is protected by bulk supersymmetry, which is intact even if branesupersymmetry is completely broken as the volume of the extra dimension isinfinite. Within this setup we discuss a flat solution with a ``self-tuning''property, that is, such a solution exists for a continuous range of values forthe brane tension. This infinite-volume solution is free of any singularities,and has the property that the brane cosmological constant is protected by bulksupersymmetry. We, however, also point out that consistency of the couplingbetween bulk gravity and brane matter generically appears to require that thebrane world-volume theory be conformal.
