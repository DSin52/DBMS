Title: Some functional solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation

Comments: 7 pages

A general functional definition of the infinite dimensional quantum$R$-matrix satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation is given. A procedure for theextracting a finite dimensional $R$-matrix from the general definition isdemonstrated in a particular case when the group $SU(2)$ takes place.
