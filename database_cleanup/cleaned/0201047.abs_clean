We introduce and study new integrable models of A_n^{(1)}-Non-Abelian Todatype which admit U(1)\otimes U(1) charged topological solitons. They correspondto the symmetry breaking SU(n+1) \to SU(2)\otimes SU(2)\otimes U(1)^{n-2} andare conjectured to describe charged dyonic domain walls of N=1 SU(n+1) SUSYgauge theory in large n limit.It is shown that this family of relativistic IMs corresponds to the firstnegative grade q={-1} member of a dyonic hierarchy of generalized cKP type. Theexplicit relation between the 1-soliton solutions (and the conserved charges aswell) of the IMs of grades q=-1 and q=2 is found. The properties of the IMscorresponding to more general symmetry breaking SU(n+1) \to SU(2)^{\otimesp}\otimes U(1)^{n-p} as well as IM with global SU(2) symmetries are discussed.
