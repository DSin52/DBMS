Using the simple path integral method we calculate the $n$-point functions offield strength of Yang-Mills theories on arbitrary two-dimensional Riemannsurfaces. In $U(1)$ case we show that the correlators consist of two parts , afree and an $x$-independent part. In the case of non-abelian semisimple compactgauge groups we find the non-gauge invariant correlators in Schwinger-Fockgauge and show that it is also divided to a free and an almost $x$-independentpart. We also find the gauge-invariant Green functions and show that theycorrespond to a free field theory.
