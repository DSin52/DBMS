The ratios of the masses of D(p-d) branes to the masses of Dp in open bosonicstring field theory are computed within the modified level truncationapproximation of Moeller, Sen and Zweibach. At the lowest non-trivialtruncation requiring the addition of new primary states, we find evidence ofrapid convergence to the expected result for 1<d<7 providing additionalevidence for the consistency of this approximation.
