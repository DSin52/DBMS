To investigate the possibility of a ghost-antighost condensate the coupledDyson--Schwinger equations for the gluon and ghost propagators in Yang--Millstheories are derived in general covariant gauges, including ghost-antighostsymmetric gauges. The infrared behaviour of these two-point functions isstudied in a bare-vertex truncation scheme which has proven to be successful inLandau gauge. In all linear covariant gauges the same infrared behaviour as inghost propagator is infrared enhanced. This infrared singular behaviourprovides indication against a ghost-antighost condensate. In theghost-antighost symmetric gauges we find that the infrared behaviour of thegluon and ghost propagators cannot be determined when replacing all dressedvertices by bare ones. The question of a BRST invariant dimension twocondensate remains to be further studied.
