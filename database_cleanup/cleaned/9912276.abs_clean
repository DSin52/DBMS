It has recently been proposed that the hierarchy problem can be solved byconsidering the warped fifth dimension compactified on $S^{1}/Z_{2}$. Manystudies in the context have assumed a particular choice for an integrationconstant $\sigma_{0}$ that appears when one solves the five-dimensionalEinstein equation. Since $\sigma_{0}$ is not determined by the boundarycondition of the five-dimensional theory, $\sigma_{0}$ may be regarded as agauge degree of freedom in a sense. To this time, all indications are that thefour-dimensional Planck mass depends on $\sigma_{0}$. In this paper, wecarefully investigate the properties of the geometry in the Randall-Sundrummodel, and consider in which location $y$ the four-dimensional Planck mass ismeasured. As a result, we find a $\sigma_{0}$-independent relation between thefour-dimensional Planck mass $M_{\rm Pl}$ and five- dimensional fundamentalmass scale $M$, and remarkably enough, we can take $M$ to TeV region when weconsider models with the Standard Model confined on a distant brane. We alsoconfirm that the physical masses on the distant brane do not depend on$\sigma_{0}$ by considering a bulk scalar field as an illustrative example. Theresulting mass scale of the Kaluza-Klein modes is on the order of $M$.
