The quantum statistics of charged, extremal black holes is investigatedbeginning with the hypothesis that the quantum state is a functional on thespace of closed three-geometries, with each black hole connected to anoppositely charged black hole through a spatial wormhole. From this startingpoint a simple argument is given that a collection of extremal black holesobeys neither Bose nor Fermi statistics. Rather they obey an exotic variety ofparticle statistics known as ``infinite statistics'' which resembles that ofdistinguishable particles and is realized by a $q$-deformation of the quantumcommutation relations.
