The superdiffeomorphisms invariant description of $N$ - extended spinningparticle is constructed in the framework of nonlinear realizations approach.The action is universal for all values of $N$ and describes the time evolutionof $D+2$ different group elements of the superdiffeomorphisms group of the$(1,N)$ superspace. The form of this action coincides with the one-dimensionalversion of the gravity action, analogous to Trautman's one.
