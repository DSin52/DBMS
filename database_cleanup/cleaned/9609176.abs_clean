We argue that all conjectured dualities involving various string, M- and F-theory compactifications can be `derived' from the conjectured duality betweentype I and SO(32) heterotic string theory, T-dualities, and the definition ofM- and F- theories. (Based on a talk given at the conference on `AdvancedQuantum Field Theory', Le Londe-les-Maures, France, Aug.31-Sept.5, 1996, inmemory of Claude Itzykson)
