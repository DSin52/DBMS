Noether's symmetry transformations for higher-order lagrangians are studied.A characterization of these transformations is presented, which is useful tofind gauge transformations for higher-order singular lagrangians. The case ofsecond-order lagrangians is studied in detail. Some examples that illustrateour results are given; in particular, for the lagrangian of a relativisticparticle with curvature, lagrangian gauge transformations are obtained, thoughthere are no hamiltonian gauge generators for them.
