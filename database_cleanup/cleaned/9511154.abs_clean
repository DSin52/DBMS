New examples of N=2 supersymmetric conformal field theories are found asfixed points of SU(2) N=2 supersymmetric QCD. Relations among the scalingdimensions of their relevant chiral operators, global symmetries, and Higgsbranches are understood in terms of the general structure of relevantdeformations of non-trivial N=2 conformal field theories. The spectrum ofscaling dimensions found are all those compatible with relevant deformations ofa y^2 = x^3 singular curve.
