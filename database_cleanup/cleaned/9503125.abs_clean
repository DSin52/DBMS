Title: A VIEW OF 2-DIM. STRING THEORY AND BLACK HOLES

Comments: 14 pages plus two uuencoded figures

We present a brief overview of 2-dim. string theory and its connection to thetheory of non-relativistic fermions in one dimension. We emphasize (i) the roleof $W_\infty$ algebra and (ii) the modelling of some aspects of 2-dim. blackhole physics using the phase space representation of the fermi fluid.
