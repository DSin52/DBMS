Using Selberg's integral formula we derive all Leutwyler-Smilga type sumrules for one and two flavors, and for each of the three chiral random matrixensembles. In agreement with arguments from effective field theory, all sumrules for $N_f = 1$ coincide for the three ensembles. The connection betweenspectral correlations and the low-energy effective partition function isdiscussed.
