Recent advances in non-critical string theory allow a unique continuation ofcritical Polyakov string amplitudes to off-shell momenta, while preservingconformal invariance. These continuations possess unusual, apparently stringy,characteristics, as we illustrate with our results for three-point functions.(Talk by R.C.M. at Strings '93)
