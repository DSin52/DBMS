Starting from renormalised Effective Lagrangian, in the presence of anexternal Chromo-Electric field at finite temperature, the expression forthermal coupling constant ($\alpha = (g^2)/(4 \pi)$) as a function oftemperature and external field is derived, using finite temperature twoparameter renormalisation group equation of Matsumoto, Nakano and Umezawa. Forsome values of the parameters, the coupling constant is seen to be approachinga value $\sim unity$.
