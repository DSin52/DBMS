By considering a (partial) topological twisting of supersymmetric Yang-Millscompactified on a 2d space with `t Hooft magnetic flux turned on we obtain asupersymmetric $\sigma$-model in 2 dimensions. For N=2 SYM this maps Donaldsonobservables on products of two Riemann surfaces to quantum cohomology ring ofmoduli space of flat connections on a Riemann surface. For N=4 SYM it maps$S$-duality to $T$-duality for $\sigma$-models on moduli space of solutions toHitchin equations.
