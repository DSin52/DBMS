Authors: Atsushi Matsuo (The University of Tokyo) and Kiyokazu Nagatomo (Osaka

amsmath,amssymb,amsthm,amscd packagesThe identities satisfied by two-dimensional chiral quantum fields are studiedfrom the point of view of vertex algebras. The Cauchy-Jacobi identity (or theBorcherds identity) for three mutually local fields is proved and consequentlya direct proof of Li's theorem on a local system of vertex operators isprovided. Several characterizations of vertex algebras are also discussed.
