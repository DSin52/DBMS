We discuss the phase structure (in the $1/N$-expansion) of theNambu-Jona-Lasinio model in curved spacetime with non-trivial topology ${\calM}^3 \times {\rm S}^1$. The evaluation of the effective potential of thecomposite field $\bar{\psi} \psi$ is presented in the linear curvatureapproximation (topology is treated exactly) and in the leading order of the$1/N$-expansion. The combined influence of topology and curvature to the phasetransitions is investigated. It is shown, in particular, that at zero curvatureand for small radius of the torus there is a second order phase transition fromthe chiral symmetric to the chiral non-symmetric phase. When the curvaturegrows and (or) the radius of ${\rm S}^1$ decreases, then the phase transitionis in general of first order. The dynamical fermionic mass is also calculatedin a number of different situations.
