We derive noncommutative multi-particle quantum mechanics from noncommutativequantum field theory in the nonrelativistic limit. Paricles of opposite chargesare found to have opposite noncommutativity. As a result, there is nononcommutative correction to the hydrogen atom spectrum at the tree level. Wealso comment on the obstacles to take noncommutative phenomenology seriously,and propose a way to construct noncommutative SU(5) grand unified theory.
