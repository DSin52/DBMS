interactionThe interaction between a parallel brane-antibrane and brane-antibrane isinvestigated by regarding the brane-antibrane pair as a kink or anti-kink typetachyon condensed state. As the kink-type tachyon condensed state is known as anon-BPS brane we expand the Lagrangian of tachyon effective field theory to thequadratic order in the off-diagonal fluctuation and then use the zeta-functionregularization and Schwinger perturbative formula to evaluate the interactionwithin a kink-kink or a kink-antikink.The results show that while the kink and kink has repulsive force the kink andanti-kink has attractive force and may be annihilated by each others. Wetherefore evaluate the free energy at finite temperature and determine thecritical temperature above which the stable state of kink-antikink system maybe found.
