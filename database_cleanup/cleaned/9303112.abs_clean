Spinning particles in curved space-time can have fermionic symmetriesgenerated by the square root of bosonic constants of motion other than theHamiltonian. We present a general analysis of the conditions under which suchnew supersymmetries appear, and discuss the Poisson-Dirac algebra of theresulting set of charges, including the conditions of closure of the newalgebra. An example of a new non-trivial supersymmetry is found in black-holesolutions of the Kerr-Newman type and corresponds to the Killing-Yano tensor,which plays an important role in solving the Dirac equation in these black-holemetrics.
