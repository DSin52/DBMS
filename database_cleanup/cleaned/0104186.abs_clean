Title: Chiral phase in fermionic measure and the resolution of the strong CP

problemComments: LaTeX, 5 pages

The fermionic measure in the functional integral of a gauge theory suffersfrom an ambiguity in the form of a chiral phase. By fixing it, one is led onceagain to the conclusion that a chiral phase in the quark mass term of QCD hasno effect and cannot cause CP violation.
