93/36This is a review on infinite non-abelian symmetries in two-dimensional fieldtheories. We show how any integrable QFT enjoys the existence of infinitelymany {\bf conserved} charges. These charges {\bf do not commute} between themand satisfy a Yang--Baxter algebra. They are generated by quantum monodromyoperators and provide a representation of $q-$deformed affine Lie algebras$U_q({\hat\G})$. We review the work by de Vega, Eichenherr and Maillet on thebootstrap construction of the quantum monodromy operators in classically scaleinvariant theories where the classical monodromy matrix is conserved. Then, therecent generalization to the sine--Gordon (or massive Thirring) model, wheresuch operators do not possess a classical analogue is given (This provides arepresentation of $S{\hat U}(2)_q$). It is then reported on the recent work byDestri and de Vega, where both commuting and non-commuting integrals of motionare systematically obtained by Bethe Ansatz in the light-cone approach. Theeigenvalues of the six--vertex alternating transfer matrix $\tau(\l)$ areexplicitly computed on a generic physical state through algebraic Bethe ansatz.In the thermodynamic limit $\tau(\l)$ turns out to be a two--valued periodicfunction. One determination generates the local abelian charges, includingenergy and momentum, while the other yields the abelian subalgebra of the(non--local) YB algebra. In particular, the bootstrap results coincide with theratio between the two determinations of the lattice transfer matrix.[Based on aLecture at the Clausthal Symposium].
