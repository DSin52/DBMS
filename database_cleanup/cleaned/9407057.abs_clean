Title: Integrable highest weight modules over affine superalgebras and number

theoryComments: 45 pages

Theory; Number TheoryIn the first part of the paper we give the denominator identity for allsimple finite-dimensional Lie super algebras $\frak g\/$ with a non-degenerateinvariant bilinear form. We give also a character and (super) dimensionformulas for all finite-dimensional irreducible $\frak g\/$-modules ofatypicality $\leq 1\/$ . In the second part of the paper we give thedenominator identity for the affine superalgebras $\hat{\frak g}\/$ associatedto $\frak g\/$. Specializations of this identity give almost all old and manynew formulas for the number of representations of an integer as sums of squaresand sums of triangular numbers. At the end, we introduce the notion of anintegrable $\hat{\frak g}\/$-module and give a classification of irreducibleintegrable highest weight $\hat{\frak g}\/$-modules.
