We make a first step to extend to the supersymmetric arena the effectiveaction method, which is used to covariantly deduce the low energy dynamics oftopological defects directly from their parent field theory. By focussing ontwo-dimensional supersymmetric theories we are able to derive the appropriatechange of variables that singles out the low energy degrees of freedom. Thesecorrespond to super-worldline embeddings in superspace which are subject to ageometrical constraint. We obtain a supersymmetric and $\kappa$--invariant lowenergy expansion, with the standard superparticle action as the leading term,which can be used for the determination of higher-order corrections. Ourformulation fits quite naturally with the present geometrical description of$\kappa$--symmetry in terms of the so-called geometrodynamical constraints. Italso provides a basis for the exploration of these issues in higher-dimensionalsupersymmetric theories.
