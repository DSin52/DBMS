Title: Quantum structure of spacetime and blackhole entropy

Journal-ref: Phys.Rev.Lett. 81 (1998) 4297-4300

The gap between a microscopic theory for quantum spacetime and thesemiclassical physics of blackholes is bridged by treating the blackholespacetimes as highly excited states of a class of nonlocal field theories. Allthe blackhole thermodynamics is shown to arise from asymptotic form of thedispersion relation satisfied by the elementary excitations of these fieldsmeared over regions of the order of Planck length and (ii) possess correlationfunctions which have universal short distance behaviour.
