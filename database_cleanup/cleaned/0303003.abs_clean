Gravitation, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, 25-28 Nov 2002Based on some recent work of the authors, we focus on the relationshipbetween the Casimir energy of a Majorana spinor field for a Euclidean Einsteinuniverse $S^4\times R$ and for a Euclidean de Sitter brane ($S^4$) embedded inAdS(5). This is for a conformally coupled massless field. Interestingly, theone brane effective potential is zero and the results are equivalent, as forthe scalar case, when evaluated on the conformally related cylinder. However,using the actual metric this equivalence no longer holds because a non-trivialcontribution from the path integral measure (known as the cocycle function) isnon-zero.
