It is by now well established that, by means of the integration by partidentities, all the integrals occurring in the evaluation of a Feynman graph ofgiven topology can be expressed in terms of a few independent master integrals.It is shown in this paper that the integration by part identities can befurther used for obtaining a linear system of first order differentialequations for the master integrals themselves. The equations can then be usedfor the numerical evaluation of the amplitudes as well as for investigatingtheir analytic properties, such as the asymptotic and threshold behaviours andthe corresponding expansions (and for analytic integration purposes, whenpossible). The new method is illustrated through its somewhat detailedapplication to the case of the one loop self-mass amplitude, by explicitlyworking out expansions and quadrature formulas, both in arbitrary continuousdimension n and in the n \to 4 limit. It is then shortly discussed whichfeatures of the new method are expected to work in the more general case ofmulti-point, multi-loop amplitudes.
