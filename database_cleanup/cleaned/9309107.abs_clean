The partition functions of QCD2 on simple surfaces admit representations interms of exponentials of the inverse coupling, that are modular transforms ofthe usual character expansions. We review the construction of such arepresentation in the case of the cylinder, and show how it leads to aformulation of QCD2 as a $c=1$ matrix model of the Kazakov-Migdal type. Theeigenvalues describe the positions of $N$ Sutherland fermions on a circle,while their discretized momenta label the representations in the correspondingan alternative description of the Douglas-Kazakov phase transition on thesphere, and we argue that an analogous phase transition exists on the cylinder.We calculate the large $N$ limit of the partition function on the cylinder withboundary conditions given by semicircular distributions of eigenvalues, and wefind an explicit expression for the large $N$ limit of the Itzykson-Zuberintegral with the same boundary conditions.
