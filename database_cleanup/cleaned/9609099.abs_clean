Title: Asymptotic Freedom

Comments: Phyzzx, 48 pages, 7 figures

I discuss how the basic phenomenon of asymptotic freedom in QCD can beunderstood in elementary physical terms. Similarly, I discuss how thelong-predicted phenomenon of ``gluonization of the proton'' -- recentlyspectacularly confirmed at HERA -- is a rather direct manifestation of thephysics of asymptotic freedom. I review the broader significance of asymptoticinterpretation and now even the design of experiments, and how on the other itmakes possible a rational, quantitative theoretical approach to problems ofunification and early universe cosmology.
