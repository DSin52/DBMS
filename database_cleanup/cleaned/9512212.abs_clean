We study abelian lattice gauge theory defined on a simplicial complex witharbitrary topology. The use of dual objects allows one to reformulate thetheory in terms of new dynamical variables; however, we avoid the use of thedual lattice entirely. Topological modes which are present in thetransformation now appear as homology classes, in contrast to the cohomologymodes found in the dual cell picture. Irregularities of dual cell complexes donot arise in this approach. We treat the two and three dimensional cases indetail.
