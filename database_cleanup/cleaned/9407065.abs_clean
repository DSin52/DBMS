Title: Recursion Relations for Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients of Uq(su2) and

Uq(su1,1)Comments: 9 pages, Tex

We report in this article three- and four-term recursion relations forClebsch-Gordan coefficients of the quantum algebras $U_q(su_2)$ and$U_q(su_{1,1})$. These relations were obtained by exploiting thecomplementarity of three quantum algebras in a $q$-deformation of $sp(8, \gr)$.
