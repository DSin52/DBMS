To appear in Phys. Lett. BIt has been argued by several authors, using different formalisms, that thequantum mechanical spectrum of black hole horizon area is discrete anduniformly spaced. Recently it was shown that two such approaches, namely theone involving quantisation on a reduced phase space, and the algebraic approachof Bekenstein and Gour are equivalent for spherically symmetric, neutral blackholes (hep-th/0202076). The observables of one can be mapped to those of theother. Here we extend that analysis to include charged black holes. Once again,we find that the ground state of the black hole is a Planck size remnant.
