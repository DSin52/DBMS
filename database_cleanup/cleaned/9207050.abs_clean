We propose a new formulation of the heterotic $D=10$ Green-Schwarzsuperstring whose worldsheet is a superspace with two even and eight oddcoordinates. The action is manifestly invariant under both target-spacesupersymmetry and a worldsheet reparametrisation supergroup. It contains only afinite set of auxiliary fields. The key ingredient are the commuting spinor(twistor) variables, which naturally arise as worldsheet superpartners of thetarget space Grassmann coordinates. These spinors parametrise the sphere $S^8$regarded as a coset space of the $D=10$ Lorentz group. The sphere is associatedwith the lightlike vector of one of the string Virasoro constraints. The originof the on-shell $D=10$ fermionic kappa symmetry of the standard Green-Schwarzformulation is explained. An essential and unusual feature is the appearance ofthe string tension only on shell as an integration constant.
