We give a systematic account of the exterior algebra of forms on q-Minkowskispace, introducing the q-exterior derivative, q-Hodge star operator,q-coderivative, q-Laplace-Beltrami operator and the q-Lie-derivative. Withthese tools at hand, we then give a detailed exposition of the q-d'Alembert andq-Maxwell equation. For both equations we present a q-momentum-indexed familyof plane wave solutions. We also discuss the gauge freedom of the q-Maxwellfield and give a q-spinor analysis of the q-field strength tensor.
