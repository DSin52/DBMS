If TeV-scale gravity describes nature, black holes will be produced inparticle accelerators, perhaps even with impressive rates at the Large HadronCollider. Their decays, largely via the Hawking process, will be spectacular.Black holes also would be produced in cosmic ray collisions with ouratmosphere, and their showers may be observable. Such a scenario means the endof our quest to understand the world at shorter distances, but may representthe beginning of the exploration of extra dimensions.
