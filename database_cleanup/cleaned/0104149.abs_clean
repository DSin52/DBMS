Title: Partition functions and Jacobi fields in the Morse theory

Authors: Soon-Tae Hong

Comments: 11 pages

We study the semiclassical partition function in the frame work of the Morsetheory, to clarify the phase factor of the partition function and to relate itto the eta invariant of Atiyah. Converting physical system with potential intoa curved manifold, we exploit the Jacobi fields and their correspondingeigenvalue equations to be associated with geodesics on the curved manifold andthe Hamilton-Jacobi theory.
