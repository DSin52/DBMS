We analyze the gaugino condensation in the effective theory for N=1 SU(N)Supersymmetric QCD with $N_{f}$ flavors. It is known that taking the vacuumexpectation value of the matter field to be infinite, we can show that gauginocondensation can occur. At such a limit we should consider only puresupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. But when we include an interaction term oforder $O(\frac{1}{v})$, the situation can change. We analyze the effect of thisinteraction term and examine the gaugino condensation in the low energyYang-Mills theory by using the scheme of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio.
