We generalize Einstein's Lagrangian in a non-polynomial (in R) way. The usualLagrangian (linear in R) is the zero $\alpha'$ limit of our theory, where$\alpha'$ is a parameter that is interpreted as the inverse cosmologicalcostant before the Planck time. The theory space of this lagrangian admits a${\bf Z_{2}}$ modular group, namely $R \leftrightarrow 1/R$. Independence ofthe modular invariant expectation values from the number of `Big Bangs'enforces a quantization condition for the cosmological constant. At thesemiclassical approximation we obtain $\Lambda =0$, and a vacuum equation whichis equivalent to inflation cosmology. D=4 and D=1 universes are obtained asunique (and topologically separated by the D=2 semiclassical barrier) integerdimension solutions. They correspond to the first excited level and the groundstate respectively of our projective gravity.
