Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B506 (2001) 369-376

We consider the behaviour of neutral non-BPS branes probed by scalars andgravitons. We show that the naked singularity of the non-BPS branes is a {\itrepulson} absorbing no incoming radiation. The naked singularity is surroundedby an infinite potential well breaking the unitarity of the scatteringS-matrix. We compute the absorption cross section which is infrared divergent.In particular this confirms that gravity does not decouple for the non-BPSbranes.
