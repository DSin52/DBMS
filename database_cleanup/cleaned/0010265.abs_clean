We consider gluodynamics in case when both color and magnetic charges arepresent. We discuss first short distance physics, where only the fundamental|Q|=1 monopoles introduced via the `t Hooft loop can be consideredconsistently. We show that at short distances the external monopoles interactas pure Abelian objects. This result can be reproduced by a Zwanziger-typeLagrangian with an Abelian dual gluon. We introduce also an effective dualgluodynamics which might be a valid approximation at distances where themonopoles |Q|=2 can be considered as point-like as well. Assuming the monopolecondensation we arrive at a model which is reminiscent in some respect of theAbelian Higgs model but, unlike the latter leaves space for the Casimirscaling.
