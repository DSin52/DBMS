In recent papers it has been observed that non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, suchas those describing $ig\phi^3$ and $-g\phi^4$ field theories, still possessreal positive spectra so long as the weaker condition of ${\cal PT}$ symmetryholds. This allows for the possibility of new kinds of quantum field theoriesthat have strange and quite unexpected properties. In this paper a techniquebased on truncating the Schwinger-Dyson equations is presented forrenormalizing and solving such field theories. Using this technique it isargued that a $-g\phi^4$ scalar quantum field theory in four-dimensionalspace-time is renormalizable, is asymptotically free, has a nonzero value of$<0|\phi|0>$, and has a positive definite spectrum. Such a theory might beuseful in describing the Higgs boson.
