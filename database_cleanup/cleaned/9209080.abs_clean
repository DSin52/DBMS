AnalysisA classification theorem for linear differential equations in two variables(one real and one Grassmann) having polynomial solutions(the generalizedBochner problem) is given. The main result is based on the consideration of theeigenvalue problem for a polynomial element of the universal enveloping algebraof the algebra $osp(2,2)$ in the "projectivized" representation (indifferential operators of the first order) possessing an invariant subspace. Aclassification of 2 x 2 matrix differential equations in one real variablepossessing polynomial solutions is described. Connection to therecently-discovered quasi-exactly-solvable problems is discussed.
