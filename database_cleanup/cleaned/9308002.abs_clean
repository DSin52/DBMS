The physical phase space of gauge field theories on a cylindrical spacetimewith an arbitrary compact simple gauge group is shown to be the quotient $ {\bfR}^{2r}/W_A, $ $ r $ a rank of the gauge group, $ W_A $ the affine Weyl group.The PI formula resulting from Dirac's operator method contains a symmetrizationwith respect to $ W_A $ rather than the integration domain reduction. It givesa natural solution to Gribov's problem. Some features of fermion quantumdynamics caused by the nontrivial phase space geometry are briefly discussed.
