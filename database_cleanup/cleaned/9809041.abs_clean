Title: Higher dimensional Taub-Bolt solutions and the entropy of non compact

manifoldsComments: 28 pages, RevTeX

We discuss the action of a circle isometry group on non compact EuclideanEinstein manifolds. We discuss approaches to a decomposition of the action andentropy for non compact manifolds in terms of the characteristics of the orbitspace of a suitable isometry. There is entropy associated with non trivialcohomology of the orbit space of the isometry, and we consider a class of noncompact solutions for which such contributions do not vanish. To obtainsuitable solutions we generalise the Bais-Batenburg construction of higherdimensional Taub-Nut type solutions to obtain the corresponding bolt solutions.We consider the generalisations to non compact solutions of gravity coupled toscalar and gauge fields.
