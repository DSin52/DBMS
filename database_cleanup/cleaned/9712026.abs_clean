We consider the supergravity solution describing a configuration ofintersecting D-4-branes with non-vanishing worldvolume gauge fields. Theentropy of such a black hole is calculated in terms of the D-branes quantisedcharges. The non-extreme solution is also considered and the correspondingthermodynamical quantities are calculated in terms of a D-brane/anti-D-branesystem. To perform the quantum mechanical D-brane analysis we studyopen-strings with their ends on branes with a magnetic condensate. Applying theresults to our D-brane system we managed to have a perfect agreement betweenthe D-brane entropy counting and the corresponding semi-classical result. TheLandau degeneracy of the open string states describing the excitations of theD-brane system enters in a crucial way. We also derive the near-extreme resultswhich agree with the semi-classical calculations.
