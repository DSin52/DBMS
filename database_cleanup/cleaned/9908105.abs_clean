Title: Born-Infeld action, supersymmetry and string theory

Comments: 37 pages, harvmac, contribution to Yuri Golfand memorial volume;

misprints correctedWe review and elaborate on some aspects of Born-Infeld action and itsaction from string theory; some properties of bosonic D=4 BI action; N=1 andN=2 supersymmetric BI actions with manifest linear D=4 supersymmetry;four-derivative terms in N=4 supersymmetric BI action; BI actions with`deformed' supersymmetry from D-brane actions; non-abelian generalization of BIaction; derivative corrections to BI action in open superstring theory.
