Within the framework of generalized functions a general consistent definitionof double commutators is given. This definition respects the Jacobi identityeven if the regularization is removed. The double commutator of fermioniccurrents is calculated in this limit. We show that BJL--type prescriptions andpoint--splitting prescriptions for calculating double commutators fail to givecorrect results in free field theory.
