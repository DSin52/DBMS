We review a perturbative approach to deal with Lagrangians with higher orinfinite order time derivatives. It enables us to construct a consistentPoisson structure and Hamiltonian with only first time derivatives order byorder in coupling. To the lowest order, the Hamiltonian is bounded from belowwhenever the potential is. We consider spacetime noncommutative field theory asan example.
