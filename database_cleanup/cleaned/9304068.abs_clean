The three dimensional black hole solutions of Ba\~nados, Teitelboim andZanelli (BTZ) are dimensionally reduced in various different ways. Solutionsare obtained to the Jackiw-Teitelboim theory of two dimensional gravity forspinless BTZ black holes, and to a simple extension with a non-zero dilatonpotential for black holes of fixed spin. Similar reductions are given forcharged black holes. The resulting two dimensional solutions are themselvesblack holes, and are appropriate for investigating exact ``S-wave'' scatteringin the BTZ metrics. Using a different dimensional reduction to the stringinspired model of two dimensional gravity, the BTZ solutions are related to thefamiliar two dimensional black hole and the linear dilaton vacuum.
