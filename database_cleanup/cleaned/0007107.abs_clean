We discuss the characteristic properties of noncommutative solitons movingwith constant velocity. As noncommutativity breaks the Lorentz symmetry, theshape of moving solitons is affected not just by the Lorentz contraction alongthe velocity direction, but also sometimes by additional `elongation'noncommutative solitons in a scalar field theory on two spatial dimension and`long stick' shaped noncommutative U(2) magnetic monopoles. However theelongation factors of these two cases are different, and so not universal.
