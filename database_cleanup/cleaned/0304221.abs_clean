Title: Gravitational Topological Quantum Field Theory Versus N=2 D=8

SupergravityAuthors: Laurent Baulieu

In a previous work, it was shown that the 8-dimensional topological quantumfield theory for a metric and a Kalb--Ramond 2-form gauge field determines N=1D=8 supergravity. It is shown here that, the combination of this TQFT with thatof a 3-form determines N=2 D=8 supergravity, that is, an untruncateddimensional reduction of N=1D=11 supergravity. Our construction holds for8-dimensional manifolds with Spin(7) \subset SO(8) holonomy. We suggest thatthe origin of local Poincar\'e supersymmetry is the gravitational topologicalsymmetry.
