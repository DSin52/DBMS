In this work we propose an exact microscopic description of maximallysymmetric branes in a Euclidean $AdS_3$ background. As shown by Bachas andPetropoulos, the most important such branes are localized along a Euclidean$AdS_2 \subset AdS_3$. We provide explicit formulas for the coupling of closedstrings to such branes (boundary states) and for the spectral density of openstrings. The latter is computed in two different ways first in terms of theopen string reflection amplitude and then also from the boundary states byworld-sheet duality. This gives rise to an important Cardy type consistencycheck. All the results are compared in detail with the geometrical picture. Wealso discuss a second class of branes with spherical symmetry and finallycomment on some implications for D-branes in a 2D back hole geometry.
