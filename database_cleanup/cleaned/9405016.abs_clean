We discuss a new type of unitary perturbations around conformal theoriesinspired by the $\sigma$-model perturbation of the nonunitary WZNW model. Weshow that the nonunitary level $k$ WZNW model perturbed by its sigma model termgoes to the unitary level $-k$ WZNW model. When plugged into the gauged WZNWmodel the given perturbation results in the perturbed gauged WZNW model whichno longer describes a coset construction. We consider the BRST invariantgeneralization of the sigma model perturbation around the gauged WZNW model. Inthis way we obtain perturbed coset constructions. In the case of the$SU_{m-2}(2)\times SU_1(2)/SU_{m-1}(2)$ coset, the BRST invariant sigma modelperturbation is identical to Zamolodchikov's $\Phi_{(3,1)}$ perturbation of theminimal conformal series. The existence of general geometry flows is clarified.
