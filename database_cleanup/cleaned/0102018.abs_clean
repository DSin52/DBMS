In a geometrical background, D-brane charge is classified by topologicalK-theory. The corresponding classification of D-brane charge in an arbitrary,nongeometrical, compactification is still a mystery. We study D-branes onnon-simply-connected Calabi-Yau 3-folds, with particular interest in theD-branes whose charges are torsion elements of the K-theory. We argue that wecan follow the D-brane charge through the nongeometrical regions of the Kahlermoduli space and, as evidence, explicitly construct torsion D-branes at theGepner point in some examples. In one of our examples, the Gepner theory is anonabelian orbifold of a tensor product of minimal models, and this somewhatexotic situation seems to be essential to the physics.
