Title: Deformation Quantization

TheoryAuthors: Stefan Waldmann

Comments: LaTeX2e, 32 pages. Lecture notes for the Kopaonik summer school 2002

In these lecture notes I give an introduction to deformation quantization.The quantization problem is discussed in some detail thereby motivating thenotion of star products. Starting from a deformed observable algebra, i.e. thestar product algebra, physical applications require to study representations ofthis algebra. I review the recent development of a representation theoryincluding techniques like Rieffel induction and Morita equivalence.Applications beyond quantization theory are found in noncommutative fieldtheories.
