We examine the various linkings in space-time of ``ball-like'' and``ring-like'' topological solitons in certain nonlinear sigma models in 2+1 and3+1 dimensions. By going to theories where soliton overlaps are forbidden,these linkings become homotopically nontrivial and can be studied byinvestigating the topology of the corresponding configuration spaces. Ouranalysis reveals the existence of topological terms which give the linkingnumber of the world-tubes of distinct species of ball solitons in 2+1dimensions, or which in 3+1 dimensions count the number of times a ball or ringsoliton threads through the center of a ring of a different species. Weexplicitly construct these terms for our models, and generalize them to caseswhere soliton overlaps are no longer strictly forbidden so the terms are nolonger purely topological. One of the (3+1)-dimensional theories we consideralso has topological solitons which consist of two rings (of distinct species)linked in space.
