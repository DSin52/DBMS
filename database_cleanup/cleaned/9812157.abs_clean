Starting from a one-particle quasi-exactly solvable system, which ischaracterized by an intrinsic sl(2) algebraic structure and theenergy-reflection symmetry, we construct a daughter N-body Hamiltonianpresenting a deformation of the Calogero model. The features of thisHamiltonian are (i) it reduces to a quadratic combination of the generators ofsl(N+1); (ii) the interaction potential contains two-body terms and interactionwith the force center at the origin; (iii) for quantized values of a certaincohomology parameter n it is quasi-exactly solvable, the multiplicity of statesin the algebraic sector is (N+n)!/(N!n!); (iv) the energy-reflection symmetryof the parent system is preserved.
