We study a topological field theory in four dimensions on a manifold withboundary. A bulk-boundary interaction is introduced through a novel variationalprinciple rather than explicitly. Through this scheme we find that the boundaryvalues of the bulk fields act as external sources for the boundary theory.Furthermore, the full quantum states of the theory factorize into a single bulkstate and an infinite number of boundary states labeled by loops on the spatialboundary. In this sense the theory is purely holographic. We show that thistheory is dual to Chern-Simons theory with an external source. We also pointout that the holographic hypothesis must be supplemented by additionalassumptions in order to take into account bulk topological degrees freedom,since these are apriori invisible to local boundary fields.
