The standard formula for the change in the effective action under a conformaltransformation is extended to the case when the boundary is piecewise smooth.We then find the functional determinants of the scalar Laplacian on regions ofthe plane obtained by stereographic projection of the fundamental domains on anorbifolded two-sphere. Examples treated are the sector of a disk and a circularcrescent. The effective action on a spherical cap is also determined.
