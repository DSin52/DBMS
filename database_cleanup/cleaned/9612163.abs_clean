Light-front Hamiltonian methods are being developed to attack bound-stateproblems in QCD. In this paper we advance the state of the art for thesemethods by computing the well-known Lamb shift in hydrogen starting from firstprinciples of QED. There are obvious but significant qualitative differencesbetween QED and QCD. In this paper, we discuss the similarities that maysurvive in a non-perturbative QCD calculation in the context of a precisionnon-perturbative QED calculation. Central to the discussion are how aconstituent picture arises in a gauge field theory, how bound-state energyscales emerge to guide the renormalization procedure, and how rotationalinvariance emerges in a light-front calculation.
