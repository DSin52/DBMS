remarks addedWe study the nature of the force between a D-brane and an anti-D-brane in themaximally supersymmetric plane wave background of type IIB superstring theory,which is equipped with a mass parameter mu. An early such study in flatspacetime(mu=0) served to sharpen intuition about D-brane interactions, showingin particular the key role of the "stringy halo" that surrounds a D-brane. Thehalo marks the edge of the region within which tachyon condensation occurs,opening a gateway to new non-trivial vacua of the theory. It seems pertinent tostudy the fate of the halo for non-zero mu. Focusing on the simplest cases ofp=+1,-1, we find here that for branes located at the origin, the radius of thehalo shrinks for increasing mu. For branes away from the origin, this shrinkingpersists, and is accompanied by a shift of the centre of the halo away from theD-brane. In fact, we observe that for large enough mu, or beyond a criticaldistance from the origin, D-branes can lose their halo entirely! We suspectthat the consequences of this physics for key notions about the dynamics,stability and classification of D-branes (such as tachyon condensation,K-theory, etc.,) may well be quite significant.
