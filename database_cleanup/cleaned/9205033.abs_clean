Strong anti-gravity is the vanishing to all orders in Newton's constant ofthe net force between two massive particles at rest. We study this phenomenonand show that it occurs in any effective theory of gravity which is obtainedfrom a higher-dimensional model by compactification on a manifold with flatdirections. We find the exact solution of the Einstein equations in thepresence of a point-like source of strong anti-gravity by dimensional reductionof what is a shock-wave solution in the higher-dimensional model.
