Comments: 7 pages, espcrc2.sty. Based on talk given at the International

Conference ``Supersymmetry and Quantum Field Theory'', Kharkov, July 25-29,2000Journal-ref: Nucl.Phys.Proc.Suppl. 102 (2001) 100-106

Massive arbitrary spin fields in AdS(3) spacetime are discussed in aframework of light-cone gauge formulation. We also consider compactification ofAdS spacetime on manifold which is warped product of AdS space and sphere. Massspectra of massless and massive fields upon such compactification are found.
