We present new supersymmetric extensions of Conformal Toda and $A^{(1)}_N$Affine Toda field theories. These new theories are constructed using methodssimilar to those that have been developed to find supersymmetric extensions oftwo-dimensional bosonic sigma models with a scalar potential. In particular, weshow that the Conformal Toda field theory admits a (1,1)-supersymmetricextension, and the $A^{(1)}_N$ Affine Toda field admits a (1,0)-supersymmetricextension.
