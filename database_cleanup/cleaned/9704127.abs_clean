We discuss long-distance, low-velocity interaction potentials for processesinvolving longitudinally boosted M5-brane (corresponding in type IIA theorylanguage to the 1/4 supersymmetric bound state of 4-brane and 0-brane). Welongitudinal M5-brane, or, equivalently, 0-branes off marginal 4+0 bound state;(b) M2-brane off longitudinal M5-brane, or a non-marginal 2+0 bound state offmarginal 4+0 bound state; (c) two parallel longitudinal M5-branes, or two 4+0marginal bound states. We demonstrate the equivalence between the classicalclosed string theory (supergravity) and M(atrix) model (one-loop superYang-Mills) results for the leading terms in the interaction potentials. Thesupergravity results are obtained using a generalisation of the classical probemethod which allows one to treat bound states of D-branes as probes byintroducing non-trivial world-volume gauge field backgrounds.
