Title: Supersymmetric Generalization of the Tensor Matter Fields

Authors: V.E.R. Lemes, A.L.M.A. Nogueira, J.A. Helay\"el-Neto

Comments: 12 pages, Latex, no figures. The section concerning symmetry breaking

is revised, leading to new conclusions. A discussion on the spinorial degreesof freedom is included, and references are addedJournal-ref: Int.J.Mod.Phys. A13 (1998) 3145-3156

The supersymmetric generalization of a recently proposed Abelian axial gaugemodel with antisymmetric tensor matter fields is presented.
