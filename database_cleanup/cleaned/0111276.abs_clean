Title: The Cardy-Verlinde Formula and Asymptotically de Sitter Brane Universe

Comments: 12 pages, LaTeX, revised version with minor corrections to appear in

Phys. Lett. BWe consider the brane universe in the bulk background of the topologicalAdS-Schwarzschild black holes, where the brane tension takes larger value thanthe fine-tunned value. The resulting universe is radiation dominated and haspositive cosmological constant. We obtain the associated cosmological Cardyformula and the Cardy-Verlinde formula. We also derive the Hubble and theBekenstein entropy bounds from the conjectured holography bound on the Casimirentropy.
