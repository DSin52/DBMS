Title: Spectral Representation of Correlation Functions in two-dimensional

Quantum Field TheoriesAuthors: G. Mussardo

Comments: 9 pages, ISAS/60/94/EP

The non-perturbative mapping between different Quantum Field Theories andother features of two-dimensional massive integrable models are discussed byusing the Form Factor approach. The computation of ultraviolet data associatedto the massive regime is illustrated by taking as an example the scatteringtheory of the Ising Model with boundary.
