Title: Equivalence of Constrained Models

Comments: 11 pages

Journal-ref: Int.J.Theor.Phys. 38 (1999) 1429-1438

We study two constrained scalar models. While there seems to be equivalencewhen the partially integrated Feynman path integral is expanded graphically,the dynamical behaviour of the two models are different when quantization isdone using Dirac constraint analysis.
