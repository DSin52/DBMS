It was conjectured by Jackson et.al. that the finite volume effectivepartition function of QCD with the topological charge $M-N$ coincides with theItzyskon-Zuber type integral for $M\times N$ rectangular matrices. In thepresent article we give a proof of this conjecture, in which the originalItzykson-Zuber integral is utilized.
