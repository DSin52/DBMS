We study special points in the moduli space of vacua at which supersymmetricelectric solutions of the heterotic string theory become massless. Weconcentrate on configurations for which supersymmetric non-renormalizationtheorem is valid. Those are ten-dimensional supersymmetric string waves andgeneralized fundamental strings with SO(8) holonomy group. From these we findthe four dimensional spherically symmetric configurations which saturate theBPS bound, in particular near the points of the vanishing ADM mass. Thenon-trivial massless supersymmetric states in this class exist only in thepresence of non-Abelian vector fields.We also find a new class ofsupersymmetric massive solutions, closely related to the massless ones. Adistinctive property of all these objects, either massless or massive, is theexistence of gravitational repulsion. They reflect all particles withnonvanishing mass and/or angular momentum, and therefore they can be calledwhite holes (repulsons), in contrast to black holes which tend to absorbparticles of all kinds. If such objects can exist, we will have the firstrealization of the universal gravitational force which repels all particleswith the strength proportional to their mass and therefore can be associatedwith antigravity.
