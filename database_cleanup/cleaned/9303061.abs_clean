We calculate the one-loop effective potential of a self-interacting scalarfield on the spacetime of the form $\reals^2\times H^2/\Gamma$. The Selbergtrace formula associated with a co-compact discrete group $\Gamma$ in$PSL(2,\reals )$ (hyperbolic and elliptic elements only) is used. The closedform for the one-loop unrenormalized and renormalized effective potentials isgiven. The influence of non-trivial topology on curvature induced phasetransitions is also discussed.
