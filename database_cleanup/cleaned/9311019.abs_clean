We show how to apply post selection in the context of weak measurement ofAharonov and collaborators to construct the quantum back reaction on aclassical field. The particular case which we study in this paper is paircreation in an external electric field and the back reaction is the counterfield produced by the pair \underline {as} it is made. The construction leadsto a complex electric field obtained from non diagonal matrix elements of thecurrent operator, the interpretation of which is clear in terms of weakmeasurement. The analogous construction applied to black hole physics (therebyleading to a complex metric) is relegated to a future paper.
