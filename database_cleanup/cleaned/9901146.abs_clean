Title: Two Lectures on D-Geometry and Noncommutative Geometry

Authors: Michael R. Douglas

Comments: LaTeX, 26 pp. Added reference

This is a write-up of lectures given at the 1998 Spring School at the AbdusSalam ICTP. We give a conceptual introduction to D-geometry, the study ofgeometry as seen by D-branes in string theory, and to noncommutative geometryas it has appeared in D-brane and Matrix theory physics.
