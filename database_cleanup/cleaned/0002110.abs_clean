In this letter we argue that instanton-dominated Green's functions in N=2Super Yang-Mills theories can be equivalently computed either using theso-called constrained instanton method or making reference to the topologicaltwisted version of the theory. Defining an appropriate BRST operator (as asupersymmetry plus a gauge variation), we also show that the expansioncoefficients of the Seiberg-Witten effective action for the low-energy degreesof freedom can be written as integrals of total derivatives over the modulispace of self-dual gauge connections.
