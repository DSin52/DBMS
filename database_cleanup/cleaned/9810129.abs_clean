It has recently been suggested that in certain special nonsupersymmetric typeII string compactifications, at least the first two perturbative contributionsto the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ vanish. Support for perturbativevanishing beyond 1-loop (as well as evidence for the absence of somenonperturbative contributions) has come from duality arguments. There was alsoa direct 2-loop computation which was incomplete; in this note we explain thedeficiency of the previous 2-loop calculation and discuss the complete 2-loopcomputation in two different models. The corrected analysis yields a vanishing2-loop contribution to $\Lambda$ in these models.
