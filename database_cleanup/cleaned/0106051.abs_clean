An off-shell formulation is given for the ``supersymmetry in singularspaces'' which has recently been developed in an on-shell formalism byBergshoeff, Kallosh and Van Proeyen using supersymmetry singlet `couplingconstant' field and 4-form multiplier field in five-dimensional space-time. Wepresent this formulation for a general supergravity-Yang-Mills-hypermultipletcoupled system compactified on an orbifold $S^1/Z_2$. Relations between thebulk cosmological constant and brane tensions of the boundary planes arediscussed.
