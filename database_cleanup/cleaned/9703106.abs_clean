Journal-ref: "25th Coral Gables Conference on High Energy Physics and

Cosmology" (Plenum Press,1997).We study the QED bound-state problem in a light-front hamiltonian approach.It is important to establish the equivalence (or not) of equal-time andlight-front approaches in the well-understood arena of Quantum Electrodynamics.Along these lines, the singlet-triplet ground state spin splitting inpositronium is calculated. The well-known result, $(7/6) \alpha^2 Ryd$,is obtained analytically, which establishes the equivalence between theequal-time and light-front approaches (at least to this order). The trueequivalence of the two approaches can only be established after higher-ordercalculations. It was previously shown that this light-front result could beobtained analytically, but a simpler method is presented in this paper.
