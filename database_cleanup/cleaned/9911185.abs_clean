School on Basics and Highlights in Fundamental Physics, August 1999A macroscopic universe may emerge naturally from a Planck cell fluctuation byunfolding through a stage of exponential expansion towards a homogeneouscosmological background. Such primordial inflation requires a large andpresumably infinite degeneracy at the Planck scale, rooted in the unboundednegative gravitational energy stored in conformal classes. This complex Planckstructure is consistent with a quantum tunneling description of the transitionfrom the Planck scale to the inflationary era and implies, in the limit ofvanishing Planck size, the Hartle-Hawking no-time boundary condition. On theother hand, string theory give credence to the holographic principle and theconcomitant depletion of states at the Planck scale. The apparentincompatibility of primordial inflation with holography either invalidates oneof these two notions or relegates the nature of the Planck size outside therealm of quantum physics, as we know it.
