Conditions for the construction of polynomial eigen--operators for theHamiltonian of collective string field theories are explored. Sucheigen--operators arise for only one monomial potential $v(x) = \mu x^2$ in thecollective field theory. They form a $w_{\infty}$--algebra isomorphic to thealgebra of vertex operators in 2d gravity. Polynomial potentials of orders onlystrictly larger or smaller than 2 have no non--zero--energy polynomialeigen--operators. This analysis leads us to consider a particular potential$v(x)= \mu x^2 + g/x^2$. A Lie algebra of polynomial eigen--operators is thenconstructed for this potential. It is a symmetric 2--index Lie algebra, alsorepresented as a sub--algebra of $U (s\ell (2)).$
