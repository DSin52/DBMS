We analyze the connection between Wess-Zumino-Witten and free fermion modelsin two-dimensional noncommutative space. Starting from the computation of thedeterminant of the Dirac operator in a gauge field background, we derive thecorresponding bosonization recipe studying, as an example, bosonization of theU(N) Thirring model. Concerning the properties of the noncommutativeWess-Zumino-Witten model, we construct an orbit-preserving transformation thatmaps the standard commutative WZW action into the noncommutative one.
