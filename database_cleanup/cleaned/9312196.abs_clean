Title: Drinfel'd algebra deformations and the associahedra

Comments: 6 pages

We construct a cohomology theory controlling the deformations of a generalDrinfel'd algebra. The picture presented here has two sides -- thecombinatorial one related with the fact of the existence of a graded Liealgebra structure on the simplicial cochain complex of the associahedra, andthe algebraic one related with the algebra of derivations on the barconstruction.
