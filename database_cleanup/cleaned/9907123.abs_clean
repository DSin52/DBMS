on Vafa-Witten partition function improvedThis thesis presents a thorough analysis of the links between the N=4supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions and its three topologicaltwisted counterparts. Special emphasis is put in deriving explicit results interms of the vacuum structure and low-energy effective description offour-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories. A key ingredient is therealization of Montonten-Olive duality in the twisted theories, which isdiscussed in detail from different viewpoints.
