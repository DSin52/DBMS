Local decompositions of a Dirac spinor into `charged' and `real' piecespsi(x) = M(x) chi(x) are considered. chi(x) is a Majorana spinor, and M(x) asuitable Dirac-algebra valued field. Specific examples of the decomposition in2+1 dimensions are developed, along with kinematical implications, andconstraints on the component fields within M(x) sufficient to encompass thecorrect degree of freedom count. Overall local reparametrisation andelectromagnetic phase invariances are identified, and a dynamical framework ofnonabelian gauge theories of noncompact groups is proposed. Connections withsupersymmetric composite models are noted (including, for 2+1 dimensions,infrared effective theories of spin-charge separation in models of high-Tcsuperconductivity).
