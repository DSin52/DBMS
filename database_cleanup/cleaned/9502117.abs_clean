Title: Remarks on Large N Coherent States

Comments: 9 pages, plain TeX ( three misprints corrected; two references added)

Analogs of ordinary Gaussian coherent states on bosonic Fock spaces areconstructed for the case of free Fock spaces, which appear to be naturalmathematical structures suitable for description of large N matrix models.
