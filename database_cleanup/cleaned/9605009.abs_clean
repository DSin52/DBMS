The implications of conformal invariance, as relevant in quantum fieldtheories at a renormalisation group fixed point, are analysed with particularreference to results for correlation functions involving conserved currents andthe energy momentum tensor. Ward identities resulting from conformal invarianceare discussed. Explicit expressions for two and three point functions, whichare essentially determined by conformal invariance, are obtained. As specialcases we consider the three point functions for two vector and an axial currentin four dimensions, which realises the usual anomaly simply and unambiguously,and also for the energy momentum tensor in general dimension $d$. The latter isshown to have two linearly independent forms in which the Ward identities arerealised trivially, except if $d = 4$, when the two forms become degenerate.This is necessary in order to accommodate the two independent forms present inthe trace of the energy momentum tensor on curved space backgrounds forconformal field theories in four dimensions. The coefficients of the two traceanomaly terms are related to the three parameters describing the general energymomentum tensor three point function. The connections with gravitationaleffective actions depending on a background metric are described. A particularform due to Riegert is shown to be unacceptable. Conformally invariantexpressions for the effective action in four dimensions are obtained using theGreen function for a differential operator which has simple properties underlocal rescalings of the metric.
