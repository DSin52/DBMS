The recent construction of the non-semisimple gaugings of maximal D=5supergravity is reported here. This construction is worked out in the so-calledrheonomic approach, based on Free Differential Algebras and the solution oftheir Bianchi identities. In this approach the dualization mechanism betweenone-forms and two-forms is more transparent. The lagrangian is unnecessarysince the field equations follow from closure of the supersymmetry algebra.These theories contain 12-r self-dual two-forms and 15+r gauge vectors, r ofwhich are abelian and neutral. Such theories, whose existence has been provedand their supersymmetry algebra constructed, have potentially interestingproperties in relation with domain wall solutions and the trapping of gravity.
