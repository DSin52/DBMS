Following the work of Sen, we consider the correspondence between extremalblack holes and string states in the context of the entropy. We obtain andstudy properties of electrically charged black hole backgrounds of tree levelheterotic string theory compactified on a $p$ dimensional torus, for$D=(10-p)=4 \ldots 9$. We study in particular a one--parameter extremal classof these black holes, the members of which are shown to be supersymmetric. Wefind that the entropy of such an extremal black hole, when calculated at thestringy stretched horizon, scales in such a way that it can be identified withthe entropy of the elementary string state with the corresponding quantumnumbers.
