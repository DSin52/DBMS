A generalization of the two-dimensional Yang-Mills and generalized Yang-Millstheory is introduced in which the building B-F theory is nonlocal in theauxiliary field. The classical and quantum properties of this nonlocalgeneralization are investigated and it is shown that for large gauge groups,there exist a simple correspondence between the properties a nonlocal theoryand its corresponding local theory.
