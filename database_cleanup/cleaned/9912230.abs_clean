Using conformal field theory methods we construct a metric that describes thedistortion of space-time surrounding a D(irichlet)-brane (solitonic) defectafter being struck by another D-brane. By viewing our four-dimensional universeas such a struck brane, embedded in a five-dimensional space-time, we argue onthe appearance of a band of massive Kaluza-Klein excitations for the bulkgraviton which is localized in a region of the fifth dimension determined bythe inverse size of the band. The band incorporates the massless mode (ordinarygraviton) and its thickness is determined essentially by the width of theGaussian distribution describing the (target-space) quantum fluctuations of theintersecting-brane configuration.
