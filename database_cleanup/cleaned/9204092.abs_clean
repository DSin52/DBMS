It is well-known that solutions to the string equation are generated byelements of Sato's Grassmannian which are invariant under action of somedifferential operator. Here it is shown that this operator is nothing else thanthe infinitesimal operator of the group of additional symmetries of the KdVflow. This is done for KdV hierarchies of arbitrary orders. Virasoroconstraints are obtained in a slightly more general form than they are usuallywritten.
