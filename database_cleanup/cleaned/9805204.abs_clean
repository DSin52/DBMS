We study the 0+1 dimensional Chern-Simons theory at finite temperature withinthe framework of derivative expansion. We obtain various interesting relations,solve the theory within this framework and argue that the derivative expansionis not a suitable formalism for a study of the question of large gaugeinvariance.
