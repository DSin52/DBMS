The relativistic scattering of a spin-1/2 particle from an infinitely longsolenoid is considered in the framework of covariant perturbation theory. Thefirst order term agrees with the corresponding term in the series expansion ofthe exact amplitude, and second order term vanishes, thus proving that Bornapproximation is consistent.
