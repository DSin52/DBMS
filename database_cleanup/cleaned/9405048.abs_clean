Title: Supersymmetry, Path Integration, and the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem

A new supersymmetric proof of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem is presented.The Peierls bracket quantization scheme is used to quantize the supersymmetricclassical system corresponding to the index problem for the twisted Diracoperator. The problem of factor ordering is addressed and the unique quantumsystem that is relevant to the index theorem is analyzed in detail. TheHamiltonian operator is shown to include a scalar curvature factor,$\hbar^2R/8$. The path integral formulation of quantum mechanics is then usedto obtain a formula for the index. For the first time, the path integral"measure" and the Feynman propagator of the system are exactly computed. Thederivation of the index formula relies solely on the definition of a Gaussiansuperdeterminant. The two-loop analysis of the path integral is also carriedout. The results of the loop and heat kernel expansions of the path interal arein complete agreement. This confirms the existence of the scalar curvaturefactor in the Schr\"odinger equation and validates the supersymmetric proof ofthe index theorem. Many other related issues are addressed. Finally, reviews ofthe index theorem and the supersymmetric quantum mechanics are presented.
