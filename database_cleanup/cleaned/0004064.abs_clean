Journal-ref: Gen.Rel.Grav. 34 (2002) 1-7

It has recently been proposed that our universe is a three-brane embedded ina higher dimensional spacetime. Here I show that black holes on the brane,black strings intersecting the brane, and gravitational waves propagating inthe bulk induce an effective energy-momentum tensor on the brane that containsnegative energy densities.
