Neutral fermions of spin 1/2 with magnetic moment can interact withelectromagnetic fields through nonminimal coupling. In 2+1 dimensions theelectromagnetic field strength plays the same role to the magnetic moment asthe vector potential to the electric charge. This duality enables one to obtainphysical results for neutral particles from known ones for charged particles.We give the probability of neutral particle-antiparticle pair creation in thevacuum by non-uniform electromagnetic fields produced by constant uniformcharge and current densities.
