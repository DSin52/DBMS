Title: Vacuum Polarization of a Scalar Field in a Rectangular Waveguide

Authors: R.B. Rodrigues and N.F. Svaiter

Comments: 42 pages, Latex; revised version, case of massive scalar field in d

dimensions addedAn analysis of the one-loop vacuum fluctuations associated with a scalarfield confined in the interior of a infinite waveguide of rectangular crosssection is presented. We first consider the massless scalar field defined in afour-dimensional Euclidean space. To identify the infinities of the vacuumfluctuations we use a combination of dimensinal and zeta function analyticregularization procedures. The infinities which occur in the one-loop vacuumrenormalized by the introduction of bulk counterterms and also surface andedges divergences that demand countertems concentrated on the boundaries. Wepresent the detailed form of the surface and edge divergences. Finally wediscuss how to generalize our calculations for a confined massive scalar fielddefined in a higher dimensional Euclidean space.
