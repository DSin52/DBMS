Using the reduced WZNW formulation we analyse the classical $W$ orbit contentof the space of classical solutions of the $A_2$ Toda theory. We define thequantized Toda field as a periodic primary field of the $W$ algebra satifyingthe quantized equations of motion.We show that this local operator can be constructed consistently only in aHilbert space consisting of the representations corresponding to the minimalmodels of the $W$ algebra.
