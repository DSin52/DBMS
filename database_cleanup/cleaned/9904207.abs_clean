Title: Non-BPS States and Branes in String Theory

Comments: LaTeX file, epsf, 53 pages, 17 figures, APCTP winter school lectures

We review the recent developments in our understanding of non-BPS states andbranes in string theory. The topics include 1) construction of unstable non-BPSD-branes in type IIA and type IIB string theories, 2) construction of stablenon-BPS D-branes on various orbifolds and orientifolds of type II stringtheories, 3) description of BPS and non-BPS D-branes as tachyonic solitonsolutions on brane-antibrane pair of higher dimension, and 4) study of thespectrum of non-BPS states and branes on a system of coincident D-brane -orientifold plane system. Some other related results are also discussedbriefly.
