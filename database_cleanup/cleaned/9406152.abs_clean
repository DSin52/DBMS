The dual version of the D=10 N=1 supergravity (SUGRA) is considered in thesuperspace approach. The superstring (anomaly compensating) corrections aredescribed by the 3-form superfield $A_{abc}$ . The complete set of dynamicalequations for the $A$-field and for physical fields of the theory arepresented. The solution of the $A$-field equations as a finite order polynomialin terms of curvature and graviphoton superfields is given. It makes possibleto incorporate some of the superstring corrections in the dual supergravity inthe explicit, supersymmetric and closed form.
