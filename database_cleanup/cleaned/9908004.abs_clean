suggested this hep-th versionWe explore the interplay between black holes in supergravity and quantumfield theories on the world-volumes of D-branes. A brief summary of black holeentropy calculations for D-brane black holes is followed by a detailed study ofparticle absorption by black holes whose string theory description involvesD-branes intersecting along a string. A conformal field theory with largecentral charge describes the low-energy excitations of this string. Theabsorption cross-sections give rise to greybody factors in Hawking radiationprocesses which are characteristic of conformal field theory at finitetemperature.Particle absorption by extremal three-branes is examined next, withparticular attention to the implications for supersymmetric gauge theory infour dimensions. A fascinating duality between supergravity and gauge theoryemerges from the study of these processes. Fields of supergravity are dual tolocal operators in the gauge theory. A non-renormalization theorem of N=4 gaugetheory helps explain why certain aspects of the duality can be exploredperturbatively. Anomalous dimensions of a large class of local operators in thegauge theory are shown to become large at strong 't Hooft coupling, signaling apossible simplification of N=4 gauge theory in this limit.
