I propose a general class of space-times whose structure is governed byobserver-independent scales of both velocity ($c$) and length (Planck length),and I observe that these space-times can naturally host a modification ofFitzGerald-Lorentz contraction such that lengths which in their inertial restframe are bigger than a "minimum length" are also bigger than the minimumlength in all other inertial frames. With an analysis in leading order in theminimum length, I show that this is the case in a specific illustrative exampleof postulates for Relativity with velocity and length observer-independentscales.
