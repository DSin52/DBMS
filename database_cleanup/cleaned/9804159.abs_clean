We present a derivation of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy from conformalfield theories. In particular we consider a six-dimensional stringconfiguration with background metric AdS_3 * S^3 near the horizon. In additionwe introduce momentum modes along the string, corresponding to aBanados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole in the anti-de Sitter (AdS)space-time, and a Taub-NUT soliton in the transverse Euclidean space,projecting out a discrete subgroub of S^3. This spherical part is described bya SU(2)/Z(m) Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model. The AdS_3 space-time, on the otherhand, is determined by two conformal field theories living at the twoone Liouville model at infinity. The extremal BTZ black hole interpolatesbetween these two conformal field theories. Moreover, we argue that the sum ofthe three conformal field theories yields the correct microscopicstate-counting including all alpha' corrections.
