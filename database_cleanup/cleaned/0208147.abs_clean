A challenge in the theory of integrable systems is to show for everynonultralocal quantum integrable model, a possible connection to an ultralocalmodel. Some of such gauge connections were discovered earlier. We complete thetask by identifying the same for the remaining ones along with two new models.We also unveil the underlying algebraic structure for these nonultralocalmodels.
