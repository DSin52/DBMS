We present a classification of $W$ algebras and superalgebras arising inAbelian as well as non Abelian Toda theories. Each model, obtained from aconstrained WZW action, is related with an $Sl(2)$ subalgebra (resp. $OSp(1|2)$superalgebra) of a simple Lie algebra (resp. superalgebra) $\cg$. However, thedetermination of an $U(1)_Y$ factor, commuting with $Sl(2)$ (resp. $OSp(1|2)$),appears, when it exists, particularly useful to characterize the corresponding$W$ algebra. The (super) conformal spin contents of each $W$ (super)algebra isperformed. The class of all the superconformal algebras (i.e. with conformalspins $s\leq2$) is easily obtained as a byproduct of our general results.
