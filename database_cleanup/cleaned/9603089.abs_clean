The T-duality transformations between open and closed superstrings indifferent D-manifolds are generalized to curved backgrounds with commutingisometries. We address some global aspects like the occurrence of orientifoldboundaries in general sigma models, higher genus world sheets, and the case ofnon-compact isometries. The various world volume effective actions are shown totransform properly under T-duality. We also include a brief discussion of thecanonical transformations of boundary states in the operator formalism.
