We rederive the $w_\infty$ Ward identities, starting from the existence oftrivial linearized gauge invariances, and using the method of canceledpropagators in the operator formalism. Recursion relations for certain classesof correlation functions are derived, and these correlation function arecalculated exactly. We clarify the relation of these results with anotherderivation of the Ward identities, which relies directly on chargeconservation. We also emphasize the importance of the kinematics of canceledpropagators in ensuring that the Ward identities are non-trivial. Finally, wesketch an extension of Ward identities to open strings.
