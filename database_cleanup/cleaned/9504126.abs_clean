We study the renormalization of the Ricci curvature as an example ofgenerally covariant operators in quantum gravity near two dimensions. We findthat it scales with a definite scaling dimension at short distance. The Riccicurvature singularity at the big bang can be viewed as such a scalingphenomenon. The problem of the spacetime singularity may be resolved by thescale invariance of the spacetime at short distance.
