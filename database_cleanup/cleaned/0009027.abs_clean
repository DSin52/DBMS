Title: Gauge strata and particle generations

Authors: R. Vilela Mendes (Grupo de Fisica Matematica, UL, Lisboa)

Phenomenological evidence suggests the existence of non-trivial backgroundfields in the QCD vacuum. On the other hand SU(3) gauge theory possessses threedifferent classes of both non-generic and non-trivial strata that may be usedas classical backgrounds. It is suggested that this three-fold multiplicity ofnon-trivial vacua may be related to the existence of particle generations,which would then find an explanation in the framework of the standard model.
