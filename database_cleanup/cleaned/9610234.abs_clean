On the world-volume of an $M$-theory five-brane propagates a two-form withself-dual field strength. As this field is non-Lagrangian, there is no obviousframework for determining its partition function. An analogous problem existsin Type IIB superstring theory for the self-dual five-form. The resolution ofthese problems and definition of the partition function is explained. A morecomplete analysis of perturbative anomaly cancellation for $M$-theoryfive-branes is also presented, uncovering some surprising details.
