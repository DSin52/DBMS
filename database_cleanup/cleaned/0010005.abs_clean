Title: Four - Point Functions of Chiral Primary Operators in N=4 SYM

Authors: B. Eden, C. Schubert, E. Sokatchev

Comments: 7 pages, talk given by C. Schubert at "Quantization, Gauge Theory and

Strings", dedicated to the memory of E.S. Fradkin, Moscow, June 5-10, 2000We discuss recent progress in the determination of correlators of chiralprimary operators in N=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory, based on a combination ofsuperconformal covariance arguments in N=2 harmonic superspace, andIntriligator's insertion formula. Applying this technique to the calculation ofthe supercurrent four - point function we obtain a compact and explicit resultfor its three-loop contribution with comparatively little effort.
