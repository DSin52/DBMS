Title: Geometry and W-Gravity

Authors: C.M. Hull

Comments: 31 pages

The higher-spin geometries of $W_\infty$-gravity and$W_N$-gravity are analysed and used to derive the complete non-linearstructure of the coupling to matter and its symmetries. The symmetry group is asubgroup of the symplectic diffeomorphisms of the cotangent bundle of theworld-sheet, and the $W_N$ geometry is obtained from a non-linear truncation ofthe $W_\infty$ geometry. Quantum W-gravity is briefly discussed. (Talk given at{\it Pathways to Fundamental Interactions}, the 16th John Hopkins Workshop onCurrent Problems in Particle Theory, Gothenborg, 1992.)
