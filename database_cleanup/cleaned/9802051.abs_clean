Comments: LaTeX file, 129 pages, 22 figures, Lectures given at Isaac Newton

Institute and DAMTP, Cambridge, references added, typos correctedIn this review I discuss some basic aspects of non-perturbative stringtheory. The topics include test of duality symmetries based on the analysis ofthe low energy effective action and the spectrum of BPS states, relationshipbetween different duality symmetries, an introduction to M- and F-theories,black hole entropy in string theory, and Matrix theory.
