We remark that the weak coupling regime of the stochastic stabilization of 2Dquantum gravity has a unique perturbative vacuum, which does not supportinstanton configurations. By means of Monte Carlo simulations we show that thenonperturbative vacuum is also confined in one potential well. Nonperturbativeeffects can be assessed in the loop equation. This can be derived from the Wardidentities of the stabilized model and is shown to be modified bynonperturbative terms.
