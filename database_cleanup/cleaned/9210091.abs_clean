Supergeneralization of $\DC P(N)$ provided by even and odd K\"ahlerianstructures from Hamiltonian reduction are construct.Operator $ \Delta$ whichused in Batalin-- Vilkovisky quantization formalism and mechanics which arebi-Hamiltonian under corresponding even and odd Poisson brackets areconsidered.
