An abundance of the Poisson-Lie symmetries of the WZNW models is uncovered.They give rise, via the Poisson-Lie $T$-duality, to a rich structure of thedual pairs of $D$-branes configurations in group manifolds. The $D$-branes arecharacterized by their shapes and certain two-forms living on them. The WZNWpath integral for the interacting $D$-branes diagrams is unambiguously definedif the two-form on the $D$-brane and the WZNW three-form on the group form aninteger-valued cocycle in the relative singular cohomology of the groupmanifold with respect to its $D$-brane submanifold. An example of the $SU(N)$WZNW model is studied in some detail.
