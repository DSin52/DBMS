We find that the target space of two-dimensional (4,0) supersymmetric sigmamodels with torsion coupled to (4,0) supergravity is a QKT manifold, that is, aquaternionic K\"ahler manifold with torsion. We give four examples ofgeodesically complete QKT manifolds one of which is a generalisation of theLeBrun geometry. We then construct the twistor space associated with a QKTmanifold and show that under certain conditions it is a K\"ahler manifold witha complex contact structure. We also show that, for every 4k-dimensional QKTmanifold, there is an associated 4(k+1)-dimensional hyper-K\"ahler one.
