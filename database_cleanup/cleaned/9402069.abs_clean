We prove that each action of a compact matrix quantum group on a compactquantum space can be decomposed into irreducible representations of the group.We give the formula for the corresponding multiplicities in the case of thequotient quantum spaces. We describe the subgroups and the quotient spaces ofquantum SU(2) and SO(3) groups.
