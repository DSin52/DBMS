We argue that Yang-Mills theory on noncommutative torus, expressed in theFourrier modes, is described by a gauge theory in a usual commutative space,the gauge group being a generalization of the area-preserving diffeomorphismsto the noncommutative case. In this way, performing the loop calculation inthis gauge theory in the continuum limit we show that this theory is {\it oneloop renormalizable}, and discuss the UV and IR limits. The moduli space of thevacua of the noncommutative super Yang-Mills theories in (2+1) dimensions isdiscussed.
