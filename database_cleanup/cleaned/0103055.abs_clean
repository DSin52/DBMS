We propose a renormalization group scaling function which is constructed fromq-deformed fermionic versions of Virasoro characters. By comparison withalternative methods, which take their starting point in the massive theories,we demonstrate that these new functions contain qualitatively the sameinformation. We show that these functions allow for RG-flows not only amongstmembers of a particular series of conformal field theories, but also betweendifferent series such as N=0,1,2 supersymmetric conformal field theories. Weprovide a detailed analysis of how Weyl characters may be utilized in order tosolve various recurrence relations emerging at the fixed points of these flows.The q-deformed Virasoro characters allow furthermore for the construction ofparticle spectra, which involve unstable pseudo-particles.
