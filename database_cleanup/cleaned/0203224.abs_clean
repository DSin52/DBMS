Title: On brane cosmological solutions

Comments: 8 pages, Latex2e

This paper presents some cosmological consequences of the five dimensional,two brane Randall-Sundrum brane scenario. The radius of the compact extradimension is taken to be time dependent. It is shown that the cosmologyconsistent with the two brane Randall-Sundrum model is a power law expansion ofthe universe, with scale factor growing as $t^{1/2}$. The two branes tend tomove towards each other with time. Some comments are made on the contributionof surface terms in deriving the four dimensional effective action.
