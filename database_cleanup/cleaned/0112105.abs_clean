Within a variational calculation we investigate the role of baryons for thestructure of dense matter in the Gross-Neveu model. We construct a trial groundstate at finite baryon density which breaks translational invariance. Itsscalar potential interpolates between widely spaced kinks and antikinks at lowdensity and the value zero at infinite density. Its energy is lower than theone of the standard Fermi gas at all densities considered. This suggests thatthe discrete gamma_5 symmetry of the Gross-Neveu model does not get restored ina first order phase transition at finite density, at variance with commonwisdom.
