(Ixtapa, Sept. 93)We explore a differential calculus on the algebra of smooth functions on amanifold. The former is `noncommutative' in the sense that functions anddifferentials do not commute, in general. Relations with bicovariantdifferential calculus on certain quantum groups and stochastic calculus arediscussed. A similar differential calculus on a superspace is shown to berelated to the Batalin-Vilkovisky antifield formalism.
