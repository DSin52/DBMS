We extend the well-known method of calculating bulk correlation functions ofthe conformal Ising model via bosonisation to situations with boundaries.Oshikawa and Affleck have found the boundary states of two decoupled Isingmodels in terms of the orbifold of a single free boson compactified on a circleof radius r=1; we adapt their results to include disorder operators. Usingthese boundary states we calculate the expectation value of a single disorderfield on a cylinder with free boundary conditions and show that in theappropriate limits we recover the standard and frustrated partition functions.We also show how to calculate Ising correlation functions on the upper halfplane.
