We construct gauge invariant operators in non-commutative gauge theorieswhich in the IR reduce to the usual operators of ordinary field theories (e.g.F^2). We show that in the deep UV the two-point functions of these operatorsadmit a universal exponential behavior which fits neatly with the dualsupergravity results. We also consider the ratio between n-point functions andtwo-point functions to find exponential suppression in the UV which we compareto the high energy fixed angle scattering of string theory.
