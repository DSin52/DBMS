Title: Cartan Calculus

Comments: 17 pages. Lecture, Enrico Fermi Summer School

A rigid framework for the Cartan calculus of Lie derivatives, innerderivations, functions, and forms is proposed. The construction employs asemi-direct product of two graded Hopf algebras, the respectivesuper-extensions of the deformed universal enveloping algebra and the algebraof functions on a quantum group. Relations in the Cartan calculus follow asconsistency conditions. The approach is not a priori based on the Leibniz rulefor the exterior derivative and might hence also be of interest in the recentwork on its deformations. The Cartan identity for the Lie derivatives isproven. (This article is based on a lecture given at the Enrico Fermi SummerSchool on Quantum Groups, Varenna, June 1994)
