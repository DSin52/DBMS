It is argued that quantum traveling of D-particles presents the``joining-splitting'' processes of field theory Feynman graphs. The amplitudesin $d$ dimensions can be corresponded with those of a $d+2$ dimensional theoryin the Light-Cone frame. It is shown that this Light-Cone formulation enablesto study processes with arbitrary longitudinal momentum transfers. It isdiscussed that a massless sector exists which can be taken as the low energylimit. By taking the constant relative distance in the bound-states we find aspectrum for the intermediatory fields.
