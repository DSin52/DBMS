We construct the nonlinear $W(sl(N+3),sl(3))$ algebras and find the spectrumof values of the central charge that gives rise, by contracting the$W(sl(N+3),sl(3))$ algebras, to a $W_3$ algebra belonging to the coset$W((sl(N+3),sl(3))/(u(1)\oplus sl(N))$. Part of the spectrum was conjecturedbefore, but part of it is given here for the first time. Using the tool ofembedding the $W(sl(N+3),sl(3))$ algebras into linearizing algebras, weconstruct new realizations of $W_3$ modulo null fields. The possibility topredict, within the conformal linearization framework, the central chargespectrum for minimal models of the nonlinear $W(sl(N+3),sl(3))$ algebras isdiscussed at the end.
