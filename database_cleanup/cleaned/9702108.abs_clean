We demonstrate the precise numerical correspondence between long rangescattering of supergravitons and membranes in supergravity in the infinitemomentum frame and in M(atrix)-Theory, both in 11 dimensions and for toroidalcompactifications. We also identify wrapped membranes in terms of topologicalinvariants of the vector bundles associated to the field theory description ofcompactified M(atrix)-Theory. We use these results to check the realization ofT-duality in M(atrix)-Theory.
