Authors: Shinobu Hikami

Comments: 16page(latex)

The saddle point equation described by the eigenvalues of N by N Hermitianmatrices is analized for a finite N case and the scaling relation for the largeN is considered. The critical point and the critical exponents of matrix modelare obtained by the finite N scaling. One matrix model and two matrix model arestudied in detail. Small N behavior for n-Ising model on a random surface isinvestigated.
