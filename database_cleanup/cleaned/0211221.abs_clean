clarifiedHolographic considerations may provide a glimpse of quantum gravity beyondwhat is currently accessible by other means. Here we apply holography toinflationary cosmology. We argue that the appropriate holographic bound on thetotal entropy in the inflationary perturbations is given by the {\itdifference} of the area of the apparent horizon in the slow-roll approximationand its exact value near the end of inflation. This implies that the effectivefield theory of the inflaton weakly coupled to gravity requires modificationsbelow the Planck scale. For a conventional model of inflation this scale is oforder of the GUT scale, $\Lambda_{UV} \la 10^{16} GeV$, but could beconsiderably lower. Signatures of such new physics could show up in the CMB.
