Title: TASI Lectures on Perturbative String Theories

Authors: Hirosi Ooguri and Zheng Yin

Comments: 80 pages, Latex, final version to appear in the Proceedings of TASI96

These lecture notes are based on a course on string theories given by HirosiOoguri in the first week of TASI 96 Summer School at Boulder, Colorado. It isan introductory course designed to provide students with minimum knowledgebefore they attend more advanced courses on non-perturbative aspects of stringString, 2. Toroidal Compactifications, 3. Superstrings, 4. Heterotic Strings,and 5. Orbifold Compactifications.
