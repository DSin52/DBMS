The spectrum of quenched Yang-Mills theory in the large-N limit displaysstrings and higher dimensional extended objects. The effective dynamics ofstring-like excitations is encoded into area preserving Schild action. In thisletter, we bridge the gap between SU(N) gauge models and fullyreparametrization invariant Nambu-Goto string models by introducing an extramatrix degree of freedom in the Yang-Mills action. In the large-N limit thismatrix variable becomes the world-sheet auxiliary field allowing a smoothtransition between the Schild and Nambu-Goto strings. The new improved matrixmodel we propose here can be extended to p-branes provided we enlarge thedimensionality of the target spacetime.
