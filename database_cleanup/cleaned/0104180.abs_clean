We discuss the obstacles for defining a set of observable quantitiesanalogous to an S-matrix which are needed to formulate string theory in anaccelerating universe. We show that the quintessence models with the equationsof state $-1 < w <-1/3$ have future horizons and may be no better suited to anS-matrix or S-vector description. We also show that in a class of theories witha stable supersymmetric vacuum, a system cannot relax into a zero-energysupersymmetric vacuum while accelerating if the evolution is dominated by asingle scalar field with a stable potential. Thus describing an eternallyaccelerating universe may be a challenge for string theory as presentlydefined.
