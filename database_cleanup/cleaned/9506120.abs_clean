The light--cone lattice approach to the massive Thirring model isreformulated using a local and integrable lattice Hamiltonian written in termsof discrete fermi fields. Several subtle points concerning boundary conditions,normal--ordering, continuum limit, finite renormalizations and decoupling offermion doublers are elucidated. The relations connecting the six--vertexanisotropy and the various coupling constants of the continuum are analyzed indetail.
