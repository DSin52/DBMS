It is shown that a gauged nonlinear $O(3)$ sigma model with anomalousmagnetic moment interaction in $2+1$ dimensions is exactly integrable forstatic, self-dual field configurations. The matter fields are exactlyequivalent to those of the usual ungauged nonlinear $O(3)$ sigma model. Thesestatic soliton solutions can be mapped into an Abelian purely magnetic vortexsolutions through a suitable reduction of the non-Abelian gauge group. Arelativistic Abelian model in $2+1$ dimensions is also presented where thesepurely magnetic vortices can be realized.
