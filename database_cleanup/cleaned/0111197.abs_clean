Title: Quantum correlations, measurement and the origin of uncertainty

Authors: Daniele Tommasini

Comments: 5 pages. This can be considered as a note or an appendix to my

previous paper "Quantum Theory finally reconcilied with Special Relativity"quant-ph/0111083I argue that the correlations that are predicted by Quantum Field Theoryshould not be interpreted as a real sign of non locality.
