We present, in the N=2, D=4 harmonic superspace formalism, a general methodfor constructing the off-shell effective action of an N=2 abelian gaugesuperfield coupled to matter hypermultiplets. Using manifestly N=2supersymmetric harmonic supergraph techniques, we calculate the low-energycorrections to the renormalized one-loop effective action in terms of N=2(anti)chiral superfield strengths. For a harmonic gauge prepotential withvanishing vacuum expectation value, corresponding to massless hypermultiplets,the only non-trivial radiative corrections to appear are non-holomorphic. For aprepotential with non-zero vacuum value, which breaks the U(1)-factor in theN=2 supersymmetry automorphism group and corresponds to massivehypermultiplets, only non-trivial holomorphic corrections arise at leadingorder. These holomorphic contribution are consistent with Seiberg's quantumcorrection to the effective action, while the first non-holomorphiccontribution in the massless case is the N=2 supersymmetrization of theHeisenberg-Euler effective Lagrangian.
