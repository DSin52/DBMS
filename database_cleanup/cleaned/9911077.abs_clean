It is shown that static solutions with a finite curvature at the horizon mayexist in dilaton gravity at temperatures $T\neq T_{H}$ (including T=0) where$T_{H} $is the Hawking one. Hawking radiation is absent and the state of asystem represents thermal excitation over the Boulware vacuum. The horizonremains unattainable for a observer because of thermal divergences in thestress-energy of quantum fields there. However, the curvature at the horizon isfinite, when measured from outside, since these divergences are compensated bythose in gradients of a dilaton field. Spacetimes under consideration aregeodesically incomplete and the coupling between dilaton and gravity divergesat the horizon, so we have ''singularity without singularity''.
