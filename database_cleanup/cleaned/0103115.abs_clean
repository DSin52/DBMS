We show that M-theory on spaces with irreducible holonomy represent Type IIAbackgrounds in which a collection of D6-branes wrap a supersymmetric cycle in amanifold with a holonomy group different from the one appearing in the M-theorydescription. For example, we show that D6-branes wrapping a supersymmetricfour-cycle on a manifold with G_2 holonomy is described in eleven dimensions byM-theory on a space with Spin(7) holonomy. Examples of such Type IIAbackgrounds which lift to M-theory on spaces with SU(3), G_2, SU(4) and Spin(7)holonomy are considered. The M-theory geometry can then be used to computeexact quantities of the gauge theory on the corresponding D-braneconfiguration.
