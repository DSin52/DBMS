Point particles fall freely along geodesics; strings do not. In string theoryall probes of spacetime structure, including photons, are extended objects andtherefore always subject to tidal forces. We illustrate how string theorymodifies the behavior of light in weak gravitational fields and limits theapplicability of the principle of equivalence. This gives in principle a windowon the short-distance structure of geometry in quantum gravity where one cansee in a model-independent way how some of its predictions differ from those ofclassical gravity. We compare this with the lessons of high-energy stringscattering.
