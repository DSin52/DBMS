We study the general form of the equations for isotropic single-scalar,multi-scalar and dyonic $p$-branes in superstring theory and M-theory, and showthat they can be cast into the form of Liouville, Toda (or Toda-like)equations. The general solutions describe non-extremal isotropic $p$-branes,reducing to the previously-known extremal solutions in limiting cases. In thenon-extremal case, the dilatonic scalar fields are finite at the outer eventhorizon.
