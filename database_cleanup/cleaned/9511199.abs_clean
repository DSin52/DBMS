We derive a geometric integration formula for the partition function of aclassical dynamical system and use it to show that corrections to the WKBapproximation vanish for any Hamiltonian which generates conformal motions ofsome Riemannian geometry on the phase space. This generalizes previous caseswhere the Hamiltonian was taken as an isometry generator. We show that thisconformal symmetry is similar to the usual formulations of theDuistermaat-Heckman integration formula in terms of a supersymmetric Wardidentity for the dynamical system. We present an explicit example of alocalizable Hamiltonian system in this context and use it to demonstrate howthe dynamics of such systems differ from previous examples of theDuistermaat-Heckman theorem.
