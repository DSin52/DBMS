We present a simple procedure for constructing the complete cohomology of theBRST operator of the two-scalar and multi-scalar $W_3$ strings. The methodconsists of obtaining two level--15 physical operators in the two-scalar $W_3$string that are invertible, and that can normal order with all other physicaloperators. They can be used to map all physical operators into non-trivialphysical operators whose momenta lie in a fundamental unit cell. By carryingout an exhaustive analysis of physical operators in this cell, the entirecohomology problem is solved.
