We consider the Abelian Higgs model as well as the SU(2) Georgi-Glashow modelin which the gauge field action is replaced by a non linear Born-Infeld action.We study soliton solutions arising in these models, namely the vortex andmonopole solutions, respectively. We construct formulas which provide goodapproximations for the mass of the Born-Infeld deformed solitons using only thedata of the undeformed solutions. The results obtained indicate that in theself-dual limit, the Born-Infeld interaction leads to bound vortices, while formonopoles it gives rise to repulsion.
