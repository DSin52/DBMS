Assuming the monopole dominance, that has been proved in the latticegluodynamics, to hold in the continuum limit, we develop an effective scalarfield theory for QCD at large distances to describe confinement. The approachis based on a gauge (or projection) independent formulation of the monopoledominance and manifestly Lorentz invariant.
