Motivated by recent findings due to Wiegmann and Zabrodin, Faddeev andKashaev concerning the appearence of the quantum U_q(sl(2)) symmetry in theproblem of a Bloch electron on a two-dimensional magnetic lattice, we introducea modification of the tight binding Azbel--Hofstadter Hamiltonian that is aspecific spin-S Euler top and can be considered as its ``classical'' analog.The eigenvalue problem for the proposed model, in the coherent staterepresentation, is described by the S-gap Lam\'e equation and, thus, iscompletely solvable. We observe a striking similarity between the shapes of thespectra of the two models for various values of the spin S.
