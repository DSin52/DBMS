We give an explicit algebraic description of finite Lorentz transformationsof vectors in 10-dimensional Minkowski space by means of a parameterization interms of the octonions. The possible utility of these results for superstringtheory is mentioned. Along the way we describe automorphisms of the two highestdimensional normed division algebras, namely the quaternions and the octonions,in terms of conjugation maps. We use similar techniques to define $SO(3)$ and$SO(7)$ via conjugation, $SO(4)$ via symmetric multiplication, and $SO(8)$ viaboth symmetric multiplication and one-sided multiplication. Thenon-commutativity and non-associativity of these division algebras plays acrucial role in our constructions.
