In this paper we explicitly show that the various noncompact abelianorbifolds are realized as special limits of parameters in type II (NSNS) Melvinbackground and its higher dimensional generalizations. As a result thesupersymmetric ALE spaces (A-type C^2/Z_N) and nonsupersymmetric orbifolds intype II and type 0 theory are all connected with each other by the exactlymarginal deformation. Our results provide new examples of the duality betweentype II and type 0 string theory. We also discuss the decay of unstablebackgrounds in this model which include closed string tachyons.
