The vacuum Einstein equations in five dimensions are shown to admit asolution describing an asymptotically flat spacetime regular on and outside anevent horizon of topology S^1 x S^2. It describes a rotating ``black ring''.This is the first example of an asymptotically flat vacuum solution with anevent horizon of non-spherical topology. There is a range of values for themass and angular momentum for which there exist two black ring solutions aswell as a black hole solution. Therefore the uniqueness theorems valid in fourdimensions do not have simple higher dimensional generalizations. It issuggested that increasing the spin of a five dimensional black hole beyond acritical value results in a transition to a black ring, which can have anarbitrarily large angular momentum for a given mass.
