We study toroidal compactifications of Type II string theory with D-branesand nontrivial antisymmetric tensor moduli and show that turning on thesefields modifies the supersymmetry projections imposed by D-branes. Thesemodifications are seen to be necessary for the consistency of T-duality. Wealso show the existence of unusual BPS configurations of branes at angles thatare supersymmetric because of conspiracies between moduli fields. Analysis ofthe problem from the point of view of the effective field theory of masslessmodes shows that the presence of a 2-form background must modify therealization of supersymmetry on the brane. In particular, the appropriatesupersymmetry variation of the physical gaugino vanishes in any constant fieldstrength background. These considerations are relevant for the $E_7$-symmetriccounting of states of 4-dimensional black holes in Type II string theorycompactified on $T^6$.
