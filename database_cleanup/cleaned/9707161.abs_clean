An imaginary part of the false-vacuum energy density in a metastable system,i.e., the decay width due to quantum tunneling, might be reproduced by Borelresummation of vacuum bubble diagrams. We examine the convergence of thisprescription in the Gaussian propagator model, in which the analyticalexpression of vacuum bubbles to the ninth order of loop expansion is available.
