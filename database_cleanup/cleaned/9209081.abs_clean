We discuss continuous and discrete sectors in the collective field theory of$d=1$ matrix models. A canonical Lorentz invariant field theory extension ofcollective field theory is presented and its classical solutions in Euclideanand Minkowski space are found. We show that the discrete, low density, sectorof collective field theory includes single eigenvalue Euclidean instantonswhich tunnel between different vacua of the extended theory. We further showthat these ``stringy" instantons induce non-perturbative effective operators ofstrength $e^{-{1\over g}}$ in the extended theory. The relationship of theworld sheet description of string theory and Liouville theory to the effectivespace-time theory is explained. We also comment on the role of the discrete,low density, sector of collective field theory in that framework.
