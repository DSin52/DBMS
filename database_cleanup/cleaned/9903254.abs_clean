In this lecture, a limited introduction of gauge invariance in phase-space isprovided, predicated on canonical transformations in quantum phase-space. Exactcharacteristic trajectories are also specified for the time-propagating Wignerclassical - for the quantized simple harmonic oscillator. This serves as theunderpinning of the field theoretic Wigner functional formulation introduced.Scalar field theory is thus reformulated in terms of distributions in fieldphase-space. This is a pedagogical selection from work published in J Phys A32(1999) 771 and Phys Rev D58 (1998) 025002, reported at the Yukawa InstituteWorkshop "Gauge Theory and Integrable Models", 26-29 January, 1999.
