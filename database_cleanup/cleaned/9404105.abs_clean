Title: Bicovariant Differential Geometry of the Quantum Group $SL_h(2)$

Journal-ref: Lett.Math.Phys. 35 (1995) 303-311

There are only two quantum group structures on the space of two by twounimodular matrices, these are the $SL_q(2)$ and the $SL_h(2)$ [9-13] quantumgroups. One can not construct a differential geometry on $ SL_q(2)$, which atthe same time is bicovariant, has three generators, and satisfies the Liebnitzrule. We show that such a differential geometry exists for the quantum group$SL_h(2)$ and derive all of its properties.
