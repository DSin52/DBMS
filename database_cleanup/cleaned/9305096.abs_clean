In development of the started activity on lattice analogues of $W$-algebras,we define the notion of lattice $W_{\infty}$-algebra, accociated with latticeintegrable system with infinite set of fields. Various kinds of reduction tolattice $W_N$-algebras, related to discrete $N$-KdV hierarchies are described.We also discuss the connection of our results with those obtained in the papersof Xiong [13] and Bonora [14].
