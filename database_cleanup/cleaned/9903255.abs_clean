Dirac Prize Lecturedelivered at Trieste, Italy, in March 1999One route towards understanding both fractional charges and chiral anomaliesdelves into Dirac's negative energy sea. Usually we think of Dirac's negativeenergy sea as an unphysical construct, invented to render quantum field theoryphysically acceptable by hiding the negative energy solutions. I suggest thatin fact physical consequences can be drawn from Dirac's construction.
