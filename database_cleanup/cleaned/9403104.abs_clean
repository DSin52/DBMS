We perform a perturbative analysis of the nonabelian Aharonov-Bohm problem toone loop in a field theoretic framework, and show the necessity of contactinteractions for renormalizability of perturbation theory. Moreover at criticalvalues of the contact interaction strength the theory is finite and preservesclassical conformal invariance.
