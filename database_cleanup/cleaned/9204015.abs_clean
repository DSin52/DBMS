Matter is coupled to three-dimensional gravity such that the topologicalphase is allowed and the (anti-) de Sitter or Poincar\'e symmetry remainsintact. Spontaneous symmetry breaking to the Lorentz group occurs if a scalarfield is included. This Higgs field can then be used to couple matter so thatthe familiar form of the matter coupling is established in the broken phase. Wealso give the supersymmetrization of this construction.
