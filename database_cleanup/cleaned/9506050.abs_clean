In this article we consider $SU(2)$ Chern-Simons/Higgs theory coupled togravity in three-dimensions. It is shown that for a cylindrically symmetricvortex both the Einstein equations and the field equations can be reduced to aset of first-order Bogomol'nyi equations provided that we choose a specificeighth-order potential.
