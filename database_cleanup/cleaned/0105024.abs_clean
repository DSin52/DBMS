We show that the triviality of the entire cohomology of the new BRST operatorQ around the tachyon vacuum is equivalent to the Q-exactness of the identity Iof the star-algebra. We use level truncation to show that as the level isincreased, the identity becomes more accurately Q-exact. We carry ourcomputations up to level nine, where an accuracy of 3% is attained. Our worksupports, under a new light, Sen's conjecture concerning the absence of openstring degrees of freedom around the tachyon vacuum. As a by-product, a new andsimple expression for I in terms of Virasoro operators is found.
