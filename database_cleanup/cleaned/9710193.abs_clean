The three-dimensional Gross-Neveu model in $R^{1} \times S^{2}$ spacetime isconsidered at finite particles number density. We evaluate an effectivepotential of the composite scalar field $\sigma(x)$, which is expressed interms of a scalar curvature $R$ and nonzero chemical potential $\mu$. We thenderive the critical values of $(R,\mu)$ at which the system undergoes the firstorder phase transition from the phase with broken chiral invariance to thesymmetric phase.
