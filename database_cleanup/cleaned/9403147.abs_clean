BRST invariance supplies a sufficient condition for the observability offields. We show that there is a global obstruction to the observability ofquarks and gluons and argue that they will not become observables at finitetemperature. We give expressions for quarks and gluons that are, however, {\itperturbatively\/} BRST invariant, and hence locally observable, up toorder~$g^2$ and~$g$ respectively.
