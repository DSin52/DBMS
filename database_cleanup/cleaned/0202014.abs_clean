Authors: Corneliu Sochichiu

Comments: 45 pages, 2 figures

The role of the gauge invariance in noncommutative field theory is discussed.A basic introduction to noncommutative geometry and noncommutative field theoryis given. Background invariant formulation of Wilson lines is proposed. Dualitysymmetries relating various noncommutative gauge models are being discussed.
