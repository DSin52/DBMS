Using one-loop effective action in large N and s-wave approximation wediscuss the possibility to induce primordial wormholes at the early Universe.An analytical solution is found for self-consistent primordial wormhole withconstant radius. Numerical study gives the wormhole solution with increasingthroat radius and increasing red-shift function. There is also some indicationto the possibility of a topological phase transition.
