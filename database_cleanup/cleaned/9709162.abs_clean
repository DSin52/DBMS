A new approach to analyze the properties of the energy-momentum tensor $T(z)$of conformal field theories on generic Riemann surfaces (RS) is proposed.$T(z)$ is decomposed into $N$ components with different monodromy properties,where $N$ is the number of branches in the realization of RS as branch coveringover the complex sphere. This decomposition gives rise to new infinitedimensional Lie algebra which can be viewed as a generalization of Virasoroalgebra containing information about the global properties of the underlyingRS. In the simplest case of hyperelliptic curves the structure of the algebrais calculated in two ways and its central extension is explicitly given. Thealgebra possess an interesting symmetry with a clear interpretation in theframework of the radial quantization of CFT's with multivalued fields on thecomplex sphere.
