It is shown that every Feynman integral can be interpreted as Green functionof some linear differential operator with constant coefficients. Thisdefinition is equivalent to usual one but needs no regularization andapplication of $R$-operation. It is argued that presented formalism isconvenient for practical calculations of Feynman integrals.
