We present a `spinon formulation' of the $SU(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten models.Central to this approach are a set of massless quasi-particles, called`spinons', which transform in the representation ${\bf \bar{n}}$ of $su(n)$ andcarry fractional statistics of angle $\theta = \pi/n$. Multi-spinon states aregrouped into irreducible representations of the yangian $Y(sl_n)$. We giveexplicit results for the $su(n)$ content of these yangian representations andpresent $N$-spinon cuts of the WZW character formulas. As a by-product, weobtain closed expressions for characters of the $su(n)$ Haldane-Shastry spinchains.
