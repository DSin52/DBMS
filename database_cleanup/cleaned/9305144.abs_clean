A generalization of the Yang-Baxter equation is proposed. It enables toconstruct integrable two-dimensional lattice models with commuting two-layertransfer matrices, while single-layer ones are not necessarily commutative.Explicit solutions to the generalized equations are found. They are relatedwith Botzmann weights of the $sl(3)$ chiral Potts model.
