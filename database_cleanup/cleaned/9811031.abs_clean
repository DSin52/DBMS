A simple systematic method for calculating derivative expansions of theone-loop effective action is presented. This method is based on using symbolsof operators and well known deformation quantization theory. To demonstrate itsadvantages we present several examples of application for scalar theory,Yang-Mills theory, and scalar electrodynamics. The superspace formulation ofthe method is considered for K\"ahlerian and non-K\"ahlerian quantumcorrections for Wess-Zumino and for Heisenberg-Euler lagrangians in super QEDmodels.
