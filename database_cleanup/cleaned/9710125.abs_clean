Title: Gaugino condensate and Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective Lagrangian

Comments: 10 pages, LaTeX

We study the sypersymmetric pure Yang-Mills theory with semisimple Liegroups. We show that the general form of the gluino condensate is determinedsolely by the symmetries of the theory and it is in disagreement with therecently proposed existence of a conformal phase in SYM theory. We discuss thepeculiarities of the Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective Lagrangian approach andexplain how it is related to the calculation of the gluino condensate
