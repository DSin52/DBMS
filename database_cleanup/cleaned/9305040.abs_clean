abbreviations, so that citation numbers would be LaTeXed correctly by thecurrent software, as the previous version of the paper had been by the oldLaTeX software in use when that version was submitted. After Eq. (7), a newreference [290] was added, to Foong and Kanno's paper, which appeared afterthis review was published in the Proceedings of the 5th Canadian Conferenceon General Relativity and Relativistic AstrophysicsHawking's 1974 calculation of thermal emission from a classical black holeled to his 1976 proposal that information may be lost from our universe as apure quantum state collapses gravitationally into a black hole, which thenevaporates completely into a mixed state of thermal radiation. Anotherpossibility is that the information is not lost, but is stored in a remnant ofthe evaporating black hole. A third idea is that the information comes out innonthermal correlations within the Hawking radiation, which would be expectedto occur at too slow a rate, or be too spread out, to be revealed by anynonperturbative calculation.
