Gravitational collapse of matter trapped on a brane will produce a black holeon the brane. We discuss such black holes in the models of Randall and Sundrumwhere our universe is viewed as a domain wall in five dimensional anti-deSitter space. We present evidence that a non-rotating uncharged black hole onthe domain wall is described by a ``black cigar'' solution in five dimensions.
