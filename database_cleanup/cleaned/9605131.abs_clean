The SO(32) heterotic string on a K3 surface is analyzed in terms of the dualtheory of a type II string (or F-theory) on an elliptically fibred Calabi-Yaumanifold. The results are in beautiful agreement with earlier work by Wittenusing very different methods. In particular, we find gauge groups of SO(32) xSp(k) appearing at points in the moduli space identified with point-likeinstantons and see hypermultiplets in the (32,2k) representation becomingmassless at the same time. We also discuss some aspects of the E8 x E8 case.
