Title: The Geometry of Supersymmetric Sigma-Models

Authors: Alexander Sevrin and Jan Troost

Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX, contribution to the proceedings of the workshop Gauge

Theories, Applied Supersymmetry and Quantum Gravity, Imperial College,London, 1996We review non-linear sigma-models with (2,1) and (2,2) supersymmetry. Wefocus on off-shell closure of the supersymmetry algebra and give a completelist of (2,2) superfields. We provide evidence to support the conjecture thatall N=(2,2) non-linear sigma-models can be described by these fields. This inits turn leads to interesting consequences about the geometry of the targetmanifolds. One immediate corollary of this conjecture is the existence of apotential for hyper-Kahler manifolds, different from the Kahler potential,which does not only allow for the computation of the metric, but of the threeSU(2) x U(1) and SU(2) x SU(2) and four-dimensional special hyper-Kahlermanifolds.
