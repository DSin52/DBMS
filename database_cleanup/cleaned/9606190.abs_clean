$N=2$ string theories are formulated in space-times with 2 space and 2 timedimensions. If the world-sheet matter system consists of 2 chiral superfields,the space-time is Kahler and the dynamics are those of anti-self-dual gravity.If instead one chiral superfield and one twisted chiral superfield are used,the space-time is a hermitian manifold with torsion and a dilaton. The stringspectrum consists of a scalar, which is a potential $K$ determining the metric,torsion and dilaton. The dynamics imply that the curvature with torsion isanti-self-dual, and an action is found for the potential $K$. It is argued thatany $N=2$ sigma-model with twisted chiral multiplets in any dimension can bedeformed to a conformally invariant theory if the lowest order contribution tothe conformal anomaly vanishes. If there are isometries, more generalgeometries are possible in which the dilaton is the Killing potential for aholomorphic Killing vector.
