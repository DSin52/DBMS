We prove a generalization of the Verlinde formula to fermionic rationalconformal field theories. The fusion coefficients of the fermionic theory areequal to sums of fusion coefficients of its bosonic projection. In particular,fusion coefficients of the fermionic theory connecting two conjugate Ramondfields with the identity are either one or two. Therefore, one is forced toweaken the axioms of fusion algebras for fermionic theories. We show that inthe special case of fermionic W(2,d)-algebras these coefficients are given bythe dimensions of the irreducible representations of the horizontal subalgebraon the highest weight. As concrete examples we discuss fusion algebras ofrational models of fermionic W(2,d)-algebras including minimal models of the$N=1$ super Virasoro algebra as well as $N=1$ super W-algebras SW(3/2,d).
