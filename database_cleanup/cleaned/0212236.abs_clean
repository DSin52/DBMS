In the context of N=2 supergravity we explain the occurrence of partialsuper-Higgs with vanishing vacuum energy and moduli stabilization in a modelsuggested by superstring compactifications on type IIB orientifolds with 3-formfluxes.The gauging of axion symmetries of the quaternionic manifold, together withthe use of degenerate symplectic sections for special geometry, are theessential ingredients of the construction.
