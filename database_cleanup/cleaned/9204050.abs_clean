We study the "topological gauged WZW model associated with$SU(2)/U(1)$",which is defined as the twisted version of the correspondingsupersymmetric gauged WZW model. It is shown that this model is equivalent to atopological conformal field theory characterized by two independent topologicalconformal algebras, one of which is the "twisted Kazama-Suzuki type" and theother is "twisted Coulomb gas type". We further show that our formalism of thisgauged WZW model naturally reduces to the well-known formulations of 2D gravitycoupled with conformal matter; one of the gauge choices leads to the K.Li'stheory, and the alternative choices lead to the KPZ theory or the DDK(Liouville) theory.
