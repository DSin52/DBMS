In this paper we explicitly calculate the analogue of the 't Hooft SU(2)Yang--Mills instantons on Gibbons--Hawking multi-centered gravitationalA_k ALE gravitational instantons and the multi-Taub--NUT, or A_k ALFgravitational instantons. We calculate their action and find the reducibleones. Following Kronheimer we also exploit the U(1) invariance of our solutionsand study the corresponding explicit singular SU(2) magnetic monopole solutionson Euclidean three-space.
