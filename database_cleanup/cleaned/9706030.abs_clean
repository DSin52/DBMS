We compute the transition amplitudes between charged particles of mass $M$and $m$ accelerated by a constant electric field and interacting by theexchange of quanta of a third field. We work in second quantization in order totake into account both recoil effects induced by transitions and the vacuuminstability of the charged fields. In spite of both effects, when the exchangedparticle is neutral, the equilibrium ratio of the populations is simply$\exp(\pi (M^2 - m^2)/eE)$. Thus, in the limit $(M-m)/M \to 0$, one recoversUnruh's result characterized by the temperature $a/2\pi$ where $a$ is theacceleration. When the exchanged particle is charged, its vacuum instabilityprevents a simple description of the equilibrium state. However, in the limitwherein the charge of the exchanged particle tends to zero, the equilibriumdistribution is once more Boltzmanian, but characterized not only by atemperature but also by the electric potential felt by the exchanged particle.This work therefore confirms that thermodynamics in the presence of horizonsdoes not rely on a semi-classical treatment. The relationship withthermodymanics of charged black holes is stressed.
