Title: Gerbes in classical Chern-Simons theory

Authors: Kiyonori Gomi

Comments: 18 pages. We make some small corrections

We construct geometrically a gerbe assigned to a connection on a principalSU(2)-bundle over an oriented closed 1-dimensional manifold. If the connectionis given by the restriction of a connection on a bundle over a compact2-manifold bounding the 1-manifold, then we have a natural object in the gerbe.The gerbes and the objects satisfy certain fundamental properties, e.g. gluinglaw.
