We discuss the quantization of theories which are formulated usingcompensating fields. In particular, we discuss the relation between thecomponents formulation and the superspace formulation of supergravity theories.The requirement that the compensating field can be eliminated at the quantumlevel gives rise to on-shell constraints on the operators of the theory. Insome cases, the constraints turn out to be physically unacceptable. Using theseconsiderations we show that new minimal supergravity is in general anomalous.
