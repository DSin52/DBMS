The complete on-shell action of topological Einstein-Maxwell gravity onfour-dimensional manifolds with SU(2) holonomy is presented. It is shownexplicitly how this theory arises from four-dimensional Euclidean N=2supergravity. The topological BRST symmetries and twisted local Lorentzsymmetries are given and the action and stress tensor are shown to beBRST-exact. A set of BRST-invariant topological operators is given. The vectorand antisymmetric tensor twisted supersymmetries and their algebra are alsofound.
