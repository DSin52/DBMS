CTP #2202We consider the one-dimensional random field Ising model, where the spin-spincoupling, $J$, is ferromagnetic and the external field is chosen to be $+h$with probability $p$ and $-h$ with probability $1-p$. At zero temperature, wecalculate an exact expression for the correlation length of the quenchedaverage of the correlation function $\langle s_0 s_n \rangle - \langle s_0\rangle \langle s_n \rangle$ in the case that $2J/h$ is not an integer. Theresult is a discontinuous function of $2J/h$. When $p = {1 \over 2}$, we alsoplace a bound on the correlation length of the quenched average of thecorrelation function $\langle s_0 s_n \rangle$.
