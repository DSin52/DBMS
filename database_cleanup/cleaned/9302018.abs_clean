We summarize a study of an Abelian gauge theory in 2+1 dimensions, the gaugefield being coupled to nonrelativistic Fermions. The Action for the gauge fieldis a combination of the Maxwell term and a Chern-Simons (CS) term. We study thelimit of vanishing Fermions' charge, keeping fixed the gauge field mass inducedby the CS term. By considering a closed surface, in particular a torus to keeptranslational invariance, we show that the Fermions do not decouple completelyfrom the gauge field, and in fact they behave as Anyons treated in thedescribe the exact solution of this limiting case.
