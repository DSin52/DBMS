By resorting to the Fock--Bargmann representation, we incorporate the quantumWeyl--Heisenberg ($q$-WH) algebra into the theory of entire analytic functions.The main tool is the realization of the $q$--WH algebra in terms of finitedifference operators. The physical relevance of our study relies on the factthat coherent states (CS) are indeed formulated in the space of entire analyticfunctions where they can be rigorously expressed in terms of theta functions onthe von Neumann lattice. The r\^ole played by the finite difference operatorsand the relevance of the lattice structure in the completeness of the CS systemsuggest that the $q$--deformation of the WH algebra is an essential tool in thephysics of discretized (periodic) systems. In this latter context we define aquantum mechanics formalism for lattice systems.
