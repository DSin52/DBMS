In this note we show that in dual N=1 string vacua provided by the heteroticstring on an elliptic Calabi-Yau together with a vector bundle respectivelyF-theory on Calabi-Yau fourfold the number of heterotic fivebranes necessaryfor anomaly cancellation matches the number of F-theory threebranes necessaryfor tadpole cancellation. This extends to the general case the work ofFriedman, Morgan and Witten, who treated the case of embedding a heterotic$E_8\times E_8$ bundle, leaving no unbroken gauge group, where one has a smoothWeierstrass model on the F-theory side.
