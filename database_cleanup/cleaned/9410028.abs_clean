Quantum gravitational corrections to the effective potential, at one-looplevel and in the leading-log approximation, for scalar quantum electrodynamicswith higher-derivative gravity ---which is taken as an effective theory forquantum gravity (QG)--- are calculated. We point out the appearence of relevantphenomena caused by quantum gravity, like dimensional transmutation, QG-driveninstabilities of the potential, QG corrrections to scalar-to-vector massratios, and curvature-induced phase transitions, whose existence is shown bymeans of analytical and numerical study.
