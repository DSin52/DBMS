Title: Spectral functions in mathematics and physics

Comments: 51 pages, Invited talk at 2nd La Plata Meeting on Trends in

Theoretical Physics, Buenos Aires, Argentina, November-December 1998,Published in AIP Conference Proceedings 484, page 106, Edited by H. Falomir,R.E. Gamboa Saravi and F.A. SchaposnikSpectral functions relevant in the context of quantum field theory under theinfluence of spherically symmetric external conditions are analysed. Examplescomprise heat-kernels, determinants and spectral sums needed for the analysisof Casimir energies. First, we summarize that a convenient way of handling themis to use the associated zeta function. A way to determine all its neededproperties is derived. Using the connection with the mentioned spectralcoefficients of Laplace-like operators on Riemannian manifolds with smoothboundaries and ii.) an analysis of vacuum energies in the presence ofspherically symmetric boundaries and external background potentials.
