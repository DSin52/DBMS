We obtain local parametrizations of classical non-compact Lie groups whereadjoint invariants under maximal compact subgroups are manifest. Extension tonon compact subgroups is straightforward. As a by-product parametrizations ofthe same type are obtained for compact groups. They are of physical interest inany theory gauge invariant under the adjoint action, typical examples being thetwo dimensional gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten-Novikov models where thesecoordinatizations become of extreme usefulness to get the background fieldsrepresenting the vacuum expectation values of the massless modes of theassociated (super) string theory.
