Assigning an intrinsic constant dipole moment to any field, we present a newkind of associative star product, the dipole star product, which was firstintroduced in [hep-th/0008030]. We develop the mathematics necessary to studythe corresponding noncommutative dipole field theories. These theories aresensible non-local field theories with no IR/UV mixing. In addition we discussthat the Lorentz symmetry in these theories is ``softly'' broken and in someparticular cases the CP (and even CPT) violation in these theories may becomeobservable. We show that a non-trivial dipole extension of N=4, D=4 gaugetheories can only be obtained if we break the SU(4) R (and hencesuper)-symmetry. Such noncommutative dipole extensions, which in the maximalsupersymmetric cases are N=2 gauge theories with matter, can be embedded instring theory as the theories on D3-branes probing a smooth Taub-NUT space withthree form fluxes turned on or alternatively by probing a space with R-symmetrytwists. We show the equivalences between the two approaches and also discussthe M-theory realization.
