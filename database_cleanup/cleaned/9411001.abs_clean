Four-dimensional twisted group lattices are used as models for space-timestructure. Compared to other attempts at space-time deformation, they have twoin putting field theories on these structures. We present and discuss ordinaryand gauge theories on twisted group lattices. We solve the free field theorycase by finding all the irreducible representations. The non-abelian gaugetheory on the two-dimensional twisted group lattice is also solved. On twistedgroup lattices, continuous space-time translational and rotational symmetriesare replaced by discrete counterparts. We discuss these symmetries in detail.Four-dimensional twisted group lattices can also be used as models fornon-trivial discrete compactifactions of certain ten-dimensional spaces.
