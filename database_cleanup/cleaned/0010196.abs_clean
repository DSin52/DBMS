We present a method based on mutations of helices which leads to theconstruction (in the large volume limit) of exceptional coherent sheavesassociated with the $(\sum_al_a=0)$ orbits in Gepner models. This is explicitlyverified for a few examples including some cases where the ambient weightedprojective space has singularities not inherited by the Calabi-Yauhypersurface. The method is based on two conjectures which lead to theanalog,in the general case, of the Beilinson quiver for $\BP^n$. We discuss howone recovers the McKay quiver using the gauged linear sigma model (GLSM) nearthe orbifold or Gepner point in K\"ahler moduli space.
