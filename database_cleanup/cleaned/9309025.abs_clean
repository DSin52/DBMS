By explicitly eliminating all gauge degrees of freedom in the $3+1$-gaugedescription of a classical relativistic (open) membrane moving in $\Real^3$ wederive a $2+1$-dimensional nonlinear wave equation of Born-Infeld type for thegraph $z(t,x,y)$ which is invariant under the Poincar\'e group in fourdimensions. Alternatively, we determine the world-volume of a membrane in acovariant way by the zeroes of a scalar field $u(t,x,y,z)$ obeying ahomogeneous Poincar\'e-invariant nonlinear wave-equation. This approach alsogives a simple derivation of the nonlinear gas dynamic equation obtained in thelight-cone gauge.
