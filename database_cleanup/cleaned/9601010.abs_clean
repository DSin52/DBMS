Supersymmetric monopoles of the heterotic string theory associated witharbitrary non-negative number of the left moving modes of the string states arepresented. They include H monopoles and their T dual partners F monopoles (ALEinstantons). Massive F = H monopoles are T self-dual. Solutions include also aninfinite tower of generic T duality covariant non-singular in stringy frameF\&H monopoles with the bottomless throat geometry. The massless F = -Hmonopoles are invariant under combined T duality and charge conjugationconverting a monopole into anti monopole. All F\&H monopoles can be promoted tothe exact supersymmetric solutions of the heterotic string theory since theholonomy group is the compact $SO(9)$. The sigma models for ${\bf M}^8$monopoles, which admit constant complex structures, have enhanced world-sheetmonopoles. The space-time supersymmetric GS light-cone action in monopolebackground is directly convertible into the world-sheet supersymmetric NSRaction.
