The action for the D=10 type II Dirichlet super-p-branes, which has beenobtained recently, is reconstructed in a more geometrical form involvingLorentz harmonic variables. This new (Lorentz-harmonic) formulation possesseskappa-symmetry in an irreducible form and is used as a basis for applying ageneralized action principle that provides the superfield equations of motionand clarifies the geometrical nature of the kappa-symmetry of these models. Thecase of a Dirichlet super-3-brane is considered in detail.
