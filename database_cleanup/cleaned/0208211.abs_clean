Authors: Volkhard F. M\"uller

Comments: 101 pages, typos and a misprint corrected & ref. added

In this article a self-contained exposition of proving perturbativerenormalizability of a quantum field theory based on an adaption of Wilson'sdifferential renormalization group equation to perturbation theory is given.The topics treated include the spontaneously broken SU(2) Yang-Mills theory.Although mainly a coherent but selective review, the article contains alsosome simplifications and extensions with respect to the literature.
