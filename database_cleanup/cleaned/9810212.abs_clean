After defining cohomologically higher order BRST and anti-BRST operators fora compact simple algebra {\cal G}, the associated higher order Laplacians areintroduced and the corresponding supersymmetry algebra $\Sigma$ is analysed.These operators act on the states generated by a set of fermionic ghost fieldstransforming under the adjoint representation. In contrast with the standardcase, for which the Laplacian is given by the quadratic Casimir, the higherorder Laplacians $W$ are not in general given completely in terms of theCasimir-Racah operators, and may involve the ghost number operator. The higherorder version of the Hodge decomposition is exhibited. The example of su(3) isworked out in detail, including the expression of its higher order Laplacian W.
