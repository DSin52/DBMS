We examine whether any type II asymmetric orbifolds have the same masslessspectrum as the dimensional reduction of D=5 simple supergravity, which,besides the eleven-dimensional supergravity, is the only known supergravityabove four dimensions with no moduli. We attempt to construct such models byfurther twisting the orbifolds which yield D=4, N=4 pure supergravity to findthat, unfortunately, none of the models have that spectrum. We providesupergravity arguments explaining why this is so. As a by-product, we list allpossible momentum-winding lattices that give D=4, N=4 pure supergravity.
