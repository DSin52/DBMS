A holographic correspondence between data on horizon and space-time physicsis investigated. We find similarities with the AdS/CFT correspondence, based onthe observation that the optical metric near the horizon describes a Euclideanasymptotically anti-de Sitter space. This picture emerges for a wide class ofstatic space-times with a non-degenerate horizon, including Schwarzschild blackholes as well as de Sitter space-time. We reveal a asymptotic conformalsymmetry at the horizon. We compute the conformal weights and 2-point functionsfor a scalar perturbation and discuss possible connections with a (non-unitary)conformal field theory located on the horizon. We then reconstruct the scalarfield and the metric from the data given on the horizon. We show that thesolution for the metric in the bulk is completely determined in terms of aspecified metric on the horizon. From the General Relativity point of view oursolutions present a new class of space-time metrics with non-sphericalhorizons. The horizon entropy associated with these solutions is alsodiscussed.
