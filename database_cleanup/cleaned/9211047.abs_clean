We present an algorithm for determining all inequivalent abelian symmetriesof non-degenerate quasi-homogeneous polynomials and apply it to the recentlyconstructed complete set of Landau--Ginzburg potentials for $N=2$superconformal field theories with $c=9$. A complete calculation of theresulting orbifolds without torsion increases the number of known spectra byabout one third. The mirror symmetry of these spectra, however, remains at thesame low level as for untwisted Landau--Ginzburg models. This happens in spiteof the fact that the subclass of potentials for which the Berglund--H\"ubschconstruction works features perfect mirror symmetry. We also make first stepsinto the space of orbifolds with $\ZZ_2$ torsions by including extra trivialfields.
