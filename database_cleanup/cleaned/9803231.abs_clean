We construct a class of intersecting brane solutions with horizon geometriesof the form adS_k x S^l x S^m x E^n. We describe how all these solutions areconnected through the addition of a wave and/or monopoles. All solutionsexhibit supersymmetry enhancement near the horizon. Furthermore we argue thatstring theory on these spaces is dual to specific superconformal field theoriesin two dimensions whose symmetry algebra in all cases contains the large N=4algebra A_{gamma}. Implications for gauged supergravities are also discussed.
