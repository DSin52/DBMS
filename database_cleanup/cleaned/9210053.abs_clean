We search for a \Lg\ interpretation of non-diagonal modular invariants oftensor products of minimal $n=2$ superconformal models, looking in particularat automorphism invariants and at some exceptional cases. For the former wefind a simple description as \lgo s, which reproduce the correct chiral ringsas well as the spectra of various Gepner--type models and orbifolds thereof. Onthe other hand, we are able to prove for one of the exceptional cases that thisconformal field theory cannot be described by an orbifold of a \Lg\ model withrespect to a manifest linear symmetry of its potential.
