A supersymmetric affinization of the algebra of octonions is introduced. Itsatisfies a super-Malcev property and is N=8 supersymmetric. Its Sugawaraconstruction recovers, in a special limit, the non-associative N=8 superalgebraof Englert et al. This paper extends to supersymmetry the results obtained byOsipov in the bosonic case.
