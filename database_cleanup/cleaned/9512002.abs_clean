It has been suggested that the chiral symmetry can be implemented only inclassical Lagrangians containing higher covariant derivatives of odd order.Contrary to this belief, it is shown that one can construct an exactly solubletwo-dimensional higher-derivative fermionic quantum field theory containingonly derivatives of even order whose classical Lagrangian exhibits chiral-gaugeinvariance. The original field solution is expressed in terms of usual Diracspinors through a canonical transformation, whose generating function allowsthe determination of the new Hamiltonian. It is emphasized that the originaland transformed Hamiltonians are different because the mapping from the old tothe new canonical variables depends explicitly on time. The violation ofcluster decomposition is discussed and the general Wightman functionssatisfying the positive-definiteness condition are obtained.
