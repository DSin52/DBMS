Within the Quantum Action Principle framework we show the perturbativerenormalizability of previously proposed topological lagrangian \`a laWitten-Fujikawa describing polymers, then we perform a 2 loop computation. Thetheory turns out to have the same predictive power of De Gennes theory, eventhough its running coupling constants exhibit a very peculiar behaviour.Moreover we argue that the theory presents two phases , a topological and a nontopological one.
