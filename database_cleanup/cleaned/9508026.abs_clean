The Landau-Ginzburg formulation of two-dimensional topological sigma modelson the target space with positive first Chern class is considered. Theeffective Landau-Ginzburg superpotential takes the form of logarithmic typewhich is characteristic of supersymmetric theories with the mass gap. Theequations of motion yield the defining relations of the quantum cohomologyring. Topological correlation functions in the $CP^{n-1}$ and Grassmannianmodels are explicitly evaluated with the use of the logarithmic superpotential.
