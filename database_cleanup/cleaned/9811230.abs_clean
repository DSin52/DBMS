This paper lays groundwork for the detailed study of the non-trivialrenormalization group flow connecting supersymmetric fixed points in fourdimensions using string theory on AdS spaces. Specifically, we considerD3-branes placed at singularities of Calabi-Yau threefolds which generalize theconifold singularity and have an ADE classification. The $\CN=1$ superconformaltheories dictating their low-energy dynamics are infrared fixed points arisingfrom deforming the corresponding ADE $\CN=2$ superconformal field theories bymass terms for adjoint chiral fields. We probe the geometry with a single$D3$-brane and discuss the near-horizon supergravity solution for a largenumber $N$ of coincident $D3$-branes.
