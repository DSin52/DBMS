It is argued that universality is severely limited for models with multiplefixed points. As a demonstration the renormalization group equations arepresented for the potential and the wave function renormalization constants inthe $O(N)$ scalar field theory. Our equations are superior compared with theusual approach which retains only the contributions that are non-vanishing inthe ultraviolet regime. We find an indication for the existence of relevantoperators at the infrared fixed point, contrary to common expectations. Thisresult makes the sufficiency of using only renormalizable coupling constants inparametrizing the long distance phenomena questionable.
