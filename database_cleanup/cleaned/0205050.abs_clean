We analyse the geometrical structure of supersymmetric solutions of type IIsupergravity of the form R^{1,9-n} x M_n with non-trivial NS flux and dilaton.Solutions of this type arise naturally as the near-horizon limits of wrapped NSfivebrane geometries. We concentrate on the case d=7, preserving two or foursupersymmetries, corresponding to branes wrapped on associative or SLAGthree-cycles. Given the existence of Killing spinors, we show that M_7 admits aG_2-structure or an SU(3)-structure, respectively, of specific type. We alsoprove the converse result. We use the existence of these geometric structuresas a new technique to derive some known and new explicit solutions, as well asa simple theorem implying that we have vanishing NS three-form and constantdilaton whenever M_7 is compact with no boundary. The analysis extends simplyto other type II examples and also to type I supergravity.
