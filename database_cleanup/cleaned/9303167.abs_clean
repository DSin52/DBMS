We analyze to all perturbative orders the properties of two possible quantumextensions of classically on-shell equivalent antisymmetric tensor gauge modelsin four dimensions. The first case, related to the soft breaking of atopological theory wants a gauge field of canonical dimension one. The otherpossibility, which assigns canonical dimension two to the gauge field, leads tothe $\sigma$ model interpretation of the theory. In both instances we find thatthe models are anomaly free.
