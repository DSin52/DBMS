After reviewing the role of phase in quantum mechanics, I discuss, with theaid of a number of unpublished documents, the development of quantum phaseoperators in the 1960's. Interwoven in the discussion are the critical physicsthere quantum systems which can determine their nature? I conclude with acritique of recent proposals which have shed new light on the problem.
