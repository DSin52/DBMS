We explore the (non)-universality of Martinez's conjecture, originallyproposed for Kerr black holes, within and beyond general relativity. Theconjecture states that the Brown-York quasilocal energy at the outer horizon ofsuch a black hole reduces to twice its irreducible mass, or equivalently, to\sqrt{A} /(2\sqrt{pi}), where `A' is its area. We first consider the chargedKerr black hole. For such a spacetime, we calculate the quasilocal energywithin a two-surface of constant Boyer-Lindquist radius embedded in a constantstationary-time slice. Keeping with Martinez's conjecture, at the outer horizonthis energy equals the irreducible mass. The energy is positive andmonotonically decreases to the ADM mass as the boundary-surface radiusdiverges. Next we perform an analogous calculation for the quasilocal energyfor the Kerr-Sen spacetime, which corresponds to four-dimensional rotatingcharged black hole solutions in heterotic string theory. The behavior of thisenergy as a function of the boundary-surface radius is similar to the chargedKerr case. However, we show that in this case it does not approach theexpression conjectured by Martinez at the horizon.
