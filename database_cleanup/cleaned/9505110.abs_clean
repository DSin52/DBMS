The spectrum of the anomalous dimensions of the composite operators (witharbitrary number of fields $n$ and derivatives $l$) in the scalar $\phi^4$ -theory in the first order of the $\epsilon$ -expansion is investigated. Theexact solution for the operators with number of fields $\leq 4$ is presented.The behaviour of the anomalous dimensions in the large $l$ limit has beenanalyzed. It is given the qualitative description of the %structure of thespectrum for the arbitrary $n$.
