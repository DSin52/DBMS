We consider the solutions of the field equations for the large $N$ dilatongravity model in $1+1$ dimensions recently proposed by Callan, Giddings, Harveyand Strominger (CGHS). We find time dependant solutions with finite mass andvanishing flux in the weak coupling regime, as well as solutions which lieentirely in the Liouville region.
