By employing D6-branes intersecting at angles in $D = 4$ type I strings, weconstruct {\em five stack} string GUT models (PS-II class), that contain at lowenergy {\em exactly the Standard model} with no extra matter and/or extra gaugegroup factors. These classes of models are based on the Pati-Salam (PS) gaugegroup $SU(4)_C \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$. They represent deformationsaround the quark and lepton basic intersection number structure.The models possess the same phenomenological characteristics of some recentlydiscussed examples (PS-A and PS-I class) of four stack PS GUTS. Namely, thereare no colour triplet couplings to mediate proton decay and proton is stable asbaryon number is a gauged symmetry. Neutrinos get masses of the correct sizes.Also the mass relation $m_e = m_d$ at the GUT scale is recovered.The conditions for the non-anomalous U(1)'s to survive massless theGreen-Schwarz mechanism are equivalent, to the conditions, coming from thepresence of N=1 supersymmetry, in sectors involving the presence of {\em extra}branes and also required to guarantee the existence of the Majorana mass termfor the right handed neutrinos. These conditions are independent from thenumber of {\em extra} U(1) branes. We also discuss the relative size of theleading worldsheet instanton correction to the trilinear Yukawa couplings in ageneral GUT model.
