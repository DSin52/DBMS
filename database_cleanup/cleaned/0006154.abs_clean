The CPT anomaly, which was first seen in perturbation theory for certainfour-dimensional chiral gauge theories, is also present in the exact result fora class of two-dimensional chiral U(1) gauge theories on the torus.Specifically, the chiral determinant for periodic fermion fields changes signunder a CPT transformation of the background gauge field. There is, in fact, ananomaly of Lorentz invariance, which allows for the CPT theorem to becircumvented.
