We consider the gauging of $ SL(2,R) $ WZNW model by its nilpotent subgroupE(1). The resulting space-time of the corresponding sigma model is seen tocollapse to a one dimensional field theory of Liouville. Gauging the diagonalsubgroup $ E(1) \times U(1) $ of $SL(2,R) \times U(1)$ theory yields anextremal three dimensional black string. We show that these solutions areobtained from the two dimensional black hole of Witten and the threedimensional black string of Horne and Horowitz by boosting the gauge group.
