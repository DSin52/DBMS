Title: Complex structures and the Elie Cartan approach to the theory of spinors

Authors: Michel Dubois-Violette

Comments: 10p

Each isometric complex structure on a 2$\ell$-dimensional euclidean space $E$corresponds to an identification of the Clifford algebra of $E$ with thecanonical anticommutation relation algebra for $\ell$ ( fermionic) degrees offreedom. The simple spinors in the terminology of E.~Cartan or the pure spinorsin the one of C. Chevalley are the associated vacua. The corresponding statesare the Fock states (i.e. pure free states), therefore, none of the aboveterminologies is very good.
