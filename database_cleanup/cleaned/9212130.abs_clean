D-dimensional constrained systems are studied with stochastic Lagrangianand\break Hamiltonian. It is shown that stochastic consistency conditions aresecond class constraints and Lagrange multiplier fields can be determined in(D+1)-dimensional canonical formulation. The Langevin equations for theconstrained system are obtained as Hamilton's equations of motion whereconjugate momenta play a part of noise fields.
