We study how the decay properties of particles are changed by acceleration.It is shown that under the influence of acceleration (1) the lifetime ofparticles is modified and (2) new processes (like the decay of the proton)become possible. This is illustrated by considering scalar models for the decayof muons, pions, and protons. We discuss the close conceptual relation betweenthese processes and the Unruh effect.
