Authors: Jan Govaerts (UCL, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium)

Comments: Lectures at the Second International Workshop on Contemporary

Problems in Mathematical Physics, Cotonou, Republic of Benin, 94 pagesWith the two most profound conceptual revolutions of XXth century physics,quantum mechanics and relativity, which have culminated into relativisticspacetime geometry and quantum gauge field theory as the principles for gravityand the three other known fundamental interactions, the physicist of the XXIstand the continuum. As an invitation to tomorrow's quantum geometers who mustdesign the new rulers by which to size up the Universe at those scales wherethe smallest meets the largest, these lectures review the basic principles oftoday's conceptual framework, and highlight by way of simple examples theinterplay that presently exists between the quantum world of particleinteractions and the classical world of geometry and topology.
