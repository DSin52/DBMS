Title: Black Hole Evaporation and Complementarity

Comments: 6 pages, 2 figs. summary of lectures presented by Erik Verlinde

at the 1994 Les Houches Summer School ``Fluctuating Geometries in Statistical(based on work with Y. Kiem, K. Schoutens and H. Verlinde)About twenty years ago Hawking made the remarkable suggestion that the blackhole evaporation process will inevitably lead to a fundamental loss of quantumcoherence. The mechanism by which the quantum radiation is emitted appears tobe insensitive to the detailed history of the black hole, and thus it seemsthat most of the initial information is lost for an outside observer. However,direct examination of Hawking's original derivation (or any later one) of theblack hole emission spectrum shows that one inevitably needs to make referenceto particle waves that have arbitrarily high frequency near the horizon asmeasured in the reference frame of the in-falling matter. This exponentialred-shift effect associated with the black hole horizon leads to a breakdown ofthe usual separation of length scales, and effectively works as a magnifyingglass that makes the consequences of the short distance, or rather, high energyphysics near the horizon visible at larger scales to an asymptotic observer.
