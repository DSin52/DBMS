Some algebraic aspects of field quantization in space-time with boundariesare discussed. We introduce an associative algebra, whose exchange propertiesare inferred from the scattering processes in integrable models with reflectingboundary conditions on the half line. The basic properties of this algebra areestablished and the Fock representations associated with certain involutionsare derived. We apply these results for the construction of quantum fields andfor the study of scattering on the half line.
