Title: The Translocal Depth-Structure of Space-Time, Connes' ``Points, Speaking

to Each Other'', and the (Complex) Structure of Quantum TheoryAuthors: Manfred Requardt

Comments: 37 pages, Latex, 6 figures

We amalgamate three fields of concepts and phenomena and argue that they areessentially the same. Connes' framework of non-commutative topological spacesand ``points, speaking to each other'', a translocal web of correlations, beinghidden in the depth-structure of our macroscopic space-time, and the translocalfeatures of quantum theory. We argue in particular, that the conception of ourspace-time continuum as basically an aggregate of structureless points isalmost shurely to poor and that the very conceptual structure of quantumtheory, like e.g. the complex superposition principle, is a mesoscopicconsequence of this existing web of translocal relations, which, on the otherhand, has its roots in the initial conditions of our universe.
