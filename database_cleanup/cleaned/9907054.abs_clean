Title: Non-Supersymmetric Open String Vacua

Comments: 8 pages, Latex + JHEP.cls. Contribution to the Proceedings of the

Trieste Meeting of the TMR Network on Physics beyond the SMWe review the construction of non-supersymmetric open string vacua in variousdimensions. They can be obtained either projecting the (compactified)non-supersymmetric 0B theory, or applying the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism to openstrings. Generically, these vacua generate a non-vanishing cosmologicalconstant. However, one can construct particular kinds of Scherk-Schwarzcompactifications with vanishing cosmological constant, at least for loworders, based on asymmetric orbifolds. A generic feature of these models isthat supersymmetry remains unbroken on the branes at all mass level, while itis broken in the bulk in a way that preserves Fermi-Bose degeneracy at eachmass level in the perturbative string spectrum.
