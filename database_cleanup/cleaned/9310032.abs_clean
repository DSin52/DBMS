Through appropriate projections of an exact renormalization group equation,we study fixed points, critical exponents and nontrivial renormalization groupflows in scalar field theories in $2<d<4$. The standard upper criticaldimensions $d_k={2k\over k-1}$, $k=2,3,4,\ldots$ appear naturally encoded inour formalism, and for dimensions smaller but very close to $d_k$ our resultsmatch the $\ee$-expansion. Within the coupling constant subspace of mass andquartic couplings and for any $d$, we find a gradient flow with two fixedpoints determined by a positive-definite metric and a $c$-function which ismonotonically decreasing along the flow.
