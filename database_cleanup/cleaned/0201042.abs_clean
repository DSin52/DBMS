We propose that higher-dimensional extended objects (p-branes) are created bysuper-Planckian scattering processes in theories with TeV scale gravity. As anexample, we compute the cross section for p-brane creation in a(n+4)-dimensional spacetime with asymmetric compactification. We find that thecross section for the formation of a brane which is wounded on a compactsubmanifold of size of the fundamental gravitational scale is larger than thecross section for the creation of a spherically symmetric black hole.Therefore, we predict that branes are more likely to be created than blackholes in super-Planckian scattering processes in these manifolds. The higherrate of p-brane production has important phenomenological consequences, as itsignificantly enhances possible detection of non-perturbative gravitationalevents in future hadron colliders and cosmic rays detectors.
