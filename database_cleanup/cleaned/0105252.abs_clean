We present some preliminary investigations about the AdS2*S2 D3-branes inAdS3*S3. We analyse the quadratic fluctuations of Dirac-Born-Infeld actionaround a given semi-classical D-brane configuration and compare them withresults obtained by using conformal field theory techniques. We finally studyclassical motions of open strings attached to those D-branes and analyse therole of the spectral flow in this context.
