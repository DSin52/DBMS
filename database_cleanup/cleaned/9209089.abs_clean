The renormalization group flow recently found by Br\'ezin and Zinn- Justin byintegrating out redundant entries of the $(N+1)\times (N+1)$ hermitian randommatrix is studied. By introducing explicitly the RG flow parameter, and addingsuitable counter terms to the matrix potential of the one matrix model, wededuce some interesting properties of the RG trajectories. In particular, thestring equation for the general massive model interpolating between the UV andIR fixed points turns out to be a consequence of RG flow. An ambiguity in theUV regime of the RG trajectory is remarked to be related to the large orderbehavior of the one matrix model.
