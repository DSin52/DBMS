We investigate the system of holomorphic differential identities implied byspecial K\"ahlerian geometry of four-dimensional N=2 supergravity. Forsuperstring compactifications on \cy threefolds these identities are equivalentto the Picard-Fuchs equations of algebraic geometry that are obeyed by theperiods of the holomorphic three-form. For one variable they reduce to linearfourth-order equations which are characterized by classical $W$-generators; wefind that the instanton corrections to the Yukawa couplings are directlyrelated to the non-vanishing of $w_4$. We also show that the symplecticstructure of special geometry can be related to the fact that the Yukawacouplings can be written as triple derivatives of some holomorphic function$F$. Moreover, we give the precise relationship of the Yukawa couplings ofspecial geometry with three-point functions in topological field theory.
