We develop the basic formalism of complex $q$-analysis to study the solutionsof second order $q$-difference equations which reduce, in the $q\rightarrow 1$limit, to the ordinary Laplace equation in Euclidean and Minkowski space. Afterdefining an inner product on the function space we construct and study theproperties of the solutions, and then apply this formalism to theSchr\"{o}dinger equation and two-dimensional scalar field theory.
