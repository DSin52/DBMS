It is shown that the two dimensional gravity, described either in theconformal gauge (the Liouville theory) or in the light cone gauge, when coupledto matter possesses an infinite number of twisted $N=2$ superconformalsymmetries. The central charges of the $N=2$ algebra for the two gauge choicesare in general different. Further, it is argued that the physical states in thelight cone gauge theory can be obtained from the Liouville theory by a fieldredefinition.
