The general, linear equations with constant coefficients on quantum Minkowskispaces are considered and the explicit formulae for their conserved currentsare given. The proposed procedure can be simplified for *-invariant equations.The derived method is then applied to Klein-Gordon, Dirac and wave equations ondifferent classes of Minkowski spaces. In the examples also symmetry operatorsfor these equations are obtained. They include quantum deformations ofclassical symmetry operators as well as an additional operator connected withdeformation of the Leibnitz rule in non-commutative differential calculus.
