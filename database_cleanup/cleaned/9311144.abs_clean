By considering the most general metric which can occur on a contractable twodimensional symplectic manifold, we find the most general Hamiltonians on a twodimensional phase space to which equivariant localization formulas for theassociated path integrals can be applied. We show that in the case of amaximally symmetric phase space the only applicable Hamiltonians areessentially harmonic oscillators, while for non-homogeneous phase spaces thepossibilities are more numerous but ambiguities in the path integrals occur. Inthe latter case we give general formulas for the Darboux Hamiltonians, as wellas the Hamiltonians which result naturally from a generalized coherent stateformulation of the quantum theory which shows that again the Hamiltonians soobtained are just generalized versions of harmonic oscillators. Our analysisand results describe the quantum geometry of some two dimensional systems.
