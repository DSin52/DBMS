Topological defects constructed out of scalar fields and possessing chiralfermion zero modes are known to exhibit an anomaly inflow mechanism whichcancels the anomaly in the effective theory of the zero modes through an inflowof current from the space in which the defect is embedded. We investigate theanalog of this mechanism for defects constructed out of gauge fields in higherdimensions. In particular we analyze this mechanism for string (one-brane)defects in six dimensions and for fivebranes in ten dimensions.}
