We discuss non-perturbative phase transitions, within the context ofheterotic M-theory, which occur when all, or part, of the wrapped five-branesin the five-dimensional bulk space come into direct contact with a boundarybrane. These transitions involve the transformation of the five-brane into a``small instanton'' on the Calabi-Yau space at the boundary brane, followed bythe ``smoothing out'' of the small instanton into a holomorphic vector bundle.Small instanton phase transitions change the number of families, the gaugegroup or both on the boundary brane, depending upon whether a base component,fiber component or both components of the five-brane class are involved in thetransition. We compute the conditions under which a small instanton phasetransition can occur and present a number of explicit, phenomenologicallyrelevant examples.
