It is natural to analyse the AdS$_{d+1}$-CQFT$_{d}$ correspondence in thecontext of the conformal- compactification and covering formalism. In this wayone obtains additional inside about Rehren's rigorous algebraic holography inconnection with the degree of freedom issue which in turn allows to illustratesthe subtle but important differences beween the original string theory-basedMaldacena conjecture and Rehren's theorem in the setting of an intrinsicfield-coordinatization-free formulation of algebraic QFT. I also discussanother more generic type of holography related to light fronts which seems tobe closer to 't Hooft's original ideas on holography. This in turn is naturallyconnected with the generic concept of ``Localization Entropy'', a quantumpre-form of Bekenstein's classical black-hole surface entropy.
