Title: Gravitational and Axionic Backgrounds for Four-dimensional Superstrings

Authors: Dieter Luest

Comments: (Talk given at the EPS 93 Conference at Marseilles, 7 pages,

HUB-IEP-93/7We construct new four-dimensional superstring vacua with extendedsuperconformal symmetries. A non-trivial dilaton background implies theexistence of Abelian killing symmetries. These are used to construct dualequivalent backgrounds in a way preserving the N=2 superconformal invariance.
