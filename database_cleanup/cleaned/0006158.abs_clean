We use the Israel condition to treat carefully the weak-field perturbationsdue to the presence of matter on a 3-brane embedded between two regions ofanti-de Sitter (AdS) space with different curvature lengths. A four dimensionalNewton's Law only emerges at distances that are large compared to the AdSlengths. When a scalar curvature is included in the brane action, however, itis possible to generate a four dimensional theory of gravity even when one orboth of the AdS lengths is large compared to distances along the brane. Inparticular, we provide an example in which the AdS lengths can be larger thanthe millimeter experimental bound.
