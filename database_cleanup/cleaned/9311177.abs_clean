Title: On the Problems with Background Independence in String Theory

Authors: S. Shatashvili

Comments: 15p., Preprint IASSNS-HEP-93/66

The problems with background independence are discussed in the example ofopen string theory. Based on the recent proposal by Witten I calculate theString Field Theory action in conformal perturbation theory to second order anddemonstrate that the proper treatment of contact terms leads to nontrivialequations of motion. I conjecture the form of the field theory action to allorders.
