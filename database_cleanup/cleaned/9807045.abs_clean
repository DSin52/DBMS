We construct explicit multivortex solutions for the first and second complexsine-Gordon equations. The constructed solutions are expressible in terms ofthe modified Bessel and rational functions, respectively. The vorticity-raisingand lowering Backlund transformations are interpreted as the Schlesingertransformations of the fifth Painleve equation.
