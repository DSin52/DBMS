We consider Euclidean D4 and D6-branes filling the whole ${\bf R}^4$ and${\bf R}^6$ space, respectively. In both cases, with a constant backgroundB-field turned on for D4-branes, we propose actions which are the same as theDBI actions up to some constant or total derivative terms. These extra termsallow us to write the action as a square of nonlinear instanton equations. Assuch, the actions can easily be supersymmetrized using the methods oftopological field theory.
