We address the possibility of false vacuum decay in $N=1$ supergravitytheories, including those corresponding to superstring vacua. By establishing aBogomol'nyi bound for the energy density stored in the domain wall of the$O(4)$ invariant bubble, we show that supersymmetric vacua remain absolutelystable against false vacuum decay into another supersymmetric vacuum, includingthose from a Minkowski to an anti-deSitter (AdS) one. As a consequence, thereare no compact static spherical domain walls, while on the other hand thereexist planar domain walls interpolating between non-degenerate supersymmetricvacua, e.g. between Minkowski (topology $\Re^{4}$) and AdS (topology$S^{1}(time) \times \Re^{3}(space)$) vacua.
