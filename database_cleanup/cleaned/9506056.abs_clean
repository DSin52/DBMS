Supersymmetry breaking may be linked to the formation of gaugino condensatesin a hidden sector. In this work, the process of formation of the condensate isexamined in a cosmological context, using an effective field theory of thegaugino bilinear which provides a reasonable interpolation between the high-and low-temperature phases. The implementation of anomaly requirementsgenerates a large potential barrier between the zero-condensate configurationand that of the true (SUSY-breaking) vacuum. As a consequence, the transitionto bubbles of true vacuum may be subject to an enormous exponentialsuppression. This leads to the same difficulties with inhomogeneity of theuniverse which occurred in the original inflationary scenarios.
