We derive an explicit, exactly conformally invariant form for the action forthe non-abelian Toda field theory. We demonstrate that the conformal invarianceconditions, expressed in terms of the $\beta$-functions of the theory, aresatisfied to all orders, and we use our results to obtain a value for thecentral charge agreeing with previous calculations.
