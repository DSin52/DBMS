We study the spectra of G/G coset models by computing BRST cohomology ofaffine Lie algebras with coefficients in tensor product of two modules.One-to-one correspondence between the spectra of $A_1^1/A_1^1$ and that of theminimal matter coupled to gravity (including boundary states of the Kac table)is observed. This phenomena is discussed from the point of hamiltonianreduction of BRST complexes of $A_N^1$ Lie algebras. (In the revised versionone proof is modified and examplified, some misprints are corrected.)
