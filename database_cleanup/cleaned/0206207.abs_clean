We consider gauge theories with multitrace deformations in the context ofcertain AdS/CFT models with explicit breaking of conformal symmetry andsupersymmetry. In particular, we study the standard four-dimensional confiningmodel based on the D4-brane metric at finite temperature. We work in theself-consistent Hartree approximation, which becomes exact in the large-N limitand is equivalent to the AdS/CFT multitrace prescription that has been proposedin the literature. We show that generic multitrace perturbations have importanteffects on the phase structure of these models. Most notably they can inducenew types of large-N first-order phase transitions.
