The freedom in choosing finite renormalizations in quantum field theories(QFT) is characterized by a set of parameters $\{c_i \}, i = 1 ..., n >...$,which specify the renormalization prescriptions used for the calculation ofphysical quantities. For the sake of simplicity, the case of a single $c$ isselected and chosen mass-independent if masslessness is not realized, this withthe aim of expressing the effect of an infinitesimal change in $c$ on thecomputed observables. This change is found to be expressible in terms of anequation involving a vector field $V$ on the action's space $M$ (coordinatesx). This equation is often referred to as ``evolution equation'' in physics.This vector field generates a one-parameter (here $c$) group of diffeomorphismson $M$. Its flow $\sigma_c (x)$ can indeed be shown to satisfy the functionalequation $$ \sigma_{c+t} (x) = \sigma_c (\sigma_t (x)) \equiv \sigma_c \circ\sigma_t $$ $$\sigma_0 (x) = x,$$ so that the very appearance of $V$ in theevolution equation implies at once the Gell-Mann-Low functional equation. Thelatter appears therefore as a trivial consequence of the existence of a vectorfield on the action's space of renormalized QFT.
