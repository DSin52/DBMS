A family of theories which interpolate between vector and chiral Schwingermodels is studied on the two--sphere $S^{2}$. The conflict between the loss ofgauge invariance and global geometrical properties is solved by introducing afixed background connection. In this way the generalized Dirac--Weyl operatorcan be globally defined on $S^{2}$. The generating functional of the Greenfunctions is obtained by taking carefully into account the contribution ofgauge fields with non--trivial topological charge and of the relatedzero--modes of the Dirac determinant. In the decompactification limit, theGreen functions of the flat case are recovered; in particular the fermioniccondensate in the vacuum vanishes, at variance with its behaviour in the vectorSchwinger model.
