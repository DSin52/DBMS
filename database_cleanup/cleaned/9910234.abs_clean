The multi-instanton solutions by 'tHooft and Jackiw, Nohl & Rebbi aregeneralized to curvilinear coordinates. Expressions can be notably simplifiedby the appropriate gauge transformation. This generates the compensatingaddition to the gauge potential of pseudoparticles. Singularities of thecompensating connection are irrelevant for physics but affect gauge dependentquantities.
