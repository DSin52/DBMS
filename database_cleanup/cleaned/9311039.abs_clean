Both the coherent states and also the squeezed states of the harmonicthe 1) displacement operator, 2) annihilation- (or ladder-) operator, andminimum-uncertainty methods. For general systems, there is the sameunderstanding except for ladder-operator and displacement-operator squeezedstates. After reviewing the known concepts, I propose a method for obtaininggeneralized minimum-uncertainty squeezed states, give examples, and relate itto known concepts. I comment on the remaining concept, that of generaldisplacement-operator squeezed states.
