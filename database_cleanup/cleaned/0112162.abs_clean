We construct a covariant quantum superstring, extending Berkovits' approachby introducing new ghosts to relax the pure spinor constraints. The centralcharge of the underlying Kac-Moody algebra, which would lead to an anomaly inthe BRST charge, is treated as a new generator with a new b-c system. Weconstruct a nilpotent BRST current, an anomalous ghost current and ananomaly-free energy-momentum tensor. For open superstrings, we find the correctmassless spectrum. In addition, we construct a Lorentz invariant B-field to beused for the computation of the integrated vertex operators and amplitudes.
