We consider the D-dimensional massive dilaton gravity coupled to Maxwell andantisymmetric tensor fields (EMATD). We derive the full separability of thistheory in static case. This discloses the core structure of the theory andyields the simple procedure of how to generate integrability classes.As an example we take a certain new class, obtain the two-parametric familiesof dyonic solutions. It turns out that at some conditions they tend to theD-dimensional dyonic Reissner-Nordstr\"om-deSitter solutions but with``renormalized'' dyonic charge plus a small logarithmic correction. The latterhas the significant influence on the global structure of the non-perturbedsolution - it may shift and split horizons, break down extremality, and dressthe naked singularity.We speculate on physical importance of the deduced integrability classes, inparticular on their possible role in understanding of the problem of unknowndilaton potential in modern cosmological and low-energy string models.
