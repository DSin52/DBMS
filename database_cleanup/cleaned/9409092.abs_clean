We consider the effect of curved two-dimensional space-time on Witten's $N=2$supersymmetric sigma models interpolating Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces toLandau-Ginzburg models. In order for the former models to have significantconnection to superstring theory, only the $N=(1,1)$ or $N=(1,0)$ part of thetotal $N=(2,2)$ world-sheet supersymmetry is made local. Even though therearises an additional minimizing condition due to a scalar auxiliary field inthe supergravity multiplet on curved two-dimensions, the essential feature ofthe sigma-model relating Calabi-Yau and Landau-Ginzburg models will bemaintained. This indicates the validity of these sigma models formulated oncurved two-dimensions or curved world-sheets. As a by-product, the coupling of$N=(2,2)$ vector multiplets to other multiplets with $N=(1,1)$ localsupersymmetry is developed.
