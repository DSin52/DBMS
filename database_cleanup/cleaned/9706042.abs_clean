Various effective field theories in four dimensions are shown to have exactnon-trivial solutions in the limit as the number $N$ of fields of some typebecomes large. These include extended versions of the U(N) Gross-Neveu model,the non-linear O(N) $\sigma$-model, and the $CP^{N-1}$ model. Although thesemodels are not renormalizable in the usual sense, the infinite number ofcoupling types allows a complete cancellation of infinities. These modelsprovide qualitative predictions of the form of scattering amplitudes forarbitrary momenta, but because of the infinite number of free parameters, it ispossible to derive quantitative predictions only in the limit of small momenta.For small momenta the large-$N$ limit provides only a modest simplification,removing at most a finite number of diagrams to each order in momenta, exceptnear phase transitions, where it reduces the infinite number of diagrams thatcontribute for low momenta to a finite number.
