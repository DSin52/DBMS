We examine an approach to justifying the mean field approximation for theanyon gas, using the scattering of anyons. Parity violation permits a nonzeroaverage scattering angle, from which one can extract a mean radius of curvaturefor anyons. If this is larger than the interparticle separation, one expectsthat the graininess of the statistical magnetic field is unimportant, and thatthe mean field approximation is good. We argue that a non-conventionalinteraction between anyons is crucial, in which case the criterion for validityof the approximation is identical to the one deduced using a self-consistencyargument.
