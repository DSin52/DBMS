Title: N-point and higher-genus osp(1|2) fusion

Authors: Jorgen Rasmussen

Comments: 17 pages, LaTeX

We study affine osp(1|2) fusion, the fusion in osp(1|2) conformal fieldtheory, for example. Higher-point and higher-genus fusion is discussed. Thefusion multiplicities are characterized as discretized volumes of certainconvex polytopes, and are written explicitly as multiple sums measuring thosevolumes. We extend recent methods developed to treat affine su(2) fusion. Theyare based on the concept of generalized Berenstein-Zelevinsky triangles andvirtual couplings. Higher-point tensor products of finite-dimensionalirreducible osp(1|2) representations are also considered. The associatedmultiplicities are computed and written as multiple sums.
