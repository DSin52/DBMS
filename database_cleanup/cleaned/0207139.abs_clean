Title: D=4 supergravity dynamically coupled to a massless superparticle in a

superfield Lagrangian approachAuthors: Igor A. Bandos, Jose A. de Azcarraga, Jose M. Izquierdo and Jerzy

LukierskiComments: v2 23 pages, RevTeX. Additional text and references, order of

sections changed, results unaltered. To appear in Phys. Rev. DWe consider the interacting system of D=4 N=1 supergravity and theBrink-Schwarz massless superparticle as described by the sum of theirsuperfield actions, and derive the complete set of superfield equations ofmotion for the coupled dynamical system. These include source terms given byderivatives of a vector superfield current density with support on theworldline. This current density is constructed from the spin 3/2 and spin 2current density `prepotentials'. We analyze the gauge symmetry of the coupledaction and show that it is possible to fix the gauge in such a way that theequations of motion reduce to those of the supergravity-bosonic particlecoupled system.
