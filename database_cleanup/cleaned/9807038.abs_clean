Massless and massive scalar fields and massless spinor fields are consideredat arbitrary temperatures in four dimensional ultrastatic curved spacetime.Scalar models under consideration can be either conformal or nonconformal andinclude selfinteraction. The one-loop nonlocal effective action at finitetemperature and free energy for these quantum fields are found up to the secondorder in background field strengths using the covariant perturbation theory.The resulting expressions are free of infrared divergences. Spectralrepresentations for nonlocal terms of high temperature expansions are obtained.
