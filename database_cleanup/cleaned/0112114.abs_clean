Noncommutative three-dimensional gravity can be described in terms of anoncommutative Chern-Simons theory. We extend this structure and also proposean action for gravitational fields on an even dimensional noncommutative space.The action is worked out in some detail for fields on a noncommutative ${\bfCP}^2$ and on $S^4$.
