We suggest a model of induced gravity in which the fundamental object is arelativistic {\it membrane} minimally coupled to a background metric and to anexternal three index gauge potential. We compute the low energy limit of thetwo-loop effective action as a power expansion in the surface tension. Ageneralized bootstrap hypothesis is made in order to identify the physicalmetric and gauge field with the lowest order terms in the expansion of thevacuum average of the composite operators conjugate to the background fields.We find that the large distance behaviour of these classical fields isdescribed by the Einstein action with a cosmological term plus a Maxwell typeaction for the gauge potential. The Maxwell term enables us to apply theHawking-Baum argument to show that the physical cosmological constant is``~probably~'' zero.
