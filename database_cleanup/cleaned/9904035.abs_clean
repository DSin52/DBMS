Title: A Comment on the Entropy of Strongly Coupled N=4

Authors: N. Itzhaki

Comments: 4 pages, latex, no figures

We propose a field theory argument, which rests on the non-renormalization ofthe two point function of the energy-momentum tensor, why the ratio between theentropies of strongly coupled and weakly coupled N=4 is of order one.
