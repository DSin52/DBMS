We prove unboundedness and boundedness of the unsmeared and smeared chiralvertex operators, respectively. We use elementary methods in bosonic Fockspace, only. Possible applications to conformal two - dimensional quantum fieldtheory, perturbation thereof, and to the perturbative construction of thesine-Gordon model by the Epstein-Glaser method are discussed. From anotherpoint of view the results of this paper can be looked at as a first steptowards a Hilbert space interpretation of vertex operator algebras.
