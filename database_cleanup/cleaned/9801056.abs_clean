The general structure of the conformal anomaly and the dilaton's effect to itare analysed. First we give a new formal proof of the statement that theconformal anomaly, in the theory which is conformal invariant at the classicallevel, is conformal invariant. The heat-kernel regularization and Fujikawa'smethod are taken for the analysis. We present a new explicit result of theconformal anomaly in 4 dimensional photon-dilaton gravity. This result isexamined from the point of the general structure.
