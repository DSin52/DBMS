The B-twisted topological sigma model coupled to topological gravity isChern-Simons theory for the open string, and the Kodaira-Spencer theory for theclosed string. We show that the B model can be represented as a PARTICLEtheory, obtained by reducing the sigma model to one dimension, and replacingthe coupling to topological gravity by a coupling to a twisted one-dimensionalsupergravity. The particle can be defined on ANY Kahler manifold--it does notrequire the Calabi-Yau condition--so it may provide a more generalized settingfor the B model than the topological sigma model. The one-loop partitionfunction of the particle can be written in terms of the Ray-Singer torsion ofthe manifold, and agrees with that of the original B model. After showing howto deform the Kahler and complex structures in the particle, we prove theindependence of this partition function on the Kahler structure, andinvestigate the origin of the holomorphic anomaly. To define other amplitudes,one needs to introduce interactions into the particle. The particle will thendefine a field theory, which may or may not be the Chern-Simons orKodaira-Spencer theories.
