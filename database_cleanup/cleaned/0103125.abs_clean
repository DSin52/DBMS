The restriction of space-time dimensions to "2+1" leads us to a novel quantumfield theory which has the Chern-Simons term in its action. This term changesthe nature of gauge interaction by giving a so-called topological mass to agauge field without breaking the gauge symmetry. We investigate how a dynamicalmass of fermion is affected by the topological mass in the non-perturbativeSchwinger-Dyson method.
