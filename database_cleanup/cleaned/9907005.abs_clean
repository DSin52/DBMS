Title: On The Equivalence Of Four Dimensional And Two dimensional Field

TheoriesComments: 19 pages, Latex, a revised version

We investigate the dimensional, the dynamical and the topological structuresof four dimensional Einstein and Yang-Mills theories. It is shown that thesetheories are constructed from two dimensional quantities, so that they possessalways a distinguished two dimensional substructure. In this sense the fourdimensional field theories are equivalent to related two dimensional fieldtheories.
