This work can be considered as a continuation of our previous one (J.Phys.,26 (1993) 313), in which an explicit form of coherent states (CS) for all SU(N)groups was constructed by means of representations on polynomials. Here weextend that approach to any SU(l,1) group and construct explicitlycorresponding CS. The CS are parametrized by dots of a coset space, which is,in that particular case, the open complex ball $CD^{l}$. This space togetherwith the projective space $CP^{l}$, which parametrizes CS of the SU(l+1) group,exhausts all complex spaces of constant curvature. Thus, both sets of CSprovide a possibility for an explicit analysis of the quantization problem onall the spaces of constant curvature.
