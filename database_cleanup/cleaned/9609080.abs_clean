We compute the Form Factors of the relevant scaling operators in a class ofintegrable models without internal symmetries by exploiting their clusterproperties. Their identification is established by computing the correspondinganomalous dimensions by means of Delfino--Simonetti--Cardy sum--rule andfurther confirmed by comparing some universal ratios of the nearbynon--integrable quantum field theories with their independent numericaldetermination.
