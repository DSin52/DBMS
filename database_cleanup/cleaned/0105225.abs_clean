Title: Mirror Symmetry and a $G_2$ Flop

Authors: Mina Aganagic and Cumrun Vafa

Comments: Identification of parameters as well as the computation of the

superpotential is extended to all A-D-E cases. Additional references are alsoincludedBy applying mirror symmetry to D-branes in a Calabi-Yau geometry we shedlight on a $G_2$ flop in M-theory relevant for large $N$ dualities in ${\calN}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories. Furthermore, we derive superpotential forM-theory on corresponding $G_2$ manifolds for all A-D-E cases. This provides aneffective method for geometric engineering of ${\cal N}=1$ gauge theories forwhich mirror symmetry gives exact information about vacuum geometry. We alsofind a number of interesting dual descriptions.
