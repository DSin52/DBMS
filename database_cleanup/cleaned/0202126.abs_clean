Using D2-brane probes, we study various properties of M-theory on singular,non-compact manifolds of G_2 and Spin(7) holonomy. We derive mirror pairs ofN=1 supersymmetric three-dimensional gauge theories, and apply this techniqueto realize exceptional holonomy manifolds as both Coulomb and Higgs branches ofthe D2-brane world-volume theory. We derive a ``G_2 quotient construction'' ofnon-compact manifolds which admit a metric of G_2 holonomy. We further discussthe moduli space of such manifolds, including the structure of geometricaltransitions in each case. For completeness, we also include familiar examplesof manifolds with SU(3) and Sp(2) holonomy, where some of the new ideas areclarified and tested.
