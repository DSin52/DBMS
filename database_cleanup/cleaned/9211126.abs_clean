There are two fundamental problems studied by the theory of hamiltonianaction-angle variables. The third problem, however, should be added to theimportant relations to the quantum integrability. Separation of variables isconstructed for the $SL(3)$ magnetic chain --- an example of integrable modelassociated to a nonhyperelliptic algebraic curve.
