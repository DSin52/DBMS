We show that a Hamiltonian reduction of affine Lie superalgebras havingbosonic simple roots (such as $OSp(1|4)$) ``does'' produce supersymmetricToda models, with superconformal symmetry being nonlinearly realised for thosefields of the Toda system which are related to the bosonic simple roots of thesuperalgebra. A fermionic $b-c$ system of conformal spin $(3/2,-1/2)$ is anatural ingredient of such models.
