TrigianteComments: 9 pages, 1 figure. Talk given by P. Termonia at the TMR meeting of

the project "Quantum Aspects of Gauge Theories, Supersymmetry andUnification", Corfu '98, TMR contract ERBFMRX-CT96-0045We derive the free Osp(8|4) singleton action by sending the M2brane to theMinkowski boundary of an AdS_4x{\cal M}_7 background. We do this by means ofthe solvable Lie algebra parametrization of the coset space. We also give somecomments on singleton actions from membranes on AdS_4xG/H backgrounds.
