This is the second in a series of papers devoted to open string field theoryin two dimensions. In this paper we aim to clarify the origin and the role ofdiscrete physical states in the theory. To this end, we study interactions ofdiscrete states and generic tachyons. In particular, we discuss at length fourpoint amplitudes. We show that behavior of the correlation functions isgoverned by the number of generic tachyons involved and values of the kinematicinvariants $s$, $t$ and $u$. Divergence of certain classes of correlators isshown to be the consequence of the fact certain kinematic invariants arenon--positive integers in that case. Explicit examples are included. We checkour results by standard conformal technique.
