Observables in the quantum field theories of $(D-1)$-form fields, $\ca$, on$D$-dimensional, compact and orientable manifolds, $M$, are computed.Computations of the vacuum value of $T_{ab}$ find it to be the metric times afunction of the volume of spacetime, $\Omega(M)$. Part of this function of$\Omega$ is a finite zero-mode contribution. The correlation functions ofanother set of operators give intersection numbers on $M$. Furthermore, asimilar computation for products of Wilson area operators results in a functionof the volumes of the intersections of the submanifolds the operators aredefined on. In addition, scalar field couplings are introduced and potentialsare induced after integrating out the $\ca$ field. Lastly, the thermodynamicsof the pure theories is found to be analogous to the zero-point motion of ascalar particle. The coupling of a Gaussian scalar field to the $\ca$ field isfound to manifest itself on the free energy at high temperatures and/or smallvolumes.
