We study the transmission of supersymmetry breaking via gravitationalinteractions in a five-dimensional brane-world compactified on $S^1/Z_2$. Weassume that chiral matter and gauge fields are confined at the orbifold fixedpoints, where supersymmetry is spontaneously broken by effective branesuperpotentials. Using an off-shell supergravity multiplet we integrate out theauxiliary fields and examine the couplings between the bulk supergravity fieldsand boundary matter fields. The corresponding tree-level shift in the bulkgravitino mass spectrum induces one-loop radiative masses for the boundaryfields. We calculate the boundary gaugino and scalar masses for arbitraryvalues of the brane superpotentials, and show that the mass spectrum reduces tothe Scherk-Schwarz limit for arbitrarily large values of the branesuperpotentials.
