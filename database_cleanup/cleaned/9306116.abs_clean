We show that the master equation governing the dynamics of simple diffusionand certain chemical reaction processes in one dimension give time evolutionoperators (Hamiltonians) which are realizations of Hecke algebras. In the caseof simple diffusion one obtains, after similarity transformations, reduciblehermitian representations while in the other cases they are non-hermitian andcorrespond to supersymmetric quotients of Hecke algebras.
