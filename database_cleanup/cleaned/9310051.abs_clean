There is a completely natural and intimate relationship between thediffeomorphism group of the circle and the Teichm\"uller spaces of Riemannsurfaces discovered by us in 1988. Such a relationship had been sought-after byphysicists from conjectures connecting the loop-space approach to string theorywith the path-integral approach. Precisely, the remarkable homogeneous spaceDiff$(S^1)$/$SL(2,R)$ (which is one of the two possible quantizable coadjointorbits of Diff$(S^1)$), embeds as a complex analytic and K\"ahler submanifoldof the universal Teichm\"uller space. Furthermore, this very homogeneous space,Diff$(S^1)$/$SL(2,R)$, considered by the previous work as a K\"ahlersubmanifold of the universal Teichm\"uller space, allows on it a naturalholomorphic period mapping, $\Pi$, that generalises the classical mapassociating to a genus $g$ Riemann surface its period matrix. Utilising thefact that the group of quasiconformal homeomorphisms of $S^1$ actssymplectically on the Sobolev space of order $1/2$ on the circle, we (withDennis Sullivan) have recently extended $\Pi$ to the entire universalTeichm\"uller space. All this is related to non-perturbative string theory.
