It is shown that all string fields except dilaton are non-propagating in the(2+1)-dimensional black string. One finds that the perturbation around theblack string reveals a mixing between the dilaton and other fields. Under thenew gauge(dilaton gauge), we disentangle this mixing and obtain one decoupleddilaton equation. It turns out that this black string is stable. From thescattering of dilaton off the neutral black string(N=0), we find the absorptioncross-section. Further the absorption cross-section for minimally coupledscalar is obtained and we compared it with that of dilaton.
