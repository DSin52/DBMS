The interior near the horizon of an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holeis taken as an initial state for quantum mechanical tunneling. An instanton ispresented that connects this state with a final state describing the presenceof several horizons. This is interpreted as a WKB description of fluctuationsdue to the throat splitting into several components.
