We construct superstring theories that obey the new supersymmetry algebra{Q_a , Q_b}=\gamma_{ab}^{mn} P_{1m} P_{2n}, in a Green-Schwarz formalism, withkappa supersymmetry also of the new type. The superstring is in a system with asuperparticle so that their total momenta are $P_{2n},P_{1m}$ respectively. Thesystem is covariant and critical in (10,2) dimensions if the particle ismassless and in (9,2) dimensions if the particle is massive. Both thesuperstring and superparticle have coordinates with two timelike dimensions buteach behaves effectively as if they have a single timelike dimension. This isdue to gauge symmetries and associated constraints. We show how to generalizethe gauge principle to more intricate systems containing two parts, 1 and 2.Each part contains interacting constituents, such as p-branes, and each partbehaves effectively as if they have one timelike coordinate, although the fullsystem has two timelike coordinates. The examples of two superparticles, and ofa superparticle and a superstring, discussed in more detail are a special casesof such a generalized interacting system.
