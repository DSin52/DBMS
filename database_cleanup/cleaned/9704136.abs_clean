We study the most general renormalization transformations for the first-orderformulation of the Yang-Mills theory. We analyze, in particular, the trivialstandard one and the extended one. The latter is a promising starting point forthe interpretation of the Yang-Mills theory as a deformation of thetopological BF theory. This work is a necessary preliminary step towards anyperturbative calculation, and completes some recently obtained results.
