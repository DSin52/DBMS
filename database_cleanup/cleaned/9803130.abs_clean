We calculate finite temperature effects on a correlation function in the twodimensional supersymmetric nonlinear O(3) sigma model. The correlation functionviolates chiral symmetry and at zero temperature it has been shown to be aconstant, which gives rise to a double-valued condensate. Within the bilinearapproximation we find an exact result in a one-instanton background at finitetemperature. In contrast to the result at zero temperature we find that thecorrelation function decays exponentially at large distances.
