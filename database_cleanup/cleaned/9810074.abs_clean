For nonrelativistic Hamiltonians which are shape invariant, analyticexpressions for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be derived using the wellknown method of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Most of these Hamiltoniansalso possess spectrum generating algebras and are hence solvable by anindependent group theoretic method. In this paper, we demonstrate theequivalence of the two methods of solution by developing an algebraic frameworkfor shape invariant Hamiltonians with a general change of parameters, whichinvolves nonlinear extensions of Lie algebras.
