Title: T-duality of large N QCD

Authors: Zachary Guralnik

Comments: based on talk given at Fourth Workshop on QCD, Paris 1998 9 pages,

tex, harvmacWe argue that non-supersymmetric large N QCD compactified on T^2 exhibitsproperties characteristic of an SL(2,Z) T-duality. The kahler structure onwhich this SL(2,Z) acts is given by $m/N + i\Lambda^2 A$, where A is the areaof the torus, m is the 't Hooft magnetic flux on the torus, and $\Lambda^2$ isthe QCD string tension.
