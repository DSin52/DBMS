We investigate a 4D analog of 2D WZW theory. The theory turns out to havesurprising finiteness properties and an infinite-dimensional current algebrasymmetry. Some correlation functions are determined by this symmetry. One wayto define the theory systematically proceeds by the quantization of modulispaces of holomorphic vector bundles over algebraic surfaces. We outline howone can define vertex operators in the theory. Finally, we definefour-dimensional ``conformal blocks'' and present an analog of the Verlindeformula.
