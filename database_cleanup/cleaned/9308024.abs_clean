Title: The Improved Bounce Solution of SU(2)-Higgs Model

Authors: Yuji Kobayashi

Comments: Plain TeX, 12 pages plus 3 figures available upon request,

TMUP-HEL-9304We further develop the reduced action formalism of the SU(2)-Higgs modeloriginally given by Aoyama et.al.. Our new ansatz for the sphaleron solutionmakes it possible to apply this formalism to all range of the Higgs selfcoupling constant. Based on the formalism, we construct a bounce solutionoscillating around the sphaleron.
