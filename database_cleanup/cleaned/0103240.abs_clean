We present exact solutions of the gravitational field equations in thegeneralized Randall-Sundrum model for an anisotropic brane with Bianchi type Iand V geometry, with perfect fluid and scalar fields as matter sources. Underthe assumption of a conformally flat bulk (with vanishing Weyl tensor) for acosmological fluid obeying a linear barotropic equation of state the generalsolution of the field equations can be expressed in an exact parametric formfor both Bianchi type I and V space-times. In the limiting case of a stiffcosmological fluid with pressure equal to the energy density, for a Bianchitype I Universe the solution of the field equations are obtained in an exactanalytic form. Several classes of scalar field models evolution on the braneare also considered, corresponding to different choices of the scalar fieldpotential. For all models the behavior of the observationally importantparameters like shear, anisotropy and deceleration parameter is considered indetail.
