The BRST anomaly which may be present in the induced $W_n$ gravity quantizedon the light-cone is evaluated in the geometrical framework of Zucchini. Thecocycles linked by the cohomology of the BRST operator to the anomaly arestraightforwardly calculated thanks to the analogy between this formulation andthe Yang-Mills theory. We give also a conformally covariant formulation ofthese quantities including the anomaly, which is valid on arbitrary Riemannsurfaces. The example of the $W_3$ theory is discussed and a comparison withother candidates for the anomaly available in the literature is presented.
