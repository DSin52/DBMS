We find a consistent formulation of the constraints of Quantum Gravity with acosmological constant in terms of the Ashtekar new variables in the connectionrepresentation, including the existence of a state that is a solution to allthe constraints. This state is related to the Chern-Simons form constructedfrom the Ashtekar connection and has an associated metric in spacetime that iseverywhere nondegenerate. We then transform this state to the looprepresentation and find solutions to all the constraint equations forintersecting loops. These states are given by suitable generalizations of theJones knot polynomial for the case of intersecting knots. These are the firstphysical states of Quantum Gravity for which an explicit form is known both inthe connection and loop representations. Implications of this result are alsodiscussed.
