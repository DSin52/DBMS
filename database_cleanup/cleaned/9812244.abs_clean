Title: Manifestly invariant actions for harmonic self-dual gauge theory

Authors: Olaf Lechtenfeld and Boris Zupnik

Comments: 16 pages, no figures

We discuss alternative descriptions of four-dimensional self-dual Yang-Millsfields in harmonic space with additional commuting spinor coordinates. Inparticular, the linear analyticity equation and nonlinear covariantharmonic-field equations are studied. A covariant harmonic field can be treatedas an infinite set of ordinary four-dimensional fields with higher spins. Weanalyze different constructions of invariant harmonic-field actionscorresponding to the self-dual harmonic equations.
