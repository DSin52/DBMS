Authors: Bertrand Le Roy

Journal-ref: J.Math.Phys. 37 (1996) 474-483

We introduce Z_3-graded objects which are the generalization of the morefamiliar Z_2-graded objects that are used in supersymmetric theories and inmany models of non-commutative geometry. First, we introduce the Z_3-gradedGrassmann algebra, and we use this object to construct the Z_3-matrices, whichare the generalizations of the supermatrices. Then, we generalize the conceptsof supertrace and superdeterminant.
