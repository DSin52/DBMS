The renormalization group flow in two-dimensional field theories that areorder in derivatives. Second, in the presence of handles the flow has quantummechanical properties. Third, the beta functions contain the elementaryhigher-genus vertices of closed string field theory. This is demonstrated atsimple examples and is applied to derive various results about gravitationallydressed beta functions. The possibility of interpreting closed string fieldtheory as the theory of the renormalization group on random surfaces withrandom topology is considered.
