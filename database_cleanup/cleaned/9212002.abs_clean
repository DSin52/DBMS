Quantization of the pure $1+1$ dimensional dilaton gravity is examined in thelight-cone gauge. It is found that the total action including ghosts generatesa $c=0$ free conformal field theory without modification of the classicalaction, which is required in the conformal gauge. We also study semiclassicalequations of the dilaton gravity coupled to $N$ scalar fields. It is shown thatthe black hole singularity is not removed even for $N<24$ in the light-conegauge. This indicates that the semiclassical analysis breaks down for small$N$.
