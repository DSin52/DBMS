Title: Gauge Independent Lagrangian Reduction of Constrained Systems

Authors: R. Banerjee

Comments: LaTex 9 pages

A gauge independent method of obtaining the reduced space of constraineddynamical systems is discussed in a purely lagrangian formalism. Implicationsof gauge fixing are also considered.
