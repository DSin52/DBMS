A non-supersymmetric ten-dimensional open string theory is constructed as anorbifold of type I string theory, and as an orientifold of the bosonic type Btheory. It is purely bosonic, and cancellation of massless tadpoles requiresthe gauge group to be SO(32)xSO(32). The spectrum of the theory contains aclosed string tachyon, and open string tachyons in the (32,32) multiplet. TheD-branes of this theory are analyzed, and it is found that the masslessexcitations of one of the 1-branes coincide with the world-sheet degrees offreedom of the D=26 bosonic string theory compactified on the SO(32) lattice.This suggests that the two theories are related by S-duality.
