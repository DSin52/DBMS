SystemsA new approach to the correlation functions is presented for the XXZ modelin the anti-ferroelectric regime. The method is based on the recent realizationof the quantum affine symmetry using vertex operators. With the aid of a bosonrepresentation for the latter, an integral formula is found for correlationfunctions of arbitrary local operators. As a special case it reproduces thespontaneous staggered polarization obtained earlier by Baxter.
