Title: 2D Supergravity and Integrable Systems

Authors: R.Ch.Rashkov

Comments: 9pgs

Integrable hierarchy based on the constrained Osp(2$\mid%2) connection isconsidered. The connection with 2D supergravity and some analogies with theW$_3^{(2)}$ case are given. It is shown that super Virasoro transformations aresymmetries of tha hierarchy.
