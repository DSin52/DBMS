We study by non perturbative techniques a vector, axial--vector theorycharacterized by a parameter which interpolates between pure vector and chiralSchwinger models. Main results are two windows in the space of parameters whichexhibit acceptable solutions. In the first window we find a free massive and afree massless bosonic excitations and interacting left--right fermions endowedwith asymptotic \hbox{states}, which feel however a long range interaction. Inthe second window the massless bosonic excitation is a negative norm statewhich can be consistently expunged from the ``physical" Hilbert space; fermionsare confined. An intriguing feature of our model occurs in the first windowwhere we find that fermionic correlators scale at both short and longdistances, but with different critical exponents. The infrared limit in thefermionic sector is nothing but a dynamically generated massless Thirringmodel.
