denjoe@stp.dias.ie, preprint number DIAS-STP-93-25We discuss how to implement an ``environmentally friendly'' renormalizationin the context of finite temperature field theory. Environmentally friendlyrenormalization provides a method for interpolating between the differenteffective field theories which characterize different asymptotic regimes. Wegive explicit two loop Pad\'e resummed results for $\l\ff$ theory for $T>T_c$.We examine the implications for non-Abelian gauge theories.
