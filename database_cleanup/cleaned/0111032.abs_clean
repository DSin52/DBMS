Title: Turning the Cosmological Constant into Black Holes

Authors: Andres Gomberoff, Marc Henneaux and Claudio Teitelboim

Comments: 6 pages, 2 figures

It is known that there is a quantum mechanical tunneling process which,through nucleation of a membrane, induces a transition between two de Sitterspaces, lowering the cosmological constant. It is shown in this paper that adifferent, new, membrane nucleation process exists, which, in addition tolowering the cosmological constant, leaves a black hole behind. Once a blackhole is present, the relaxation of the cosmological constant may proceed via ananalog of the old process, which decreases the black hole horizon area, or viathe new process, which increases it.
