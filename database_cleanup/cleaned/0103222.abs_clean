We study Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) flux tubes on the Higgs branch of N=2QCD with SU(2) gauge group and two flavors of fundamental matter. Inparticular, we consider this theory near Argyres-Douglas (AD) point where themass of monopoles connected by these ANO strings becomes small. In this regimethe effective QED which describes the theory on the Higgs branch becomesstrongly coupled. We argue that the appropriate description of the theory is interms of long and thin flux tubes (strings) with small tension. We interpretthis as another example of duality between field theory in strong coupling andstring theory in weak coupling. Then we consider the non-critical string theoryfor these flux tubes which includes fifth (Liouville) dimension. We identifyCFT at the AD point as UV fix point corresponding to AdS metric on the 5d"gravity" side. The perturbation associated with the monopole mass term createsa kink separating UV and IR behavior. We estimate the renormalized stringtension and show that it is determined by the small monopole mass. Inparticular, it goes to zero at the AD point.
