We systematically investigate the effect of short distance physics on thespectrum of temperature anistropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background producedduring inflation. We present a general argument-assuming only low energylocality-that the size of such effects are of order H^2/M^2, where H is theHubble parameter during inflation, and M is the scale of the high energyphysics.We evaluate the strength of such effects in a number of specific string and Mtheory models. In weakly coupled field theory and string theory models, theeffects are far too small to be observed. In phenomenologically attractiveHorava-Witten compactifications, the effects are much larger but stillunobservable. In certain M theory models, for which the fundamental Planckscale is several orders of magnitude below the conventional scale of grandunification, the effects may be on the threshold of detectability.However, observations of both the scalar and tensor fluctuation contributionsto the Cosmic Microwave Background power spectrum-with a precision near thecosmic variance limit-are necessary in order to unambiguously demonstrate theexistence of these signatures of high energy physics. This is a formidableexperimental challenge.
