Several new results on the multicritical behavior of rectangular matrixmodels are presented. We calculate the free energy in the saddle pointapproximation, and show that at the triple-scaling point, the result is thesame as that derived from the recursion formulae. In the triple-scaling limit,we obtain the string equation and a flow equation for arbitrary multicriticalpoints. Parametric solutions are also examined for the limit of almost-squarematrix models. This limit is shown to provide an explicit matrix modelrealization of the scaling equations proposed to describe open-closed stringtheory.
