We investigate the local geometry on the moduli space of G_2 structures thatarises in compactifications of M-theory on holonomy G_2 manifolds. Inparticular, we determine the homogeneity properties of couplings of theassociated N=1, D=4 supergravity under the scaling of moduli space coordinates.We then find some brane solitons of N=1, D=4 supergravity that are associatedwith wrapping M-branes on cycles of the compact space. These include cosmicstrings and domain walls that preserve half of supersymmetry of thefour-dimensional theory, and non-supersymmetric electrically and magneticallycharged black holes. The geometry of some of the black holes is that ofnon-extreme M-brane configurations reduced to four-dimensions on a seven torus.
