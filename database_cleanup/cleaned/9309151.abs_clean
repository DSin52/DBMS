We propose a simple model for a free relativistic particle of fractional spinin 2+1 dimensions which satisfies all the necessary conditions. The canonicalquantization of the system leads to the description of one- particle states ofthe Poincare group with arbitrary spin. Using the Hamil- tonian formulationwith the set of constraints, we introduce the electro- magnetic interaction ofa charged anyon and obtain the Lagrangian. The Casimir operator of the extendedalgebra, which is the first-class constraint, is obtained and gives theequation of motion of the anyon. In particular, from the latter it follows thatthe gyromagnetic ratio for a charged anyon is two due to the parallelness ofspin and momentum of the particle in 2+1 dimensions. The canonical quantizationis also considered in this case.
