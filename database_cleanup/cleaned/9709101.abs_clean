We find the exact non-perturbative expression for a simple Wilson loop ofarbitrary shape for U(N) and SU(N) Euclidean or Minkowskian two-dimensionalYang-Mills theory regulated by the Wu-Mandelstam-Leibbrandt gauge prescription.The result differs from the standard pure exponential area-law of YM_2, butstill exhibits confinement as well as invariance under area-preservingdiffeomorphisms and generalized axial gauge transformations. We show that thelarge N limit is NOT a good approximation to the model at finite N and concludethat Wu's N=infinity Bethe-Salpeter equation for QCD_2 should have no boundstate solutions. The main significance of our results derives from theimportance of the Wu-Mandelstam-Leibbrandt prescription in higher-dimensionalperturbative gauge theory.
