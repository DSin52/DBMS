The large N limit of D3-branes is expected to correspond to a superconformalfield theory living on the boundary of the anti-de Sitter space appearing inthe near-horizon geometry. Dualizing the D3-brane to a D-instanton, we showthat this limit is equivalent to a type IIB S-duality. In both cases oneeffectively reaches the near-horizon geometry. This provides an alternativeapproach to an earlier derivation of the same result that makes use of theproperties of a gravitational wave instead of the D-instanton.
