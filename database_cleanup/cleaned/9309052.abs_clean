A new linear system is constructed for Poincar\'e supergravities in twodimensions. In contrast to previous results, which were based on the conformalgauge, this linear system involves the topological world sheet degrees offreedom (the Beltrami and super-Beltrami differentials). The associatedspectral parameter likewise depends on these and is itself subject to a pair ofdifferential equations, whose integrability condition yields one of theequations of motion. These results suggest the existence of an extension of theGeroch group mixing propagating and topological degrees of freedom on the worldsheet. We also develop a chiral tensor formalism for arbitrary Beltramidifferentials, in which the factorization of $2d$ diffeomorphisms is alwaysmanifest.
