Families of Bases of Singular VectorsComments: 15 pages, no figures, posted by Pavel Etingof by the author's request

The quasiclassical asymptotics of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation withvalues in the tensor product of sl(2)- representations are considered. Thefirst term of asymptotics is an eigenvector of a system of commuting operators.We show that the norm of this vector with respect to the Shapovalov form isequal to the determinant of the matrix of second derivatives of a suitablefunction. This formula is an analog of the Gaudin and Korepin formulae for thenorm of the Bethe vectors. We show that the eigenvectors form a basis undercertain conditions.
