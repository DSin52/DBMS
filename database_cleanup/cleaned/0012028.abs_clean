Quantum gravity arguments and the entropy bound for effective field theoriesproposed in PRL 82, 4971 (1999) lead to consider two correlated scales whichparametrize departures from relativistic quantum field theory at low and highenergies. A simple estimate of their possible phenomenological implicationsleads to identify a scale of around 100 TeV as an upper limit on the domain ofvalidity of a quantum field theory description of Nature. This fact agrees withrecent theoretical developments in large extra dimensions. Phenomenologicalconsequences in the beta-decay spectrum and cosmic ray physics associated topossible Lorentz invariance violations induced by the infrared scale arediscussed. It is also suggested that this scale might produce new unexpectedeffects at the quantum level.
