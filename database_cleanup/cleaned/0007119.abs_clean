We investigate the Laplacian Abelian gauge on the sphere S^4 in thebackground of a single `t Hooft instanton. To this end we solve the eigenvalueproblem of the covariant Laplace operator in the adjoint representation. Theground state wave function serves as an auxiliary Higgs field. We find that theground state is always degenerate and has nodes. Upon diagonalisation, thesezeros induce toplogical defects in the gauge potentials. The nature of thedefects crucially depends on the order of the zeros. For first-order zeros oneobtains magnetic monopoles. The generic defects, however, arise from zeros ofsecond order and are pointlike. Their topological invariant is the Hopf indexS^3 -> S^2. These findings are corroborated by an analysis of the Laplaciangauge in the fundamental representation where similar defects occur. Possibleimplications for the confinement scenario are discussed.
