We propose a new nonrelativistic Chern-Simons theory based on a simplemodification of the standard Lagrangian. This admits asymptoticallynonvanishing field configurations and is applicable to the description ofsystems of repulsive bosons. The new model supports topological vortices andhas a self-dual limit, both in the pure Chern-Simons and in the mixedChern-Simons-Maxwell cases. The analysis is based on a new formulation of theChern-Simons theories as constrained Hamiltonian systems.
