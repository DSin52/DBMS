Title: Gauging the Central Charge

Authors: N. Dragon, U. Theis

Comments: 10 pages, LaTeX, uses AMS-LaTeX. Ansatz for constraints on L changed,

reference addedWe gauge the central charge of the N=2 supersymmetry algebra in rigidsuperspace. The Fayet Sohnius hypermultiplet with gauged central chargecoincides on-shell with N=2 supersymmetric electrodynamics. The gauge couplingsof the vector-tensor multiplet turn out to be nonpolynomial.
