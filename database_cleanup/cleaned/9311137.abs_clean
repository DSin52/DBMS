Models and Topological Field Theory,'' eds. L. Baulieu et al., Cargese, May'93, (Plenum Press, New York, 1995), pp. 59-70We present results for the BRST cohomology of $\cW[\bfg]$ minimal modelscoupled to $\cW[\bfg]$ gravity, as well as scalar fields coupled to $\cW[\bfg]$gravity. In the latter case we explore an intricate relation to the (twisted)$\bfg$ cohomology of a product of two twisted Fock modules.
