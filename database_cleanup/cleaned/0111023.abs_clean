Title: The energy states of quantum dots through the variational method and SQM

Authors: Elso Drigo Filho and Regina Maria Ricotta

Comments: Talk given at the VII International Wigner Symposium, University of

Maryland, College Park, USA, August 2001The Variational Method is applied within the context of SupersymmetricQuantum Mechanics to provide information about the energy states of ahydrogenic donor in a quantum dot.
