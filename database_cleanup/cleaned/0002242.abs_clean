We propose a universal expression for the moduli metric of a class of four-and five-dimensional black holes which preserve at least four supersymmetries.These include the black holes that are associated with various intersectingbranes in ten and eleven dimensions, the electrically charged black holes ofN=2 D=5 and N=2 D=4 supergravities with any number of vector multiplets, anddyonic black holes of N=2 D=4 supergravity. The moduli metric of electricallycharged N=2 D=4 black holes coupled to any number of vector multiplets isexplicitly computed. We also investigate the superconformal symmetries of theblack hole moduli spaces for small black hole separations.
