The quantum and classical aspects of a deformed $c=1$ matrix model proposed byJevicki and Yoneya are studied. String equations are formulated in theframework of Toda lattice hierarchy. The Whittaker functions now play the roleof generalized Airy functions in $c<1$ strings. This matrix model has twodistinct parameters. Identification of the string coupling constant is therebynot unique, and leads to several different perturbative interpretations of thismodel as a string theory. Two such possible interpretations are examined. Inboth cases, the classical limit of the string equations, which turns out togive a formal solution of Polchinski's scattering equations, shows that theclassical scattering amplitudes of massless tachyons are insensitive todeformations of the parameters in the matrix model.
