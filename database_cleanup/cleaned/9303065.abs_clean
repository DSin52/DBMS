The partition function corresponding to the "polytopic" action, a new actionfor the gravitational interaction which we have proposed recently, is computedin the simplest two-dimensional geometries of genus zero and one. Thefunctional integral over the Liouville field is approximated by an ordinaryintegral over the constant zero mode. We study the dependence on both thecoupling constant and the cosmological constant, and compare with recentscaling results in standard 2D quantum gravity.
