Title: Diffeomorphism Invariant Theories and Vector Supersymmetry

Authors: Olivier Piguet

Comments: 9 pages, LaTex. Talk given at the International Conference

"Quantization, Gauge Theory, and Strings" dedicated to the memory ofProfessor Efim Fradkin, Moscow, 2000Einstein gravity in the Palatini first order formalism is shown to possess avector supersymmetry of the type encountered in the topological gauge theories.A peculiar feature of the gravitationel theory is the link of this vectorsupersymmetry with the field equation of motion of the Faddeev-Popov ghostassociated to diffeomorphism invariance.
