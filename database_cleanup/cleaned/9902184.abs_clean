We consider quantum \cal{N} = 4 super Yang-Mills theory interacting in acovariant way with \cal{N} = 4 conformal supergravity. The induced large Neffective action for such a theory is calculated on a dilaton-gravitationalbackground using the conformal anomaly found via AdS/CFT correspondence.Considering such an effective action as a quantum correction to the classicalgravity action we study quantum cosmology. In particular, the effect fromdilaton to the scale factor (which without dilaton corresponds to theinflationary universe) is investigated. It is shown that, dependent on theinitial conditions for the dilaton, the dilaton may slow down, or accelerate,the inflation process. At late times, the dilaton is decaying exponentially.
