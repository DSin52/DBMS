For general compact K\"ahler manifolds it is shown that both Toeplitzquantization and geometric quantization lead to a well-defined (by operatornorm estimates) classical limit. This generalizes earlier results of theauthors and Klimek and Lesniewski obtained for the torus and higher genusRiemann surfaces, respectively. We thereby arrive at an approximation of thePoisson algebra by a sequence of finite-dimensional matrix algebras $gl(N)$,$N\to\infty$.
