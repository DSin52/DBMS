We consider a general formalism for treating a Hamiltonian (canonical) fieldtheory with a spatial boundary. In this formalism essentially all functionalsare differentiable from the very beginning and hence no improvement terms areneeded. We introduce a new Poisson bracket which differs from the usual``bulk'' Poisson bracket with a boundary term and show that the Jacobi identityis satisfied. The result is geometrized on an abstract world volume manifold.The method is suitable for studying systems with a spatial edge like the onesoften considered in Chern-Simons theory and General Relativity. Finally, wediscuss how the boundary terms may be related to the time ordering whenquantizing.
