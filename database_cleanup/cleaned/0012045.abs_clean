Title: D-branes in group manifolds and flux stabilization

Authors: Christoph Schweigert

Comments: 6 pages. Invited talk at the 9th Marcel Grossmann meeting, Rome, July

2000We consider D-branes in group manifolds, from the point of view of openstrings and using the Born-Infeld action on the brane worldvolume. D-branescorrespond to certain integral (twined) conjugacy classes. We explain theintegrality condition on the conjugacy classes in both approaches. In theBorn-Infeld description, the D-brane worldvolume is stabilized againstshrinking by a subtle interplay of quantized U(1) fluxes and the non-trivialityof the B-field.
