It is argued that the sphaleron solutions appearing in theEinstein-Yang-Mills theory are important in the transition processes atextremely high energies. Namely, when the energy exceeds the sphaleron mass,the existence of these solutions ensures constructive interference on the setof the overbarrier transition histories interpolating between distincttopological sectors of the theory. This has to lead to an enhancement of thetransition rate and the related non-conservation of the fermion number.
