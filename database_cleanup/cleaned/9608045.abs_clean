We determine the most general form of the antisymmetric $H$-field tensorderived from a purely time-dependent potential that is admitted by all possiblespatially homogeneous cosmological models in 3+1-dimensional low-energy bosonicstring theory. The maximum number of components of the $H$ field that are leftarbitrary is found for each homogeneous cosmology defined by the Bianchi groupclassification. The relative generality of these string cosmologies is found bycounting the number of independent pieces of Cauchy data needed to specify thegeneral solution of Einstein's equations. The hierarchy of generality differssignificantly from that characteristic of vacuum and perfect-fluid cosmologies.The degree of generality of homogeneous string cosmologies is compared to thatof the generic inhomogenous solutions of the string field equations.
