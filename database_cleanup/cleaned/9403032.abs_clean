The null vectors of an arbitrary highest weight representation of the $WA_2$algebra are constructed. Using an extension of the enveloping algebra byallowing complex powers of one of the generators, analysed by Kent for theVirasoro theory, we generate all the singular vectors indicated by the Kacdeterminant. We prove that the singular vectors with given weights are uniqueup to normalisation and consider the case when $W_0$ is not diagonalisableamong the singular vectors.
