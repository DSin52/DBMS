We study universality properties of the Weingarten hyper-cubic randomsurfaces. Since a long time ago the model with a local restriction forbiddingsurface self-bendings has been thought to be in a different universality classfrom the unrestricted model defined on the full set of surfaces. We show thatboth models in fact belong to the same universality class with the entropyexponent gamma = 1/2 and differ by finite size effects which are much morepronounced in the restricted model.
