We study symmetry breaking in $Z_2$ symmetric large $N$ matrix models. In theplanar approximation for both the symmetric double-well $\phi^4$ model and thesymmetric Penner model, we find there is an infinite family of broken symmetrysolutions characterized by different sets of recursion coefficients $R_n$ and$S_n$ that all lead to identical free energies and eigenvalue densities. Thesesolutions can be parameterized by an arbitrary angle $\theta(x)$, for eachvalue of $x = n/N < 1$. In the double scaling limit, this class reduces to asmaller family of solutions with distinct free energies already at the toruslevel. For the double-well $\phi^4$ theory the double scaling string equationsare parameterized by a conserved angular momentum parameter in the range $0 \lel < \infty$ and a single arbitrary $U(1)$ phase angle.
