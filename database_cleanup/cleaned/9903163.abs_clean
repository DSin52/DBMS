We derive a $U$-duality invariant formula for the degeneracies of BPSmultiplets in a D1-D5 system for toroidal compactification of the type IIstring. The elliptic genus for this system vanishes, but it is found that BPSstates can nevertheless be counted using a certain topological partitionfunction involving two insertions of the fermion number operator. This ispossible due to four extra toroidal U(1) symmetries arising from a Wignercontraction of a large $\CN=4$ algebra $\CA_{\kappa,\kappa'}$ for $\kappa' \to\infty$. We also compare the answer with a counting formula derived fromsupergravity on $AdS_3\times S^3 \times T^4$ and find agreement within theexpected range of validity.
