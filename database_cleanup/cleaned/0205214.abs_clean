Noncommutative Yang-Mills theories are sensitive to the choice of therepresentation that enters in the gauge kinetic term. We constrain thisambiguity by considering grand unified theories. We find that at first order inthe noncommutativity parameter \theta, SU(5) is not truly a unified theory,while SO(10) has a unique noncommutative generalization. In view of theseresults we discuss the noncommutative SM theory that is compatible with SO(10)GUT and find that there are no modifications to the SM gauge kinetic term atlowest order in \theta.We study in detail the reality, hermiticity and C,P,T properties of theSeiberg-Witten map and of the resulting effective actions expanded in ordinaryfields. We find that in models of GUTs (or compatible with GUTs) right-handedfermions and left-handed ones appear with opposite Seiberg-Witten map.
