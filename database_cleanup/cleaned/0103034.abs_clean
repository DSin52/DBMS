Title: Gravity as the Spin-2 Quantum Gauge Theory

Authors: M. Wellmann

Comments: 80 pages, PhD Thesis

This work deals with the theory of a quantized spin-2 field in the frameworkof causal perturbation theory. It is divided into two parts. In the first partwe analyze the gauge structure of a massless self-interacting quantum tensorfield. We look at this theory from a pure field theoretical point of viewwithout assuming any geometrical aspect from general relativity. To first orderin the perturbation expansion of the $S$-matrix we derive necessary andsufficient conditions for such a theory to be gauge invariant, by which we meanthat the gauge variation of the self-coupling with respect to the gauge chargeoperator $Q$ is a divergence in the sense of vector analysis. The most generaltrilinear self-coupling of the graviton field turns out to be the one derivedfrom the Einstein-Hilbert action plus coboundaries and divergences.In the second part of this work (sect.9) we consider a massive scalar fieldcoupled to gravity. We are interested in the long range behaviour of thistheory. Radiative corrections for two particle scattering are investigated inthe adiabatic limit, where the cutoff of the interaction at infinity isremoved. We compute the differential cross section for graviton bremsstrahlungin which one of the scattered particles emits a graviton of low energy. It isshown that such processes are logarithmically divergent in the adiabatic limit.Furthermore we show that the differential cross section for two particlescattering with a graviton self-energy insertion is finite in the adiabaticlimit while for matter self-energy it is logarithmically divergent, too.
