It was recently pointed out that the physics of a single discretegravitational extra dimension exhibits a peculiar UV/IR connection relating theUV scale to the radius of the effective extra dimension. Here we note that thisnon-locality is a manifestation of holography, encoding the correct scaling ofthe number of fundamental degrees of freedom of the UV theory. This in turnrelates the Wilsonian RG flow in the UV theory to the effective gravitationaldynamics in the extra dimension. The relevant holographic c-function isdetermined by the expression for the holographic bound. Holography in thiscontext is a result of the requirements of unitarity and diffeomorphisminvariance. We comment on the relevance of this observation for thecosmological constant problem.
