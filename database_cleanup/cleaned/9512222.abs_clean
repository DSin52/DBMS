A sequence of zero-temperature black-hole spacetimes with angular momentumand electric and magnetic charges is shown to exist in gauged $N=2$supergravity. Stability of a subset of these spacetimes is demonstrated bysaturation of the Bogomol'nyi bound arising from the supersymmetry algebra. Themass of the resulting solitonic black holes is given in terms of thecosmological constant and the angular momentum. We conjecture that at thequantum level these solitons are dyons with angular momentum determined by theelectric and magnetic charges.
