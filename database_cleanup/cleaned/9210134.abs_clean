The group theoretic method is extended to include fields with a backgroundcharge. This formalism is used to compute the tree level scattering for $W_3$strings. The scattering amplitudes involve Ising model correlation functions. Adetailed study of the four tachyon amplitude shows that the $W_3$ string mustpossess additional states in its spectrum associated with intercept $1/2$ andthe energy operator of the Ising model.
