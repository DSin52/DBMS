Title: Classical differential geometry and integrability of systems of

hydrodynamic typeComments: 12 pages.  To be published in

analytic and geometric methods to nonlinear differential equations, 14-19July 1992, Exeter, UK)Remarkable parallelism between the theory ofintegrable systems of first-order quasilinear PDE and some old results inprojective and affine differential geometry of conjugate nets, Laplaceequations, their Bianchi-Baecklund transformations is exposed.These results were recently applied by I.M.Krichever andB.A.Dubrovin to prove integrability of some models intopological field theories. Within the geometric framework wederive some new integrable (in a sense to be discussed)generalizations describing N-wave resonant interactions.
