Title: Two-dimensional gravity with an invariant energy scale

Authors: S. Mignemi

Comments: 6 pages, LaTeX; added some comments and new references

We investigate the gauging of a two-dimensional deformation of the Poincarealgebra, which accounts for the existence of an invariant energy scale. Themodel describes 2D dilaton gravity with torsion. We obtain explicit solutionsof the field equations and discuss their physical properties.
