I discuss D0-brane quantum mechanics as a nonperturbative formulation ofstring theory, in particular the relation between theBanks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind matrix model, the Maldacena conjecture forD0-branes, and type IIA/M-theory duality. Some features of the quantummechanics of D0-branes are also discussed. Lecture presented at theNishinomiya-Yukawa Memorial Symposium, Nov. 1998.
