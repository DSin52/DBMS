We present Poincare invariant domain wall (``3-brane'') solutions to some5-dimensional effective theories which can arise naturally in string theory. Inparticular, we find theories where Poincare invariant solutions exist forarbitrary values of the brane tension, for certain restricted forms of the bulkinteractions. We describe examples in string theory where it would be naturalfor the quantum corrections to the tension of the brane (arising from quantumfluctuations of modes with support on the brane) to maintain the required formof the action. In such cases, the Poincare invariant solutions persist in thepresence of these quantum corrections to the brane tension, so that no 4dcosmological constant is generated by these modes.
