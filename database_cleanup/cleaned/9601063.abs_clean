Quantum Field Theory (September 1995, Zvenigorod, Russia)Quantum mechanics of Hamiltonian (non-dissipative) systems uses Lie algebraand analytic group (Lie group). In order to describe non-Hamiltonian(dissipative) systems in quantum theory we need to use non-Lie algebra andanalytic quasigroup (loop).The author derives that analog of Lie algebra for quantum non-Hamiltoniansystems is commutant Lie algebra and analog of Lie group for these systems isanalytic commutant associative loop (Valya loop). A commutant Lie algebra isan algebra such that commutant (a subspace which is generated by allcommutators) is a Lie subalgebra. Valya loop is a non-associative loop suchthat the commutant of this loop is associative subloop (group). We prove thata tangent algebra of Valya loop is a commutant Lie algebra. It is shown thatgeneralized Heisenberg-Weyl algebra, suggested by the author to describequantum non-Hamiltonian (dissipative) systems, is a commutant Lie algebra. Asthe other example of commutant Lie algebra, it is considered a generalizedPoisson algebra for differential 1-forms.Note that non-Hamiltonian (dissipative) quantum theory has a broad range ofapplication for non-critical strings in "coupling constant" phase space andbosonic string in non-Riemannian (for example, affine-metric) curved spacewhich are non-Hamiltonian (dissipative) systems.
