Within effective heterotic superstring theory compactified on a six-torus wederive minimum energy (supersymmetric), static, spherically symmetricsolutions, which are manifestly invariant under the target space $O(6,22)$ andthe strong-weak coupling $SL(2)$ duality symmetries with 28 electric and 28magnetic charges subject to one constraint. The class of solutions with aconstant axion corresponds to dyonic configurations subject to two chargeconstraints, with purely electric [or purely magnetic] and dyonicconfigurations preserving ${1\over 2}$ and ${1\over 4}$ of $N=4$ supersymmetry,respectively. General dyonic configurations in this class have a space-time ofextreme Reissner-Nordstr\" om black holes while configurations with moreconstrained charges have a null or a naked singularity.
