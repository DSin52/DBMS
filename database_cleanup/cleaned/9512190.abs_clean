We present a novel way to compute the one-loop ring-improved effectivepotential numerically, which avoids the spurious appearence of complexexpressions and at the same time is free from the renormalization ambiguitiesof the self-consistent approaches, based on the direct application ofSchwinger-Dyson type equations to the masses.
