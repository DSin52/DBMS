We discuss a K3 and torus from view point of "mirror symmetry". We calculatethe periods of the K3 surface and obtain the mirror map, the two-pointcorrelation function, and the prepotential. Then we find there is no instantoncorrection on K3 (also torus), which is expected from view point of Algebraicgeometry.
