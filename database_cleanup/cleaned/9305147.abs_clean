We show generally that in thermal gravity, the one-particle irreducible2-point function depends on the choice of the basic graviton fields. We derivethe relevant properties of a physical graviton self-energy, which isindependent of the parametrization of the graviton field. An explicitexpression for the graviton self-energy at high-temperature is given toone-loop order.
