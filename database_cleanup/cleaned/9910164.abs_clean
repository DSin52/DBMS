We construct the matrix description for a twisted version of the IIA stringtheory on S^1 with fermions antiperiodic around a spatial circle. The result isa 2+1-dimensional U(N) x U(N) nonsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory withfermionic matter transforming in the (N,Nbar). The two U(N)'s are exchanged ifone goes around a twisted circle of the worldvolume. Relations with Type 0theories are explored and we find Type 0 matrix string limits of our gaugetheory. We argue however that most of these results are falsified by theabsence of SUSY nonrenormalization theorems and that the models do not in facthave a sensible Lorentz invariant space time interpretation.
