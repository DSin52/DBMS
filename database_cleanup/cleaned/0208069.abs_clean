We show the existence of fermionic zeromodes in heterotic fivebranebackgrounds. By solving fermionic field equations explicitly, the normalizableand physical zeromodes are obtained. The zeromodes have a non-vanishinggravitino component, and a possible scenario of the gravitino condensation withthe gaugino condensation is suggested.
