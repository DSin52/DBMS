We look at some dynamic geometries produced by scalar fields with both the"right" and the "wrong" sign of the kinetic energy. We start with anisotropichomogeneous universes with closed, open and flat spatial sections. Anon-singular solution to the Einstein field equations representing an openanisotropic universe with the ghost field is found. This universe startscollapsing from $t \to -\infty$ and then expands to $t \to \infty$ withoutencountering singularities on its way. We further generalize these solutions tothose describing inhomogeneous evolution of the ghost fields. Some interestingsolutions with the plane symmetry are discussed. These have a property that thesame line element solves the Einstein field equations in two mirror regions$|t|\geq z$ and $|t|\leq z$, but in one region the solution has the\emph{right} and in the other, the \emph{wrong} signs of the kinetic energy. Weargue, however, that a physical observer can not reach the mirror region in afinite proper time. Self-similar collapse/expansion of these fields are alsobriefly discussed.
