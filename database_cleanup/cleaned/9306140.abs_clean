The finite form of the $N=2$ super-Weyl transformations in the chiral andtwisted-chiral irreducible formulations of the two-dimensional $N=2$ superfieldsupergravity are found in $N=2$ superspace. The super-Weyl anomaly of the $N=2$extended fermionic string theory is computed in terms of the $N=2$ superfields,by using a short time expansion of the $N=2$ chiral heat kernel. The super-Weylinvariant $N=2$ superconformal structure is introduced, and a new definition ofthe $N=2$ super-Riemannian surfaces is proposed.
