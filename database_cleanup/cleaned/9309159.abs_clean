Title: A theory of tensor products for module categories for a vertex operator

algebra, IIComments: 31 pages. To appear in Selecta Mathematica. A reference is updated

This is the second part in a series of papers presenting a theory of tensorproducts for module categories for a vertex operator algebra. In Part I(hep-th/9309076), the notions of $P(z)$- and $Q(z)$-tensor product of twomodules for a vertex operator algebra were introduced and under a certainhypothesis, two constructions of a $Q(z)$-tensor product were given, usingcertain results stated without proof. In Part II, the proofs of those resultsare supplied.
