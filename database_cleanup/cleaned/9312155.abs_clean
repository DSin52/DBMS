We examine the correspondence between the conformal field theory of boundaryoperators and two-dimensional hyperbolic geometry. By consideration of domainboundaries in two-dimensional critical systems, and the invariance of thehyperbolic length, we motivate a reformulation of the basic equation ofconformal covariance. The scale factors gain a new, physical interpretation. Weexhibit a fully factored form for the three-point function. A doubly-infinitediscrete series of central charges with limit c=-2 is discovered. Acorrespondence between the anomalous dimension and the angle of certain
