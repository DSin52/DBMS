correctionsThe vanishing of the cosmological constant and the non-renormali-zationtheorem are verified at two loops by explicit computation using thehyperelliptic language and the newly obtained chiral measure of D'Hoker andPhong. A set of identities is found which is used in the verification of thenon-renormalization theorem and leads to a great simplification of thecalculation of the four-particle amplitude at two loops.
