We consider the loop space representation of multi-matrix models. Explainingthe origin of a time variable through stochastic quantization we make contactwith recent proposals of Ishibashi and Kawai. We demonstrate how collectivefield theory with its loop space interactions generates a field theory ofnon-critical strings.
