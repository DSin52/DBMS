In the framework of communication theory, we analyse the gedanken experimentin which beams of quanta bearing information are flashed towards a black hole.We show that stimulated emission at the horizon provides a correlation betweenincoming and outgoing radiations consisting of bosons. For fermions, themechanism responsible for the correlation is the Fermi exclusion principle.Each one of these mechanisms is responsible for the a partial transfer of theinformation originally coded in the incoming beam to the black--hole radiation.We show that this process is very efficient whenever stimulated emissionoverpowers spontaneous emission (bosons). Thus, black holes are not `ultimatewaste baskets of information'.
