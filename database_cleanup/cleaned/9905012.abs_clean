We consider ``brane-universes'', where matter is confined to four-dimensionalhypersurfaces (three-branes) whereas one extra compact dimension is felt bygravity only. We show that the cosmology of such branes is definitely differentfrom standard cosmology and identify the reasons behind this difference. Wegive a new class of exact solutions with a constant five-dimensional radius andcosmologically evolving brane. We discuss various consequences.
