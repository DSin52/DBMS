Physics; Exactly Solvable and Integrable SystemsInspired by factorized scattering from delta-type impurities in(1+1)-dimensional space-time, we propose and analyse a generalization of theZamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra. Distinguished elements of the new algebra,called reflection and transmission generators, encode the particle-impurityinteractions. We describe in detail the underlying algebraic structure. Therelative Fock representations are explicitly constructed and a generalfactorized scattering theory is developed in this framework.
