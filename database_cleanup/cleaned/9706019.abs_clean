A rectangular Wilson loop with sides parallel to space and time directions isperturbatively evaluated in two light-cone gauge formulations of Yang-Millstheory in 1+1 dimensions, with ``instantaneous'' and ``causal'' interactionsbetween static quarks. In the instantaneous formulation we get Abelian-likeexponentiation of the area in terms of $C_F$. In the ``causal'' formulation theloop depends not only on the area, but also on the dimensionless ratio $\beta ={L \over T}$, $2L$ and $2T$ being the lengths of the rectangular sides. Besidesit also exhibits dependence on $C_A$. In the limit $T \to \infty$ the area lawis recovered, but dependence on $C_A$ survives. Consequences of these resultsare pointed out.
