The problem of information loss is considered under the assumption that theprocess of black hole evaporation terminates in the decay of the black holeinterior into a baby universe. We show that such theories can be decomposedinto superselection sectors labeled by eigenvalues of the third-quantized babyuniverse field operator, and that scattering is unitary within eachsuperselection sector. This result relies crucially on the quantum-mechanicalvariability of the decay time. It is further argued that the decay rate in theblack hole rest frame is necessarily proportional to $e^{-S_{tot}}$, where$S_{tot}$ is the total entropy produced during the evaporation process,entailing a very long-lived remnant.
