We carry out a general analysis of the representations of the superconformalalgebras OSp(8/4,R) and OSp(8*/2N) in terms of harmonic superspace. We presenta construction of their highest-weight UIR's by multiplication of the differenttypes of massless conformal superfields ("supersingletons"). Particularattention is paid to the so-called "short multiplets". Representationsundergoing shortening have "protected dimension" and may correspond to BPSstates in the dual supergravity theory in anti-de Sitter space. These resultsare relevant for the classification of multitrace operators in boundaryconformally invariant theories as well as for the classification of AdS blackholes preserving different fractions of supersymmetry.
