We investigate on the plane the axial anomaly for euclidean Dirac fermions inthe presence of a background Aharonov--Bohm gauge potential. The nonperturbative analysis depends on the self--adjoint extensions of the Diracoperator and the result is shown to be influenced by the actual way ofunderstanding the local axial current. The role of the quantum mechanicalparameters involved in the expression for the axial anomaly is discussed. Aderivation of the effective action by means of the stereographic projection isalso considered.
