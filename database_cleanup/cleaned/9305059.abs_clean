The bihamiltonian structure of the N=2 Supersymmetric Boussinesq equation isfound. It is not reduced to the corresponding classical structure and hence itdescribes the pure supersymmetric effect. For the supersymmetric Boussinesqequation which contains the classical partner the Lax pair is given explicitly.Thus we prove the integrability of the equation.
