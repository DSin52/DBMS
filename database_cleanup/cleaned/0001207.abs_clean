I consider the implications for brane-world scenarios of the rather robustquantum-gravity expectation that there should be a quantum minimum limit on theuncertainty of all physical length scales. In order to illustrate the possiblesignificance of this issue, I observe that, according to a plausible estimate,the quantum limit on the length scales that characterize the bulk geometrycould affect severely the phenomenology of a recently-proposed brane-worldscenario.
