We analyze the quantum cosmology of one--loop string effective models whichexhibit an $O(d,d)$ symmetry. It is shown that due to the large symmetry ofthese models the Wheeler--de Witt equation can completely be solved. As aresult, we find a basis of solutions with well defined transformationproperties under $O(d,d)$ and under scale factor duality in particular. Thegeneral results are explicitly applied to 2--dimensional target spaces whilesome aspects of higher dimensional cases are also discussed. Moreover, asemiclassical wave function for the 2-dimensional black hole is constructed asa superposition of our basis.
