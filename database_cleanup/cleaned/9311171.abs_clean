Invent. MathA new approach to integrability of affine Toda field theories and closelyrelated to them KdV hierarchies is proposed. The flows of a hierarchy areexplicitly identified with infinitesimal action of the principal abeliansubalgebra of the nilpotent part of the corresponding affine algebra on ahomogeneous space.This is an extended version of the paper "Generalized KdV flows and nilpotentsubgroups of affine Kac-Moody groups"; it has been accepted for publication inInventiones Mathematicae.
