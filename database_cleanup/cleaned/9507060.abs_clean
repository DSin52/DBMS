We present a string theory that reproduces the large-$N$ expansion of twodimensional Yang-Mills gauge theory on arbitrary surfaces. First, a new classof topological sigma models is introduced, with path integrals localized to themoduli space of harmonic maps. The Lagrangian of these harmonic topologicalsigma models is of fourth order in worldsheet derivatives. Then we gaugeworldsheet diffeomorphisms by introducing the induced worldsheet metric. Thisleads to a topological string theory, whose Lagrangian coincides in the bosesector with the rigid string Lagrangian discussed some time ago by Polyakov andothers as a candidate for QCD string theory. The path integral of thistopological rigid string theory is localized to the moduli spaces ofminimal-area maps, and calculates their Euler numbers. The dependence of thelarge-$N$ QCD partition functions on the target area emerges from measuring thevolume of the moduli spaces, and can be reproduced by adding a Nambu-Goto term(improved by fermionic terms) to the Lagrangian of the topological rigidstring.
