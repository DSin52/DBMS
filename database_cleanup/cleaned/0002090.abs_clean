We study BPS Dirac monopole in U(1) gauge theory on non-commutativespacetime. The corresponding brane configuration is obtained in the equivalentordinary gauge theory through the map proposed by Seiberg and Witten. Thisconfiguration coincides exactly with a tilted D-string as predicted. This studyprovides an interesting check of the equivalence of the non-commutative andordinary gauge theories.
