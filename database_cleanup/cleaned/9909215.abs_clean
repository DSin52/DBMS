We consider systems of Dp branes in the presence of a nonzero B field. Westudy the corresponding supergravity solutions in the limit where the branesworldvolume theories decouple from gravity. These provide dual descriptions oflarge N noncommutative field theories. We analyse the phase structure of thetheories and the validity of the different description. We provide evidencethat in the presence of a nonzero B field the worldvolume theory of D6 branesdecouples from gravity. We analyse the systems of M5 branes and NS5 branes inthe presence of a nonzero C field and nonzero RR fields, respectively. Finally,we study the Wilson loops (surfaces) using the dual descriptions.
