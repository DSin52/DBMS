Title: Higher Derivatives and Canonical Formalism

Comments: 7 pages, LaTex.

A canonical formalism for higher-derivative theories is presented on thebasis of Dirac's method for constrained systems. It is shown that thisformalism shares a path integral expression with Ostrogradski's canonicalformalism.
