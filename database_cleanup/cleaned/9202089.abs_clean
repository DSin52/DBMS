We consider the correlation functions of the tachyon vertex operator of thesuper Liouville theory coupled to matter fields in the super Coulomb gasformulation, on world sheets with spherical topology. After integrating overthe zero mode and assuming that the $s$ parameter takes an integer value, wesubsequently continue it to an arbitrary real number and compute thecorrelators in a closed form. We also included an arbitrary number of screeningcharges and, as a result, after renormalizing them, as well as the externallegs and the cosmological constant, the form of the final amplitudes do notmodify. The result is remarkably parallel to the bosonic case. Forcompleteness, we discussed the calculation of bosonic correlators includingarbitrary screening charges.
