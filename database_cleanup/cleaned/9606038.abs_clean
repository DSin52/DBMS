Title: Mean Field Theory for Fermion-based U(2) Anyons

Comments: 18 pages, 4 figures, macros included

The energy density is computed for a U(2) Chern-Simons theory coupled to anon-relativistic fermion field (a theory of ``non-Abelian anyons'') under theassumptions of uniform charge and matter density. When the matter field is aspinless fermion, we find that this energy is independent of the twoChern-Simons coupling constants and is minimized when the non-Abelian chargedensity is zero. This suggests that there is no spontaneous breaking of theSU(2) subgroup of the symmetry, at least in this mean-field approximation. Forspin-1/2 fermions, we find self-consistent mean-field states with a smallnon-Abelian charge density, which vanishes as the theory of free fermions isapproached.
