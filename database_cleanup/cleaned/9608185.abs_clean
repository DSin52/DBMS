Title: The Moduli Space of BPS Monopoles

Comments: LaTex, 14 pagees, To be appear in proceedings for Quark-96, Russia

We review a progress in our understanding of the moduli space for anarbitrary number of BPS monopoles in a gauge theory with a group $G$ of rank$r$ that is maximally broken to $U(1)^r$. The derivation of the moduli spacemetric has been obtained from studying the low energy dynamics ofwell-separated dyons.
