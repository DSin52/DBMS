An algebraic program of computation and characterization of higher loop BRSTanomalies is presented. We propose a procedure for disentangling a genuine{\itlocal} higher loop anomaly from the quantum dressings of lower loop anomalies.For such higher loop anomalies we derive a local consistency condition, whichis the generalisation of the Wess-Zumino condition for the one-loop anomaly.The development is presented in the framework of the field-antifield formalism,making use of a nonlocal regularization method. The theoretical construction isexemplified by explicitly computing the two-loop anomaly of chiral $W_3$gravity. We also give, for the first time, an explicit check of the localtwo--loop consistency condition that is associated with this anomaly.
