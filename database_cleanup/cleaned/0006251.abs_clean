We consider spherically symmetric higher-dimensional solutions of Einstein'sequations with a bulk cosmological constant and n transverse dimensions. Incontrast to the case of one or two extra dimensions we find no solutions thatlocalize gravity when $n\geq 3$, for strictly local topological defects. Wediscuss global topological defects that lead to the localization of gravity andestimate the corrections to Newton's law. We show that the introduction of abulk ``hedgehog'' magnetic field leads to a regular geometry and localizesgravity on the 3-brane with either a positive, zero or negative bulkcosmological constant. The corrections to Newton's law on the 3-brane areparametrically the same as for the case of one transverse dimension.
