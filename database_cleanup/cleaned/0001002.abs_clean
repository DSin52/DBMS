We point out that massive gauged supergravity potentials, for example thosearising due to the massive breathing mode of sphere reductions in M-theory orstring theory, allow for supersymmetric (static) domain wall solutions whichare a hybrid of a Randall-Sundrum domain wall on one side, and a dilatonicdomain wall with a run-away dilaton on the other side. On the anti-de Sitter(AdS) side, these walls have a repulsive gravity with an asymptotic regioncorresponding to the Cauchy horizon, while on the other side the runawaydilaton approaches the weak coupling regime and a non-singular attractivegravity, with the asymptotic region corresponding to the boundary of spacetime.We contrast these results with the situation for gauged supergravity potentialsfor massless scalar modes, whose supersymmetric AdS extrema are genericallymaxima, and there the asymptotic regime transverse to the wall corresponds tothe boundary of the AdS spacetime. We also comment on the possibility that themassive breathing mode may, in the case of fundamental domain-wall sources,stabilize such walls via a Goldberger-Wise mechanism.
