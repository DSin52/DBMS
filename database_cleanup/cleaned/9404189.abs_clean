Title: Multicritical Behavior of $c=1$ Matrix Model

Authors: H. Itoyama and M. Koike

Comments: 8 pages

We discuss multicritical behavior of $c=1$ matrix model, extending the recentwork of ref. \cite{CIO} on a nonperturbative completion of the density ofstates function. For the odd orders of multicriticality, we are able todetermine the higher genus contributions and a nonperturbative completion fromthe WKB wave function of the multicritical periodic potential.  The expressionfor the contributions as a function of the scaled chemical potential is foundto be the same as the one at the lowest critical point. We point out a strangescaling behavior.
