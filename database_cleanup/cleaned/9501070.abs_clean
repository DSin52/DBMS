We examine here discontinuities in the metric, the antisymmetric tensor and thedilaton field which are allowed by conformal invariance. We find that thesurfaces of discontinuity must necessarily be null surfaces and shock andimpulsive waves are both allowed. We employ our results for the case ofcolliding plane gravitational waves and we discuss the SL(2,R)XSU(2)/RXR WZWmodel in the present prespective. In particular, the singularities encounteredin this model may be viewed as the result of the mutual focusing of thecolliding waves.
