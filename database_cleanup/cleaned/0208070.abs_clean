We analyze the spectrum of the N=(2,2) supersymmetric Landau-Ginzburg theoryin two dimensions with superpotential W=X^{n+2}-lambda X^2. We find the fullBPS spectrum of this theory by exploiting the direct connection between the UVand IR limits of the theory. The computation utilizes results from thePicard-Lefschetz theory of singularities and its extension to boundarysingularities. The additional fact that this theory is integrable requires thatthe BPS states do not close under scattering. This observation fixes the massesof non-BPS states as well.
