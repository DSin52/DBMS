The boundary states for a certain class of WZW models are determined. Themodels include all modular invariants that are associated to a symmetry of theunextended Dynkin diagram. Explicit formulae for the boundary statecoefficients are given in each case, and a number of properties of thecorresponding NIM-reps are derived.
