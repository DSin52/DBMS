Invariance under finite renormalization group (RG) transformations is used tostructure the invariant charge in models with one coupling in the 4 lowestorders of perturbation theory. In every order there starts a RG-invariant,which is uniquely continued to higher orders. Whereas in massless models theRG-invariants are power series in logarithms, there is no such requirement in amassive model. Only, when one applies the Callan-Symanzik (CS) equation of therespective theories, the high-energy behavior of the RG-invariants isrestricted. In models, where the CS-equation has the same form as theRG-equation, the massless limit is reached smoothly, i.e. the beta-functionsare constants in the asymptotic limit and the RG-functions starting the newinvariant tend to logarithms. On the other hand in the spontaneously brokenmodels with fermions the CS-equation contains a beta-function of a physicalmass. As a consequence the beta-functions depend on the normalization pointalso in the asymptotic region and a mass independent limit does not existanymore.
