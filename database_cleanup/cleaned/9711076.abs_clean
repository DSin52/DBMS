I review my work together with Piljin Yi on the spectrum of BPS-saturatedstates in N = 2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. In an M-theory description,such states are realized as certain two-brane configurations. We first show howthe central charge of the N = 2 algebra arises from the two-form central chargeof the eleven-dimensional supersymmetry algebra, and derive the condition for atwo-brane configuration to be BPS-saturated. We then discuss how the topologyof the two-brane determines the type of BPS-multiplet. Finally, we discuss thephenomenon of marginal stability and show how it is related to the mutualnon-locality of states.
