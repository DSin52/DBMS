Title: Green-Schwarz type formulation of D=11 S - invariant superstring and

superparticle actionsAuthors: A.A. Deriglazov and D.M. Gitman

Comments: Revised version, in particular, discussion of SO(2,9) case is

included. To be published in Int. J. Mod. Phys. AA manifestly Poincare invariant formulations for $SO(1,10)$ and SO(2,9)superstring actions are proposed. The actions are invariant under a localfermionic $\kappa$-symmetry as well as under a number of global symmetries,which turn out to be on-shell realization of the known ``new supersymmetry``S-algebra. Canonical quantization of the theory is performed and relation ofthe quantum state spectrum with that of type IIA Green-Schwarz superstring isdiscussed. Besides, a mechanical model is constructed, which is a zero tensionlimit of the D=11 superstring and which incorporates all essential features ofthe latter. A corresponding action invariant under off-shell closed realizationof the S-algebra is obtained.
