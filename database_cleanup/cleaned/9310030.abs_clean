When the parameter of deformation q is a m-th root of unity, the centre ofU_q(sl(N))$ contains, besides the usual q-deformed Casimirs, a set of newgenerators, which are basically the m-th powers of all the Cartan generators ofU_q(sl(N)). All these central elements are however not independent. In thisletter, generalising the well-known case of U_q(sl(2)), we explicitly writepolynomial relations satisfied by the generators of the centre. Application tothe parametrization of irreducible representations and to fusion rules aresketched.
