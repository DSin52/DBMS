We compute the M theory corrections to the confining linear potential betweena quark and an anti-quark in N=1 Super Yang-Mills theory. We find a constantterm, and a term exponentially small with characteristic length of$\Lambda_{QCD}^{-1}$. The potential in the MQCD setup that corresponds tosoftly broken N=1 SYM is found to have a similar behavior.
