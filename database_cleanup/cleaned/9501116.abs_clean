In this paper we construct the exact representation of the Ising partitionfunction in the form of the $ SL_q(2,R)$-invariant functional integral for thelattice free $(l,q)$-fermion field theory ($l=q=-1$). It is shown that the$(l,q)$-fermionization allows one to re-express the partition function of theeight-vertex model in external field through functional integral withfour-fermion interaction. To construct these representations, we define alattice $(l,q,s)$-deformed Grassmann bispinor field and extend the Berezinintegration rules to this field. At $l=q=-1, s=1$ we obtain the lattice$(l,q)$-fermion field which allows us to fermionize the two-dimensional Isingmodel. We show that the Gaussian integral over $(q,s)$-Grassmann variables isexpressed through the $(q,s)$-deformed Pfaffian which is equal to square rootof the determinant of some matrix at $q=\pm 1, s=\pm 1$.
