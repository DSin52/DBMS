We study matrix models related via the correspondence of Dijkgraaf and Vafato supersymmetric gauge theories with matter in the fundamental. As inflavorless examples, measure factors of the matrix integral reproduceinformation about R-symmetry violation in the field theory. The models, studiedpreviously as models of open strings, exhibit a large-M phase transition as thenumber of flavors is varied. This is the matrix model's manifestation of theend of asymptotic freedom. Using the relation to a quiver gauge theory, weextract the effective glueball superpotential and Seiberg-Witten curve from thematrix model.
