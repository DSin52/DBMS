The divergent part of the one-loop off-shell effective action is computed fora single scalar field coupled to the Ricci curvature of 2D gravity ($c \phiR$), and self interacting by an arbitrary potential term $V(\phi)$. TheVilkovisky-DeWitt effective action is used to compute gauge-fixing independentresults. In our background field/covariant gauge we find that the Liouvilletheory is finite on shell. Off-shell, we find a large class of renormalizablepotentials which include the Liouville potential. We also find that forbackgrounds satisfying $R=0$, the Liouville theory is finite off shell, aswell.
