Title: Recent Developments in String Theory

Comments: 83 pages

The purpose of this short review is to present progresses in string theory inthe recent past. There have been very important developments in ourunderstanding of string dynamics, especially in the nonperturbative aspects. Inthis context, dualities play a cardinal role. The string theory provides adeeper understanding of the physics of special class of black holes from amicroscopical point of view and has resolved several important questions. It isalso recognized that M-theory provides a unified description of the fiveperturbatively consistent string theories. The article covers some of theseaspects and highlights important progress made in string theory.
