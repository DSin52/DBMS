We study string action with multiplet of $\Theta$-terms added, which turnsout to be closely related with the bosonic sector of D=11 superstring action[3,4]. Alternatively, the model can be considered as describing class ofspecial solutions of the membrane. An appropriate set of variables is find, inwhich the light-cone quantization turns out to be possible. It is shown thatanomaly terms in the algebra of the light-cone Poincare generators are absentfor the case D=27.
