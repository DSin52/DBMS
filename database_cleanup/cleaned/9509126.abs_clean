Comments: 8 pages; uses macros tables.tex and amssym.def (version 2.1 or later)

We summarize some recent results obtained in collaboration with J. McCarthyon the spectrum of physical states in $W_3$ gravity coupled to $c=2$ matter. Weshow that the space of physical states, defined as a semi-infinite (or BRST)cohomology of the $W_3$ algebra, carries the structure of a BV-algebra. ThisBV-algebra has a quotient which is isomorphic to the BV-algebra of polyvectorfields on the base affine space of $SL(3,C)$. Details have appeared elsewhere.Symmetries," Istanbul, June 1994, eds.
