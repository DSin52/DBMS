We clarify some ambiguous points in a derivation of duality via braneexchange using M-theory language, and propose a ``proof'' of duality in MQCD.Actually, duality in MQCD is rather trivial and does not need a complicatedproof.The problem is how to interpret it in field theory language. We examine BPSstates in N=2 theory and find the particle correspondence under duality. In theprocess, we also find some exotic particles in N=2 MQCD, and we observe aninteresting phenomenon in type IIA string theory, namely, that fundamentalstrings are converted into D2-branes via the exchange of two NS5-branes. Wealso discuss how we should understand Seiberg's N=1 duality from exact dualityin MQCD.
