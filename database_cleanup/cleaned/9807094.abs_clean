Unlike the extremal Reissner - Nordstr\"{o}m black hole in ordinaryspacetime, the one in anti-de Sitter spacetime is a minimum of action and haszero entropy if quantization is carried out after extremalization. However, ifextremalization is carried out after quantization, then the entropy is aquarter of the area as in the usual case.
