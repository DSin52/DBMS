Title: Two Outcomes for Two Old (Super-)Problems

Authors: S. Deser (Brandeis University)

Comments: Invited contribution to Gol'fand Memorial Volume, M. Shifman, ed.

(World Publishing, 2000). 7 pagesI briefly review the outcomes of two very different old questions -- whereglobal SUSY improves on ordinary QFT -- when they are in turn posed in thelocal, SUGRA, context. The first concerns the unexpectedly powerful role of the"Dirac square root" graded algebra relation $E=Q^2$, originally found in D=4SUSY by Gol'fand and Likhtman, in proving positive energy theorems both inSUGRA and in ordinary gravity theories, where $E$ and $Q$ have very differentboson/fermion loop ultraviolet cancellations in SUSY models. Here the result isthe dimensional gravitational $\kappa^2$ even, as recently shown, in maximalD=11 SUGRA.
