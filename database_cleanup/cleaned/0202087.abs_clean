We establish that the open string star product in the zero momentum sectorcan be described as a continuous tensor product of mutually commuting twodimensional Moyal star products. Let the continuous variable $\kappa \in[~0,\infty)$ parametrize the eigenvalues of the Neumann matrices; then thenoncommutativity parameter is given by $\theta(\kappa) =2\tanh(\pi\kappa/4)$.For each $\kappa$, the Moyal coordinates are a linear combination of evenposition modes, and the Fourier transform of a linear combination of oddposition modes. The commuting coordinate at $\kappa=0$ is identified as themomentum carried by half the string. We discuss the relation to Bars' work, andattempt to write the string field action as a noncommutative field theory.
