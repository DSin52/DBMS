Poland)Comments: LaTex, new references added, minor typos corrected, e-mail

ziemek@ift.uni.wroc.plWe present two different Lax operators for a manifestly N=2 supersymmetricextension of "a=-2" Boussinesq hierarchy . The first is the supersymmetricgeneralization of the Lax operator of the Modified KdV equation. The second isthe generalization of the supersymmetric Lax operator of the N=2 supersymmetrica=-2 KdV system. The gauge transformation of the first Lax operator provide theMiura link between the "small" N=4 supersymmetric conformal algebra and thesupersymmetric $W_{3}$ algebra .
