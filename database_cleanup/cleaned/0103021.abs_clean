We study tachyon condensation on brane-antibrane systems in orbifold theoriesfrom the viewpoint of boundary string field theory. We show that thecondensation of holomorphic tachyon fields generates various fractionalD-branes. The boundary N=2 supersymmetry in the world-sheet theory ensures thisresult exactly. Furthermore, our results are consistent with the twistedRR-charges from detailed calculations of boundary states. We also discuss thegeneration of RR-charges due to holomorphic tachyon fields on multiplebrane-antibrane pairs in flat space.
