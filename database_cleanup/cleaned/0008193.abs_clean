Title: Cosmological predictions from the Misner brane

Comments: 16 pages, RevTex

Within the spirit of five-dimensional gravity in the Randall-Sundrumscenario, in this paper we consider cosmological and gravitational implicationsinduced by forcing the spacetime metric to satisfy a Misner-like symmetry. Wefirst show that in the resulting Misner-brane framework the Friedmann metricfor a radiation dominated flat universe and the Schwarzschild or anti-de Sitterblack holes metrics are exact solutions on the branes, but the model cannotaccommodate any inflationary solution. The horizon and flatness problems canhowever be solved in Misner-brane cosmology by causal and noncausalcommunications through the extra dimension between distant regions which areoutside the horizon. Based on a semiclassical approximation to thepath-integral approach, we have calculated the quantum state of theMisner-brane universe and the quantum perturbations induced on its metric bybrane propagation along the fifth direction. We have then considered testablepredictions from our model. These include a scale-invariant spectrum of densityperturbations whose amplitude can be naturally accommodated to the requiredvalue 10$^{-5}-10^{-6}$, and a power spectrum of CMB anisotropies whoseacoustic peaks are at the same sky angles as those predicted by inflationarymodels, but having much smaller secondary-peak intensities. These predictionsseem to be compatible with COBE and recent Boomerang and Maxima measurements
