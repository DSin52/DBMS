In this letter we present constant solutions to the tetrahedron equationsproposed by Zamolodchikov. In general, from a given solution of the Yang-Baxterequation there are two ways to construct solutions to the tetrahedron equation.There are also other kinds of solutions. We present some two-dimensionalsolutions that were obtained by directly solving the equations using either anupper triangular or Zamolodchikov's ansatz.
