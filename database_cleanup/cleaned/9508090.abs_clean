A general homogeneous two dimensional dilaton gravity model consideredrecently by Lemos and S\` a, is given quantum matter Polyakov corrections andis solved numerically for several static, equilibrium scenarii. Classically thedilaton field ranges the whole real line, whereas in the semi-classical theory,with the usual definition, it is always below a certain critical value at whicha singularity appears. We give solutions for both sub- and super-criticaldilaton field. The pasting together of the spacetime on both sides of asingularity in semi-classical planar general relativity is discussed.
