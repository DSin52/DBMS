Vacuum polarization and particle production effects in classicalelectromagnetic and gravitational backgrounds can be studied by the effectivelagrangian method. Background field configurations for which the effectivelagrangian is zero are special in the sense that the lowest order quantumcorrections vanishes for such configurations. We propose here the conjecturethat there will be neither particle production nor vacuum polarization inclassical field configurations for which all the scalar invariants are zero. Weverify this conjecture, by explicitly evaluating the effective lagrangian, fornon-trivial electromagnetic and gravitational backgrounds withvanishing scalar invariants. The implications of this result are discussed.
