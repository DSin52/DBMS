Title: Non-Gaussian generalizations of Wick's theorems, related to the

Schwinger-Dyson equationComments: 61 pages amslatex. Uses amssym and amssym.def

In this work we present a number of generalizations of Wick's theorems onintegrals with Gaussian weight to a larger class of weights which we callsubgaussian. Examples of subgaussian contractions are that of Kac-Moody orVirasoro type, although the concept of a subgaussian weight does not refer apriori to two-dimensional field theory. The generalization was chosen in such away that the contraction rules become a combinatorical way of solving theSchwinger-Dyson equation. In a still more general setting we prove a relationbetween solutions of the Schwinger-Dyson equation and a map $N$, which in theGaussian case reduces to normal ordering. Furthermore, we give a number ofresults concerning contractions of composite insertions, which do not sufferfrom the Johnson-Low problem of ``commutation'' relations that do not satisfythe Jacobi identity.
