Title: Algebraic Renormalization of the Electroweak Standard Model

Authors: Elisabeth Kraus (Univ. Bonn)

Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX, Talk presented at the DESY Zeuthen Workshop on

Elementary Particle Theory ``Loops and Legs in Gauge Theories'', Rheinsberg,Germany, April 19-24, 1998, to appear in Acta Phys. PolJournal-ref: Acta Phys.Polon. B29 (1998) 2647-2654

The algebraic method of renormalization is applied to the standard model ofelectroweak interactions. We present the most important modifications comparedto theories with simple groups.
