remarks added, misprints corrected)We show how to calculate correlation functions of two matrix models. Ourmethod consists in making full use of the integrable hierarchies and theirreductions, which were shown in previous papers to naturally appear inmulti--matrix models. The second ingredient we use are the $W$--constraints. Infact an explicit solution of the relevant hierarchy, satisfying the$W$--constraints (string equation), underlies the explicit calculation of thecorrelation functions. In the course of our derivation we do not use anycontinuum limit tecnique. This allows us to find many solutions which areinvisible to the latter technique.
