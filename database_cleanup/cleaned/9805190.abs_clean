We present the last missing details of our algorithm for the classificationof reflexive polyhedra in arbitrary dimensions. We also present the results ofan application of this algorithm to the case of three dimensional reflexivepolyhedra. We get 4319 such polyhedra that give rise to K3 surfaces embedded intoric varieties. 16 of these contain all others as subpolyhedra. The 4319polyhedra form a single connected web if we define two polyhedra to beconnected if one of them contains the other.
