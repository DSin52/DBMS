Title: Renormalization of current algebra

Authors: Jouko Mickelsson

Comments: 12pp, talk at the meeting "Generalized symmetries in physics",

Clausthal, July 1993In this talk I want to explain the operator substractions needed torenormalize gauge currents in a second quantized theory. The case of space-timedimensions $3+1$ is considered in detail. In presence of chiral fermions therenormalization effects a modification of the local commutation relations ofthe currents by local Schwinger terms. In $1+1$ dimensions on gets the usualcentral extension (Schwinger term does not depend on background gauge field)whereas in $3+1$ dimensions one gets an anomaly linear in the backgroundpotential. We extend our method to the spatial components of currents. Sincethe bose-fermi interaction hamiltonian is of the form $j^k A_k$ (in thetemporal gauge) we get a new renormalization scheme for the interaction. Theidea is to define a field dependent conjugation for the fermi hamiltonian inthe one-particle space such that after the conjugation the hamiltonian can bequantized just by normal ordering prescription.
