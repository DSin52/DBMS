We study the full unitary matrix models. Introducing a new term $l log U$, lplays the role of the discrete time. On the other hand, the full unitary matrixmodel contains a topological term. In the continuous limit it gives rise to aphase transition at $\theta=\pi$. The ground state is characterize by thediscrete time l. The discrete time l plays like the instanton number.
