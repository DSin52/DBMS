String theory gives rise to various mechanisms to generate primordialinflation, of which ``brane inflation'' is one of the most widely considered.In this scenario, inflation takes place while two branes are approaching eachother, and the modulus field representing the separation between the branesplays the role of the inflaton field. We study the phase space of initialconditions which can lead to a sufficiently long period of cosmologicalinflation, and find that taking into account the possibility of nonvanishinginitial momentum can significantly change the degree of fine tuning of therequired initial conditions.
