We show how to expand the free energy of a matrix model coupled to arbitrarymatter in powers of the matter coupling constant. Concentrating on $\nu$uncoupled Ising models---which have central charge $\nu/2$---we work out theexpansion to sixth order for $\nu$ = 1, 2, and 3. Analyzing the series by theratio method, we exhibit the spin-ordering phase transition. We discuss thelimit $\nu \rightarrow \infty$, which is especially clear in the lowtemperature expansion; we prove that in this limit the dependence of the modelon $\nu$ becomes trivial.
