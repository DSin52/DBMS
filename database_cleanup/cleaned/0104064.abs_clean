We determine the vacuum structure and phases of N=1 theories obtained via amass \mu for the adjoint chiral superfield in N=2, SO(n_c) SQCD. For largenumber of flavors these theories have two groups of vacua. The first exhibitsdynamical breaking of flavor symmetry \USp(2n_f) \to U(n_f) and arises as arelevant deformation of a non-trivial superconformal theory. These are in theconfined phase. The second group, in an IR-free phase with unbroken flavorsymmetry, is produced from a Coulomb branch singularity with Seiberg's dualgauge symmetry. In the large-\mu regime both groups of vacua are well-describedby dual quarks and mesons, and dynamical symmetry breaking in the first groupoccurs via meson condensation. We follow the description of these vacua fromweak to strong coupling and demonstrate a nontrivial agreement between thephases and the number of vacua in the two regimes. We construct thesemiclassical monopole flavor multiplets and argue that their multiplicity isconsistent with the number of N=1 vacua.
