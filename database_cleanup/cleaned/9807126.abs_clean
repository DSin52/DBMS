Title: New Results in Heat-Kernel Asymptotics on Manifolds with Boundary

Comments: 31 pages, plain Tex. Paper prepared for the Fourth Workshop on

Quantum Field Theory under the Influence of External Conditions, Leipzig,September 1998A review is presented of some recent progress in spectral geometry onoperator includes the effect of tangential derivatives; application ofconformal variations and other functorial methods to the evaluation ofheat-kernel coefficients; conditions for strong ellipticity of theboundary-value problem; fourth-order operators on manifolds with boundary;non-local boundary conditions in Euclidean quantum gravity. Many deepdevelopments in physics and mathematics are therefore in sight.
