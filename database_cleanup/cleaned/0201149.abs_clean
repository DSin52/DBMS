We analytically prove that the matter solution of vacuum string field theoryconstructed by Kostelecky and Potting is the matter sliver state. We also givean analytical proof that the ghost solution by Hata and Kawano is the sliverstate in the twisted ghost CFT. It is also proved that the candidate state forthe tachyon proposed by Hata and Kawano can be identified with the stateconstructed by Rastelli, Sen and Zwiebach using CFT. Our proofs are based onthe techniques recently developed by Okuyama.
