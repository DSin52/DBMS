Title: AdS Black Hole in R^2-Gravity

Authors: Sachiko Ogushi

Comments: Talk given at the "Sixth Workshop on Non-Perturbative Quantum

Chromodynamics" 5 - 9 June 2001, Paris, France; 5 pagesWe discuss some properties of higher derivative (HD) bulk gravity withoutRiemann tensor square term. Such a kind of gravity admits Schwarzschild Anti deSitter (SAdS) black hole as exact solution. It is shown that induced branegeometry on such background is Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) radiationdominated Universe. We show that HD terms contributions appear in the Hawkingtemperature, entropy and Hubble parameter via the redefinition of 5-dimensionalgravitational constant and AdS scale parameter. These HD terms do not destroythe AdS-dual description of radiation represented by strongly-coupled CFT.So-called Cardy-Verlinde formula which expresses cosmological entropy as squareroot from other parameters and entropies is also derived in R^2-gravity. Thistalk is based on works with Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov.
