We investigate the additional symmetries of several supersymmetric KPhierarchy, and the Jacobian SKP hierarchy. In all three cases we find that thealgebra of symmetries is isomorphic to the algebra of superdifferentialoperators, or equivalently $\SW_{1+\infty}$. These results seem to suggest thatdespite their realization depending on the dynamics, the additional symmetriesare kinematical in nature.
