We use normal coordinate methods to obtain the expansion with respect tofermionic coordinates of the 11-dimensional supermembrane action in asupergravity background. Likewise, expansions for various branes in otherdimensions can be obtained. These methods allow a systematic and unambiguousexpansion of the vielbein to any order in the fermionic coordinates and avoidthe complications encountered in the gauge completion approach.
