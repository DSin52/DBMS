Odd-dimensional Riemannian spaces that are non-orientable, but have a pinstructure, require the consideration of the twisted adjoint representation ofthe corresponding pin group. It is shown here how the Dirac operator should bemodified, also on even-dimensional spaces, to make it equivariant with respectto the action of that group when the twisted adjoint representation is used inthe definition of the pin structure. An explicit description of a pin structureon a hypersurface, defined by its immersion in a Euclidean space, is used toderive a "Schroedinger" transform of the Dirac operator in that case. This isthen applied to obtain - in a simple manner - the spectrum and eigenfunctionsof the Dirac operator on spheres and real projective spaces.
