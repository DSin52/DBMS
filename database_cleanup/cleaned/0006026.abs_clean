We discuss quantum tunneling between classically BPS saturated solitons intwo-dimensional theories with N=2 supersymmetry and a compact space dimension.Genuine BPS states form shortened multiplets of dimension two. In the models weconsider there are two degenerate shortened multiplets at the classical level,but there is no obstruction to pairing up through quantum tunneling. Thetunneling amplitude in the imaginary time is described by instantons. We findthat the instanton is nothing but the 1/4 BPS saturated ``wall junction,''considered previously in the literature in other contexts. Two central chargesof the superalgebra allow us to calculate the instanton action without findingthe explicit solution (it is checked, though, numerically, that the saturatedsolution does exist). We present a quantum-mechanical interpretation of thesoliton tunneling.
