Authors: Igor Bandos

Comments: 10 pages, LATEX, no figures

A brief introduction to superembedding approach (SEA) in its variant based onthe generalized action principle (GAP) for super-p-branes is given. A role ofharmonic variables for Lorentz group is stressed. A relation of the GAP withcomplete superfield actions is noted. Recent applications in studying ofDirichlet branes (super-Dp-branes) and M-branes are discussed.
