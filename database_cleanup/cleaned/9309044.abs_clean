We consider two dimensional U(N) QCD on the cylinder with a timelike Wilsonline in an arbitrary representation. We show that the theory is equivalent to Nfermions with internal degrees of freedom which interact among themselves witha generalized Sutherland-type interaction. By evaluating the expectation valueof the Wilson line in the original theory we explicitly find the spectrum anddegeneracies of these particle systems.
