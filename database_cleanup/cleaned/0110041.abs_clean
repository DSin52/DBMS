We consider the classification of BPS and non-BPS D-branes in orientifoldmodels. In particular we construct all stable BPS and non-BPS D-branes in theGimon-Polchinski (GP) and Dabholkar-Park-Blum-Zaffaroni (DPBZ) orientifolds anddetermine their stability regions in moduli space as well as decay products. Wefind several kinds of integrally and torsion charged non-BPS D-branes. Certainof these are found to have projective representations of the orientifold$\times$ GSO group on the Chan-Paton factors. It is found that the GPorientifold is not described by equivariant orthogonal K-theory as may havebeen at first expected. Instead a twisted version of this K-theory is expectedto be relevant.
