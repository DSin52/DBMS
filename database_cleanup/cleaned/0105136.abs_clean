We consider a string wrapped many times around a compact circle in space, andlet this string carry a right moving wave which imparts momentum and angularmomentum to the string. The angular momentum causes the strands of the`multiwound' string to separate and cover the surface of a torus. We computethe supergravity solution for this string configuration. We map this solutionby dualities to the D1-D5 system with angular momentum that has been recentlystudied. We discuss how constructing this multiwound string solution may helpus to relate the microscopic and macroscopic pictures of black hole absorption.
