WorkshopThe Yangian symmetry Y(su($n$)) of the Calogero-Sutherland-Moser spin modelis reconsidered. The Yangian generators are constructed from two non-commutingsu($n$)-loop algebras. The latters generate an infinite dimensional symmetryalgebra which is a deformation of the $W_\infty$-algebra. We show that thisdeformed $W_\infty$-algebra contains an infinite number of Yangian subalgebraswith different deformation parameters.
