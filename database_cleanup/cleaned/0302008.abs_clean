Title: Remark About dS/CFT Correspondence

Authors: J.Kluson

Comments: 21 pages, some references added

In this paper we will study some aspects of dS/CFT correspondence. We willfocus on the relation between Witten's non-standard de Sitter inner product andcorrelators in the holographic dual conformal field theory. We will argue thatfrom the definition of Witten's inner product and conjecture that the Hilbertspace of initial states of massive scalar field on $\mathcal{I}^-$ in de Sitterspace corresponds to the Hilbert space of states of Euclidean CFT on$\mathcal{I}^-$, we can obtain CFT correlators in any vacuum state.
