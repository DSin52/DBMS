Title: On N=2 MQCD

Comments: 32 pages. 4 figires. Lecture in the Second Winter School on ``Branes,

Fields And Mathematical Physics" at the APCTP (Feb.9-20, 1998)We review M-theory description of 4d N=2 SQCD. Configurations of M-theoryfivebranes relevant to describe the moduli spaces of the Coulomb and Higgsbranches are studied using the Taub-NUT geometry. Minimal area membranesrelated with the BPS states of N=2 SQCD are given explicitly. They almostsaturate the BPS bounds. The deviation from the bounds is due to their boundarycondition constrained by the fivebrane. The electric-magnetic duality at thebaryonic branch root is also examined from the M-theory viewpoint. In thiscourse, novel concepts such as creation of brane and exchange of branes in TypeII theory are explained in the framework of M-theory.
