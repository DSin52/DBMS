Among the usual constraints of (1,1) supergravity in d=2 the condition ofvanishing bosonic torsion is dropped. Using the inverse supervierbein and thesuperconnection considerably simplifies the formidable computational problems.It allows to solve the constraints for those fields before taking into accountthe (identically fulfilled) Bianchi identities. The relation of arbitraryfunctions in the seminal paper of Howe to supergravity multiplets is clarified.The local supersymmetry transformations remain the same, but, somewhatsurprisingly, the transformations of zweibein and Rarita-Schwinger fielddecouple from those of the superconnection multiplet. A method emergesnaturally, how to construct `non-Einsteinian' supergravity theories withnontrivial curvature and torsion in d=2 which, apart from their intrinsicinterest, may be relevant for models of super black holes and for novelgeneralizations in superstring theories. Several explicit examples of suchmodels are presented, some of which immediately allow a dilatonic formulationfor the bosonic part of the action.
