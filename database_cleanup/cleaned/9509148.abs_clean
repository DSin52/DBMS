This talk is divided into two parts. The first part reviews some of theduality relationships between superstring theories. These relationships areinterpreted as providing evidence for the existence of a unique underlyingfundamental theory. The second part describes my recent work on the SL(2,Z)duality group of the type IIB superstring theory in ten dimensions and itsinterpretation in terms of a possible theory of supermembranes in elevendimensions.
