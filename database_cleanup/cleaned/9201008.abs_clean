The Coulomb gas representations are presented for the ${\rmSU(2)}$$_k$-extended $N$=4 superconformal algebras, incorporating theFeigin-Fuchs representation of the\break ${\rm SU(2)}$$_k$ Kac-Moody algebrawith {\sl arbitrary} level $k$. Then the long-standing problem of identifyingthe whole set of charge-screening operators for the $N$=4 superconformalalgebras is solved and their explicit expressions are given. The method ofachieving a rigorous proof of the $N$=4 Kac determinant formulae following Katoand Matsuda is suggested. The complete proof for them will be given elsewhere.Our results for the screening operators also provide the basis for studying theBRST formalism of the $N$=4 superconformal algebras ${\sl {\grave a}\ la}$Felder.
