Quantum geometry gives a regularization scheme-independent effective action,whoes equation of motion for the conformal mode has a stable de Sitter solutionat the high-energy region where the coupling of the self-interactions of thetraceless mode can be neglected because of the asymptotic freedom. However, thedynamics of the traceless mode suggests that inflation ends at the low-energyregion.
