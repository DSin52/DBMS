We study the dilaton/axion configuration near D-instantons in type IIBsuperstring theory. In the field theory limit, the metric near the instantonsbecomes flat in the string frame as well as in the Einstein frame. In the largeN limit, the string coupling constant becomes zero except near the origin. Thesupersymmetry of this configuration is analyzed. An implication of this resultto the IIB Matrix Model is discussed.
