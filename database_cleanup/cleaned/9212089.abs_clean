We discuss the relationship between target space modular invariance anddiscrete gauge symmetries in four-dimensional orbifold-like strings. First wederive the modular transformation properties of various string vertex operatorsof the massless string fields. Then we find that for supersymmetriccompactifications the action of the duality elements, leaving invariant themulticritical points, corresponds to a combination of finite K\"ahler and gaugetransformations. However, those finite gauge transformations are not elementsof a remnant discrete gauge symmetry. We suggest that, at least in the case ofGepner models corresponding to tensor products of identical minimal models, theduality element leaving invariant the multicritical point corresponds to the${\bf Z}_{k+2}$ symmetry of any of the minimal $N=2$ models appearing in thetensor product.
