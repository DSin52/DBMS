Title: On Domain-wall/QFT dualities in various dimensions

Authors: Eric Bergshoeff and Rein Halbersma

Comments: Talk given by E. Bergshoeff at the International Workshop in Dubna

1999. 12 pages, 1 figureWe investigate domain-wall/quantum field theory correspondences in variousdimensions. We give particular emphasis to the special case of the quantummechanics of 0--branes.
