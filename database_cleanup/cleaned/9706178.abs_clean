We apply a new and mathematically rigorous method for the quantization ofconstrained systems to two-dimensional gauge theories. In this method, whichquantizes Marsden-Weinstein symplectic reduction, the inner product on thephysical state space is expressed through a certain integral over the gaugegroup. The present paper, the first of a series, specializes to the Minkowskitheory defined on a cylinder. The integral in question is then constructed interms of the Wiener measure on a loop group. It is shown how $\th$-anglesemerge in the new method, and the abstract theory is illustrated in detail inan example.
