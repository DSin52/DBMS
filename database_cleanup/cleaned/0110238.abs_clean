We obtain new results for consistent braneworld Kaluza-Klein reductions,showing how we can derive four-dimensional N=2 gauged supergravity ``localisedon the AdS_4 brane'' as an exact embedding in five-dimensional N=4 gaugedsupergravity. Similarly, we obtain five-dimensional N=2 gauged supergravitylocalised on an AdS_5 brane as a consistent Kaluza-Klein reduction fromsix-dimensional N=4 gauged supergravity. These embeddings can be lifted to typeIIB and massive type IIA supergravity respectively. The new AdS braneworldKaluza-Klein reductions are generalisations of earlier results on braneworldreductions to ungauged supergravities. The lower-dimensional cosmologicalconstant in our AdS braneworld reductions is an adjustable parameter, and so itcan be chosen to be small enough to be phenomenologically realistic, even ifthe higher-dimensional one is of Planck scale. We also discuss analyticcontinuations to give a de Sitter gauged supergravity in four dimensions as abraneworld Kaluza-Klein reduction. We find that there are two distinct routesthat lead to the same four-dimensional theory. In one, we start from afive-dimensional de Sitter supergravity, which itself arises from aKaluza-Klein reduction of type IIB^* supergravity on the hyperbolic 5-sphere.In the other, we start from AdS gauged supergravity in five dimensions, with ananalytic continuation of the two 2-form potentials, and embed thefour-dimensional de Sitter supergravity in that. The five-dimensional theoryitself comes from an O(4,3)/O(3,2) reduction of Hull's type IIB_{7+3}supergravity in ten dimensions.
