A long-standing conjecture on the structure of renormalized, gauge invariant,integrated operators of arbitrary dimension in Yang-Mills theory isestablished. The general solution of the consistency condition for anomalieswith sources included is also derived. This is achieved by computingexplicitely the cohomology of the full unrestricted BRST operator in the spaceof local polynomial functionals with ghost number equal to zero or one. Theargument does not use power counting and is purely cohomological. It reliescrucially on standard properties of the antifield formalism.
