Title: Bosonization and Duality in 2+1-Dimensions

Massive Thirring ModelComments: Email address

Bosonization of the gauged, massive Thirring model in 2+1-dimensions producesa Maxwell-Chern-Simons gauge theory, coupled to a dynamical, massive vectorfield. Exploiting the Master Lagrangian formalism, two dual theories areconstructed, one of them being a gauge theory. The full two-point functions ofboth the interacting fields are computed in the path integral quantizationscheme. Furthermore, some new dual models, derived from the original masterlagrangian and valid for different regimes of coupling parameters, areconstructed and analysed in details.
