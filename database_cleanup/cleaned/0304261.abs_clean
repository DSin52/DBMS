Title: Gauge Fixing and Scattering Amplitudes in String Field Theory around

Universal SolutionsAuthors: Tomohiko Takahashi and Syoji Zeze

Comments: 23 pages, LaTeX with PTPTeX.sty

We study a gauge fixed action of open string field theory around theuniversal solution which has been found as an analytic classical solution withone parameter a. For a>-1/2, we can reproduce open string scattering amplitudesin the theory fixed in the Siegel gauge. At a=-1/2, all scattering amplitudesvanish and there is no open string excitation in the gauge fixed theory. Theseresults support the conjecture that the universal solution can be regarded aspure gauge or the tachyon vacuum solution.
