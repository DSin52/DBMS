A minimal area problem imposing different length conditions on open andclosed curves is shown to define a one parameter family of covariantopen-closed quantum string field theories. These interpolate from a recentlyproposed factorizable open-closed theory up to an extended version of Witten'sopen string field theory capable of incorporating on shell closed strings. Thestring diagrams of the latter define a new decomposition of the moduli spacesof Riemann surfaces with punctures and boundaries based on quadraticdifferentials with both first order and second order poles.
