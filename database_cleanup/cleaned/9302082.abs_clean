In this paper we develop the covariant string field theory approach to open2d strings. Upon constructing the vertices, we apply the formalism to calculatethe lowest order contributions to the 4- and 5- point tachyon--tachyon treeamplitudes. Our results are shown to match the `bulk' amplitude calculations ofBershadsky and Kutasov. In the present approach the pole structure of theamplitudes becomes manifest and their origin as coming from the higher stringmodes transparent.
