Title: On Algebraic Singularities, Finite Graphs and D-Brane Gauge Theories

String Theoretic PerspectiveAuthors: Yang-Hui He

Comments: 513 pages, 71 figs, Edited Excerpts from the first 3 volumes of the

author's PhD ThesisIn this writing we shall address certain beautiful inter-relations betweenthe construction of 4-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories and resolutionof algebraic singularities, from the perspective of String Theory. We review insome detail the requisite background in both the mathematics, such asorbifolds, symplectic quotients and quiver representations, as well as thephysics, such as gauged linear sigma models, geometrical engineering,Hanany-Witten setups and D-brane probes.We investigate aspects of world-volume gauge dynamics using D-braneresolutions of various Calabi-Yau singularities, notably Gorenstein quotientsand toric singularities. Attention will be paid to the general methodology ofconstructing gauge theories for these singular backgrounds, with and withoutthe presence of the NS-NS B-field, as well as the T-duals to brane setups andbranes wrapping cycles in the mirror geometry. Applications of such diverse andelegant mathematics as crepant resolution of algebraic singularities,representation of finite groups and finite graphs, modular invariants of affineLie algebras, etc. will naturally arise. Various viewpoints and generalisationsof McKay's Correspondence will also be considered.The present work is a transcription of excerpts from the first three volumesof the author's PhD thesis which was written under the direction of Prof. A.Hanany - to whom he is much indebted - at the Centre for Theoretical Physics ofMIT, and which, at the suggestion of friends, he posts to the ArXiv pro hacvice; it is his sincerest wish that the ensuing pages might be of some smalluse to the beginning student.
