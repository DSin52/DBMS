Title: Brane New World and dS/CFT correspondence

Authors: S.D. Odintsov

Comments: 10 pages, based on plenary talk at GRG11, Tomsk, July 2002

The occurence of 5d de Sitter space with 4d de Sitter brane is discussed onclassical and quantum level. It is shown that quantum effects maybe produced bydual CFT living on the brane. Moreover, gravity trapping on the brane is provedvia the presentation of 5d dS gravity as 4d gravity coupled with gauge theory.This supports the dS/CFT correspondence. Some open questions in 5d dS/4d CFTcorrespondence are briefly discussed.
