The screening of an applied magnetic field in the charged anyon fluid atfinite density and temperature is investigated. For densities typical ofhigh-temperature superconducting materials we find that the anyon fluidexhibits a superconducting behavior at any temperature. The total Meissnerscreening is characterized by two penetration lengths corresponding to twoshort-range eigenmodes of propagation within the anyon fluid.
