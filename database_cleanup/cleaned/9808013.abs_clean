Title: The universal chiral partition function for exclusion statistics

Authors: A. Berkovich and B.M. McCoy

Comments: 14 pages in revtex. References added and the section on multiple

representations of u(1) expandedWe demonstrate the equality between the universal chiral partition function,which was first found in the context of conformal field theory andRogers-Ramanujan identities, and the exclusion statistics introduced by Haldanein the study of the fractional quantum Hall effect. The phenomena of multiplerepresentations of the same conformal field theory by different sets ofexclusion statistics is discussed in the context of the ${\hat u}(1)$ theory ofa compactified boson of radius $R.$
