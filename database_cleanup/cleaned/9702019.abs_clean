We studied the lowest order quantum corrections to the macroscopic wavefunctions $\Gamma (A,\ell)$ of non-critical string theory using thesemi-classical expansion of Liouville theory. By carefully taking the perimeterconstraint into account we obtained a new type of boundary condition for theLiouville field which is compatible with the reparametrization invariance ofthe boundary and which is not only a mixture of Dirichlet and Neumann types butalso involves an integral of an exponential of the Liouville field along theboundary. This condition contains an unknown function of $A/\ell^2$. Wedetermined this function by computing part of the one-loop corrections to$\Gamma (A,\ell)$.
