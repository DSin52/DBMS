This review paper is a continuation of hep-th/0012145 and it deals primarilywith noncommutative ${\mathbb R}^{d}$ spaces. We start with a discussion ofvarious algebras of smooth functions on noncommutative ${\mathbb R}^{d}$ thathave different asymptotic behavior at infinity. We pay particular attention tothe differences arising when working with nonunital algebras and the unitizedones obtained by adjoining the unit element. After introducing main objects ofnoncommutative geometry over those algebras such as inner products, modules,connections, etc., we continue with a study of soliton and instanton solutionsin field theories defined on these spaces. The discussion of solitons includesthe basic facts regarding the exact soliton solutions in the Yang-Mills-Higgssystems as well as an elementary discussion of approximate solitons in scalartheories in the $\theta \to \infty$ limit. We concentrate on the modulestructure and topological numbers characterizing the solitons. The section oninstantons contains a thorough description of noncommutative ADHM construction,a discussion of gauge triviality conditions at infinity and the structure of amodule underlying the ADHM instanton solution. Although some familiarity withgeneral ideas of noncommutative geometry reviewed in the first part is expectedfrom the reader, this part is largely independent from the first one.
