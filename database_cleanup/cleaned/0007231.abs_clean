We review self-duality of nonlinear electrodynamics and its extension toseveral Abelian gauge fields coupled to scalars. We then describe self-dualityin supersymmetric models, both N = 1 and N = 2. The self-duality equations,which have to be satisfied by the action of any self-dual system, are found andsolutions are discussed. One important example is the Born-Infeld action. Weexplain why the N = 2 supersymmetric actions proposed so far are not thecorrect world-volume actions for D3 branes in d = 6.
