We construct an explicit class of solutions of type IIB supergravity that isa smooth deformation of the 3-brane class of solutions. The solution isnonsupersymmetric and involves nontrivial dilaton and axion fields as well asthe standard 5-form field strength. One of the main features of the solution isthat for large values of the radius the deformation is small and itasymptotically approaches the undeformed 3-brane solution, signaling arestoration of conformal invariance in the UV for the dual gauge theory. Wesuggest that the supergravity deformation corresponds to a massive deformationon the dual gauge theory and consequently the deformed theory has theundeformed one as an ultraviolet fixed point. In cases where the original3-brane solution preserves some amount of supersymmetry we suggest that thegauge theory interpretation is that of soft supersymmetry breaking. We discussthe deformation for D3-branes on the conifold and the generalized conifoldexplicitly. We show that the semiclassical behavior of the Wilson loop suggeststhat the corresponding gauge theory duals are confining.
