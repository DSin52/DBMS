Title: Some quantum analogues of solvable Lie groups

In this paper we analyze the structure of some subalgebras of quantizedenveloping algebras corresponding to unipotent and solvable subgroups of asimple Lie group G. These algebras have the non--commutative structure ofiterated algebras of twisted polynomials with a derivation, an object which hasoften appeared in the general theory of non-commutative rings. In particular,we find maximal dimensions of their irreducible representations. Our resultsconfirm the validity of the general philosophy that the representation theoryis intimately connected to the Poisson geometry.
