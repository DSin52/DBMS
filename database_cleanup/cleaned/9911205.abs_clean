We review physical motivations and possible realizations of string vacua withlarge internal volume and/or low string scale and discuss the issue ofsupersymmetry breaking. In particular, we describe the key features ofScherk-Schwarz deformations in type I models and conclude by reviewing thetype-I models require that supersymmetry be {\it broken at the string scale} ona collection of branes, while being exact, to lowest order, in the bulk and onother branes.
