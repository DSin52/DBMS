Analysis of several gedanken experiments indicates that black holecomplementarity cannot be ruled out on the basis of known physical principles.Experiments designed by outside observers to disprove the existence of aquantum-mechanical stretched horizon require knowledge of Planck-scale effectsfor their analysis. Observers who fall through the event horizon after samplingthe Hawking radiation cannot discover duplicate information inside the blackhole before hitting the singularity. Experiments by outside observers to detectbaryon number violation will yield significant effects well outside thestretched horizon.
