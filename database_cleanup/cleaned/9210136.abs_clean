We study two dimensional Quantum Chromodynamics with massive quarks on acylinder in a light--cone formalism. We eliminate the non--dynamical degrees offreedom and express the theory in terms of the quark and Wilson loop variables.It is possible to perform this reduction without gauge fixing. The fermionicFock space can be defined independent of the gauge field in this light--coneformalism.
