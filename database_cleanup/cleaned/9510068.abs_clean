A C*-algebra of asymptotic fields which properly describes the infraredstructure in quantum electrodynamics is proposed. The algebra is generated bythe null asymptotic of electromagnetic field and the time asymptotic of chargedmatter fields which incorporate the corresponding Coulomb fields. As aconsequence Gauss' law is satisfied in the algebraic setting. Within thisalgebra the observables can be identified by the principle of gauge invariance.A class of representations of the asymptotic algebra is constructed whichresembles the Kulish-Faddeev treatment of electrically charged asymptoticfields.
