In the context of softly-broken N=4 to N=2 supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory,we calculate using semi-classical instanton methods, the lowest ordernon-trivial terms in the mass expansion of the prepotential for all instantonnumber. We find exact agreement with Seiberg-Witten theory and thereby achievethe most powerful test yet of this theory. We also calculate the one- andtwo-instanton contributions completely and also find consistency withSeiberg-Witten theory. Our approach relies on the fact that the instantoncalculus admits a nilpotent fermionic symmetry, or BRST operator, whoseexistence implies that the integrals over the instanton moduli space, whichgive the coefficients of the prepotential, localize on the space of resolvedpoint-like instantons or what we call ``topicons''.
