We point out that in a recent paper by Chaichian et al. (Phys.Rev.Lett71(1993)3405) Dirac quantization procedure is not properly followed asa result of which the resulting quantum theory is different from what one willget by a straightforward application of Dirac's formulation. For example atquantum level the model in I has noncommutative geometry, i.e., $[x_\mu, x_\nu]\neq 0$ while a correct treatment would give $[x_\mu, x_\nu] = 0$. Moreover,their assertion about $\alpha$ being an arbitrary constant in $S_\mu = -\alphap_\mu /{\sqrt{p^2}} $ is not correct and consequently one can not say whetherthe model describes anyons.
