We investigate the high energy behavior of the correlation functions of theopen Wilson lines in noncommutative gauge theory. We obtain a very simplephysical picture that they are bound to form a group of closed Wilson loops. Weprove our claim in the weak coupling region by perturbative analysis. Weemphasize the importance of respecting the cyclic symmetry of the straightWilson lines to compute the correlation functions. The implications for stringycalculation of the correlators are also discussed.
