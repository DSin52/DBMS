Title: Chiral ring in the 4D W_3 string

Comments: 13 pages

I summarize some recent results obtained in collaboration with P.~Bouwknegtand K.~Pilch on the spectrum of physical states in $\cW_3$ gravity coupled to$c=2$ matter. In particular, it is shown that the algebra of operatorscorresponding to physical states -- defined as a semi-infinite (or BRST)cohomology of the $\cW_3$ algebra -- carries the structure of a G-algebra. ThisG-algebra has a quotient which is isomorphic to the G-algebra of polyvectorfields on the base affine space of $SL(3,\CC)$. Details have appearedelsewhere.
