We introduce in a natural and straigthforward way the $loop$ (Lagrangian)$representation$ for the partition function of pure compact lattice QED. Thecorresponding classical lattice loop action is proportional to the quadraticarea of the loop world sheets. We discuss the parallelism between the $loop$formulation of this model in terms of world sheets of loops and the$topological$ representation of the Higgs (broken) phase for the non-compactlattice QED in terms of world sheets of Nielsen-Olesen strings.
