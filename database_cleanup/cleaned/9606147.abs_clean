Title: Superstrings in the geometrical approach and constrained super--WZNW

modelsAuthors: Dmitri Sorokin

Comments: LaTeX file, 8 pages. Based on talks given at the INTAS Network

Workshop on "Fundamental Problems in Classical, Quantum and String Gravity"(Torino, 2-3 May, 1996), The International Conference on "Problems of QuantumField Theory" (Alushta, 13-18 May, 1996) and The Second InternationalSakharov Conference on Physics (Moscow, 20-24 May, 1996)By use of geometrical methods of surface theory we demonstrate links ofGreen-Schwarz superstring dynamics with supersymmetric exactly-solvablenonlinear systems and super-WZNW models reduced in an appropriate way.
