The structure of the commutator algebra for conformal quantum mechanics isconsidered. Specifically, it is shown that the emergence of a dimensional scaleby renormalization implies the existence of an anomaly or quantum-mechanicalsymmetry breaking, which is explicitly displayed at the level of the generatorsof the SO(2,1) conformal group. Correspondingly, the associated breakdown ofthe conservation of the dilation and special conformal charges is derived.
