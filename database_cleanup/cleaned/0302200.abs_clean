Authors: J"urgen Fuchs, Ingo Runkel, Christoph Schweigert

Comments: 7 pages. Contribution to the 35th International Symposium Ahrenshoop

on the Theory of Elementary Particles (Berlin, August 2002) and to theInternational Conference on Theoretical Physics (UNESCO, Paris, July 2002).For related proceedings contributions seeThe interpretation of D-branes in terms of open strings has lead to muchinterest in boundary conditions of two-dimensional conformal field theories(CFTs). These studies have deepened our understanding of CFT and allowed us todevelop new computational tools. The construction of CFT correlators based oncombining tools from topological field theory and non-commutative algebra intensor categories, which we summarize in this contribution, allows e.g. todiscuss, apart from boundary conditions, also defect lines and disorder fields.
