references addedAbelian Lagrangians containing Phi^4-type vertices are regularized by meansof a suitable point-splitting scheme combined with generalized gaugetransformations.. The calculation is developed in details for a generalLagrangean, whose fields (gauge and matter ones) satisfy usual conditions. Weillustrate our results by considering some special cases, such as the($\overline{\psi}\psi)^2 and a modified version of the Avddev-Chizhov models.Possible application of our results to the Abelian Higgs model, wheneverspontaneous symmetry breaking is considered, is also discussed. We also payattention to a number of features of the point-split action such as theregularity and non-locality of its new ``interacting terms''.
