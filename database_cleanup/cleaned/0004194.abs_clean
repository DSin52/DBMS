We study the null compactification of type-IIA-string perturbation theory atfinite temperature. We prove a theorem about Riemann surfaces establishing thatthe moduli spaces of infinite-momentum-frame superstring worldsheets areidentical to those of branched-cover instantons in the matrix-string modelconjectured to describe M-theory. This means that the identification of stringdegrees of freedom in the matrix model proposed by Dijkgraaf, Verlinde andVerlinde is correct and that its natural generalization produces the modulispace of Riemann surfaces at all orders in the genus expansion.
