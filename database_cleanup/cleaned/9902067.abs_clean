The most general black M5-brane solution of eleven-dimensional supergravity(with a flat R^4 spacetime in the brane and a regular horizon) is characterizedby charge, mass and two angular momenta. We use this metric to constructgeneral dual models of large-N QCD (at strong coupling) that depend on two freeparameters. The mass spectrum of scalar particles is determined analytically(in the WKB approximation) and numerically in the whole two-dimensionalparameter space. We compare the mass spectrum with analogous results fromlattice calculations, and find that the supergravity predictions are close tothe lattice results everywhere on the two dimensional parameter space exceptalong a special line. We also examine the mass spectrum of the supergravityKaluza-Klein (KK) modes and find that the KK modes along the compact D-branecoordinate decouple from the spectrum for large angular momenta. There arehowever KK modes charged under a U(1)xU(1) global symmetry which do notdecouple anywhere on the parameter space. General formulas for the stringtension and action are also given.
