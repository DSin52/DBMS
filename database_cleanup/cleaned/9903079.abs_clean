Comments: 7 pages, RevTeX. Talk given at DPF '99; UCLA, Jan. 7, 1999

We review the construction of the unitary supermultiplets of the${\cal{N}}=8$ d=5 anti-de Sitter (AdS_5) superalgebra SU(2,2|4), which is thesymmetry group of the type IIB superstring theory on $AdS_5 \times S^5$, usingthe oscillator method.
