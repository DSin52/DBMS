We obtain the operator algebra of each twisted sector of all WZW orbifolds,including the general twisted current algebra and the algebra of the twistedcurrents with the twisted affine primary fields. Surprisingly, the twistedright and left mover current algebras are not a priori copies of each other.Using the operator algebra we also derive world-sheet differential equationsfor the twisted affine primary fields of all WZW orbifolds. Finally we includeground state properties to obtain the twisted Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equationsof the WZW permutation orbifolds and the inner-automorphic WZW orbifolds.
