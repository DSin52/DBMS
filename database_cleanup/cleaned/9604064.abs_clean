Roughly speaking, naked singularities are singularities that may be seen bytimelike observers. The Cosmic Censorship conjecture forbids their existence bystating that a reasonable system of energy will not, under reasonableconditions, collapse into a naked singularity. There are however many(classical) counter-examples to this conjecture in the literature. We propose adefense of the conjecture through the quantum theory. We will show that theHawking effect and the accompanying back reaction, when consistently applied tonaked singularities in two dimensional models of dilaton gravity with matterand a cosmological constant, prevent their formation by causing them to explodeor emit radiation catastrophically. This contrasts with black holes whichradiate slowly. If this phenomenon is reproduced in the four dimensional world,the explosion of naked singularities should have observable consequences.
