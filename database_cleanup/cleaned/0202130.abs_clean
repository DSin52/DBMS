We study a non-Riemannian modification of 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory.In our proposal the Riemannian structure of the five-dimensional manifold isreplaced by a Weyl-integrable one. In this context a 4-dimensionalPoincar$\grave{e}$ invariant solution is studied. Spacetime structures withthick smooth branes separated in the extra dimension arise. We focus ourattention, mainly, in a case where the massless graviton is located in one ofthe thick branes at the origin, meanwhile the matter degrees of freedom areconfined to the other brane. Due to the small overlap of the graviton'swave-function with the second thick brane, the model accounts for a resolutionof the mass hierarchy problem a la Randall-Sundrum. Although, initially, noassumptions are made about the topology of the extra dimension, the solutionfound yields an extra space that is effectivelly compact and respects $Z_2$symmetry. Unlike some other models with branes, a preliminary study (notincluding the effect of scalar perturbations) shows that the spectrum ofmassive Kaluza-Klein states is quantized and free of tachyonic modes.
