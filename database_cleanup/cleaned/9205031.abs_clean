The addition of a topological model to the matter content of a conventionalclosed-string theory leads to the appearance of many perturbatively-decoupledspace-time worlds. We illustrate this by classifying topological vertex modelson a triangulated surface. We comment on how such worlds could have beencoupled in the Planck era.
