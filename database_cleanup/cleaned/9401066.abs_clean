A lattice version of quantum nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation isconsidered, which has significantly simple form and fullfils most of thecriteria desirable for such lattice variants of field models. Unlike most ofthe known lattice NLS, the present model belongs to a class which does notexhibit the usual symmetry properties. However this lack of symmetry itselfseems to be responsible for the remarkable simplification of the relevantobjects in the theory, such as the Lax operator, theHamiltonian and other commuting conserved quantities as well as theirspectrum.The model allows exact quantum solution through algebraic Bethe ansatz andalso a straightforward and natural generalisation to the vector case, givingthus a new exact lattice version of the vector NLS model. A deformationrepresenting a new quantum integrable system involving Tamm-Dancoff like$q$-boson operators is constructed.
