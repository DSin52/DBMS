We give a simple derivation of a new formal expression for the number ofparticles produced from a conformal scalar field vacuum due to the creation ofa gauge cosmic string. We find that the number of particles released in stringformation may be substantially lower than what previous estimates haveindicated. Our derivation also indicates that there always exists at least onecritical angle deficit less than $2\pi$, at which the particle productionattains a maximum value. At the end we argue that additional (quantum) effectswill occur in string formation. In particular, a new mechanism to produce smallscale structure on strings is proposed.
