Smooth-throat wormholes are treated on as possessing quantum fluctuationenergy with scalar massive field as its source. Heat kernel coefficients of theLaplace operator are calculated in background of the arbitrary-profile throatwormhole with the help of the zeta-function approach. Two specific profile areconsidered. Some arguments are given that the wormholes may exist. It serves asa solution of semiclassical Einstein equations in the range of specific valuesof length and certain radius of wormhole's throat and constant of non-minimalconnection.
