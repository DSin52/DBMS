Title: Quantum field theory of electrodynamic phenomena that requires no

regularizationAuthors: Marijan Ribaric and Luka Sustersic

Comments: 5 pages, no figures

We put forward an example of local, covariant Lagrangians where the Feynmanrules result in diagrams of QED but with regularized propagators. Following 'tHooft and Veltman, these diagrams may be taken to define a quantum field theoryof electrodynamic phenomena that requires no regularization and is realistic,is unitary. (iii) The theory does not imply the existence of particles withwrong metric and/or wrong statistics. (iv) It contains the experimentalpredictions of QED. No such Lagrangians were known before
