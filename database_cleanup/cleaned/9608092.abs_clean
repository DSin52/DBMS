It has been known that the Wigner representation theory for positive energyorbits permits a useful localization concept in terms of certain lattices ofreal subspaces of the complex Hilbert -space. This ''modular localization'' isnot only useful in order to construct interaction-free nets of local algebraswithout using non-unique ''free field coordinates'', but also permits the studyof properties of localization and braid-group statistics in low-dimensionalQFT. It also sheds some light on the string-like localization properties of the1939 Wigner's ''continuous spin'' representations.We formulate a constructivenonperturbative program to introduce interactions into such an approach basedon the Tomita-Takesaki modular theory. The new aspect is the deep relation ofthe latter with the scattering operator.
