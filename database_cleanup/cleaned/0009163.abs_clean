Following the formalism of enveloping algebras and star product calculus weformulate and analyze a model of gauge gravity on noncommutative spaces andexamine the conditions of its equivalence to general relativity. Thecorresponding Seiberg-Witten maps are established which allow the definition ofrespective dynamics for a finite number of gravitational gauge field componentson noncommutative spaces.
