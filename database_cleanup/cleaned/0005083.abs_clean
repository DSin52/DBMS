We study a class of Wilsonian formulations of non-Abelian gauge theories inalgebraic non-covariant gauges where the Wilsonian infrared cutoff $\Lambda$ isinserted as a mass term for the propagating fields. In this way theWard-Takahashi identities are preserved to all scales. NeverthelessBRST-invariance in broken and the theory is gauge-dependent and unphysical at$\Lambda\neq0$. Then we discuss the infrared limit $\Lambda\to0$. We show thatthe singularities of the axial gauge choice are avoided in planar gauge andlight-cone gauge. In addition the issue of infrared divergences is addressed insome explicit example. Finally the rectangular Wilson loop of size $2L\times2T$ is evaluated at lowest order in perturbation theory and a non commutativitybetween the limits $\Lambda\to0$ and $T\to\infty$ is pointed out.
