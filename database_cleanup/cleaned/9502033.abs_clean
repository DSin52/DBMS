Title: On the Role of Vector Supersymmetry in Topological Field Theory

Comments: 17 pages, latex, no figures. Talk given at the ``XV Encontro Nacional

de Fisica de Particulas e Campos'', Angra dos Reis, Brazil, October 1994.Vector supersymmetry is typical of topological field theory. Its role in theconstruction of gauge invariant quantities is explained, as well as its role inthe cancellation of the ultraviolet divergences. The example of theChern-Simons theory in three dimensions is treated in details.
