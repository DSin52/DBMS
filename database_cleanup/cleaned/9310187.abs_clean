Title: Conformal Field Theory and Geometry of Strings

Authors: Jurg Frohlich and Krzysztof Gawedzki

What is quantum geometry? This question is becoming a popular leitmotiv intheoretical physics and in mathematics. Conformal field theory may catch aglimpse of the right answer. We review global aspects of the geometry ofconformal fields, such as duality and mirror symmetry, and interpret themwithin Connes' non-commutative geometry.
