By studying an effective action description of the coupling of charged gaugefields in $N=2$ $SU(n)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories, we can describeregions of moduli space where one or more of these fields becomes unphysical.We discuss subtleties in the structure of the moduli space for $SU(3)$.
