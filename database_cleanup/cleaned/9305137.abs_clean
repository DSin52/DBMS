We investigate the cosmological consequences of having quantum fields livingin a space with compactified dimensions. We will show that the equation ofstate is not modified by topological effects and so the dynamics of theuniverse remains as it is in the infinite volume limit. On the contrary thethermal history of the universe depends on terms that are associated withhaving non-trivial topology. In the conclusions we discuss some issues aboutthe relationship between the $c=1$ non-critical string-inspired cosmology andthe result obtained with matter given by a hot massless field in $S^{1}\times\mbox{\bfR}$.
