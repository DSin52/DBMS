By investigating the critical behavior appearing at the extremal limit of thenon-dilatonic, black p-branes in (d+p) dimensions, we find that somecritical exponents related to the critical point obey the scaling laws. Fromthe scaling laws we obtain that the effective spatial dimension of thenon-dilatonic black holes and black strings is one, and is p for thenon-dilatonic black p-branes. For the dilatonic black holes and blackp-branes, the effective dimension will depend on the parameters in theories.Thus, we give an interpretation why the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy may be givena simple world volume interpretation only for the non-dilatonic blackp-branes.
