We have argued previously that black holes may be represented in a D-braneapproach by monopole and vortex defects in a sine-Gordon field theory model ofLiouville dynamics on the world sheet. Supersymmetrizing this sine-Gordonsystem, we find critical behaviour in 11 dimensions, due to defect condensationthat is the world-sheet analogue of D-brane condensation around an extraspace-time dimension in M theory. This supersymmetric description ofLiouville dynamics has a natural embedding within a 12-dimensional frameworksuggestive of F theory.
