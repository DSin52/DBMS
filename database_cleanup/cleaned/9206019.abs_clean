We consider the BRST and superconformal properties of the ghost action of 2-Dsupergravity. Using the background spin structure on the worldsheet, we showthat this action can be transformed by canonical field transformations to reachother conformal models such as the 2-D topological gravity or the chiral modelsfor which the gauge variation of the action reproduces the left or rightconformal anomaly. Our method consists in using the gravitino and its ghost asfundamental blocks to build fields with different conformal weights andstatistics. This indicates in particular that the twisting of a conformal modelinto another one can be classically interpreted as a change of "fieldrepresentation" of the superconformal symmetry.
