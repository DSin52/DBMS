Using recent advances in the understanding of non-critical strings, weconstruct a unique, conformally invariant continuation to off-shell momenta ofPolyakov amplitudes in critical string theory. Three-point amplitudes areexplicitly calculated. These off-shell amplitudes possess some unusual,apparently stringy, characteristics, which are unlikely to be reproduced in astring field theory. Thus our results may be an indication that somefundamentally new formulation, other than string field theory, will be requiredto extend our understanding of critical strings beyond the Polyakov pathintegral.
