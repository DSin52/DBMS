Theoretical Methods in Physics, July 31 - August 05, 2000, Dubna (Russia)We describe graded contractions of Virasoro algebra. The highest weightrepresentations of Virasoro algebra are constructed. The reducibility ofrepresentations is analysed. In contrast to standart representations thecontracted ones are reducible except some special cases. Moreover we find anexotic module with null-plane on fifth level.
