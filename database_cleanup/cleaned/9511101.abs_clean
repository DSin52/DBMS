Pad\'e approximant numerical program leads to a significant improvement ofthe variational results for the mass gap, for arbitrary N. A more completecomparison of different Pad\'e approximants is performed. Text modifiedaccording to these new results, one figure and two references addedJournal-ref: Int.J.Mod.Phys.

We show how to perform systematically improvable variational calculations inthe $O(2N)$ Gross-Neveu model for generic $N$, in such a way that allinfinities usually plaguing such calculations are accounted for in a waycompatible with the perturbative renormalization group . The final point is ageneral framework for the calculation of non-perturbative quantities likecondensates, masses etc$\ldots$, in an asymptotically free field theory. Forthe Gross-Neveu model, the numerical results obtained from a ``2-loop'' down tolow values of $N$.
