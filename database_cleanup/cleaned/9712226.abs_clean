Comments: latex

Journal-ref: Contemp.Math. 219 (1998) 93

The cohomological approach to the problem of consistent interactions betweenfields with a gauge freedom is reviewed. The role played by the BRST symmetryis explained. Applications to massless vector fields and 2-form gauge fieldsare surveyed.
