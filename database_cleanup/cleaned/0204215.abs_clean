Title: Dynamical Features of Maggiore's Generalised Commutation Relations

Comments: 14 pages. Version 2

deletions in the text. Section 5 shortened. To appear in Physics Letters BWe study the dynamical features of Maggiore's generalised commutationrelations. We focus on their generality and, in particular, their dependence onthe Hamiltonian H. We derive the generalisation of the Planck's law for blackbody spectrum, study the statistical mechanics of free particles, and study theearly universe evolution which now exhibits non trivial features. We find thatthe dynamical features, found here and in our earlier work, are all generic andvary systematically with respect to the asymptotic growth of the Hamiltonian H.
