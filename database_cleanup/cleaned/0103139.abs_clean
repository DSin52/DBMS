We analyze the structure of noncommutative pure Chern-Simons theorysystematically in the axial gauge. We show that there is no IR/UV mixing inthis theory in this gauge. In fact, we show, using the usual BRST identities aswell as the identities following from vector supersymmetry, that this is a freetheory. As a result, the tree level Chern-Simons coefficient is notrenormalized. It also holds that the Chern-Simons coefficient is not modifiedat finite temperature. As a byproduct of our analysis, we prove that the ghostscompletely decouple in the axial gauge in a noncommutative gauge theory.
