Bilocal light-ray operators which are Lorentz scalars, vectors orantisymmetric tensors, and which appear in various hard scattering QCDprocesses, are decomposed into operators of definite twist. These operators areharmonic tensor functions and their Taylor expansion consists of (traceless)local light-cone operators with span irreducible representations of the Lorentzgroup with definite spin j and common geometric twist (= dimension - spin).Some applications concerning the nonforward matrix elements of these operatorsand the generalization fo conformal light-cone operators of definite twist isconsidered. The group theoretical background of the method has been made clear.
