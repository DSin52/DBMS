We show how to construct, starting from a quasi-Hopf algebra, orquasi-quantum group, invariants of knots and links. In some cases, theseinvariants give rise to invariants of the three-manifolds obtained by surgeryalong these links. This happens for a finite-dimensional quasi-quantum group,whose definition involves a finite group $G$, and a 3-cocycle $\om$, which wasfirst studied by Dijkgraaf, Pasquier and Roche. We treat this example in moredetail, and argue that in this case the invariants agree with the partitionfunction of the topological field theory of Dijkgraaf and Witten depending onthe same data $G, \,\om$.
