I study various properties of the critical limits of correlators containinginsertions of conserved and anomalous currents. In particular, I show that theimprovement term of the stress tensor can be fixed unambiguously, studying theRG interpolation between the UV and IR limits. The removal of the improvementambiguity is encoded in a variational principle, which makes use of sum rulesfor the trace anomalies a and a'. Compatible results follow from the analysisof the RG equations. I perform a number of self-consistency checks and discussthe issues in a large set of theories.
