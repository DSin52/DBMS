We investigate whether a recently proposed modulation of the power spectrumof primordial density fluctuations generated through transplankian (maybestringy) effects during inflation can be observed. We briefly review themechanism leading to the modulation and apply it to a generic slow-rollscenario of inflation. We then investigate how these primordial modulationeffects leave an imprint in the cosmic microwave background radiation. Ourconclusions are that for favourable parameter values already the presentlyflying MAP satellite will have a chance to detect such transplanckianoscillations in the pattern of temperature fluctuations on the sky, and thatthe upcoming Planck satellite will either detect them or put stringent limitsrelated to the mass scale where the new effects appear.
