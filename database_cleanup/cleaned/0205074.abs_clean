Recently a class of Type IIA orientifold models was constructed yielding justthe fermions of the SM at the intersections of D6-branes wrapping a 6-torus. Wegeneralize that construction to the case of Type IIB compactified on anorientifold of T^4 \times (C/Z_N) with D5-branes intersecting at angles on T^4.We construct explicit models in which the massless fermion spectrum is just theone of a three-generation Standard Model.One of the motivations for these new constructions is that in this case thereare 2 dimensions which are transverse to the SM D5-brane configuration. Bymaking those two dimensions large enough one can have a low string scale M_s oforder 1-10 TeV and still have a large M_{Planck} in agreement withobservations. From this point of view, these are the first explicit D-branestring constructions where one can achieve having just the fermionic spectrumand gauge group of the SM embedded in a Low String Scale scenario. Thecancellation of U(1) anomalies turns out to be quite analogous to the toroidalD6-brane case and the proton is automatically stable due to the gauging ofbaryon number. Unlike the D6-brane case, the present class of models has N = 0SUSY both in the bulk and on the branes and hence the spectrum is simpler.
