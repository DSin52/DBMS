We consider Type IIB superstring theory with the addition of n 9-branes and nanti-9-branes (and no orientifolds). The result is a ten-dimensional chiraltheory of open and closed oriented strings with gauge group U(n) \times U(n).There is, however, a tachyonic instability which can be understood as theconsequence of brane-antibrane annihilation. We therefore expect to recover theusual IIB theory as the tachyon rolls to infinity.
