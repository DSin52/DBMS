We discuss the hierarchy of Yukawa couplings in a supersymmetric three familyStandard-like string Model. The model is constructed by compactifying Type IIAstring theory on a Z_2 x Z_2 orientifold in which the Standard Model matterfields arise from intersecting D6-branes. When lifted to M theory, the modelamounts to compactification of M-theory on a G_2 manifold. While the actualfermion masses depend on the vacuum expectation values of the multiple Higgsfields in the model, we calculate the leading worldsheet instantoncontributions to the Yukawa couplings and examine the implications of theYukawa hierarchy.
