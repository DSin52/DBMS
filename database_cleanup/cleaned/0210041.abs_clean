We study counter-terms of one- and two-point Green functions of some specialoperators in ${\cal N}=1$ SYM from their SUGRA duals from the consideration ofAdS/CFT or gauge/gravity correspondence. We consider both the Maldacena-Nunezsolution and the Klebanov-Strassler-Tseytlin solution that are proposed to beSUGRA duals of ${\cal N}=1$ SYM. We obtain radial/energy-scale relation foreach solution by comparing SUGRA calculations with the field theory results.Using these relations we evaluate the $\beta$-function of ${\cal N}=1$ SYM. Wefind that the leading order term can be accurately obtained for both solutionsand the higher order terms exhibit some ambiguities. We discuss the origin ofthese ambiguities and conclude that more studies are needed to check whetherthese SUGRA solutions are exactly dual to ${\cal N}=1$ SYM.
