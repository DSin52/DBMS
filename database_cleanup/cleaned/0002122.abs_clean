The q-state Potts model in two dimensions exhibits a first-order transitionfor q>4. As q->4+ the correlation length at this transition diverges. We arguethat this limit defines a massive integrable quantum field theory whose lowestexcitations are kinks connecting 4+1 degenerate ground states. We construct theS-matrix of this theory and the two-particle form factors, and hence estimate anumber of universal amplitude ratios. These are in very good agreement with theresults of extrapolated series in q^(-1/2) as well as Monte Carlo results forq=5.
