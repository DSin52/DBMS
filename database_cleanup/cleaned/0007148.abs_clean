We analyse in three space-time dimensions, the connection between abelianself dual vector doublets and their counterparts containing both an explicitmass and a topological mass. Their correspondence is established in thelagrangian formalism using an operator approach as well as a path integralapproach. A canonical hamiltonian analysis is presented, which also shows theequivalence with the lagrangian formalism. The implications of our results forbosonisation in three dimensions are discussed.
