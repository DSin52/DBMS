We investigate D-branes with maximal symmetry on general group manifolds interms of boundary states and effective actions. We show that in large $k$ limitboundary states with an suitable Wilson line form boundary states of the othertypes of D-branes, extending the known fact in SU(2) case. We also show thatfluctuation mass spectrum around D-brane solutions of the effective actionagrees with that of boundary CFT in large $k$ limit.
