Title: Vertex Operator Superalgebras and Their Representations

Comments: 50 pages, to appear in Contemporary Mathematics

After giving some definitions for vertex operator SUPERalgebras and theirmodules, we construct an associative algebra corresponding to any vertexoperator superalgebra, such that the representations of the vertex operatoralgebra are in one-to-one correspondence with those of the correspondingassociative algebra. A way is presented to decribe the fusion rules for thevertex operator superalgebras via modules of the associative algebra. The aboveare generalizations of Zhu's constructions for vertex operator algebras. Thenwe deal in detail with vertex operator superalgebras corresponding toNeveu-Schwarz algebras, super affine Kac-Moody algebras, and free fermions. Weuse the machinery established above to find the rationality conditions,classify the representations and compute the fusion rules. In the appendix, wepresent explicit formulas for singular vectors and defining relations for theintegrable representations of super affine algebras. These formulas are notonly crucial for the theory of the corresponding vertex operator superalgebrasand their representations, but also of independent interest.
