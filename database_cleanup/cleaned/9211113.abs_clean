The geometric structure of theories with gauge fields of spins two and highershould involve a higher spin generalisation of Riemannian geometry. Suchgeometries are discussed and the case of $W_\infty$-gravity is analysed indetail. While the gauge group for gravity in $d$ dimensions is thediffeomorphism group of the space-time, the gauge group for a certain$W$-gravity theory (which is $W_\infty$-gravity in the case $d=2$) is the groupof symplectic diffeomorphisms of the cotangent bundle of the space-time. Gaugetransformations for $W$-gravity gauge fields are given by requiring theinvariance of a generalised line element. Densities exist and can beconstructed from the line element (generalising $\sqrt { \det g_{\mu \nu}}$)only if $d=1$ or $d=2$, so that only for $d=1,2$ can actions be constructed.These two cases and the corresponding $W$-gravity actions are considered indetail. In $d=2$, the gauge group is effectively only a subgroup of thesymplectic diffeomorphism group. Some of the constraints that arise for $d=2$are similar to equations arising in the study of self-dual four-dimensionalgeometries and can be analysed using twistor methods, allowing contact to bemade with other formulations of $W$-gravity. While the twistor transform forself-dual spaces with one Killing vector reduces to a Legendre transform, thatfor two Killing vectors gives a generalisation of the Legendre transform.
