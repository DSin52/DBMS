We discuss physical spectra and correlation functions of topological minimalmodels coupled to topological gravity. We first study the BRST formalism ofthese theories and show that their BRST operator $Q=Q_s+Q_v$ can be brought to$Q_s$ by a certain homotopy operator $U$, $UQU^{-1}=Q_s$ ($Q_s$ and $Q_v$ arethe $N=2$ and diffeomorphism BRST operators, respectively). Thereparametrization (anti)-ghost $b$ mixes with the supercharge operator $G$under this transformation. Existence of this transformation enables us to usematter fields to represent cohomology classes of the operator $Q$. Weexplicitly construct gravitational descendants and show that they generate thehigher-order KdV flows. We also evaluate genus-zero correlation functions andrederive basic recursion relations of two-dimensional topological gravity.
