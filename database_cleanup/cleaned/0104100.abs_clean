Building on earlier work, we construct linear sigma models for strings oncurved spaces in the presence of branes. Our models include an extremelygeneral class of brane-worldvolume gauge field configurations. We explain in anaccessible manner the mathematical ideas which suggest appropriate worldsheetinteractions for generating a given open string background. This constructionprovides an explanation for the appearance of the derived category in D-branephysics complementary to that of recent work of Douglas.
