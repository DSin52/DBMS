Diaconescu, Moore and Witten have shown that the topological part of theM-theory partition function is an invariant of an E8 gauge bundle over the11-dimensional bulk. This presents a puzzle as an 11d gauge theory cannotexhibit linearly realized supersymmetry. One possibility is that the gaugetheory is nonsupersymmetric and flows to 11d SUGRA only in the infrared, withSUSY arising as a low energy accidental degeneracy. Although no such gaugetheory has been constructed, any such construction must satisfy a number ofconstraints in order to correctly reproduce the known 10-dimensional physics oneach boundary component. We analyze these constraints and in particular usethem to attempt an approximate construction of the 11d gravitino as acondensate of the gauge theory fields.
