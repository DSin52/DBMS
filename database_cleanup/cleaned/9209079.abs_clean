AnalysisA classification of ordinary differential equations and finite-differenceequations in one variable having polynomial solutions (the generalized Bochnerproblem) is given. The method used is based on the spectral problem for apolynomial element of the universal enveloping algebra of $sl_2({\bf R})$ (fordifferential equations) or $sl_2({\bf R})_q$ (for finite-difference equations)in the "projectivized" representation possessing an invariant subspace.Connection to the recently-discovered quasi-exactly-solvable problems isdiscussed.
