We consider the dimensional reduction of N=1 {SYM}_{2+1} to 1+1 dimensions.The gauge groups we consider are U(N) and SU(N), where N is finite. Weformulate the continuum bound state problem in the light-cone formalism, andshow that any normalizable SU(N) bound state must be a superposition of aninfinite number of Fock states. We also discuss how massless states arise inthe DLCQ formulation for certain discretizations.
