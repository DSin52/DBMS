We consider the non-commutative generalization of the chiral perturbationtheory. The resultant coupling constants are severely restricted by the modeland in good agreement with the data. When applied to the Skyrme model, ourscheme reproduces the non-Skyrme term with the right coefficient. We comment ona similar treatment of the linear $\sigma $-model.
