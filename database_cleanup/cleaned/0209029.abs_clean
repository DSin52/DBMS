Recently, investigations have begun into a holographic duality fortwo-dimensional de Sitter space. In this paper, we evaluate the associatedcentral charge, using a modified version of the canonical Hamiltonian methodthat was first advocated by Catelani {\it et al}. Our computation agrees withthat of a prior work (Cadoni {\it et al}), but we argue that the method usedhere is, perhaps, aesthetically preferable on holographic grounds. We alsoconfirm an agreement between the Cardy and thermodynamic entropy, thusproviding further support for the conjectured two-dimensional deSitter/conformal field theory correspondence.
