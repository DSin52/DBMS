A. Picardello (eds.), Pitman Research Notes in Mathematics Series 311,Longman Scientific & Technical, 1994, pp. 46--128A tutorial introduction is given to general Hopf algebras andto general compact quantum groups. In the definition and further treatmentof compact quantum groups C*-algebras are avoided. Contact withWoronowicz's compact matrix quantum groups is made at a later stage.
