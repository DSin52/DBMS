Title: Is Purity Eternal?

Authors: Mark Srednicki

Comments: 12 pages, in Plain Tex; section 3 on Lorentz covariance expanded and

Phenomenological and formal restrictions on the evolution of pure into mixedstates are discussed. In particular, it is argued that, if energy is conserved,loss of purity is incompatible with the weakest possible form of Lorentzcovariance.
