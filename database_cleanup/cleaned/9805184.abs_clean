We discuss the role of the multiplicative anomaly for a complex scalar fieldat finite temperature and density. It is argued that physical considerationsmust be applied to determine which of the many possible expressions for theeffective action obtained by the functional integral method is correct. This isdone by first studying the non-relativistic field where the thermodynamicpotential is well-known. The relativistic case is also considered. We emphasizethat the role of the multiplicative anomaly is not to lead to new physics, butrather to preserve the equality among the various expressions for the effectiveaction.
