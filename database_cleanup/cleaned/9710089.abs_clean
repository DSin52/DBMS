The question that guides our discussion is how did the geometry and particlescome into being. The present theory reveals primordial deeper structuresunderlying fundamental concepts of contemporary physics. We begin with adrastic revision of a role of local internal symmetries in physical concept ofcurved geometry. A standard gauge principle of local internal symmetries isgeneralized. The gravitation gauge group is proposed, which is generated byhidden local internal symmetries. Last two parts address to the question ofphysical origin of geometry and basic concepts of particle physics such as thefields of quarks with the spins and various quantum numbers, internalsymmetries and so forth; also four basic principles of Relativity, Quantum,Gauge and Color Confinement, which are, as it was proven, all derivative andcome into being simultaneously. The most promising aspect of our approach sofar is the fact that many of the important anticipated properties, basicconcepts and principles of particle physics are appeared quite naturally in theframework of suggested theory.
