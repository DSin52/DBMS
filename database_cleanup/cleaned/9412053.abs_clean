Title: On a New Universal Class of Phase Transitions and Quantum Hall Effect

Authors: Michael Flohr

We study the possible phase transitions between (2+1)-dimensional abelianChern-Simons theories. We show that they may be described by non-unitaryrational conformal field theories with c_eff = 1. As an example we choose thefractional quantum Hall effect and derive all its main features from thediscrete fractal structure of the moduli space of these non-unitary transitionconforma lfield theories and some large scale principles. Rationality of thesetheories is intimately related to the modular group yielding sever conditionson the possible phase transitions. This gives a natural explanation for both,the values and the widths, of the observed fractional Hall plateaux.
