``Dimension bubbles'' of the type previously studied by Blau and Guendelman[S.K. Blau and E.I. Guendelman, Phys. Rev. D40, 1909 (1989)], which effectivelyenclose a region of 5d spacetime and are surrounded by a region of 4dspacetime, can arise in a 5d theory with a compact extra dimension that isdimensionally reduced to give an effective 4d theory. These bubbles with thindomain walls can be stabilized against total collapse in a rather natural wayby a scalar field which, as in the case with ``ordinary'' nontopologicalsolitons, traps light scalar particles inside the bubble.
