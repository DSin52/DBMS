The method of flow equations is applied to QED on the light front. Requiringthat the partical number conserving terms in the Hamiltonian are considered tobe diagonal and the other terms off-diagonal an effective Hamiltonian isobtained which reduces the positronium problem to a two-particle problem, sincethe particle number violating contributions are eliminated. No infrareddivergencies appear. The ultraviolet renormalization can be performedsimultaneously.
