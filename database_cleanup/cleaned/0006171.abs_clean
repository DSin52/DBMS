Some spatially homogeneous Bianchi type I cosmological models filled withhomogeneous ``electric'' $p$-form fields are shown to mimic the never-endingoscillatory behaviour of generic string cosmologies established recently. Thevalidity of the ``Kasner-free-flights plus collisions-on-potential-walls''picture is also illustrated in the case of known, non-chaotic, superstringsolutions.
