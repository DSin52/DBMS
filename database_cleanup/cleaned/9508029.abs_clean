We study both spherically symmetric and rotating black holes with dilatoncoupling and discuss the evaporation of these black holes via Hawking's quantumradiation and their fates. We find that the dilaton coupling constant $\alpha$drastically affects the emission rates, and therefore the fates of the blackholes. When the charge is conserved, the emission rate from the non-rotatinghole is drastically changed beyond $\alpha = 1$ (a superstring theory) anddiverges in the extreme limit. In the rotating cases, we analyze the slowlyrotating black hole solution with arbitrary $\alpha$ as well as three exactsolutions, the Kerr--Newman ($\alpha = 0$), and Kaluza--Klein ($\alpha =\sqrt{3}$), and Sen black hole ($\alpha = 1$ and with axion field). Beyond thesame critical value of $\alpha \sim 1$, the emission rate becomes very largenear the maximally charged limit, while for $\alpha<1$ it remains finite. Theblack hole with $\alpha > 1$ may evolve into a naked singularity due to itslarge emission rate. We also consider the effects of a discharge process byinvestigating superradiance for the non-rotating dilatonic black hole.
