Title: Quantum Evaporation of Liouville Black Holes

Authors: R.B. Mann

Comments: LaTeX file, 6 pgs

The classical field equations of a Liouville field coupled to gravity in twospacetime dimensions are shown to have black hole solutions. Exact solutionsare also obtained when quantum corrections due to back reaction effects areincluded, modifying both the ADM mass and the black hole entropy. Thethermodynamic limit breaks down before evaporation of the black hole iscomplete, indicating that higher-loop effects must be included for a fulldescription of the process. A scenario for the final state of the black holespacetime is suggested.
