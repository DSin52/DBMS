Title: Order Parameters for Non-Abelian Gauge Theories

Comments: 10p, revtex, 3 figures available upon request

Owing to subtle issues concerning quantum fluctuations and gauge fixing, aformulation of a general procedure to specify the realization of non-Abeliangauge symmetry has evaded all earlier attempts. In this Letter, we discussthese subtleties and present two sets of order parameters for non-Abelian gaugetheories. Such operators directly probe the manifest low energy symmetry groupand are crucial for the study of the phase diagram of a non-Abelian gaugetheory.
