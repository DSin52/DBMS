Recently derived general formal solutions of a BRST quantization on innerproduct spaces of irreducible Lie group gauge theories are applied to trivialmodels and relativistic particle models for particles with spin 0, 1/2 and 1.In the process general quantization rules are discovered which make the formalsolutions exact. The treatment also give evidence that the formal solutions aredirectly generalizable to theories with graded gauge symmetries. Forrelativistic particles reasonable results are obtained although there exists nocompletely Lorentz covariant quantization of the coordinate and momenta oninner product spaces. There are two inequivalent procedures depending onwhether or not the time coordinate is quantized with positive or indefinitemetric states. The latter is connected to propagators.
