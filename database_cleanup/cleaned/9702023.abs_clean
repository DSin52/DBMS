The response of isodoublet fermions to classical backgrounds of essentially2-dimensional boson fields in SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs theory is investigated. Inparticular, the spectral flow of Dirac eigenvalues is calculated for anon-contractible sphere of configurations passing through the vacuum and theZ-string (the embedded vortex solution). Also, a non-vanishing Berry phase isestablished for adiabatic transport "around" the Z-string. These results implythe existence of a new type of global (non-perturbative) gauge anomaly in SU(2)Yang-Mills-Higgs quantum field theory with a single doublet of left-handedfermions. Possible extensions to other chiral gauge field theories are alsodiscussed.
