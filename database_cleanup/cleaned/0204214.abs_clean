Low energy theorems of Nambu-Goldstone fermion associated with spontaneouslybroken supersymmetry are studied for gauge supermultiplets. Two possible termsin the effective Lagrangian are needed to deal with massless gaugino and/ormassless gauge boson. As an illustrative example, a concrete model is workedout which can interpolate massless as well as massive gaugino and/or gaugeboson to examine the low energy effective interaction of NG-fermion.
