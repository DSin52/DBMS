We discuss the ten dimensional black holes made of D0-branes in the regimewhere the effective coupling is large, and yet the 11D geometry is unimportant.We suggest that these black holes can be interpreted as excitations over thethreshold bound state. Thus, the entropy formula for the former is used topredict a scaling region of the wave function of the latter. The horizon radiusand the mass gap predicted in this picture agree with the formulas derived fromthe classical geometry.
