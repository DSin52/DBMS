Field Theory, edited by A. W. Schreiber, A. G. Williams and A. W. Thomas,World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd., Singapore, pp. 308-313 (1998)We study the gauge covariance of the fermion-photon vertex in quenched,massless 3-dimensional quantum electrodynamics. A class of vertex Ans\"{a}tzeobtained by generalizing that proposed by Dong et al. is tested using theinvariance of the photon polarization scalar under the Landau-Khalatnikovtransformation.
