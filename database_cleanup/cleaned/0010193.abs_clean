Island, Korea, Sep. 4-8, 2000; acknowledgement addedWe show that the Gauss-Bonnet term is the only consistent curvature squaredinteraction in the Randall-Sundrum model and various static and inflationarysolutions can be found. And from metric perturbations around the RS backgroundwith a single brane embedded, we also show that for a vanishing Gauss-Bonnetcoefficient, the brane bending allows us to reproduce the 4D Einstein gravityat the linearized level.
