We show that N=2 supersymmetric Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Higgs systems in threedimension can be realized as gauge theories on a D2-brane in D8-branesbackground with a non-zero B-field. We reproduce a potential of Coulomb branchof the Chern-Simons theory as a potential of a D2-brane in a classical D8-branesolution and show that each Coulomb vacuum is realized by a D2-brane stabilizedin the bulk at a certain distance from D8-branes.
