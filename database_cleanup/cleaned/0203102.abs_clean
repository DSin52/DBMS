A three-dimensional simple N=1 supergravity theory with a supersymmetricsigma-model on the coset E_{8(+8)} / SO(16) is constructed. Both bosons andfermions in the matter multiplets are in the spinorial 128-representation ofSO(16) with the same chirality. Due to their common chirality, this model cannot be obtained from the maximal N=16 supergravity. By introducing anindependent vector multiplet, we can also gauge an arbitrary subgroup of SO(16)together with a Chern-Simons term. Similar N=1 supersymmetric sigma-modelscoupled to supergravity are also constructed for the cosets F_{4(-20)} / SO(9)and SO(8,n) / SO(8) X SO(n).
