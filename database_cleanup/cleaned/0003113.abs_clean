Starting from tree and one-loop tachyon amplitudes of open string theory inthe presence of a constant B-field, we explore two problems. First we show thatin the noncommutative field theory limit the amplitudes reduce to tree andone-loop diagrams of the noncommutative phi-three theory. Next, we checkfactorization of the one-loop amplitudes in the long cylinder limit.
