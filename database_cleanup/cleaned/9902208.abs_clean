Title: Partially Localized Intersecting BPS Branes

Comments: 27 pages, LaTeX, revised version to appear in Nucl. Phys. B

We present the explicit forms of supergravity solutions for the variousintersecting two BPS branes in eleven and ten dimensions, where one brane islocalized at the delocalized other brane. Our partially localized supergravitysolutions describe brane configurations in the near horizon region of thedelocalized branes, where the two constituent branes meet in the overalltransverse space and the delocalized branes coincide. We also give the braneworldvolume interpretations for some of such supergravity solutions.
