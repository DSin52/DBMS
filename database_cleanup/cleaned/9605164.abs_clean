A new version of differential renormalization is presented. It is based onpulling out certain differential operators and introducing a logarithmicdependence into diagrams. It can be defined either in coordinate or momentumspace, the latter being more flexible for treating tadpoles and diagrams whereinsertion of counterterms generates tadpoles. Within this version, gaugeinvariance is automatically preserved to all orders in Abelian case. Sincedifferential renormalization is a strictly four-dimensional renormalizationscheme it looks preferable for application in each situation when dimensionalrenormalization meets difficulties, especially, in theories with chiral andsuper symmetries. The calculation of the ABJ triangle anomaly is given as anexample to demonstrate simplicity of calculations within the presented versionof differential renormalization.
