Title: Symmetry Principles for String Theory

Comments: 5 pages, Plain TeX, no figures

The gauge symmetries that underlie string theory arise from innerautomorphisms of the algebra of observables of the associated conformal fieldtheory. In this way it is possible to study broken and unbroken symmetries onthe same footing, and exhibit an infinite-dimensional supersymmetry algebrathat includes space-time diffeomorphisms and an infinite number ofspontaneously broken level-mixing symmetries. We review progress in this area,culminating in the identification of a weighted tensor algebra as a subalgebraof the full symmetry. We also briefly describe outstanding problems.
