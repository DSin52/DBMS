We study (2,2) supersymmetric field theories on two-dimensional worldsheetwith boundaries. We determine D-branes (boundary conditions and boundaryinteractions) that preserve half of the bulk supercharges in non-linear sigmamodels, gauged linear sigma models, and Landau-Ginzburg models. We identify amechanism for brane creation in LG theories and provide a new derivation of alink between soliton numbers of the massive theories and R-charges of vacua atthe UV fixed point. Moreover we identify Lagrangian submanifolds that arise asthe mirror of certain D-branes wrapped around holomorphic cycles of K\"ahlermanifolds. In the case of Fano varieties this leads to the explanation of Helixstructure of the collection of exceptional bundles and soliton numbers, throughPicard-Lefshetz theory applied to the mirror LG theory. Furthermore using theLG realization of minimal models we find a purely geometric realization ofVerlinde Algebra for SU(2) level k as intersection numbers of D-branes. Thisalso leads to a direct computation of modular transformation matrix andprovides a geometric interpretation for its role in diagonalizing the Fusionalgebra.
