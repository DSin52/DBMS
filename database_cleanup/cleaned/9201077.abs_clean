3531-3546Some elaboration is given to the structure of physical states in 2D gravitycoupled to $C \leq 1$ matter, and to the chiral algebra ($w_{\infty}$) of$C_{M} = 1$ theory which has been found recently, in the continuum approach, byWitten and by Klebanov and Polyakov. It is shown then that the chiral algebrais being realized as well in the minimal models of gravity ($C_{M}<1$), so thatit stands as a general symmetry of 2D gravity theories.
