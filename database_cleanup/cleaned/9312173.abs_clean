The line bundles which arise in the holonomy interpretations of the geometricphase display curious similarities to those encountered in the statement of theBorel-Weil-Bott theorem of the representation theory. The remarkable relationof the geometric phase to the classification of complex line bundles providesthe necessary tools for establishing the relevance of the Borel-Weil-Botttheorem to Berry's adiabatic phase. This enables one to define a set oftopological charges for arbitrary compact connected semisimple dynamical Liegroups. In this paper, the problem of the determination of the parameter spaceof the Hamiltonian is also addressed. A simple topological argument ispresented to indicate the relation between the Riemannian structure on theparameter space and Berry's connection. The results about the fibre bundles andgroup theory are used to introduce a procedure to reduce the problem of thenon-adiabatic (geometric) phase to Berry's adiabatic phase for crankedHamiltonians. Finally, the possible relevance of the topological charges of thegeometric phase to those of the non-abelian monopoles is pointed out.
