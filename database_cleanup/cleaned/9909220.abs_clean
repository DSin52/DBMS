Title: Remarks on Defining the DLCQ of Quantum Field Theory as a Light-Like

LimitComments: 20 pages, no figures, uses phy macro (provided)

The issue of defining discrete light-cone quantization (DLCQ) in field theoryas a light-like limit is investigated. This amounts to studying quantum fieldtheory compactified on a space-like circle of vanishing radius in anappropriate kinematical setting. While this limit is unproblematic at thetree-level, it is non-trivial for loop amplitudes. In one-loop amplitudes, whenthe propagators are written using standard Feynman $\alpha$-parameters we showthat, generically, in the limit of vanishing radius, one of the$\alpha$-integrals is replaced by a discrete sum and the (UV renormalized)one-loop amplitude has a finite light-like limit. This is analogous to whathappens in string theory. There are however exceptions and the limit maydiverge in certain theories or at higher loop order. We give a rather detailedanalysis of the problems one might encounter. We show that quantumelectrodynamics at one loop has a well-defined light-like limit.
