Linearization of homogeneous polynomials of degree n and k variables leads togeneralized Clifford algebras. Multicomplex numbers are then introduced inanalogy to complex numbers with respect to usual Clifford algebra. In turnmulticomplex extensions of trigonometric functions are constructed in terms of`compact' and `non-compact' variables. It gives rise to the natural extensionof the d-dimensional sine-Gordon field theory in the n-dimensional multicomplexspace. In dimension 2, the cases n=1,2,3,4 are identified as the quantumintegrable Liouville, sine-Gordon and known deformed Toda models. The generalcase is discussed.
