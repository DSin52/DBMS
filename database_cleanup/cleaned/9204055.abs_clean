Parametrized field theories, which are generally covariant versions ofordinary field theories, are studied from the point of view of the covariantcanonical (pre)symplectic structure. Motivated by issues arising in generaldiffeomorphism group, construction of observables, and the relationship betweenthe canonical and covariant phase spaces.
