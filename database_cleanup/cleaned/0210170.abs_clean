Centennial Conference, Pecs, HungaryPhase Space is the framework best suited for quantizing superintegrablesystems--systems with more conserved quantities than degrees of freedom. Inthis quantization method, the symmetry algebras of the hamiltonian invariantsare preserved most naturally. We illustrate the power and simplicity of themethod through new applications to nonlinear sigma-models, specifically forChiral Models and de Sitter N-spheres, where the symmetric quantum hamiltoniansamount to compact and elegant expressions, in accord with the Groenewold-vanHove theorem. Additional power and elegance is provided by the use of NambuBrackets (linked to Dirac Brackets) involving the extra invariants ofsuperintegrable models. The quantization of Nambu Brackets is then successfullycompared to that of Moyal, validating Nambu's original proposal, whileinvalidating other proposals.
