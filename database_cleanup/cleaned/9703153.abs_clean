N flavor QED in two dimensions is reduced to a quantum mechanics problem withN degrees of freedom for which the potential is determined by the ground stateof the problem itself. The chiral condensate is determined at all values oftemperature, fermion masses, and the $\theta$ parameter. In the single flavorcase, the anomalous mass (m) dependence of the chiral condensate at$\theta=\pi$ at low temperature is found. The critical value is given by $m_c\sim .437 e/\sqrt{\pi}$.
