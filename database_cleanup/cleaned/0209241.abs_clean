These lectures provide an introduction to the microscopic description ofbranes in curved backgrounds. After a brief reminder of the flat space theory,the basic principles and techniques of (rational) boundary conformal fieldtheory are presented in the second lecture. The general formalism is thenillustrated through a detailed discussion of branes on compact group manifolds.In the final lecture, many more recent developments are reviewed, includingsome results for non-compact target spaces.
