We improve the heavy quark potential, extracted from the Wilson loop averagein the Ads/CFT approach by taking the quantum fluctuation of the only radialcoordinate of $Ads_5$ which is transverse to the world-sheet of the classicalNambu-Goto string in the static gauge, and obtain the universalL{\"u}scher-Symanzik-Weisz/L{\"u}scher term.
