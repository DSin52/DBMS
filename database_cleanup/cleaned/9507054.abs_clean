The full cohomology ring of the Lian-Zuckerman type operators (states) in${\hat c_M}<1$ Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond (NSR) string theory is argued to begenerated by three elements $x$, $y$ and $w$ in analogy with the correspondingresults in the bosonic case. The ground ring generators $x$ and $y$ arenon-invertible and belong to the Ramond sector whereas the higher ghost numberoperators are generated by an invertible element $w$ with ghost number one lessthan that of the ground ring generators and belongs to either Neveu-Schwarz(NS) or Ramond (R) sector depending on whether we consider (even, even) or(odd, odd) series coupled to $2d$ supergravity. We explicitly construct theseoperators (states) and illustrate our result with an example of pure Liouvillesupergravity.
