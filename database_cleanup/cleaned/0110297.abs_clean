Title: Symplectic Quantization of Open Strings and Noncommutativity in Branes

Authors: Nelson R. F. Braga and Cresus F. L. Godinho

Comments: We included a comparison with previous results obtained from Dirac

quantization, emphasizing the fact that in the symplectic case the boundaryconditions, that lead to the non commutativity, show up from the directapplication of the standard method. Version to appear in Phys. Rev. DJournal-ref: Phys.Rev. D65 (2002) 085030

We show how to translate boundary conditions into constraints in thesymplectic quantization method by an appropriate choice of generalizedvariables. This way the symplectic quantization of an open string attached to abrane in the presence of an antisymmetric background field reproduces the noncommutativity of the brane coordinates.
