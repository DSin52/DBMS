We discuss the large $N$ limit of the supersymmetric $CP^N$ models as anillustration of Cecotti and Vafa's $tt^*$ formalism. In this limit the `$tt^*$equation' becomes the long wavelength limit of the $2D$ Toda lattice, anequation first studied in the context of self-dual gravity. We show how simplefinite temperature and large $N$ techniques determine the relevant solution,and verify analytically that it solves the $tt^*$ equation, using Legendretransform techniques from self-dual gravity.
