It is shown that the vacuum value of the $2d$ gravity stress tensor in thefree field theory is singular in the fundamental region on the complex planewhere the genus-$n>1$ Riemann surface are mapped. Because of the abovesingularity, one can not construct modular invariant multi-loop amplitudes. Thediscussed singularity is due to the singularity in the vacuum value of the $2d$gravity field that turns out to be on the genus-$n>1$ Riemann surfaces.
