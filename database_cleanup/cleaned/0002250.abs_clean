theories, supersymmetry and unificationWe discuss general spinning p-branes of string and M-theory and use theirthermodynamics along with the correspondence between near-horizon branesolutions and field theories with 16 supercharges to describe the thermodynamicbehavior of these theories in the presence of voltages under the R-symmetry.The thermodynamics is used to provide two pieces of evidence in favor of asmooth interpolation function between the free energy at weak and strongcoupling of the field theory. (i) A computation of the boundaries of stabilityshows that for the D2, D3, D4, M2 and M5-branes the critical values of Omega/Tin the two limits are remarkably close and (ii) The tree-level R^4 correctionsto the spinning D3-brane generate a decrease in the free energy at strongcoupling towards the weak coupling result. We also comment on thegeneralization to spinning brane bound states and their thermodynamics, whichare relevant for non-commutative field theories.
