Symposium, Karpacz, Poland 25-27 September 1996Self-dual 2-forms in D=2n dimensions are characterised by an eigenvaluecriterion. The equivalence of various definitions of self-duality is proven. Weshow that the self-dual 2-forms determine a n^2-n+1 dimensional manifold S_{2n}and the dimension of the maximal linear subspaces of S_{2n}$ is equal to theRadon-Hurwitz number of linearly independent vector fields on the sphereS^{2n-1}. The relation between the maximal linear subspaces and therepresentations of Clifford algebras is noted. A general procedure based onthis relation for the explicit construction of linearly self-dual 2-forms isgiven. The construction of the octonionic instanton solution in D=8 dimensionsis discussed.
