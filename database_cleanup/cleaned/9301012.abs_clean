Title: A Solvable Model for Intersecting Loops

Comments: 9 pages LaTex, uses epsf.sty

We show that some models with non-local (and non-localizable) interactionshave a property, called quasi-locality, which allows for the definition of atransfer matrix. We give the Yang-Baxter equation as a sufficient condition forthe existence of a family of commuting transfer matrices and solve them for aloop model with intersections. This solvable model is then analyzed in somedetail and its applications to a Lorentz gas are briefly discussed.
