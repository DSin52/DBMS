(R-channel) TBA is elaborated to find the effective central charge dependenceon the boundary parameters for the massless boundary sine-Gordon model with thecoupling constant $(8\pi)/\beta^2 = 1+ \lambda$ with $\lambda$ a positiveinteger. Numerical analysis of the massless boundary TBA demonstrates thatexcited state contributions should be included to have the right behavior ofthe effective central charge.
