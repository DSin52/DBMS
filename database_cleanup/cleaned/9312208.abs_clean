By using the free field realizations, we analyze the representation theory ofthe W_{1+infinity} algebra with c=1. The eigenvectors for the Cartan subalgebraof W_{1+infinity} are parametrized by the Young diagrams, and explicitlywritten down by W_{1+infinity} generators. Moreover, their eigenvalues and fullcharacter formula are also obtained.
