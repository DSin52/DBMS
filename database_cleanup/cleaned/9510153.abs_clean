We present mechanisms for generating conical singularities both in three andfour-dimensions in the systems with copies of scalar or chiral multipletscoupled to $N=2$ or $N=1$ supergravity. Our mechanisms are useful forsupersymmetry breaking, maintaining the zero cosmological constants in threeand four-dimensions. A strong coupling duality connecting these twodimensionalities is also studied.
