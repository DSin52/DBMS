Physics, August 1991)Two-dimensional gravity in the light-cone gauge was shown by Polyakov toexhibit an underlying $SL(2,R)$ Kac-Moody symmetry, which may be used toexpress the energy-momentum tensor for the metric component $h_{++}$ in termsof the $SL(2,R)$ currents {\it via}\ the Sugawara construction. We review somerecent results which show that in a similar manner, $W_\infty$ and$W_{1+\infty}$ gravities have underlying $SL(\infty,R)$ and $GL(\infty,R)$Kac-Moody symmetries respectively.
