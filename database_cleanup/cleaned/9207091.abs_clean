We show that the isometries of the manifold of scalars in $N=2$ supergravityin $d=5$ space-time dimensions can be broken by the supergravity interactions.The opposite conclusion holds for the dimensionally reduced $d=4$ theories,where the isometries of the scalar manifold are always symmetries of the fulltheory. These spaces, which form a subclass of the {\em special} K\"ahlermanifolds, are relevant for superstring compactifications.
