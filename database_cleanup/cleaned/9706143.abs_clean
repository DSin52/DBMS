The spherically symmetric reduction of higher dimensional Einstein-scalartheory leads to lower dimensional dilatonic gravity with dilaton coupled scalar(for example, from 4D to 2D system). We calculate trace anomaly and anomalyinduced effective action for 2D and 4D dilaton coupled scalars. The large-Neffective action for 2D quantum dilaton-scalar gravity is also found. These 2Dresults maybe applied for analysis of 4D spherical collapse. The role of new,dilaton dependent terms in trace anomaly for 2D black holes and Hawkingradiation is investigated in some specific models of dilatonic gravity whichrepresent modification of CGHS model. The conformal sector for 4D dilatonicgravity is constructed. Quantum back-reaction of dilaton coupled matter isbriefly discussed (it may lead to the inflationary Universe with non-trivialdilaton).
