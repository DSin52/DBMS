Title: Adventures in de Sitter space

Authors: Raphael Bousso

Comments: 15 pages, 5 figures. Contribution to Hawking Festschrift

This is my contribution to the Festschrift honoring Stephen Hawking on his60th birthday. Twenty-five years ago, Gibbons and Hawking laid out thesemi-classical properties of de Sitter space. After a summary of their mainresults, I discuss some further quantum aspects that have since beenunderstood. The largest de Sitter black hole displays an intriguing pattern ofinstabilities, which can render the boundary structure arbitrarily complicated.I review entropy bounds specific to de Sitter space and outline a few of thestrategies and problems in the search for a full quantum theory of thespacetime.
