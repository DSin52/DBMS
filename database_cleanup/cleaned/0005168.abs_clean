Title: AdS/CFT Dualities and the Unitary Representations of Non-compact Groups

Authors: Murat Gunaydin

I review the relationship between AdS/CFT (anti-de Sitter / conformal fieldtheory) dualities and the general theory of positive energy unitaryrepresentations of non-compact space-time groups and supergroups. I show, inparticular, how one can go from the manifestly unitary compact basis of thelowest weight (positive energy) representations of the conformal group (Wignerpicture) to the manifestly covariant coherent state basis (Dirac picture). Thecoherent states labelled by the space-time coordinates correspond to covariantfields with a definite conformal dimension. These results extend to higherdimensional Minkowskian spacetimes as well as generalized spacetimes defined byJordan algebras and Jordan triple systems. The second part of my talk discussesthe extension of the above results to conformal supergroups of Minkowskiansuperspaces as well as of generalized superspaces defined by Jordansuperalgebras. The (super)-oscillator construction of generalized(super)-conformal groups can be given a dynamical realization in terms ofgeneralized (super)-twistor fields.
