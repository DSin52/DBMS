We describe a novel duality symmetry of Phi(4)-theory defined onnoncommutative Euclidean space and with noncommuting momentum coordinates. Thisduality acts on the fields by Fourier transformation and scaling. It is anextension, to interactions defined with a star-product, of that which arises inquantum field theories of non-interacting scalar particles coupled to aconstant background electromagnetic field. The dual models are in general ofthe same original form but with transformed coupling parameters, while incertain special cases all parameters are essentially unchanged. Using aparticular regualarization we show, to all orders of perturbation theory, thatthat this duality also persists at the quantum level. We also point out variousother properties of this class of noncommutative field theories.
