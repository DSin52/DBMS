Title: Strings and Noncommutativity

Authors: Louise Dolan and Chiara R. Nappi

Comments: Lectures given at the String Theory Conferences in Hangzho and

Beijing, 14 pages, LatexIn these talks we review some of the recent results on open strings andnoncommutative gauge theories, starting from the early calculations of openstrings in a constant electromagnetic background. We discuss both the neutralstring and the charged string. In the latter case, the scaling limit that leadsto noncommutative abelian gauge theory can be generalized to a scaling limit inwhich multiple noncommutativity parameters enter. Our approach corresponds toexpanding a theory with U(N) Chan-Paton factors around a background U(1)^Ngauge field with different magnetic fields in each U(1). This scaling limit canbe interpreted in terms of a matrix model. We also describe an open stringmodel with a time-dependent noncommutativity parameter. This model is the openstring version of a WZW model based on a non-semi-simple group. It has atime-dependent background, and a spacetime metric of the plane wave typesupported by a Neveu-Schwarz two-form potential.
