By examining multi-instantons in N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) gauge theory, wederive, on very general grounds, and to all orders in the instanton number, arelationship between the prepotential F(Phi), and the coordinate on the quantummoduli space u=<Tr Phi^2>. This relation was previously obtained by Matone inthe context of the explicit Seiberg-Witten low-energy solution of the model.Our findings can be viewed as a multi-instanton check of the proposed exactresults in supersymmetric gauge theory.
