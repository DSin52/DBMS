Title: Explicit Computations for the Intersection Numbers on Grassmannians, and

on the Space of Holomorphic Maps from CP^1 into G_r(C^n)Comments: 16 pages, LaTeX

We derive some explicit expressions for correlators on Grassmannian G_r(C^n)as well as on the moduli space of holomorphic maps, of a fixed degree d, fromsphere into the Grassmannian. Correlators obtained on the Grassmannain are afirst step generalization of the Schubert formula for the self-intersection.The intersection numbers on the moduli space for r=2,3 are given explicitly bytwo closed formulas, when r=2 the intersection numbers, are found to generatethe alternate Fibonacci numbers, the Pell numbers and in general a random walkof a particle on a line with absorbing barriers. For r=3 the intersectionnumbers form a well organized pattern.
