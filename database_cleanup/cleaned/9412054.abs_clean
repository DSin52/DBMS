Title: Combinatorial constructions of modules for infinite-dimensional Lie

algebras, I. Principal subspaceComments: 43 pages, latex, two tables; revised and extended version

This is the first of a series of papers studying combinatorial (with no``subtractions'') bases and characters of standard modules for affine Liealgebras, as well as various subspaces and ``coset spaces'' of these modules.In part I we consider certain standard modules for the affine Lie algebraconstruct bases for their principal subspaces (introduced and studied recentlycolor $i,\;1\leq i \leq n,$ and a charge $s,\; 1\leq s \leq k,$ are assigned toeach part of a partition, so that the parts of the same color and charge complywith certain difference conditions. The parts represent ``Fouriercoefficients'' of vertex operators and can be interpreted as``quasi-particles'' enjoying (two-particle) statistical interaction related tothe Cartan matrix of $\g.$ In the particular case of vacuum modules, thecharacter formula associated with our basis is the one announced in [FS]. Newcombinatorial characters are proposed for the whole standard vacuum$\ga$-modules at level one.
