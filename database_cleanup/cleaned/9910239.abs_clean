We present a new generalized topological current in terms of the orderparameter field $\vec \phi$ to describe the arbitrary dimensional topologicaldefects. By virtue of the $% \phi$-mapping method, we show that the topologicaldefects are generated from the zero points of the order parameter field $\vec\phi$, and the topological charges of these topological defects are topologicalquantized in terms of the Hopf indices and Brouwer degrees of $\phi$-mappingunder the condition that the Jacobian $% J(\frac \phi v)\neq 0$. When $J(\frac\phi v)=0$, it is shown that there exist the crucial case of branch process.Based on the implicit function theorem and the Taylor expansion, we detail thebifurcation of generalized topological current and find different directions ofthe bifurcation. The arbitrary dimensional topological defects are foundsplitting or merging at the degenerate point of field function $\vec \phi $ butthe total charge of the topological defects is still unchanged.
