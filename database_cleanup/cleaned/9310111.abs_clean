We consider a model which effectively restricts the functional integral ofYang--Mills theories to the fundamental modular region. Using algebraicarguments, we prove that this theory has the same divergences as ordinary YangMills theory in the Landau gauge and that it is unitary. The restriction of thefunctional integral is interpreted as a kind of spontaneous breakdown of the$BRS$ symmetry.
