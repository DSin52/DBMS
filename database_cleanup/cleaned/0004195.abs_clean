A strong coupling limit of theories whose low-energy effective field theoryis 5-dimensional N=8 supergravity is proposed in which the gravitationalcoupling becomes large. It is argued that, if this limit exists, it should be a6-dimensional theory with (4,0) supersymmetry compactified on a circle whoseradius gives the 5-dimensional Planck length. The sector corresponding to theD=5 supergravity multiplet is a (4,0) D=6 superconformal field theory based onthe (4,0) multiplet with 27 self-dual 2-forms, 42 scalars and, instead of agraviton, a fourth-rank tensor gauge field satisfying a self-dualityconstraint. The superconformal field theory has 32 supersymmetries and 32conformal supersymmetries and its dimensional reduction gives the maximalsupergravity in five dimensions. Electromagnetic duality generalises to agravitational triality.
