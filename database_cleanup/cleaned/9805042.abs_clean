The approach to the dynamics of a charged particle in the Born-Infeldnonlinear electrodynamics developed in [Phys. Lett. A 240 (1998) 8] isgeneralized to include a Born-Infeld dyon. Both Hamiltonian and Lagrangianstructures of many dyons interacting with nonlinear electromagnetism areconstructed. All results are manifestly duality invariant.
