Title: Consistency of Quantum Background Independence

Comments: 23 pages, phyzzx

We analyse higher order background independence conditions arising frommultiple commutators of background deformations in quantum closed string fieldtheory. The conditions are shown to amount to a vanishing theorem for$\Delta_S$ cohomology classes. This holds by virtue of the existence of modulispaces of higher genus surfaces with two kinds of punctures. Our result is ageneralisation of a previous genus zero analysis relevant to the classicaltheory.
