The low energy structures of N=1 supersymmetric models with E_6, F_4 and E_7gauge groups and fundamental irrep matter contents are studied herein. Weidentify sets of gauge invariant composites which label all flat directions inthe confining/Higgs phases of these theories. The impossibility of mappingseveral of these primary operators rules out previously conjectured exceptionalself duals reported in the literature.
