In this work we calculate the low-energy effective action for gravity withtorsion, obtained after the integration of scalar and fermionic matter fields,using the local momentum representation based on the Riemann normal coordinatesexpansion. By considering this expansion around different space-time points, wealso compute the nonlocal terms together with the more usual divergent ones.Finally we discuss the applicability of our results to the calculation ofparticle production probabilities.
