We discuss hidden symmetries of three-dimensional field configurationsrevealed at the one-particle level by the use of pseudoclassical particlemodels. We argue that at the quantum field theory level, these can be naturallyexplained in terms of manifest symmetries of the reduced phase spaceHamiltonian of the corresponding field systems.
