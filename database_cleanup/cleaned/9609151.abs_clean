Nonvanishing tadpoles and possible infinities associated in the multiparticleamplitudes are discussed with regard to the disk and $RP^{2}$ diagrams of theType I' compactification. We find that the infinity cancellation of $SO(32)$type $I$ theory extends to this case as well despite the presence of tadpoleslocalized in the D-brane world-volume and the orientifold surfaces. Formalismof string S-matrix generating functional is presented to find a consistentcancellation of the tadpoles in the linearized approximation. Our formalismautomatically provides representation of the string amplitudes on thisbackground to all orders in $\alpha'$.
