For certain situations relations are indicated between the space-wavefunction duality of Faraggi-Matone, enhanced dispersionless KdV, and Whithamdynamics for appropriate hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces related toSeiberg-Witten theory. This paper gives refinements of hep-th/9702138 and somenew ideas.
