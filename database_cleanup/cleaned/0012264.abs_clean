Using the zeta function regularization method we calculate the ground stateenergy of scalar massive field inside a spherical region in the space-time of aCasimir energy inside a sphere of radius $R$ and make an analytical analysisabout it. We observe that this energy may be positive or negative depending onmetric coefficient $\alpha$ and non-conformal coupling $\xi$. In the limit$R\to\infty$ we found a zero result. (ii) In the second model we surround themonopole by additional sphere of radius $r_0<R$ and consider scalar fieldconfined in the region between these two spheres. In the latter, the groundstate energy presents an additional contribution due to boundary at $r_0$ whichis divergent for small radius. Additional comments about renormalization areconsidered.
