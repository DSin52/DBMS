We study the stability of the giant gravitons in the string theory backgroundwith NSNS B field. We consider the perturbation of giant gravitons formed by aprobe D$(8-p)$ brane in the background generated by D$(p-2)$-D$(p)$ branes for$2 \le p \le 5$. We use the quadratic approximation to the brane action to findthe equations of motion. For $p=5$, giant graviton configurations are stableindependent of the size of the brane. For $p \ne 5$, we calculated the range ofthe size of the brane where they are stable. We also present the modefrequencies explicitly for some special cases.
