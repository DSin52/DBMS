additional references addedPure N=1 super Yang-Mills theory can be realised as a certain low energylimit of M theory near certain singularities in $G_2$-holonomy spaces. ForSU(n) and SO(2n) gauge groups these $M$ theory backgrounds can be regarded asstrong coupling limits of wrapped D6-brane configurations in Type IIA theory oncertain non-compact Calabi-Yau spaces such as the deformed conifold. Variousaspects of such realisations are studied including the generation of thesuperpotential, domain walls, QCD strings and the relation to recent work ofVafa. In the spirit of this recent work we propose a `gravity dual' of M theorynear these singularities.
