We present a new 1/8 supersymmetric intersecting M-brane solution of D=11supergravity with two independent rotation parameters. The metric has anon-singular event horizon and the near-horizon geometry is $adS_3\timesS^3\times S^3\times\bE^2$ (just as in the non-rotating case). We also present amethod of determining the isometry supergroup of supergravity solutions fromthe Killing spinors and use it to show that for the near horizon solution it is$D(2|1,\alpha)\times D(2|1,\alpha)$ where $\alpha$ is the ratio of the two3-sphere radii. We also consider various dimensional reductions of oursolution, and the corresponding effect of these reductions on the Killingspinors and the isometry supergroups.
