Physical quark-number charges of dyons are determined, via a formula whichgeneralizes that of Witten for the electric charge, in N=2 supersymmetrictheories with $SU(2) \times U(1)^{N_f} $ gauge group. The quark numbers of themassless monopole at a nondegenerate singularity of QMS turn out to vanish inall cases. A puzzle related to CP invariant cases is solved. Generalization ofour results to $SU(N_c)\times U(1)^{N_f}$ gauge theories is straightforward.
