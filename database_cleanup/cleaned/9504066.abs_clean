We convert the self-dual model of Townsend, Pilch, and Nieuwenhuizen to afirst-class system using the generalized canonical formalism of Batalin,Fradkin, and Tyutin and show that gauge-invariant fields in the embedded modelcan be identified with observables in the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory as wellas with the fundamental fields of the self-dual model. We construct thephase-space partition function of the embedded model and demonstrate how abasic set of gauge-variant fields can play the role of either the vectorpotentials in the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory or the fundamental fields of theself-dual model by appropriate choices of gauge.
