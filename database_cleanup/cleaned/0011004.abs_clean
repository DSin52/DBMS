We investigate properties of the entropy density related to a generalizedextensive statistics and derive the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equation for asystem of relativistic particles obeying such a statistics. We investigate theconformal limit of such a system. We also derive a generalized Y-system. TheGentile intermediate statistics and the statistics of gamma-ons are consideredin detail. In particular, we observe that certain thermodynamic quantities forthe Gentile statistics majorize those for the Haldane-Wu statistics.Specifically, for the effective central charges related to affine Toda modelswe obtain nontrivial inequalities in terms of dilogarithms.
