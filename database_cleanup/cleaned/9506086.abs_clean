Title: Spacetime Supersymmetry and Duality in String Theory

Comments: 6 pages, harvmac

I discuss the role of spacetime supersymmetry in the interplay betweenstrong/weak coupling duality and target space duality in string theory whicharises in string/string duality. This can be seen via the construction ofstring soliton solutions which in $N=4$ compactifications of heterotic stringtheory break more than $1/2$ of the spacetime supersymmetries but whose analogsin $N=2$ and $N=1$ compactifications break precisely $1/2$ of the spacetimesupersymmetries. As a result, these solutions may be interpreted as stablesolitons in the latter two cases, and correspond to Bogomol'nyi-saturatedstates in their respective spectra.
