The criterion for thenon-perturbative validity of the quantization is that the partition function ofthe corresponding TQFT does not vanish and that its (equivariant) BRST-algebrais free of anomalies. I sketch the construction of a TQFT whose partitionfunction is proportional to the generalized Euler-characteristic of the cosetspace $SU(n)_{gauge}/SU(n)_{global}$ with an associated equivariantBRST-algebra that manifestly preserves translational symmetry. Somenon-perturbative consequences of this approach are discussed.
