To study ``physical'' gauges such as the Coulomb, light-cone, axial ortemporal gauge, we consider ``interpolating'' gauges which interpolate linearlybetween a covariant gauge, such as the Feynman or Landau gauge, and a physicalgauge. Lorentz breaking by the gauge-fixing term of interpolating gauges iscontrolled by extending the BRST method to include not only the local gaugegroup, but also the global Lorentz group. We enumerate the possible divergencesof interpolating gauges, and show that they are renormalizable, and we showthat the expectation value of physical observables is the same as in acovariant gauge. In the second part of the article we study the Coulomb-gaugeas the singular limit of the Landau-Coulomb interpolating gauge. We find thatunrenormalized and renormalized correlation functions are finite in this limit.We also find that there are finite two-loop diagrams of ``unphysical''particles that are not present in formal canonical quantization in the Coulombgauge. We verify that in the same limit, the Gauss-BRST Ward identity holds,which is the functional analog of the operator statement that a BRSTtransformation is generated by the Gauss-BRST charge. As a consequence, $gA_0$is invariant under renormalization, whereas in a covariant gauge, no componentof the gluon field has this property.
