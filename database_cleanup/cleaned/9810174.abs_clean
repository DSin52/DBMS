Title: Spacetime at the Planck scale and Path Integral

Comments: RevTex, 3 pages, no figures, to appear in Proceedings of 6th

International Conference on Path Integral, Florence, August 1998We discuss a path integral formalism to introduce noncommutativegeneralizations of spacetime manifold in even dimensions, which have beensuggested to be reasonable effective pictures at very small length scales, ofthe order of Planck length.
