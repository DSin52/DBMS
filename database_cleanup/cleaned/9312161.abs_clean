We construct a classical action for a system of $N$ point-like sources whichcarry SU(2) non-Abelian charges coupled to non-Abelian Chern-Simons gaugefields, and develop a quantum mechanics for them. Adopting the coherent statequantization and solving the Gauss' constraint in an appropriately chosengauge, we obtain a quantum mechanical Hamiltonian given in terms of theKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection. Then we study the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohmeffect, employing the obtained Hamiltonian for two-particle sector. An explicitevaluation of the differential cross section for the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohmscattering is given.
