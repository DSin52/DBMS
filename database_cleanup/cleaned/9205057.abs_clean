We discuss a new method of integration over matrix variables based on asuitable gauge choice in which the angular variables decouple from theeigenvalues at least for a class of two-matrix models. The calculation ofcorrelation functions involving angular variables is simple in this gauge.Where the method is applicable it also gives an extremely simple proof of theclassical integration formula used to reduce multi-matrix models to an integralover the eigenvalues.
