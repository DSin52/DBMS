The D-brane spectrum of a $\Zop_2\times\Zop_2$ Calabi-Yau three-fold orbifoldof toroidally compactified Type IIA and Type IIB string theory is analysedsystematically. The corresponding K-theory groups are determined and completeagreement is found. New kinds of stable non-BPS D-branes are found, whosestability regions are far more complicated than the previously discussednon-BPS D-branes. The decay channels of non-BPS D-branes beyond their stabilityregions are identified. Finally the T-dual orbifold is analysed and a suitableK-theory is found.
