A hidden gauge theory structure of quantum mechanics which is invisible inits conventional formulation is uncovered. Quantum mechanics is shown to beequivalent to a certain Yang-Mills theory with an infinite-dimensional gaugegroup and a nondynamical connection. It is defined over an arbitrary symplecticmanifold which constitutes the phase-space of the system under consideration.The ''matter fields'' are local generalizations of states and observables; theyassume values in a family of local Hilbert spaces (and their tensor products)which are attached to the points of phase-space. Under local frame rotationsthey transform in the spinor representation of the metaplectic group Mp(2N),the double covering of Sp(2N). The rules of canonical quantization are replacedby two independent postulates with a simple group theoretical and differentialgeometrical interpretation. A novel background-quantum split symmetry plays acentral role.
