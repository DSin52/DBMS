Title: Non-Grassmann "Classicization" of Fermion Dynamics

Comments: 7 pages, LaTeX

A carefully motivated symmetric variant of the Poisson bracket in ordinary(not Grassmann) phase space variables is shown to satisfy identities which arein algebraic correspondence with the anticommutation postulates for quantizedFermion systems. "Symplecticity" in terms of this symmetric Poisson bracketimplies generalized Hamilton's equations that can only be of Schroedinger type(e.g., the Dirac equation but not the Klein-Gordon or Maxwell equations). Thisrestriction also excludes the old "four-Fermion" theory of beta decay.
