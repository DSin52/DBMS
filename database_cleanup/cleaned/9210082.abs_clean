gives new results on correlation functions. )It is shown that conformal matter with $c_{\ssc L}\not=c_{\ssc R}$ can beconsistently coupled to two-dimensional `frame' gravity. The theory isquantized in conformal gauge, following David, and Distler and Kawai. There isno analogue of the $c=1$ barrier found in nonchiral non-critical strings. Anon-critical heterotic string is constructed---it has 744 states in itsspectrum, transforming in the adjoint representation of $(E_8)^3.$ Correlationfunctions are calculated in this example, revealing the existence of extradiscrete states.
