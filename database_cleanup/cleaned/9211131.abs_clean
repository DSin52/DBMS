The technique of $Q$-polinomials are used to derive the $w$- constraints inthe two-matrix and Kontsevich-like model at finite $N$. These constraints areclosed and form Lie algebra. They are associated with the matrices, $\lambda^n{\partial}_\lambda^m$ with $n,m\geq 0$. In the case of two-matrix model theycan be reduced to the $W$-constraints of \cite{8}. For the case ofKontsevich-like model and two-matrix model with the finite polinomialpotential, the number of constraints are limited by the power of the finitematrix potential i.e. the spin of $w$-s coincide with that power. Thisstatement is the natural consequence of the form of constraints.
