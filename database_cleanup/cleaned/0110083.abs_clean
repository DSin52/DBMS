We consider the bosonic fields which describe a particle which may exist instates with spins one and zero with different masses. All the linearlyindependent solutions of the equation for a free particle are obtained in theform of the projection matrix-dyads (density-matrices). The interaction withanomalous magnetic dipole and quadruple electric moments of a particle isstudied. The Hamiltonian form of the first order equation has beeninvestigated.
