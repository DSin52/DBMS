Comments: 10 pages, Latex, aipxfm.sty, fix2col.sty; Based on talk given at 10th

Tohwa International Symposium on String Theory, Tohwa Univ., Fukuoka,(Japan), July 3-7, 2001In my talk I shall consider the mechanism of self-expansion of a system of ND0-branes into high-dimensional non-commutative world-volume investigated byHarmark and Savvidy. Here D2-brane is formed due to the internal angularmomentum of D0-brane system. The idea is that attractive force of tensionshould be cancelled by the centrifugal motion preventing a D-brane system fromcollapse to a lower-dimensional one. I shall also present a new extendedsolution where a total of 9 space dimensions is used to embed a D0-branesystem. In the last section, by performing linear analysis, the stability ofthe system is demonstrated.
