We consider freely acting orbifold compactifications, which interpolate intwo possible decompactification limits between the supersymmetric type IIstring and the non-supersymmetric type 0 string. In particular we discuss howD-branes are incorporated into these orbifold models. Investigating the openstring spectrum on D3-branes, we will show that one can interpolate in this waybetween N=4 supersymmetric U(N) respectively U(2N) Yang-Mills theories andnon-supersymmetric U(N)*U(N) gauge theories with adjoint massless scalar fieldsplus bifundamental massless fermions in a smooth way. Finally, by lifting theorbifold construction to M-theory, we conjecture some duality relations andshow that in particular a new supersymmetric branch of gauge like theoriesemanate for the non-supersymmetric model.
