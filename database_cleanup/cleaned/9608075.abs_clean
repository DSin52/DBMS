The holomorphic homogeneous prepotential encoding the special geometry of thespecial K\"ahler manifolds ${\textstyle SU(1,n)\over \textstyle U(1)\otimesSU(n)}$ is constructed using the symplectic embedding of the isometry group$SU(1,n)$ into $Sp(2n+2,{\hbox{\bf R}})$. Also the automorphic functions ofthese manifolds are discussed.
