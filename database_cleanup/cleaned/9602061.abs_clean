123-132String duality suggests a fascinating juxtoposition of world-volume andtarget-space dynamics. This is particularly apparent in the $D$-branedescription of stringy solitons that forms a major focus of this article (whichis {\it not} intended to be a comprehensive review of this extensive subject).1. The oligarchy of string world-sheets2. $p$-branes and world-volumes3. World-sheets for world-volumes4. Boundary states, $D$-branes and space-time supersymmetry[This article is based on a talk presented at the CERN Workshop on StringDuality (December, 1995) and the published version of a talk at the BuckowSymposium (September, 1995).]
