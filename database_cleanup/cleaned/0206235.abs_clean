The momentum density conjugate to a bosonic quantum field splits naturallyinto the sum of a classical component and a nonclassical component. It is shownthat the field and the nonclassical component of the momentum density satisfyan_exact_ uncertainty relation, i.e., an equality, which underlies theHeisenberg-type uncertainty relation for fields. This motivates a new approachto bosonic quantum fields based on an exact uncertainty principle. Inparticular, the postulate that an ensemble of classical fields is subject tononclassical momentum fluctuations, of a strength determined by the fielduncertainty, leads from the classical to the quantum field equations. Examplesinclude scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational fields. For the latter casethe exact uncertainty principle specifies a unique (non-Laplacian) operatorordering for the Wheeler-deWitt equation.
