We give a complete classification of all simple current modular invariants,extending previous results for $(\Zbf_p)^k$ to arbitrary centers. We obtain asimple explicit formula for the most general case. Using orbifold techniques tothis end, we find a one-to-one correspondence between simple current invariantsand subgroups of the center with discrete torsions.  As a by-product, we provethe conjectured monodromy independence of the total number of such invariants.The orbifold approach works in a straightforward way for symmetries of oddorder, but some modifications are required to deal with symmetries of evenorder. With these modifications the orbifold construction with discrete torsionis complete within the class of simple current invariants. Surprisingly, thereare cases where discrete torsion is a necessity rather than a possibility.
