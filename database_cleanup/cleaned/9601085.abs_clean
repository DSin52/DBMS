We analyze the spectrum of dyons in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory withgauge group SU(3) spontaneously broken down to U(1)xU(1). The Higgs fieldsselect a natural basis of simple roots. Acting with S-duality on the W-bosonstates corresponding to simple roots leads to an orbit of BPS dyon states thatare magnetically charged with respect to one of the U(1)'s. The correspondingmonopole solutions can be obtained by embedding SU(2) monopoles into SU(3) andthe S-duality predictions reduce to the SU(2) case. Acting with S-duality onthe W-boson corresponding to a non-simple root leads to an infinite set of newS-duality predictions. The simplest of these corresponds to the existence of aharmonic form on the moduli space of SU(3) monopoles that have magnetic charge(1,1) with respect to the two U(1)'s. We argue that the moduli space is givenby R^3x(R^1xM)/Z_2, where M is Euclidean Taub-NUT space, and that the latteradmits the appropriate normalizable harmonic two form. We briefly discuss thegeneralizations to other gauge groups.
