We apply the supersymmetric procedure to one-step random walks in onedimension at the level of the usual master equation, extending a studyinitiated by H.R. Jauslin [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 41}, 3407 (1990)]. A discussion ofthe supersymmetric technique for this discrete case is presented by introducinga formal second-order discrete master derivative and its ``square root", and wesolve completely, and in matrix form, the cases of homogeneous random walks(constant jumping rates). A simple generalization of Jauslin's results to twouncorrelated axes is also provided. There may be many applications, especiallyto bistable and multistable one-step processes.
