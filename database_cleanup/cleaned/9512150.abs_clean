In our paper~\cite{KR} we began a systematic study of representations of theuniversal central extension $\widehat{\Cal D}\/$ of the Lie algebra ofdifferential operators on the circle. This study was continued in thepaper~\cite{FKRW} in the framework of vertex algebra theory. It was shown thatthe associated to $\widehat {\Cal D}\/$ simple vertex algebra $W_{1+ \infty,N}\/$ with positive integral central charge $N\/$ is isomorphic to theclassical vertex algebra $W (gl_N)$, which led to a classification of modulesover $W_{1 + \infty, N}$. In the present paper we study the remainingnon-trivial case, that of a negative central charge $-N$. The basic tool is thedecomposition of $N\/$ pairs of free charged bosons with respect to $gl_N\/$and the commuting with $gl_N\/$ Lie algebra of infinite matrices$\widehat{gl}$.
