There are $N-1$ classes of kink solutions in $SU(N)\times Z_2$. We show howinteractions between various kinks depend on the classes of individual kinks aswell as on their orientations with respect to each other in the internal space.In particular, we find that the attractive or repulsive nature of theinteraction depends on the trace of the product of charges of the two kinks. Wecalculate the interaction potential for all combinations of kinks and antikinksin $SU(5)\times Z_2$ and study their collisions. The outcome of kink-antikinkcollisions, as expected from previous studies, is sensitive to their initialrelative velocity. We find that heavier kinks tend to break up into lighterones, while interactions between the lightest kinks and antikinks in this modelcan be repulsive as well as attractive.
