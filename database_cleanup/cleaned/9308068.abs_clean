An infinite family of cornucopions is found within the $SU(2)\times U(1)$sector of the 4--d heterotic string low-energy theory, the extremal $U(1)$magnetic dilatonic black hole being the lowest energy state. Non-abeliancornucopions are interpreted as sphalerons associated with potential barriersseparating topologically distinct Yang-Mills vacua on the $U(1)$ cornucopionbackground. A mass formula for non-abelian dilatonic black holes is derived,and the free energy is calculated through the Euclidean action.
