We consider a Hamiltonian analysis of the Liouville theory and constructionof symmetry generators using Castellani's method. We then discuss thelight-cone gauge fixed theory. In particular, we clarify the difference betweenHamiltonian approaches based on different choices of time, $\xi^0$ and $\xi^+$.Our main result is the construction of SL(2,R) symmetry generators in bothcases.
