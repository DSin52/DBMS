An approach to understand Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE) usinganomalies is studied in this paper. More specifically, this is done by lookingat the anomaly in the current conservation equation of a WZNW theory describingfields living at the edge of the two dimensional Hall sample. This WZNW theoryitself comes from the non-Abelian bosonisation of fermions living at the edge.It is shown that this model can describe both integer and fractionalquantization of conductivities in a unified manner.
