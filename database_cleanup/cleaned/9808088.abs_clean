Type IIB string action on AdS_5 x S^5 constructed in hep-th/9805028 is putinto a form where it becomes quadratic in fermions. This is achieved byperforming 2-d duality (T-duality) on the action in which kappa-symmetry wasfixed in the Killing gauge in hep-th/9808038. We discuss some properties andpossible applications of the resulting action.
