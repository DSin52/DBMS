We show how the supersymmetric KdV equation can be obtained from theself-duality condition on Yang-Mills fields in four dimension associated withthe graded Lie algebra OSp(2/1). We also obtain the hierarchy of Susy KdVequations from such a condition. We formulate the Susy KdV hierarchy as avanishing curvature condition associated with the U(1) group and show how anAbelian self-duality condition in four dimension can also lead to theseequations.
