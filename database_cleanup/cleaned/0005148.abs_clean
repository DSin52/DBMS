We discuss possible D-brane configurations on SU(2) group manifolds in thesigma model approach. When we turn the boundary conditions of the spacetimefields into the boundary gluing conditions of chiral currents, we find that forall D-branes except the spherical D2-branes, the gluing matrices R^a_{b} dependon the fields, so the chiral Kac-Moody symmetry is broken, but conformalsymmetry is maintained. Matching the spherical D2-branes derived from the sigmamodel with those from the boundary state approach we obtain a U(1) fieldstrength that is consistent with flux quantization.
