The solutions of the arbitrary-spin massless wave equations over ${\bf R}^1\times H^3$ space are obtained using the generalized coherent states for theLorentz group. The use of these solutions for the construction of invariantpropagators of quantized massless fields with an arbitrary spin over the ${\bfR}^1 \times H^3$ space is considered. The expression for the scalar propagatoris obtained in the explicit form.
