Title: Superfield Description of Effective Theories on BPS Domain Walls

Comments: LaTeX file, 33 pages, 1 eps figure, some corrections made in Sec.5.4

We derive the low-energy effective theory on the BPS domain wall in 4D N=1global SUSY theories in terms of the 3D superfields. Our derivation makes thepreserved SUSY by the wall manifest and the procedure for integrating out themassive modes easier. Our procedure clarifies how the 3D superfields areembedded into the 4D chiral and vector superfields. We also point out ashortcoming of the conventional procedure for deriving the effective theory onthe wall.
