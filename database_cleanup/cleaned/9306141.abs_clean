We derive an equation which gives the tree-level scattering amplitudes fortachyons in the black hole background using the exact states of the collectivefield hamiltonian corresponding to a deformed matrix model recently proposed byJevicki and Yoneya. Using directly the symmetry algebra we obtain explicitexpression for a class of amplitudes in the tree approximation. We also studythe quantum effects in the corresponding collective field theory. Inparticular, we compute the ground state energy and the free energy at finitetemperature up to two loops, and the first quantum correction to the two-pointfunction.
