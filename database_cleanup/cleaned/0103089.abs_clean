We propose a Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formulation of boundary superstringfield theory. The superstring field action is defined in terms of a closedone-form in the space of couplings, and we compute it explicitly for exactlysolvable tachyon perturbations. We also argue that the superstring field actiondefined in this way is the partition function on the disc, in accord with aprevious proposal.
