Some mathematical inconsistencies in the conventional form of Maxwell'sequations extended by Lorentz for a single charge system are discussed. Tosurmount these in framework of Maxwellian theory, a novel convectiondisplacement current is considered as additional and complementary to thefamous Maxwell displacement current. It is shown that this form of theMaxwell-Lorentz equations is similar to that proposed by Hertz forelectrodynamics of bodies in motion. Original Maxwell's equations can beconsidered as a valid approximation for a continuous and closed (or going toinfinity) conduction current. It is also proved that our novel form of theMaxwell-Lorentz equations is relativistically invariant. In particular, arelativistically invariant gauge for quasistatic fields has been found toreplace the non-invariant Coulomb gauge. The new gauge condition contains thefamous relationship between electric and magnetic potentials for one uniformlymoving charge that is usually attributed to the Lorentz transformations.Thus, for the first time, using the convection displacement current, a physicalinterpretation is given to the relationship between the components of thefour-vector of quasistatic potentials. A rigorous application of the new gaugetransformation with the Lorentz gauge transforms the basic field equations intoan independent pair of differential equations responsible for longitudinal andtransverse fields, respectively. The longitudinal components can be interpretedexclusively from the standpoint of the instantaneous "action at a distance"concept and leads to necessary conceptual revision of the conventionalFaraday-Maxwell field. The concept of electrodynamic dualism is proposed forself-consistent classical electrodynamics. It implies simultaneous coexistence
