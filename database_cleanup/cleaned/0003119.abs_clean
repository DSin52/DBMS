This is the write-up of a set of lectures on the comparison between LatticeGauge Theories and AdS/CFT results for the non-perturbative behaviour ofnon-supersymmetric Yang Mills theories. These notes are intended for studentswhich are assumed not to be experts in L.G.T. For this reason the first part isdevoted to a pedagogical introduction to the Lattice regularization of QCD. Inthe second part we discuss some basic features of the AdS/CFT correspondenceand compare the results obtained in the non-supersymmetric limit with thoseobtained on the Lattice. We discuss in particular the behaviour of the stringtension and of the glueball spectrum. Lectures delivered at the School ofTheoretical Physics (S.N.F.T.), Parma, September 1999.
