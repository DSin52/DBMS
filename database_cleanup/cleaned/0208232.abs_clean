We construct the string states $|O_{p}^J>_J$, $|O_{q}^{J_1}>_{{J_1}{J_2}}$and $|O_{0}^{J_{1}J_{2}}>_{{J_1}{J_2}}$ in the Hilbert space of the quantummechanical orbifold model so as to calculate the three point functions and thematrix elements of the light-cone Hamiltonian from the interacting string bitmodel. With these string states we show that the three point functions and thematrix elements of the Hamiltonian derived from the interacting string bitmodel up to $g^{2}_2$ order precisely match with those computed from theperturbative SYM theory in BMN limit.
