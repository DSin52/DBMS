Radiative corrections arising from the axial coupling of charged fermions toa constant vector b_\mu can induce a Lorentz- and CPT-violating Chern-Simonsterm in the QED action. We calculate the exact one-loop correction to this termkeeping the full b_\mu dependence, and show that in the physically interestingcases it coincides with the lowest-order result. The effect of regularizationand renormalization and the implications of the result are briefly discussed.
