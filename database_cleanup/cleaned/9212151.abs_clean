Title: Beyond Supersymmetry and Quantum Symmetry (an introduction to braided

groups and braided matrices)Authors: Shahn Majid

Comments: 52 pages, DAMTP/92-71 (to appear in Proc. 5th Nankai Workshop, China,

June 92, Wld Sci.) Some typos corrected in this replacement re. eqns (77),(101), (121). Also, the figures are now submitted as Figures file to thedatabaseThis is a systematic introduction for physicists to the theory of algebrasand groups with braid statistics, as developed over the last three years by theauthor. There are braided lines, braided planes, braided matrices and braidedgroups all in analogy with superlines, superplanes etc. The main idea is thatthe bose-fermi $\pm1$ statistics between Grassmannn coordinates is now replacedby a general braid statistics $\Psi$, typically given by a Yang-Baxter matrix$R$. Most of the algebraic proofs are best done by drawing knot and tanglediagrams, yet most constructions in supersymmetry appear to generalise well.Particles of braid statistics exist and can be expected to be described in thisway. At the same time, we find many applications to ordinary quantum groupchains, action-angle variables for quantum groups, vector addition on$q$-Minkowski space and a semidirect product q-Poincar\'e group are among themain applications so far. Every quantum group can be viewed as a braided group,so the theory contains quantum group theory as well as supersymmetry. Therealso appears to be a rich theory of braided geometry, more general thansuper-geometry and including aspects of quantum geometry. Braided-derivationsobey a braided-Leibniz rule and recover the usual Jackson $q$-derivative as the1-dimensional case.
