We discuss gauge transformations in QED coupled to a charged spinor field,and examine whether we can gauge-transform the entire formulation of the theoryfrom one gauge to another, so that not only the gauge and spinor fields, butalso the forms of the operator-valued Hamiltonians are transformed. Thediscussion includes the covariant gauge, in which the gauge condition andGauss's law are not primary constraints on operator-valued quantities; it alsoincludes the Coulomb gauge, and the spatial axial gauge, in which theconstraints are imposed on operator-valued fields by applying theDirac-Bergmann procedure. We show how to transform the covariant, Coulomb andspatial axial gauges to what we call``common form,'' in which all particle excitation modes have identicalproperties. We also show that, once that common form has been reached, QED indifferent gauges has a common time-evolution operator that definestime-translation for states that represent systems of electrons and photons.By combining gauge transformations with changes of representation fromstandard to common form, the entire apparatus of a gauge theory can betransformed from one gauge to another.
