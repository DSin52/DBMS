The vacuum energy density is calculated for the $O(N)$ nonlinear sigma modelsin two dimensions. To obtain $\varepsilon_{vac}$ we assume that each point ofthe space in which non-perturbative f\/ields are determined can be replaced bya sphere $S^2$ having a small radius $r$ which approaches zero at the very endof the calculation. This assumption allows to get the classical f\/ieldsgenerating v.e.v. of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor.
