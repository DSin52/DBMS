We demonstrate that the generalization of the relativistic Toda chain (RTC)is a special reduction of two-dimensional Toda Lattice hierarchy (2DTL). Thisreduction implies that the RTC is gauge equivalent to the discrete AKNShierarchy and, which is the same, to the two-component Volterra hierarchy whileits forced (semi-infinite) variant is described by the unitary matrix integral.The integrable properties of the RTC hierarchy are revealed in different$\tau$-function approach. Relativistic Toda molecule hierarchy is alsoconsidered, along with the forced RTC. Some applications to biorthogonalpolynomial systems are discussed.
