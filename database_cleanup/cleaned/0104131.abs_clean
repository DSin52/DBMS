It has recently been argued that non--BPS brane world scenarios can reproducethe small value of the cosmological constant that seems to have been measured.Objections against this proposal are discussed and necessary (but notsufficient) conditions are stated under which it may work. At least n=2 extradimensions are needed. Also, the mass matrix in the supergravity sector mustsatisfy $Str M^2=0$. Moreover, the proposal can be ruled out experimentally ifNewton's constant remains unchanged down to scales of 10 micrometers. If, onthe other hand, such a ``running Newton constant'' is observed, it couldprovide crucial experimental input for superstring phenomenology.
