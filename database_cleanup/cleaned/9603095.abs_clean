The Connes and Lott reformulation of the strong and electroweak modelrepresents a promising application of noncommutative geometry. In this schemethe Higgs field naturally appears in the theory as a particular `gauge boson',connected to the discrete internal space, and its quartic potential, fixed bythe model, is not vanishing only when more than one fermion generation ispresent. Moreover, the exact hypercharge assignments and relations among themasses of particles have been obtained. This paper analyzes the possibility ofextensions of this model to larger unified gauge groups. Noncommutativegeometry imposes very stringent constraints on the possible theories, andremarkably, the analysis seems to suggest that no larger gauge groups arecompatible with the noncommutative structure, unless one enlarges the fermionicdegrees of freedom, namely the number of particles.
