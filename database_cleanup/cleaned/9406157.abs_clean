The machinery of braided geometry introduced previously is used now toconstruct the $\epsilon$ `totally antisymmetric tensor' on a general braidedvector space determined by R-matrices. This includes natural $q$-Euclidean and$q$-Minkowski spaces. The formalism is completely covariant under thecorresponding quantum group such as $\widetilde{SO_q(4)}$ or$\widetilde{SO_q(1,3)}$. The Hodge $*$ operator and differentials are alsoconstructed in this approach.
