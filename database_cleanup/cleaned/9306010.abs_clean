We give the Heisenberg realization for the quantum algebra $U_q(sl_n)$, whichis written by the $q$-difference operator on the flag manifold. We construct itfrom the action of $U_q(sl_n)$ on the $q$-symmetric algebra $A_q(Mat_n)$ by theBorel-Weil like approach. Our realization is applicable to the construction ofthe free field realization for the $U_q(\widehat{sl_n})$ [AOS].
