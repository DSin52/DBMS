We study various three-dimensional supersymmetric Maxwell Chern-Simonssolitons by using type IIB brane configurations. We give a systematicclassification of soliton spectra such as topological BPS vortices andnontopological vortices in $\cn=2,3$ supersymmetric Maxwell Chern-Simons systemvia the branes of type IIB string theory. We identify the brane configurationswith the soliton spectra of the field theory and obtain a nice agreement withfield theory aspects. We also discuss possible brane constructions for BPSdomain wall solutions.
