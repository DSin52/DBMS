We investigate the possibility that the dimension 2 condensate A_mu^2 has anon zero non-perturbative value in Yang-Mills theory. We introduce amultiplicatively renormalisable effective potential for this condensate andshow through two loop calculations that a non zero condensate is energeticallyfavoured.
