We calculate all of vielbein superfields up to second order in anticommutingcoordinates in terms of the component fields of 11-dimensional on-shellsupergravity by using `Gauge completion'. This configuration of superspaceholds the $\kappa $-symmetry for supermembrane Lagrangian and represents11-dimensional on-shell supergravity.
