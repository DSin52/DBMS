Recently the long-standing puzzle about counting the Witten index in N=1supersymmetric gauge theories was resolved. The resolution was based onexistence (for higher orthogonal $SO(N), N \geq 7$ and exceptional gaugegroups) of flat connections on $T^{3}$ which have commuting holonomies butcannot be gauged to a Cartan torus. A number of papers has been published whichstudied moduli spaces and some topological characteristics of those flatconnections. In the present letter an explicit description of such flatconnection for the basic case of $Spin(7)$ is given.
