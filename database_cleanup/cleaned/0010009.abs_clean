Title: Normalized Weyl-type $\star$-product on K\"ahler manifolds

Authors: Takuya Masuda

Comments: to be published in Mod. Phys. Lett. A

We define a normalized Weyl-type $\star$-product on general K\"{a}hlermanifolds. Expanding this product perturbatively we show that the cumbersometerm, which appears in a Berezin-type product, does not appear at least in thefirst order of $\hbar$. This means a normalization factor, which is introducedby Reshetikhin and Takhtajan for a Berezin-type product, is unnecessary for ourWeyl-type product at that order.
