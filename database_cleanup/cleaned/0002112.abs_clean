Supersymmetry and Yang-Mills type gauge invariance are two of the essentialproperties of most, and possibly the most important models in fundamentalphysics. Supersymmetry is nearly trivial to prove in the (traditionallygauge-noncovariant) superfield formalism, whereas the gauge-covariant formalismmakes gauge invariance manifest. In 3+1-dimensions, the transformation from oneinto the other is elementary and essentially unique. By contrast, thistransformation turns out to be impossible in the most general 1+1-dimensionalcase. In fact, only the (manifestly) gauge- and supersymmetry-covariantformalism guarantees both universal gauge-invariance and supersymmetry.
