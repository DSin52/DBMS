We study the polarization states of the D0-brane in type IIA string theory.In addition to states with angular momentum and magnetic dipole moments, thereare polarization states of a single D0-brane with nonzero D2-brane dipole andmagnetic H-dipole moments, as well as quadrupole and higher moments of variouscharges. These fundamental moments of the D0-brane polarization states can bedetermined directly from the linearized couplings of background fields to theD0-brane world-volume fermions. These couplings determine the long rangesupergravity fields produced by a general polarization state, which typicallyhave non-zero values for all the bosonic fields of type IIA supergravity. Wedemonstrate the precise cancellation between spin-spin and magneticdipole-dipole interactions and an analogous cancellation between 3-form andH-field dipole-dipole interactions for a pair of D0-branes. The first of thesecancellations follows from the fact that spinning D0-brane states havegyromagnetic ratio g = 1, and the second follows from the fact that the ratiobetween the 3-form and H-field dipole moments is also 1 in natural units. Bothof these relationships can be seen immediately from the couplings in theD0-brane world-volume action.
