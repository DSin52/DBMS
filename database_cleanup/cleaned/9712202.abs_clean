Title: Infinite Statistics and Black Holes in Matrix Theory

Authors: D. Minic (Penn State)

Comments: 15 pages, plain TeX, no figures

The concept of infinite statistics is applied to the analysis of black holethermodynamics in Matrix Theory. It is argued that Matrix Theory partons,D0-branes, satisfy quantum infinite statistics, and that this observationjustifies the recently proposed Boltzmann gas model of Schwarzschild blackholes in Matrix Theory.
