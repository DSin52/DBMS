Spacetimes generated by a lightlike particle source for topologically massivegravity and its limits - Einstein gravity and the pure gravitationalChern-Simons model - are obtained both by solving the field equations and byinfinite boosts of static metrics. The resulting geometries are the first knownsolutions of topologically massive gravity that are asymptotically flat andgenerated by compact matter sources. Explicit metrics describing variousmultiphoton solutions are also derived. For Einstein gravity, we also constructsuch solutions by null boost identifications of Minkowski space and therebyobtain limits on the energies of the sources.
