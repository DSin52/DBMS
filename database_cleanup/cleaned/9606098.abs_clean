We calculate the two-loop quantum corrections, including the back-reaction ofthe Hawking radiation, to the one-loop effective metric in a unitary gaugequantization of the CGHS model of 2d dilaton gravity. The correspondingevaporating black hole solutions are analysed, and consistent semi-classicalgeometries appear in the weak-coupling region of the spacetime when the widthof the matter pulse is larger then the short-distance cutoff. A consistentsemi-classical geometry also appears in the limit of a shock-wave matter. TheHawking radiation flux receives non-thermal corrections such that it vanishesfor late times and the total radiated mass is finite. There are no staticremnants for matter pulses of finite width, although a BPP type static remnantappears in the shock-wave limit. Semi-classical geometries without curvaturesingularities can be obtained as well. Our results indicate that higher-orderloop corrections can remove the singularities encountered in the one-loopsolutions.
