Title: On the definiteness of the conformal anomaly in nonconformal gauges

Authors: W. M\"odritsch

Comments: 8pages, LaTeX, TUW-93-19

The critical dimension of the bosonic string in the harmonic and the deDondergauge may be calculated from the time ordered product of two energy momentumtensors. We show that recently found ambiguities within that method innonconformal gauges can be resolved by a treatment respecting backgroundcovariance.
