We consider string theory on AdS_3 in terms of the Wakimoto free fieldrepresentation. The scattering amplitudes for N unitary tachyons are analysedin the factorization limit and the poles corresponding to the mass-shellconditions for physical states are extracted. The vertex operators for excitedlevels are obtained from the residues and their properties are examined.Negative norm states are found at the second mass level.
