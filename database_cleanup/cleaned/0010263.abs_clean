We use the correspondence between string states and local operators on theworld-sheet boundary defined by vertex operators in open string theory to putin correspondence, holographically, the bosonic open string with the large Nlimit of a mechanical system living on the world-sheet boundary. We give anatural interpretation of this system in terms of a one-dimensional stochasticprocess and show that the correspondence takes the form of a map between twoconformal field theories with central charge c=24 and c=1.
