Following the work of Kinnersley and Walker for flat spacetimes, we haveanalyzed the anti-de Sitter C-metric in a previous paper. In the de Sittercase, Podolsky and Griffiths have established that the de Sitter C-metric (dSC-metric) found by Plebanski and Demianski describes a pair of acceleratedblack holes in the dS background with the acceleration being provided (inaddition to the cosmological constant) by a strut that pushes away the twoblack holes or, alternatively, by a string that pulls them. We extend theiranalysis mainly in four directions. First, we draw the Carter-Penrose diagramsof the massless uncharged dS C-metric, of the massive uncharged dS C-metric andof the massive charged dS C-metric. These diagrams allow us to clearly identifythe presence of two dS black holes and to conclude that they cannot interactgravitationally. Second, we revisit the embedding of the dS C-metric in the 5DMinkowski spacetime and we represent the motion of the dS C-metric origin inthe dS 4-hyperboloid as well as the localization of the strut. Third, wecomment on the physical properties of the strut that connects the two blackholes. Finally, we find the range of parameters that correspond to non-extremeblack holes, extreme black holes, and naked particles.
