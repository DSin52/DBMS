Title: Remarks on the Atick-Witten behavior and strings near black hole

horizonsComments: 12 pages, latex, no figures

We present arguments pointing to a behavior of the string free energy in thepresence of a black hole horizon similar to the Atick-Witten dependence ontemperature beyond the Hagedorn transition. We give some evidence based onorbifold techniques applied to Rindler space and further support is foundwithin a Hamiltonian approach. However, we argue that the interpretation interms of a reduction of degrees of freedom is confronted by serious problems.Finally, we point out the problems concerning heuristic red-shift arguments andthe local interpretation of thermodynamical quantities.
