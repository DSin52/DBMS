Title: Finiteness of multi-loop superstring amplitudes

Authors: G. S. Danilov

Comments: 16 pages, LaTeX

Superstring amplitudes of an arbitrary genus are calculated throughsuper-Schottky parameters by a summation over the fermion strings. For acalculation of divergent multi-loop fermion string amplitudes a supermodularinvariant regularization procedure is used. A cancellation of divergences inthe superstring amplitudes is established. Grassmann variables are integrated,the superstring amplitudes are obtained to be explicitly finite and modularinvariant.
