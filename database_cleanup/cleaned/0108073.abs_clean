We study a scalar-tensor bimetric cosmology in the Randall-Sundrum model withone positive tension brane, where the biscalar field is assumed to be confinedon the brane. The effective Friedmann equations on the brane are obtained andanalyzed. We comment on resolution of cosmological problems in this bimetricmodel.
