We present a systematic and 'from the ground up' analysis of the 'minimalcoupling' type of gauging of Yang-Mills symmetries in (2,2)-supersymmetric1+1-dimensional spacetime. Unlike in the familiar 3+1-dimensional N=1supersymmetric case, we find several distinct types of minimal couplingsymmetry gauging, and so several distinct types of gauge (super)fields, some ofwhich entirely novel. Also, we find that certain (quartoid) constrainedsuperfields can couple to no gauge superfield at all, others (haploid ones) cancouple only very selectively, while still others (non-minimal, i.e., linearones) couple universally to all gauge superfields.
