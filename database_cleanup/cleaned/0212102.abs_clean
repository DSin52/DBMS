We have examined the localization of gauge bosons on the three-brane embeddedin 5D bulk space-time,and we find two kinds of branes as the candidate for ourworld where both graviton and gauge bosons can be trapped. In one brane, thecosmological constant $\lambda$ should be zero in order to find gauge bosons onthis brane. On another brane, a positive cosmological constant is needed totrap the gauge bosons in the bulk,even if how small $\lambda$ is.Which brane isrealized depends on the configurations of the bulk.
