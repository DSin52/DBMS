Authors: Demosthenes Ellinas

Comments: 6 pages,plain Latex,FTUV/93-12. Talk at the 'Harmonic Oscillators'

Workshop,Maryland 1992Operator angle-action variables are studied in the frame of the SU(2)algebra, and their eigenstates and coherent states are discussed. The quantummechanical addition of action-angle variables is shown to lead to a novel noncommutative Hopf algebra. The group contraction is used to make the connectionwith the harmonic oscillator.
