We extend the Wilson renormalization group (RG) to supersymmetric theories.As this regularization scheme preserves supersymmetry, we exploit thesuperspace technique. To set up the formalism we first derive the RG flow forthe massless Wess-Zumino model and deduce its perturbative expansion. We thenconsider N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills and show that the local gauge symmetryflow boundary conditions. We restrict our analysis to the first loop, thegeneralization to higher loops presenting no difficulty due to the iterativenature of the procedure. Furthermore, adding matter fields, we reproduce theone-loop supersymmetric chiral anomaly to the second order in the vector field.
