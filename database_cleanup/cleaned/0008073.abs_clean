We study the phases of the 1+1 dimensional Non-Commutative Open String theoryon a circle. We find that the length scale of non-commutativity increases atstrong coupling, the coupling in turn being dressed by a power of D-stringcharge. The system is stringy at around this length scale, with dynamicsinvolving an interplay between the open and wrapped closed strings sectors.Above this energy scale and at strong coupling, and below it at weak coupling,the system acquires a less stringy character. The near horizon geometry of theconfiguration exhibits several intriguing features, such as a flip in thedilaton field and the curvature scale, reflecting UV-IR mixing innon-commutative dynamics. Two special points in the parameter measuring thesize of the circle are also identified.
