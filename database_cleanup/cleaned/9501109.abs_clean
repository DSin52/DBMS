Title: Exact S matrices for integrable quantum spin chains

Authors: Luca Mezincescu and Rafael I. Nepomechie

Comments: 19 pages, plain tex (macro included), 6 figures

We begin with a review of the antiferromagnetic spin 1/2 Heisenberg chain. Inparticular, we show that the model has particle-like excitations with spin 1/2,and we compute the exact bulk S matrix. We then review our recent work whichgeneralizes these results. We first consider an integrable alternating spin 1/2also has excitations with spin 0. We compute the bulk S matrix, which has someunusual features. We then consider the open antiferromagnetic spin 1/2Heisenberg chain with boundary magnetic fields. We give a direct calculation ofthe boundary S matrix. (Talk presented at the conference on StatisticalMechanics and Quantum Field Theory at USC, 16 - 21 May 1994)
