In this brief review we introduce the methods of quantum field theory out ofequilibrium and study the non-equilibrium aspects of phase transitions.Specifically we critically study the picture of the ``slow-roll'' phasetransition in the new inflationary models, we show that the instabilities thatare the hallmark of the phase transition, that is the formation of correlateddomains, dramatically change this picture. We analyze in detail the dynamics ofphase separation in strongly supercooled phase transitions in Minkowski space.We argue that this is typically the situation in weakly coupled scalartheories. The effective evolution equations for the expectation value and thefluctuations of an inflaton field in a FRW cosmology are derived both in theloop expansion and in a self-consistent non-perturbative scheme. Finally we usethese non-equilibrium techniques and concepts to study the influence of quantumand thermal fluctuations on the dynamics of a proposed mechanism for theformation of disoriented chiral condensates during a rapid phase transition outof equilibrium. This last topic may prove to be experimentally relevant atpresent accelerator energies. To appear in the Proceedings of the `2nd.Journ\'ee Cosmologie', Observatoire de Paris, 2-4, June 1994.
