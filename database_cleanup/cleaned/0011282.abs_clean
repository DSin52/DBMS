We examine noncommutative Yang-Mills and open string theories usingmagnetically and electrically deformed supergravity duals. The duals are nearhorizon regions of Dp-brane bound state solutions which are obtained by usingO(p+1,p+1) transformations of Dp-branes. The action of the T-duality groupimplies that the noncommutativity parameter is constant along holographicRG-flows. The moduli of the noncommutative theory, i.e., the open string metricand coupling constant, as well as the zero-force condition are shown to beinvariant under the O(p+1,p+1) transformation, i.e., deformation independent.We find sufficient conditions, including zero force and constant dilaton in theISO(3,1)-invariant D3 brane solution, for exact S-duality betweennoncommutative Yang-Mills and open string theories. These results are used toconstruct noncommutative field and string theories with N=1 supersymmetry fromthe T^(1,1) and Pilch-Warner solutions. The latter has a non-trivial zero-forcecondition due to the warping.
