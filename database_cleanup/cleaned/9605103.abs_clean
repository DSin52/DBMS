Title: Discrete Mathematics and Physics on the Planck-Scale exemplified by

means of a Class of 'Cellular Network Models' and their DynamicsAuthors: Manfred Requardt

Comments: Considerably enlarged paper, one new chapter added about 'Groupoid

Structure, 41 pages, LatexStarting from the hypothesis that both physics, in particular space-time andthe physical vacuum, and the corresponding mathematics are discrete on thePlanck scale we develop a certain framework in form of a class of 'cellular networks' consisting of cells (nodes) interacting with each other viabonds according to a certain 'local law' which governs their evolution.Both the internal states of the cells and the strength/orientation of the bondsare assumed to be dynamical variables. We introduce a couple of candidates ofsuch local laws which, we think, are capable of catalyzing the unfolding of thenetwork towards increasing complexity and pattern formation. In section 3 thebasis is laid for a version of 'discrete analysis' on 'graphs' and'networks' which, starting from different, perhaps more physicallyoriented principles, manages to make contact with the much more abstractmachinery of Connes et al. and may complement the latter approach. In section 4several more advanced geometric/topological concepts and tools are introducedwhich allow to study and classify such irregular structures as (random)graphsand networks. We show in particular that the systems under study carry in anatural way a 'groupoid structure'. In section 5 a, as far as we can see,dimension') in form of a 'degree of connectivity' for graphs, networksand the like is developed. The possibility of dimensional phase transitions isdiscussed.
