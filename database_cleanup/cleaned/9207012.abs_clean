The Polyakov's "soldering procedure" which shows how two-dimensionaldiffeomorphisms can be obtained from SL(2,R) gauge transformations is discussedusing the free-field representation of SL(2,R) current algebra. Using thisformalism, the relation of Polyakov's method to that of the Hamiltonianreduction becomes transparent. This discussion is then generalised to N=1superdiffeomorphisms which can be obtained from N=1 super Osp(1,2) gaugetransformations. It is also demonstrated that the phase space of the Osp(2,2)supercurrent algebra represented by free superfields is connected to theclassical phase space of N=2 superconformal algebra via Hamiltonian reduction.}
