A complete, straightforward and natural Lagrangian description is given forthe classical non-relativistic dynamics of a particle with colour or internalsymmetry degrees of freedom moving in a background Yang-Mills field. Thisprovides a new simple Lagrangian formalism for Wong's equations for spinlessparticles, and presents also their generalisation, in gauge covariant form, forspin-$\frack$ particles, within a complete Lagrangian formalism.
