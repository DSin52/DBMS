A new way how to calculate the off-shell renormalization functions within the$R^2$-gravity has been proposed. The one-loop renormalization group equationsin the approach suggested have been constructed. The behaviour of effectivepotential for an massless scalar field interacting with the quantumgravitational field has been analyzed in this approach.
