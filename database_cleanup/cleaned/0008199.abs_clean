We consider 2+1-dimensional classical noncommutative scalar field theory. Thegeneral ansatz for a radially symmetric solution is obtained. Some exactsolutions are presented. Their possible physical meaning is discussed. The caseof the finite $\theta$ is discussed qualitatively and illustrated by somenumerical results.
