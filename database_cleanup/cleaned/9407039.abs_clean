In this paper we investigate the vanishing of cosmological singularities byquantization. Starting from a 5d Kaluza--Klein approach we quantize, as a firststep, the non--spherical metric part and the dilaton field. These fields whichare classically singular become smooth after quantization. In addition, weargue that the incorporation of non perturbative quantum corrections form adilaton potential. Technically, the procedure corresponds to the quantizationof 2d dilaton gravity and we discuss several models. From the 4d point of viewthis procedure is a semiclassical approach where only the dilaton and modulimatter fields are quantized.
