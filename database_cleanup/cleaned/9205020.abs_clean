Scattering amplitudes for discrete states in 2D string theory are considered.Pole divergences of tree-level amplitudes are extracted and residues areinterpreted as renormalized amplitudes for discrete states. An effectiveLagrangian generating renormalized amplitudes for open string is written andcorresponding Ward identities are presented. A relation of this Lagrangian withhomotopy Lie algebra is discussed.
