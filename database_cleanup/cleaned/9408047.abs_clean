The exact quantization of two models, the massive vector meson model and theHiggs model in the London limit, both describing massive photons, is presented.Even though naive arguments (based on gauge-fixing) may indicate theequivalence of these models, it is shown here that this is not true in generalwhen we consider these theories on manifolds with boundaries. We show, inparticular, that they are equivalent only for a special choice of the boundaryconditions that we are allowed to impose on the fields.
