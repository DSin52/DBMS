The d=10 type II string theories, d=11 M-theory and d=12 F-theory have thesame symmetry group. It can be viewed either as a subgroup of a conformal groupOSp(1|64) or as a contraction of OSp(1|32). The theories are related bydifferent identifications of their symmetry operators as generators ofOSp(1|32). T- and S-dualities are recognized as redefinitions of generators.Some (s,t) signatures of spacetime allow reality conditions on the generators.All those that allow a real structure are related again by redefinitions withinthe algebra, due to the fact that the algebra OSp(1|32) has only one realrealization. The redefinitions include space/space, time/time and space/timedualities. A further distinction between the theories is made by theidentification of the translation generator. This distinguishes variousversions of type II string theories, in particular the so-called *-theories,characterized by the fact that the P_0 generator is not the (unique)positive-definite energy operator in the algebra.
