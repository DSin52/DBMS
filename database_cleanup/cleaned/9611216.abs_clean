The foundation for the theory of correlation functions of exactly solvablemodels is determinant representation. Determinant representation permit todescribe correlation functions by classical completely integrabledifferential equations [Barough, McCoy, Wu]. In this paper we show thatdeterminant represents works not only for free fermionic models. We obtaineddeterminant representation for the correlation function$<\psi(0,0)\psi^\dagger(x,t)>$ of the quantum nonlinear Schr\"odingerequation, out of free fermionic point. In the forthcoming publications weshall derive completely integrable equation and asymptotic for the quantumcorrelation function of this model of interacting fermions.
