A model, based on a noncommutative geometry, unifying general relativity withquantum mechanics, is further develped. It is shown that the dynamics in thismodel can be described in terms of one-parameter groups of random operators. Itis striking that the noncommutative counterparts of the concept of state andthat of probability measure coincide. We also demonstrate that the equationdescribing noncommutative dynamics in the quantum gravitational approximationgives the standard unitary evolution of observables, and in the "space-timelimit" it leads to the state vector reduction. The cases of the spin andposition operators are discussed in details.
