D-brane probes, Hanany-Witten setups and geometrical engineering stand as atrichotomy of the currently fashionable techniques of constructing gaugetheories from string theory. Meanwhile, asymptotic freedom, finitude and IRfreedom pose as a trichotomy of the beta-function behaviour in quantum fieldtheories. Parallel thereto is a trichotomy in set theory of finite, tame andwild representation types. At the intersection of the above lies the theory ofquivers. We briefly review some of the terminology standard to the physics andto the mathematics. Then we utilise certain results from graph theory andaxiomatic representation theory of path algebras to address physical issuessuch as the implication of graph additivity to finiteness of gauge theories,the impossibility of constructing completely IR free string orbifold theoriesand the unclassifiability of N<2 Yang-Mills theories in four dimensions.
