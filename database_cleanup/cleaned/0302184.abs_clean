Title: Cosmological Perturbations from a New-Physics Hypersurface

Comments: 12 pages; corrected typos in the text; added two references

Within a broad class of inflationary models we critically analyze the wayinitial quantum fluctuations on a new-physics hypersurface (NPH) affectstandard predictions for large-scale cosmological perturbations. We find thatthese so-called transplanckian effects depend crucially on the definition ofthe "vacuum state" in particular on which Hamiltonian is minimized on the NPHin order to select such a state. Transplanckian effects can be made muchsmaller than previously suggested if sufficiently "adiabatic" Hamiltonians areminimized.
