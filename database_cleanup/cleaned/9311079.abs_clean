A theory of higher-derivative 2D dilaton gravity which has its roots in themassive higher-spin mode dynamics of string theory is suggested. Thedivergences of the effective action to one-loop are calculated, both in thecovariant and in the conformal gauge. Some technical problems which appear inthe calculations are discussed. An interpretation of the theory as a particularD=2 higher-derivative $\sigma$-model is given. For a specific case ofhigher-derivative 2D dilaton gravity, which is one loop multiplicativelyrenormalizable, static configurations corresponding to black holes are shown toexist.
