We propose an alternative dimensional reduction prescription which in respectwith Green functions corresponds to drop the extra spatial coordinate. Fromthis, we construct the dimensionally reduced Lagrangians both for scalars andfermions, discussing bosonization and supersymmetry in the particular2-dimensional case. We argue that our proposal is in some situations morephysical, in the sense that it mantains the form of the interactions betweenparticles, thus preserving the dynamics corresponding to the higher dimensionalspace.
