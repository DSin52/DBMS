We analyse the spectrum of perturbations of the de Sitter space on the onehand, while on the other hand we compute the location of the poles in theConformal Field Theory (CFT) propagator at the border. The coincidence isstriking, supporting a dS/CFT correspondence. We show that the spectrum ofthermal excitations of the CFT at the past boundary $I^{-}$ together with thatspectrum at the future boundary $I^{+}$ is contained in the quasi-normal modespectrum of the de Sitter space in the bulk.
