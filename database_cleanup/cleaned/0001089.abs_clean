In this paper we consider D=4 NCSYM theories with 8 supercharges. We studythese theories through a proper type IIA (and M-theory) brane configuration. Wefind the one loop beta function of these theories and show that there is anelliptic curve describing the moduli space of the theory, which is in principlethe same as the curve for the commutative counter-part of our theory. We studysome other details of the dynamics by means of this brane configuration.
