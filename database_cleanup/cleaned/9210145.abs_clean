A generalization of the $SU(2)$--spin systems on a lattice and theircontinuum limit to an arbitrary compact group $G$ is discussed. The continuumlimits are, in general, non--relativistic $\sigma$--model type field theoriestargeted on a homogeneous space $G/H$, where $H$ contains the maximal torus of$G$. In the ferromagnetic case the equations of motion derived from ourcontinuum Lagrangian generalize the Landau--Lifshitz equations with quadraticdispersion relation for small wave vectors. In the antiferromagnetic case thedispersion law is always linear in the long wavelength limit. The models becomerelativistic only when $G/H$ is a symmetric space. Also discussed are ageneralization of the Holstein--Primakoff representation of the $SU(N)$algebra, the topological term and the existence of the instanton type solutionsin the continuum limit of the antiferromagnetic systems.
