Title: The one example of Lorentz group

Gemeinde zu Rostock, Rostosk, Germany)Comments: LaTeX file, 20 pages

The aim of this work is to show, on the example of the behaviour of thespinless charged particle in the homogeneous electric field, that one canquantized the velocity of particle by the special gauge fixation. The workgives also the some information about the theory of second quantisation in thespace of Hilbert- Fock and the theory of projectors in the Hilbert space. Oneconsider in Appendix the theory of the spinless charged particle in thehomogeneous addiabatical changed electrical field.
