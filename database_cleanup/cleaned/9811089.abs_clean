D-branes, topological defects in string theory on which string endpoints canlive, may give new insight into the understanding of the cosmological evolutionof the Universe at early epochs. We analyze the dynamics of D-branes in curvedbackgrounds and discuss the parameter space of M-theory as a function of thecoupling constant and of the curvature of the Universe. We show that D-branesmay be efficiently produced by gravitational effects. Furthermore, in curvedspacetimes the transverse fluctuations of the D-branes develop a tachyonic modeand when the fluctuations grow larger than the horizon the branes becometensionless and break up. This signals a transition to a new regime. We discussthe implications of our findings for the singularity problem present in stringcosmology, suggesting the existence of a limiting value for the curvature whichis in agreement with the value suggested by the cosmological version of theholography principle. We also comment on possible implications for theso-called brane world scenario, where the Standard Model gauge and matterfields live inside some branes while gravitons live in the bulk.
