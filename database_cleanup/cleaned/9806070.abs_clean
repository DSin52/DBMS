The non-relativistic formalism introduced by Berry and Robbins that naturallyincorporates the spin-statistics connection is generalized relativistically. Itis then extended to an arbitrary Kaluza-Klein space-time by a suitablegeneralization of the Schwinger treatment of angular momenta. This leads, inthis approach, to the inclusion of the `internal' quantum numbers in thespin-statistics connection on an equal footing with spin.
