We argue that the torus partition sum in $2d$ (super) gravity, which countsphysical states in the theory, is a decreasing function of the renormalizationgroup scale. As an application we chart the space of $(\hat c\leq1)$ $c\leq1$models coupled to (super) gravity, confirming and extending ideas due to A.Zamolodchikov, and discuss briefly string theory, where our results imply thatthe number of degrees of freedom decreases with time.
