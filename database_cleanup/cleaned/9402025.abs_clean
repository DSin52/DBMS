Present quantum theory, which is statistical in nature, does not predictjoint probability distribution of position and momentum because they arenoncommuting. We propose a deterministic quantum theory which predicts a jointprobability distribution such that the separate probability distributions forposition and momentum agree with usual quantum theory. Unlike the Wignerdistribution the suggested distribution is positive definite. The theorypredicts a correlation between position and momentum in individual events.
