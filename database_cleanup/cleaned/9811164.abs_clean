We calculate the zero point energy of a massive scalar field in thebackground of an infinitely thin spherical shell given by a potential of thedelta function type. We use zeta functional regularization and express theregularized ground state energy in terms of the Jost function of the relatedscattering problem. Then we find the corresponding heat kernel coefficients andperform the renormalization, imposing the normalization condition that theground state energy vanishes when the mass of the quantum field becomes large.Finally the ground state energy is calculated numerically. Corresponding plotsare given for different values of the strength of the background potential, forboth attractive and repulsive potentials.
