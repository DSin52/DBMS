Title: No Cosmological D=11 Supergravity

Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B406 (1997) 49-53

We show, in two complementary ways, that D=11 supergravity---in contrast toall its lower dimensional versions---forbids a cosmological extension. First,we linearize the putative model about an Anti de Sitter background and showthat it cannot even support a "global" supersymmetry invariance; hence thereis no Noether construction that can lead to a local supersymmetry. This is truewith the usual 4-form field as well as for a "dual", 7-form, starting point.Second, a cohomology argument, starting from the original full nonlineartheory, establishes the absence of deformations involving spin 3/2 mass andcosmological terms. In both approaches, it is the form field that isresponsible for the obstruction. ``Dualizing'' the cosmological constant to an11-form field also fails.
