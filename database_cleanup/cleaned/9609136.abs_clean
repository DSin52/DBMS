We consider 3-monopoles symmetric under inversion symmetry. We show that themoduli space of these monopoles is an Atiyah-Hitchin submanifold of the3-monopole moduli space. This allows what is known about 2-monopole dynamics tobe translated into results about the dynamics of 3-monopoles. Using a numericalADHMN construction we compute the monopole energy density at various points ontwo interesting geodesics. The first is a geodesic over the two-dimensionalrounded cone submanifold corresponding to right angle scattering and the secondis a closed geodesic for three orbiting monopoles.
