Title: Canonical Quantization of the Liouville Theory, Quantum Group

Structures, and Correlation FunctionsAuthors: Gerhard Weigt

Comments: 12 pages, talk

We describe a self-consistent canonical quantization of Liouville theory interms of canonical free fields. In order to keep the non-linear Liouvilledynamics, we use the solution of the Liouville equation as a canonicaltransformation. This also defines a Liouville vertex operator. We show, inparticular, that a canonical quantized conformal and local quantum Liouvilletheory has a quantum group structure, and we discuss correlation functions fornon-critical strings.
