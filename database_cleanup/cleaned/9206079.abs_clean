The static stationary axially symmetric background ("infinite cosmic string")of the $D=4$ string theory provided with an axion charge is studied in theeffective theory approach. The most general exact solution is constructed. Itis found that the Kalb-Ramond axion charge, present in the string topology$R^{3} \times S^{1}$, produces nontrivial gravitational field configurationswhich feature horizons. The corresponding ``no-hair'' theorems are proved whichstress uniqueness of black strings. Connection of the solutions with the gaugedWZWN sigma model constructions on the world sheet is discussed since they arethe only target spaces which hide their singularities behind horizons, and thusobey the cosmic censorship conjecture.
