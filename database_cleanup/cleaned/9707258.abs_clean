Higgs branch of N=2 SQCD is studied from the M theory viewpoint. With adifferential geometrical proof of the s-rule besides an investigation on theglobal symmetry of M theory brane configurations, an exact description of thebaryonic and non-baryonic branches in terms of M theory is presented. Thebaryonic branch root is also studied. The ``electric'' and ``magnetic''descriptions of the root are shown to be related with each other by the braneexchange in M theory.
