We consider superstring compactifications where both the classicaldescription, in terms of a Calabi-Yau manifold, and also the quantum theory isknown in terms of a Landau-Ginzburg orbifold model. In particular, we study(smooth) Calabi-Yau examples in which there are obstructions to parametrizingall of the complex structure cohomology by polynomial deformations thusrequiring the analysis based on exact and spectral sequences. General argumentsensure that the Landau-Ginzburg chiral ring copes with such a situation byhaving a nontrivial contribution from twisted sectors. Beyond the expectedfinal agreement between the mathematical and physical approaches, we find adirect correspondence between the analysis of each, thus giving a more completemathematical understanding of twisted sectors. Furthermore, this approach showsthat physical reasoning based upon spectral flow arguments for determining thespectrum of Landau-Ginzburg orbifold models finds direct mathematicaljustification in Koszul complex calculations and also that careful point- fieldanalysis continues to recover suprisingly much of the stringy features.
