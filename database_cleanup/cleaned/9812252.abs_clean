A brief review of string theory on group manifolds is given, and comparisonsare then drawn between Minkowski space, SU(2), and SU(1,1) = AdS_3. The proofof the no-ghost theorem is outlined, assuming a certain restriction on therepresentation content for bosonic and fermionic strings on SU(1,1). Somepossible connections with the AdS/CFT correspondence are mentioned. (Based oninvited talk by JME at Trieste Conference on Super 5-branes and Physics in(5+1)-dimensions.)
