In this paper we consider 1-D non-local field theories with a particular$1/r^2$ interaction, a constant gauge field and an arbitrary scalar potential.We show that any such theory that is at a renormalization group fixed pointalso satisfies an infinite set of reparametrization invariance Ward identities.We also prove that, for special values of the gauge field, the value of thepotential that satisfies the Ward identities to first order in the potentialstrength remains a solution to all orders in the potential strength, summedover all loops. These theories are of interest because they describedissipative quantum mechanics with an arbitrary potential and a constantmagnetic field. They also give solutions to open string theory in the presenceof a uniform gauge field and an arbitrary tachyon field.
