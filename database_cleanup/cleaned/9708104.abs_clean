Title: Finite quantum field theory from a natural postulate

Comments: 8 pages, LaTex, no figures

A new approach is demonstrated that QFTs can be UV finite if they are viewedas the low energy effective theories of a fundamental underlying theory (thatis complete and well-defined in all respects) according to the nowaday'sstandard point of view. No subtraction procedure, counter terms and hence bareparameters are needed. It can also be viewed as a new formulation of thewilson's renormalization program. In contrast to the old ones, this newapproach works for any interaction model and spacetime dimensions. Itsimportant implications are sketched.
