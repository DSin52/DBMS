We discuss AdS_{2+1} (BTZ) black holes arising in type 0 string theorycorresponding to D1-D5 and F1-NS5 bound states. In particular we describe a newfamily of non-dilatonic solutions with only Dp_{+}, that is ``electric''branes. These solutions are distinguished by the absence of fermions in theworld volume theory which is an interacting CFT. They can not be obtained as aprojection of a type II BPS-configuration. As for previous type 0 backgroundslinear stability is guaranteed only if the curvature is of the order of thestring scale where alpha' corrections cannot be excluded. Some problemsconcerning the counting of states are discussed.
