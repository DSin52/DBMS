Title: Superpartner States in Quantum Mechanics of Colored Particle

Authors: Sh. Mamedov

Comments: 8 pages

Superpartner correspondence of states of colored particle in externalchromomagnetic field given by non-commuting constant vector potentials isdetermined. Squared Dirac equation for this particle is solved exactly andexplicit expressions of superpartner states are found. The wave functions ofstates with definite energy are found. Supersymmetry algebra and superpartnerstates in three dimensional motion case are considered.
