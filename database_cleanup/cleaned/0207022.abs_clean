In kappa-deformed relativistic framework we consider three differentdefinitions of kappa-deformed velocities and introduce corresponding additionlaws. We show that one of the velocities has classical relativistic additionlaw. The relation of velocity formulae with the coproduct for fourmomenta andnoncommutative space-time structure is exhibited.
