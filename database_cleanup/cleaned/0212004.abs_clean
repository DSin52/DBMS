Title: Derivation of Einstein Equation from a New Type of four Dimensional

SuperstringAuthors: B. B. Deo and L. Maharana

Comments: 7pages

A new type of superstring in four dimension is proposed which has the centralcharge 26. The Neveu Schwarz and the Ramond vacua are both tachyonic. The selfenergy of the scalar tachyon cancels from the contribution of the fermionicloop of the Ramond sector. The NS tachyonic vacuum is used to construct amassless graviton. Coulombic vector excitations of zero mass, referred as a`Newtonian' graviton are also shown to exist. The propagators are explicitlyevaluated. Following the method of Weinberg, we deduce the Einstein's fieldequation of general relativity.
