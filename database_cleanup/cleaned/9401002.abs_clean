First, we investigate the static non-Abelian Kubo equation. We prove that itdoes not possess finite energy solutions; thereby we establish that gaugetheories do not support hard thermal solitons. A similar argument shows that"static" instantons are absent. In addition, we note that the static equationsreproduce the expected screening of the non-Abelian electric field by a gaugeinvariant Debye mass m=gT sqrt((N+N_F/2)/3). Second, we derive the non-AbelianKubo equation from the composite effective action. This is achieved by showingthat the requirement of stationarity of the composite effective action isequivalent, within a kinematical approximation scheme, to the condition ofgauge invariance for the generating functional of hard thermal loops.
