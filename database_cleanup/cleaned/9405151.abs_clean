Perturbing usual type B topological matter with vector $(0,1)$-forms we finda topological theory which contains explicitly Kodaira-Spencer deformationtheory. It is shown that, in genus zero, three-point correlation functions givethe Yukawa couplings for a generic point in the moduli space of complexstructures. This generalization of type B topological matter seems to be thecorrect framework to understand mirror symmetry in terms of two-dimensionaltopological field theories.
