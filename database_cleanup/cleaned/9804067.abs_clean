Polchinski and Pouliot have shown that M-momentum transfer between membranesin supergravity can be understood as a non-perturbative instanton effect inbetween D-branes. We show that this process can be described in perturbationtheory as virtual string pair creation, and is closely related to Schwinger'streatment of the pair creation of charged particles in a uniform electricfield. Through the application of dualities, our perturbative calculation givesresults for various non-perturbative amplitudes, including M-momentum transferbetween gravitons, membranes, and longitudinal fivebranes. Thus perturbationtheory plus dualities are sufficient to demonstrate agreement betweensupergravity and gauge theory for a number of M-momentum transferringprocesses. A variety of other processes where branes are transmitted betweenbranes, e.g. (p,q)-string transmission in IIB-theory, can also be studied. Wediscuss the implications of our results for proving the 11 dimensional Lorentzinvariance of Matrix theory.
