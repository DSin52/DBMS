We re-examine the justification for the imposition of regular boundaryconditions on the wavefunction at the Coulomb singularity in the treatment ofthe hydrogen atom in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. We show that the issueof the correct boundary conditions is not independent of the physical structureof the proton. Under the physically reasonable assumption that the finite sizeand structure of the proton can be represented as a positive correction to theCoulomb potential, we give a justification for the regular boundary condition,which, in contrast to the usual treatments, is physically motivated andmathematically rigorous. We also describe how irregular boundary conditions canbe used to model non-positive corrections to the Coulomb potential.
