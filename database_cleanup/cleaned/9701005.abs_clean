It is shown that, if generators of supersymmetry transformations(supercharges) can be defined in a spatially homogeneous physical state, thenthis state describes the vacuum. Thus, supersymmetry is broken in any thermalstate and it is impossible to proceed from it by ``symmetrization'' to stateson which an action of supercharges can be defined. So, unlike the familiarspontaneous breakdown of bosonic symmetries, there is a complete collapse ofsupersymmetry in thermal states. It is also shown that spatially homogeneoussuperthermal ensembles are never supersymmetric.
