We investigate the canonical quantization of gravity coupled to pointlikematter in 2+1 dimensions. Starting from the usual point particle action in thefirst order formalism, we introduce auxiliary variables which make the actionlocally Poincar\'e invariant. A Hamiltonian analysis shows that the gauge groupis actually larger than the Poincar\'e group -- certain additional gaugeconstraints are present which act on the matter degrees of freedom. Theseadditional constraints are necessary to mimic the diffeomorphism invariancepresent if the theory is formulated with a spacetime metric. The additionalgauge constraints are realized projectively in the quantum theory, with a phasein the composition law for finite gauge transformations. That phase isresponsible for the braid invariance of physical observables (holonomies).
