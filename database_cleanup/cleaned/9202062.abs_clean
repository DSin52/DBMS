Title: The Plumbing of Minimal Area Metrics

Authors: Michael Wolf and Barton Zwiebach

We study the metric of minimal area on a punctured Riemann surface under thecondition that all nontrivial homotopy closed curves be longer than or equal to$2\pi$. By constructing deformations of admissible metrics we establishnecessary conditions on minimal area metrics and a partial converse toBeurling's criterion for extremal metrics. We explicitly construct new minimalarea metrics that do not arise from quadratic differentials.Under the physically motivated assumption of existence of the minimal areametrics, we show there exist neighborhoods of the punctures isometric to a flatsemiinfinite cylinder of circumference $2\pi$, allowing the definition ofcanonical complex coordinates around the punctures. The plumbing of surfaceswith minimal area metrics is shown to induce a metric of minimal area on theresulting surface. This implies that minimal area string diagrams define aconsistent quantum closed string field theory.
