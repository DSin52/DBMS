We study differential calculus on h-deformed bosonic and fermionic quantumspace. It is shown that the fermionic quantum space involves a parafermionicvariable as well as a classical fermionic one. Further we construct theclassical $su(2)$ algebra on the fermionic quantum space and discuss a mappingbetween the classical $su(2)$ and the h-deformed $su(2)$ algebras.
