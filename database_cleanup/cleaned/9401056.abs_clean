The phase structure of the $d=3$ Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in curved spacetimeis considered to leading order in the $1/N$--expansion and in the linearcurvature approximation. The possibility of a curvature-induced first-orderphase transition is investigated numerically. The dynamically generatedfermionic mass is calculated for some values of the curvature.
