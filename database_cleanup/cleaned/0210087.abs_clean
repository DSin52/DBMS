We construct integrable spin chains with inhomogeneous periodic dispositionof the anisotropy parameter. The periodicity holds for both auxiliary (space)and quantum (time) directions. The integrability of the model is based on a setof coupled Yang-Baxter equations. This construction yields P-leg integrableladder Hamiltonians. We analyse the corresponding quantum group symmetry.
