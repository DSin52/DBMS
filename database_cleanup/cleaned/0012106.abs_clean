We address the problem of the cosmological constant within theRandall-Sundrum scenario with a brane stabilization mechanism. We considerbrane tensions of general form. We examine the conditions under which a smallchange of the positive tension of the first brane can be absorbed in a smallmodification of the two-brane configuration, instead of manifesting itself as acosmological constant. We demonstrate that it is possible to have acosmological constant in the range predicted by recent observational data, ifthere is an ultraviolet cutoff of order 10 TeV in the contributions to thebrane tension from vacuum fluctuations.
