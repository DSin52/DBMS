Comments: LPTENS preprint 93/38, LATEX file 15 pages

Ideas recently put forward by Y. Matsuo and the author are summarized on theexample of the simplest ($W_3$) generalization of two-dimensional gravity.These notes are based on lectures given at the workshop `` Strings, ConformalModels and Topological Field Theories'', Cargese 12-21 May 1993; and at themeeting ``String 93'', Berkeley, 24-29 May 1993.
