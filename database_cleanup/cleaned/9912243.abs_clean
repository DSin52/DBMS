The off-shell structure of the string sigma model is investigated. In theopen bosonic string, nonperturbative effects are shown to depend crucially onthe regularization scheme. A scheme retaining the notion of string widthreproduces the structure of Witten's string field theory and the associatedunconventional gauge transformations.
