We describe the investigation of spontaneous mass-generation and chiralsymmetry breaking in supersymmetric QED3 using numerical solutions of theDyson-Schwinger equation together with the CJT effective action andsupersymmetric Ward identities. We find that, within the quenched bareapproximation, the chirally symmetric solution is favoured.
