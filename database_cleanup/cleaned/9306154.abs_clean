The effective action on an orbifolded sphere is computed for minimallycoupled scalar fields. The results are presented in terms of derivatives ofBarnes zeta-functions and it is shown how these may be evaluated. Numericalvalues are shown. An analytical, heat-kernel derivation of the Ces\`aro-Fedorovformula for the number of symmetry planes of a regular solid is also presented.
