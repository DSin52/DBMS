I describe recent examples of phase transitions in four-dimensional M theoryvacua in which the net generation number changes. There are naive obstructionsto transitions lifting chiral matter, but loopholes exist which enable us toavoid them. I first review how chirality arises in the heterotic limit of Mtheory, previously known forms of topology change in string theory, andchirality-changing phase transitions in six dimensions. This leads to theconstruction of the four-dimensional examples, which involve wrapped M-theoryfivebranes at an $E_8$ wall.
