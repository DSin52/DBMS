We study the interaction of gauge fields of arbitrary integer spins with theconstant electromagnetic field. We reduce the problem of obtaining thegauge-invariant Lagrangian of integer spin fields in the external field topurely algebraic problem of finding a set of operators with certain featuresusing the representation of the high-spin fields in the form of vectors in apseudo-Hilbert space. We consider such a construction up to the second order inthe electromagnetic field strength and also present an explicit form ofinteraction Lagrangian for a massive particle of spin $s$ in terms ofsymmetrical tensor fields in linear approximation. The result obtained does notdepend on dimensionality of space-time.
