We prove that both global monopole and minimally coupled static zero massscalar field are electrogravity dual of the Schwarzschild solution or flatspace and they share the same equation of state, $T^0_0 - T^i_i = 0$. Thisproperty was however known for the global monopole spacetime while it is forthe first time being established for the scalar field. In particular, it turnsout that the Xanthopoulos - Zannias scalar field solution is dual to flatspace.
