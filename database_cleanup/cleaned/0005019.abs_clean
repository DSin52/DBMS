There exist two versions of the covariant Schwinger term in the literature.They only differ by a sign. However, we shall show that this is an essentialdifference. We shall carefully (taking all signs into account) review theexisting quantum field theoretical computations for the covariant Schwingerterm in order to determine the correct expression.
