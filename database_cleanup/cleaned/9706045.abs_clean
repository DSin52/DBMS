Title: Duality in 2D Spin Models on Torus

Comments: 10 pages, LATEX. Reference added

Method of derivation of the duality relations for two-dimensionalZ(N)-symmetric spin models on finite square lattice wrapped on the torus isproposed. As example, exact duality relations for the nonhomogeneous Isingmodel (N=2) and the Z(N)-Berezinsky-Villain model are obtained.
