We study a deformation of the type IIB Maldacena-Nunez background whicharises as the near-horizon limit of NS5 branes wrapped on a two-cycle. Thisbackground is dual to a "little string theory" compactified on a two-sphere, atheory which at low energies includes four-dimensional N = 1 super Yang-Millstheory. The deformation we study corresponds to a mass term for some of thescalar fields in this theory, and it breaks supersymmetry completely. In thelanguage of seven-dimensional SO(4) gauged supergravity the deformationinvolves (at leading order) giving a VEV, depending only on the radialcoordinate, to a particular scalar field. We explicitly construct thecorresponding solution at leading order in the deformation, both inseven-dimensional and in ten-dimensional supergravity, and we verify that itcompletely breaks supersymmetry. Since the original background had a mass gapand we are performing a small deformation, the deformed background isguaranteed to be stable even though it is not supersymmetric.
