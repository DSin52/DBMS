The realizations of the Lie algebra corresponding to the dynamical symmetrygroup SO(2,1) of the Schr\"{o}dinger equations for the Morse and the$V=u^2+1/u^2$ potentials were known to be related by a canonicaltransformation. q-deformed analog of this transformation connecting twodifferent realizations of the sl_q(2) algebra is presented. By the virtue ofthe q-canonical transformation a q-deformed Schr\"{o}dinger equation for theMorse potential is obtained from the q-deformed $V=u^2+ 1/u^2$ Schr\"{o}dingerequation. Wave functions and eigenvalues of the q-Schr\"{o}dinger equationsyielding a new definition of the q-Laguerre polynomials are studied.
