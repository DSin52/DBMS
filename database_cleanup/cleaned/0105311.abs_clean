We evaluate the Seiberg-Witten map for solitons and instantons innoncommutative gauge theories in various dimensions. We show that solitonsconstructed using the projection operators have delta-function supports whenexpressed in the commutative variables. This gives a precise identification ofthe moduli of these solutions as locations of branes. On the other hand, aninstanton solution in four dimensions allows deformation away from theprojection operator construction. We evaluate the Seiberg-Witten transform ofthe U(2) instanton and show that it has a finite size determined by thenoncommutative scale and by the deformation parameter \rho. For large \rho, theprofile of the D0-brane density of the instanton agrees surprisingly well withthat of the BPST instanton on commutative space.
