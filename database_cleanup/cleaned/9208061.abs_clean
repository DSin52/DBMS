We study representations of Temperley-Lieb algebras associated with thetransfer matrix formulation of statistical mechanics on arbitrary  lattices. Wefirst discuss a new hyperfinite algebra, the Diagram algebra$D_{\underline{n}}(Q)$, which is a quotient of the Temperley-Lieb algebraappropriate for Potts models in the mean field case, and in which the algebrasappropriate for all transverse lattice shapes $G$ appear as subalgebras. Wegive the complete structure of this subalgebra in the case ${\hat A}_n$ (Pottsmodel on a cylinder). The study of the Full Temperley Lieb algebra of graph $G$reveals a vast number of infinite sets of inequivalent irreduciblerepresentations characterized by one or more (complex) parameters associated totopological effects such as links. We give a complete classification in the${\hat A}_n$ case where the only such effects are loops and twists.
