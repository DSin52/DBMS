II, paper 15, I.N., Tashkent (to appear)The curvature scalar -R/const in the Einstein-Gilbert action can be replacedby the energy-momentum scalar of the matter T. This additional energy term inLagrangians of particles and fields does not disappear on a flat space-time andcan be considered as a gravitational self energy. It is shown that this term inLagrangians of quantum fields naturally induces renormalizational counterterms.As a result additional counterterms are not needed in introduction.
