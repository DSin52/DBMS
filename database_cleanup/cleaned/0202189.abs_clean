We investigate some of the issues relating to the dynamical instability ofgeneral static spacetimes with horizons. Our paper will be partiallypedagogical and partially exploratory in nature. After discussing the currentunderstanding, we generalize the proposal of Gubser and Mitra, which identifiesdynamical instability of black branes with local thermodynamic instability, toinclude all product spacetimes with the horizon uniformly smeared over aninternal space. We support our conjecture by explicitly exhibiting a thresholdunstable mode for Schwarzschild-AdS_5 x S^5 black hole. Using the AdS/CFTcorrespondence, this simultaneously yields a prediction for a phase transitionin the dual gauge theory. We also discuss implications for spacetimes withcosmological horizons.
