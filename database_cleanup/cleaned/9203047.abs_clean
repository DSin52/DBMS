We study the effect of a Chern-Simons term in a theory with discrete gaugegroup H, which in (2+1)-dimensional space time describes (non-abelian) anyons.As in a previous paper, we emphasize the underlying algebraic structure, namelythe Hopf algebra D(H). We argue on physical grounds that the addition of aChern-Simons term in the action leads to a non-trivial 3-cocycle on D(H).Accordingly, the physically inequivalent models are labelled by the elements ofthe cohomology group H^3(H,U(1)). It depends periodically on the coefficient ofthe Chern-Simons term which model is realized. This establishes a relation withthe discrete topological field theories of Dijkgraaf and Witten. Somerepresentative examples are worked out explicitly.
