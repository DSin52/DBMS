The large $N_c$ limit of Yang-Mills gauge theory is the dynamics of a closedgluonic chain, but this fact does not obviate the inherently strong couplingnature of the dynamical problem. However, we suggest that a single link in sucha chain might be reasonably described in the quasi-perturbative language ofgluons and their interactions. To implement this idea, we use the MIT bag tomodel the physics of a nearest neighbor bond.
