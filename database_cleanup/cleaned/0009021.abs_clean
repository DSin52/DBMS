We study D=3 field theories on the D3-branes stretched between two NS5-braneswith NS B-field background. The theory is a noncommutative gauge theory. Themirror symmetry and S-duality of the theory are discussed. A new feature isthat the mirror of the noncommutative gauge theory is not a field theory but anopen string decoupled from the closed string. We also consider brane creationphenomena and use the result to discuss the analogue of the Seiberg duality. Anoncommutative soliton is interpreted as a D1-brane induced on D3-brane.
