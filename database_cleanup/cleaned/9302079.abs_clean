Comments: 12 pages, LaTeX, CTP#2183

The spin-4/3 fractional superstring is characterized by a chiral algebrainvolving a spin-4/3 current on the world-sheet in addition to theenergy-momentum tensor. These currents generate physical state conditions onthe fractional superstring Fock space. Scattering amplitudes of these physicalstates are described which satisfy both spurious state decoupling and cyclicsymmetry (duality). Examples of such amplitudes are calculated using anexplicit $c=5$ realization of the spin-4/3 current algebra. This representationhas three flat coordinate boson fields and a global SO(2,1) Lorentz symmetry,permitting a particle interpretation of the amplitudes.
