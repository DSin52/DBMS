We study general black-hole solutions of the low-energy string effectiveaction in arbitrary dimensions using a general metric that can describe themall in a unified way both in the extreme and non-extreme cases. We calculatethe mass, temperature and entropy and study which relations amongst the chargesand the mass lead to extremality. We find that the temperature always vanishesin the extreme limit and we find that, for a set of n charges (no furtherreducible by duality) there are 2^{(n-1)} combinations of the charges thatimply extremality. Not all of these combinations can be central chargeeigenvalues and, thus, there are in general extreme black holes which are notsupersymmetric (or ``BPS-saturated''). In the N=8 supergravity case we arguethat the existence of roughly as many supersymmetric and non-supersymmetricextreme black holes suggests the existence of an underlying twelve-dimensionalstructure.
