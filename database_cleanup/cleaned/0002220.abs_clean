We study the formation and stability of regular black holes by employing athin shell approximation to the dynamics of collapsing magnetic monopoles. Thecore deSitter region of the monopole is matched across the shell to aReissner-Nordstrom exterior. We find static configurations which arenonsingular black holes and also oscillatory trajectories about these staticpoints that share the same causal structure. In these spacetimes the shell isalways hidden behind the black hole horizon. We also find shell trajectoriesthat pass through the asymptotically flat region and model collapse of amonopole to form a regular black hole. In addition there are trajectories inwhich the deSitter core encompasses a deSitter horizon and hence undergoestopological inflation. However, these always yield singular black holes andnever have the shell passing through the aymptotically flat region. Althoughthe regular black hole spacetimes satisfy the strong energy condition, theyavoid the singularity theorems by failing to satisfy the genericity conditionon the Riemann tensor. The regular black holes undergo a change in spatialtopology in accordance with a theorem of Borde's.
