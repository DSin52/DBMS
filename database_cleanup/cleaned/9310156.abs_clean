We describe in detail how one can extract space-time geometry in an exactlysolvable model of quantum dilaton gravity of the type proposed by Callan,Giddings, Harvey and Strominger ( CGHS ). Based on our previous work, in whicha model with 24 massless matter scalars was quantized rigorously in BRSToperator formalism, we compute, without approximation, mean values of thematter stress-energy tensor, the inverse metric and some related quantities ina class of coherent physical states constructed in a specific gauge within theconformal gauge. Our states are so designed as to describe a variety ofspace-time in which in-falling matter energy distribution produces a black holewith or without naked sigularity. In particular, we have been able to producethe prototypical configuration first discovered by CGHS, in which a ( smeared )matter shock wave produces a black hole without naked sigularity.
