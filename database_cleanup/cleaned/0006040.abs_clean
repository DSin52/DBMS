Title: Quantum Field Theory from First Principles

Comments: 16 pages, plain Tex, paper submitted for the Proceedings of the

Conference "Geometrical Aspects of Quantum Fields", Physics Department ofLondrina University, April 17-20, 2000When quantum fields are studied on manifolds with boundary, the correspondingone-loop quantum theory for bosonic gauge fields with linear covariant gaugesneeds the assignment of suitable boundary conditions for elliptic differentialoperators of Laplace type. There are however deep reasons to modify such ascheme and allow for pseudo-differential boundary-value problems. When theboundary operator is allowed to be pseudo-differential while remaining aprojector, the conditions on its kernel leading to strong ellipticity of theboundary-value problem are studied in detail. This makes it possible to developa theory of one-loop quantum gravity from first principles only, i.e. thephysical principle of invariance under infinitesimal diffeomorphisms and themathematical requirement of a strongly elliptic theory. It therefore seems thata non-local formulation of quantum field theory has some attractive featureswhich deserve further investigation.
