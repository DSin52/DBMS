We study a supersymmetric theory twisted on a K\"ahler four manifold$M=\Sigma_1 \times \Sigma_2 ,$ where $\Sigma_{1,2}$ are 2D Riemann surfaces. Wedemonstrate that it possesses a "left-moving" conformal stress tensor on$\Sigma_1$ ($\Sigma_2$) in a BRST cohomology, which generates the Virasoroalgebra with the conventional commutation relations. The central charge of theVirasoro algebra has a purely geometric origin and is proportional to the Eulercharacteristic $\c$ of the $\Sigma_2$ ($\Sigma_1$) surface. It is shown thatthis construction can be extended to include a realization of a Kac-Moodyalgebra in BRST cohomology with a level proportional to the Eulercharacteristic $\c .$ This structure is shown to be invariant underrenormalization group. A representation of the algebra $W_{1+\infty}$ in termsof a free chiral supermultiplet is also given. We discuss the role ofinstantons and a possible relation between the dynamics of 4D Yang-Millstheories and those of 2D sigma models.
