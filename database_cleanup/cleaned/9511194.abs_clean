The force between like sign BPS saturated objects generally vanishes. This isa reflection of the fact that BPS states are really massless unchargedparticles with nonvanishing momenta in compactified directions. Two like signBPS objects with zero relative velocity can be viewed as a boosted state of twoneutral massless particles in a state of vanishing relative motion. By contrasttwo unlike sign BPS particles may be thought of as colliding objects moving inopposite directions in compact space. This leads to complicated interactionswhich are totally intractable at present. We illustrate this by considering thepotential between opposite sign zero-D- branes .
