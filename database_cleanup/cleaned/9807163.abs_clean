For slowly varying fields the Yang-Mills Schroedinger functional can beexpanded in terms of local functionals. We show how analyticity in a complexscale parameter enables the Schroedinger functional for arbitrarily varyingfields to be reconstructed from this expansion. We also construct the form ofthe Schroedinger equation that determines the coefficients. Solving this inpowers of the coupling reproduces the results of the `standard' perturbativesolution of the functional Schroedinger equation which we also describe. Inparticular the usual result for the beta-function is obtained illustrating howanalyticity enables the effects of rapidly varying fields to be computed fromthe behaviour of slowly varying ones.
