Supersymmetry of five dimensional string solutions is examined in the contextof gauged D=5, N=2 supergravity coupled to abelian vector multiplets. We findmagnetic black strings preserving one quarter of supersymmetry and approachingthe half-supersymmetric product space AdS_3\times H^2 near the event horizon.The solutions thus exhibit the phenomenon of supersymmetry enhancement near thehorizon, like in the cases of ungauged supergravity theories, where the nearhorizon limit is fully supersymmetric. Finally, product space compactificationsare studied in detail, and it is shown that only for negative curvature(hyperbolic) internal spaces, some amount of supersymmetry can be preserved.Among other solutions, we find that the extremal rotating BTZ black holetensored by H^2 preserves one quarter of supersymmetry.
