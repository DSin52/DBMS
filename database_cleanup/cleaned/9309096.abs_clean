Based on a recent paper by Takhtajan, we propose a formulation of 2D quantumgravity whose basic object is the Liouville action on the Riemann sphere$\Sigma_{0,m+n}$ with both parabolic and elliptic points. The identification ofthe classical limit of the conformal Ward identity with the Fuchsian projectiveconnection on $\Sigma_{0,m+n}$ implies a relation between conformal weights andramification indices. This formulation works for arbitrary $d$ and admits astandard representation only for $d\le 1$. Furthermore, it turns out that theintegerness of the ramification number constrains $d=1-24/(n^2-1)$ that for$n=2m+1$ coincides with the unitary minimal series of CFT.
