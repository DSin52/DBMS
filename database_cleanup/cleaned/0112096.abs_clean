Title: Isomonodromy equations on algebraic curves, canonical transformations

and Whitham equationsAuthors: I. Krichever

The Hamiltonian theory of isomonodromy equations for meromorphic connectionswith irregular singularities on algebraic curves is constructed. An explicitformula for the symplectic structure on the space of monodromy and Stokesmatrices is obtained. The Whitham equations for the isomonodromy equations arederived. It is shown that they provide a flat connection on the space of thespectral curves of the Hitchin systems.
