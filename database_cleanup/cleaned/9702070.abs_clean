Title: Scalar Field Theory in Curved Space and the Definition of Momentum

Comments: 44 pages, TeX, 3 figures. Minor alterations have been made to several

equations in the textSome general remarks are made about the quantum theory of scalar fields andthe definition of momentum in curved space. Special emphasis is given to fieldtheory in anti-de Sitter space, as it represents a maximally symmetricspace-time of constant curvature which could arise in the local description ofmatter interactions in small regions of space-time. Transform space rules forevaluating Feynman diagrams in Euclidean anti-de Sitter space are initiallydefined using eigenfunctions based on generalized plane waves. It is shownthat, for a general curved space, the rules associated with the vertex aredependent on the type of interaction being considered. A condition foreliminating this dependence is given. It is demonstrated that the vacuum andpropagator in conformally flat coordinates in anti-de Sitter space areequivalent to those analytically continued from $H^4$ and that transform spacerules based on these coordinates can be used more readily. A proof of theanalogue of Goldstone's theorem in anti-de Sitter space is given, using ageneralized plane wave representation of the commutator of the current and thescalar field. It is shown that the introduction of curvature in the space-timeshifts the momentum by an amount which is determined by the Riemann tensor tofirst order, and it follows that there is a shift in both the momentum and massscale in anti-de Sitter space.
