Under the Influence of External Conditions, Leipzig, 14-18 September, 1998.Requires sprocl.styJulian Schwinger became interested in the Casimir effect in 1975. Hisoriginal impetus was to understand the quantum force between parallel plateswithout the concept of zero point fluctuations of field quanta, in the languageof source theory. He went on to consider applications to dielectrics and tospherical geometries in 1977. Although he published nothing on the subject inthe following decade, he did devote considerable effort to understanding theconnection between acceleration and temperature in the mid 1980s. During thelast four years of his life, he became fascinated with sonoluminescence, andproposed that the dynamical Casimir effect could be responsible for the copiousemission of photons by collapsing air bubbles in water.
