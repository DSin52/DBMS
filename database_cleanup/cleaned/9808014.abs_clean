For supergavrity solutions which are the product of an anti-de Sitter spacewith an Einstein space X, we study the relation between the amount ofsupersymmetry preserved and the geometry of X. Depending on the dimension andthe amount of supersymmetry, the following geometries for X are possible, indimension 2k+1, 3-Sasaki in dimension 4k+3, 7-dimensional manifolds of weak G_2holonomy and 6-dimensional nearly Kaehler manifolds. Many new examples of suchmanifolds are presented which are not homogeneous and have escaped earlierclassification efforts. String or M theory in these vacua are conjectured to bedual to superconformal field theories. The brane solutions interpolatingbetween these anti-de Sitter near-horizon geometries and the product ofMinkowski space with a cone over X lead to an interpretation of the dualsuperconformal field theory as the world-volume theory for branes at a conicalsingularity (cone branes). We propose a description of those field theorieswhose associated cones are obtained by (hyper-)Kaehler quotients.
