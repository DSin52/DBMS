We obtain the vacuum solutions for M-theory compactified on eight-manifoldswith non-vanishing four-form flux by analyzing the scalar potential appearingin the three-dimensional theory. Many of these vacua are not supersymmetric andyet have a vanishing three-dimensional cosmological constant. We show that inthe context of Type IIB compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds with fluxesand external brane sources alpha'-corrections generate a correction to thesupergravity potential proportional to the Euler number of the internalmanifold which spoils the no-scale structure appearing in the classicalpotential. This indicates that alpha'-corrections may indeed lead to astabilization of the radial modulus appearing in these compactifications.
