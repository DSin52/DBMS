Title: The Blob Algebra and the Periodic Temperley-Lieb Algebra

Authors: Paul Martin and Hubert Saleur

Comments: 12 pages

We determine the structure of two variations on the Temperley-Lieb algebra,both used for dealing with special kinds of boundary conditions in statisticalmechanics models.The first is a new algebra, the `blob' algebra (the reason for the name willbecome obvious shortly!). We determine both the generic and all the exceptionalstructures for this two parameter algebra. The second is the periodicTemperley-Lieb algebra. The generic structure and part of the exceptionalstructure of this algebra have already been studied. Here we complete theanalysis, using results from the study of the blob algebra.
