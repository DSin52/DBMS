We re-examine the classification of supersymmetric extended objects in thelight of the recently discovered Type II p-branes, previously thought not toexist for p> 1. We find new points on the brane-scan only in D = 10 and thenonly for p = 3(Type IIB), p = 4 (Type IIA), p = 5 (Type IIA and IIB) and p = 6(Type IIA). The case D = 10, p = 2 (Type IIA) also exists but is equivalent tothe previously classified D = 11 supermembrane.
