non-bounded modulesComments: 13 pages

Journal-ref: Mod.Phys.Lett. A8 (1993) 3613-3624

We explicitly write dowm integral formulas for solutions toKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations with coefficients in non-bounded -- neitherhighest nor lowest weight -- $\gtsl_{n+1}$-modules. The formulas are closelyrelated to WZNW model at a rational level.
