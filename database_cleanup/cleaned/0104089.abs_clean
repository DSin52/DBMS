We study a special combination of the compact directions of the spacetime(compactified on tori) and the worldsheet parity transformed of thesedirections. The transformations that change the compact part of the spacetimeto this combination, are more general than the T-duality transformations. Manyproperties of this combination and also of the corresponding worldsheetfermions are studied. By using the boundary state formalism, we study theeffects of the above transformations to D-branes. For the special cases theresulted branes reduce to the known mixed branes, or reduce to the modifiedmixed branes.
