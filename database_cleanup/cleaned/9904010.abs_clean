Anomalies of N = (4,4) superconformal field theories coupled to a conformalsupergravity background in two dimensions are computed by using the AdS/CFTcorrespondence. We find that Weyl, axial gauge and super Weyl transformationsare anomalous, while general coordinate, local Lorentz, vector gauge and localsuper transformations are not. The coefficients of the anomalies show that thesuperconformal field theories have the central charge expected in the AdS/CFTcorrespondence.
