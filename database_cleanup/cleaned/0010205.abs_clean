We consider the quantum effects of bulk matter (scalars, spinors) in theRandall-Sundrum AdS$_5$ brane-world at nonzero temperature. The thermodynamicenergy (modulus potential) is evaluated at low and high temperatures. Thispotential has an extremum which could be a minimum in some cases (for example,for a single fermion). That suggests a new dynamical mechanism to stabilize thethermal AdS$_5$ brane-world. It is shown that the brane separation required tosolve the hierarchy scale problem may occur at a quite low temperature. Anatural generalization in terms of the AdS/CFT correspondence (through thesupergravity thermal contribution) is also possible.
