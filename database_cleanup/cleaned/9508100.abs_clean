Title: On the BRST Cohomology of N=2 Strings

Comments: Talk at ``Strings '95'', March 95; 2 pages

We analyze the BRST cohomology of the critical N=2 NSR string using chiralbosonization. Picture-changing and spectral flow is made explicit in aholomorphic field basis. The integration of fermionic and U(1) moduli isperformed and yields picture- and U(1) ghost number-changing insertions intothe string measure for n-point amplitudes at arbitrary genus and U(1) instantonnumber.
