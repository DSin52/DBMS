An approach based on considerations of the non-classical energy momentumtensor outside the event horizon of a black hole provides additional physicalinsight into the nature of discrete quantum hair on black holes and its effecton black hole temperature. Our analysis both extends previous work based on theEuclidean action techniques, and corrects an omission in that work. We alsoraise several issues related to the effects of instantons on black holethermodynamics and the relation between these effects and results in twodimensional quantum field theory.
