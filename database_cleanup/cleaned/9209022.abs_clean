Two dimensional quantum gravity coupled to a conformally invariant matterfield of central charge c=n/2, is represented, in a discretized version, by nindependent Ising spins per cell of the triangulations of a random surface. Thematrix integral representation of this model leads to a diagrammatic expansionat large orders, when the Ising coupling constant is tuned to criticality, oneextracts the values of the string susceptibility exponent. We extend ourprevious calculation to order eight for genus zero and investigate now also thegenus one case in order to check the possibility of having a well-defineddouble scaling limit even c>1.
