We present four-dimensional gauge theories in Minkowski spacetime whicheffectively generate in certain energy regimes five-dimensional warpedgeometries whereas, in general, the fifth dimension is latticized. Afterdiscussing in detail several general aspects in such theories we present anumber of exactly solvable examples. We also point out how a particular case,defined in an N-sided polygon and having a Z_N symmetry, has a similarrealization in an appropriate supersymmetric setting with D3-branes.
