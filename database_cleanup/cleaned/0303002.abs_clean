Title: Electrostatic self-energy in QED_2 on curved background

Authors: H. Mohseni Sadjadi

Comments: 11 pages, latex

By considering the vacuum polarization, we study the effects of geometry onelectrostatic self--energy of a test charge near the black hole horizon andalso in regions with strong and weak curvature in static two dimensional curvedbackgrounds. We also discuss the relation of ultraviolet behavior of the gaugefield propagator and charge confinement.
