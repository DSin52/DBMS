Extending the commutator algebra of quantum $\kappa$-Poincar\'e symmetry tothe whole of the phase space, and assuming that this algebra is to be covariantunder action of deformed Lorentz generators, we derive the transformationproperties of positions under the action of deformed boosts. It turns out thatthese transformations leave invariant the quadratic form in the position space,which is the Minkowski metric and that the boosts saturate. The issues ofmassless and massive particles motion, as well as time dilatation and lengthcontraction in this new framework are also studied.
