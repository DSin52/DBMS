The present paper is revised copy of hep-th/9303087 in which higher spinextensions of the nonabelian gauge symmetries for the classical WZNW model areconsidered. Both linear and nonlinear realizations of the extended affineKac-Moody algebra are obtained. A characteristic property of the WZNW model isthat it admits a higher spin linear realization of the extended affineKac-Moody algebra which is equivalent to the corresponding higher spinnonlinear realization of the same algebra. However, in both cases the higherspin currents do not form an invariant space with respect to their generatingtransformations. This makes it imposible for this symmetry to be gauged.
