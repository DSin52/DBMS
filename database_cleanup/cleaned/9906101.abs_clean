We construct non-supersymmetric four dimensional gauge theories arising aseffective theories of D-branes placed on various singularities in Type 0Bstring theory. We mostly focus on models which are conformal in the large Nlimit and present both examples appearing on self-dual D3-branes on orbifoldsingularities and examples including orientifold planes. Moreover, we derivetype 0 Hanany-Witten setups with NS 5-branes intersected by D-branes and thecorresponding rules for determining the massless spectra. Finally, we discusspossible duality symmetries (Seiberg-duality) for non-supersymmetric gaugetheories within this framework.
