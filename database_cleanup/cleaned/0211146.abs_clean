In order todo that, we consider N=2 super Yang-Mills with one flavor and a mass breakingterm. One of the spontaneous symmetry breaking is accomplished by a scalar thatcan be in particular in the representation of the diquark condensate andtherefore it can be thought as being itself the condensate. We analyze thephases of the theory. In the superconducting phase, we show the existence ofBPS Z_k-strings and calculate exactly their string tension in a straightforwardway. We also find that magnetic fluxes of the monopole and Z_k-strings areproportional to one another allowing for monopole confinement in a phasetransition. We further show that some of the resulting confining theories canbe obtained by adding a deformation term to N=2 or N=4 superconformal theories.
