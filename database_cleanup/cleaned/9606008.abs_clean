We derive the anomaly 8-form of 6-dimensional gauge theories arising in Ftheory compactifications on elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds. The result allowsto determine the matter content of certain such theories in terms ofintersection numbers on the base of elliptic fibration. We also discuss gaugetheories on 7-branes with double point singularities on the worldvolume.Applications to Type II compactifications on Hirzebruch surfaces and $P^2$ areoutlined.
