The derivative expansion of the one-loop effective action in QED$_3$ andQED$_4$ is considered. The first term in such an expansion is the effectiveaction for a constant electromagnetic field. An explicit expression for thenext term containing two derivatives of the field strength $F_{\mu\nu}$, butexact in the magnitude of the field strength, is obtained. The general resultsfor fermion and scalar electrodynamics are presented. The cases of pureelectric and pure magnetic external fields are considered in details. TheFeynman rules for the perturbative expansion of the one-loop effective actionin the number of derivatives is developed.
