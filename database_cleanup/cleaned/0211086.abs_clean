We present a qualitative model of the Coulomb branch of the moduli space oflow-energy effective N=2 SQCD with gauge group SU(3) and up to five flavours ofmassive matter. Overall, away from double cores, we find a situation broadlysimilar to the case with no matter, but with additional complexity due to theproliferation of extra BPS states. We also include a revised version of thepure SU(3) model which can accommodate just the orthodox weak couplingspectrum.
