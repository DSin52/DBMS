We review the BRST analysis of the system of a (super)conformal mattercoupled to 2D (super)gravity. The spectrum and its operator realization arereported. In particular, the operators associated with the states of nonzeroghost number are given. We also discuss the ground ring structure of thesuper-Liouville coupled to ${\hat c}=1$ matter. In appendices, hermiticities,states for $c<1$ conformal matter coupled to gravity and the proof for thespectrum are discussed.
