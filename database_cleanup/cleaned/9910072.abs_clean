In the present article we solve the Dirac-Pauli and Klein Gordon equations inan asymptotically uniformly accelerated frame when a constant magnetic field ispresent. We compute, via the Bogoliubov coefficients, the density of scalar andspin 1/2 particles created. We discuss the role played by the magnetic fieldand the thermal character of the spectrum.
