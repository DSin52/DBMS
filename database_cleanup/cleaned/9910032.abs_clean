By making use of the Langevin equation with a kernel, it was shown that theFeynman measure exp(-S) can be realized in a restricted sense in a diffusivestochastic process, which diverges and has no equilibrium, for bottomlesssystems. In this paper, the dependence on the initial conditions and thetemporal behavior are analyzed for 0-dim bottomless systems. Furthermore, it isshown that it is possible to find stationary quantities.
