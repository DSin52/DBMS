We consider warped compactifications of ${\cal M}$-theory tothree-dimensional Minkowski space on compact eight-manifolds. Taking all theleading quantum gravity corrections of eleven-dimensional supergravity intoaccount we obtain the solution to the equations of motion and Bianchiidentities. Generically these vacua are not supersymmetric and yet have avanishing three-dimensional cosmological constant.
