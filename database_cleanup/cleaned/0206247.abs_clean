We study the holographic duals of type II and heterotic matrix stringtheories described by warped AdS_3 supergravities. By explicitly solving thelinearized equations of motion around near horizon D-string geometries, wedetermine the spectrum of Kaluza-Klein primaries for type I, II supergravitieson warped AdS_3 x S^7. The results match those coming from the dualtwo-dimensional gauge theories living on the D-string worldvolumes. We brieflydiscuss the connections with the N=(8,8), N=(8,0) orbifold superconformal fieldtheories to which type IIB / heterotic matrix strings flow in the infrared. Inparticular, we associate the dimension (3/2, 3/2) twisted operator which bringsthe matrix string theories out from the conformal point (R^8)^N / S_N with thedilaton profile in the supergravity background.The familiar dictionary between masses and scaling dimensions of fields andoperators are modified by the presence of non-trivial warp factors and runningdilatons. These modifications are worked out for the general case of domainwall / QFT correspondences between supergravities on warped AdS_{d+1} x S^qgeometries and super Yang-Mills theories with 16 supercharges.
