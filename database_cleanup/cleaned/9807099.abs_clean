It is shown that, under quite general conditions, thermal correlationfunctions in relativistic quantum field theory have stronger analyticityproperties in configuration space than those imposed by the KMS-condition.These analyticity properties may be understood as a remnant of the relativisticspectrum condition in the vacuum sector and lead to a Lorentz-covariantformulation of the KMS-condition involving all space-time variables.
