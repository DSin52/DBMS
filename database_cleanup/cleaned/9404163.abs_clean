We introduce a model detector which registers the passage of a particlethrough the detector location, without substantially perturbing the particlewave function. (The exact time of passage is not determined in suchmeasurements.) We then show that our detector can operate in a classicallyforbidden region and register particles passing through a certain point under apotential barrier. We show that it should be possible to observe the particle'strack under the barrier.
