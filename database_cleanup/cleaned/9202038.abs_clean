Starting from a topological gauge theory in two dimensions with symmetrygroups $ISO(2,1)$, $SO(2,1)$ and $SO(1,2)$ we construct a model for gravitywith non-trivial coupling to matter. We discuss the equations of motion whichare connected to those of previous related models but incorporate mattercontent. We also discuss the resulting quantum theory and finally presentexplicit formul\ae $\;$ for topological invariants.
