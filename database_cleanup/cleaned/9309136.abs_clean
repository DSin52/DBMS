An extension of the Artin Braid Group with new operators that generate doubleand triple intersections is considered. The extended Alexander theorem,relating intersecting closed braids and intersecting knots is proved for doubleand triple intersections, and a counter example is given for the case ofquadruple intersections. Intersecting knot invariants are constructed viaMarkov traces defined on intersecting braid algebra representations, and theextended Turaev representation is discussed as an example. Possibleapplications of the formalism to quantum gravity are discussed.
