We study the realization of the (super) conformal topological symmetry intwo-dimensional field theories. The mirror automorphism of the topologicalalgebra is represented as a reflection in the space of fields. As aconsequence, a double BRST structure for topological matter theories is found.It is shown that the implementation of the topological symmetry in non-critical(super)string theories depends on the matter content of the two realizationsconnected by the mirror transformation.
