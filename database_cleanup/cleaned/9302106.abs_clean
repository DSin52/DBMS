Title: Fields and Symmetries of 2D Strings

Comments: 13 pages, phyzzx

We describe some recent progress in understanding and formulating stringtheory which is based on extensive studies of strings in lower (D=2) dimension.At the center is a large $W_{\infty}$ symmetry that appears most simply in thematrix model picture. In turn the symmetry defines the dynamics giving Wardidentities and the complete S-matrix. The integrability aspect where nonlinearstring phenomena emerges from linear matrix model dynamics is emphasized.Extensions involving couplings of discrete topological fields to the tachyonare also described.
