The electric charge of a wormhole mouth and the magnetic flux ``linked'' bythe wormhole are non-commuting observables, and so cannot be simultaneouslydiagonalized. We use this observation to resolve some puzzles in wormholeelectrodynamics and chromodynamics. Specifically, we analyze the color electricfield that results when a colored object traverses a wormhole, and we discussthe measurement of the wormhole charge and flux using Aharonov-Bohminterference effects. We suggest that wormhole mouths may obey conventionalquantum statistics, contrary to a recent proposal by Strominger.
