We discuss issues concerning M(atrix) theory compactifications on curvedspaces. We argue from the form of the graviton propagator on curved space thatexcited string states do not decouple from the annulus D0-brane $v^4$amplitude, unlike the flat space case. This argument shows that a large classof quantum mechanical systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom cannotreproduce supergravity answers. We discuss the specific example of an ALE spaceand suggest sources of possible higher derivative terms that might helpreproduce supergravity results.
