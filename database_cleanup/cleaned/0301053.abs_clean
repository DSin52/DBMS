The problem of confinement of neutral fermions in two-dimensional space-timeis approached with a pseudoscalar double-step potential in the Dirac equation.Bound-state solutions are obtained when the coupling is of sufficientintensity. The confinement is made plausible by arguments based on effectivemass and anomalous magnetic interaction.
