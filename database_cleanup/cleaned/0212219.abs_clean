correctionsWe compute explicitly the four-particle amplitude in superstring theories byusing the hyperelliptic language and the newly obtained chiral measure ofD'Hoker and Phong. Although the algebra of the intermediate steps is a littlebit involved, we obtain a quite simple expression for the four-particleamplitude. As expected, the integrand is independent of all the insertionpoints. As an application of the obtained result, we show that the perturbativecorrection to the $R^4$ term in type II superstring theories is vanishingpoint-wise in (even) moduli space at two loops.
