We derive the Wilsonian renormalization group equation in two dimensional${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models. This equation shows thatthe sigma models on compact Einstein K\"{a}hler manifolds are aymptoticallyfree. This result is gerenal and does not depend on the specific forms of theK\"{a}hler potentials. We also examine the renormalization group flow in a newmodel which connects two manifolds with different global symmetries.
