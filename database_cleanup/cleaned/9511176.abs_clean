We analyze nonabelian massive Higgs-free theories in the causalEpstein-Glaser approach. Recently, there has been renewed interest in thesemodels. In particular we consider the well-known Curci-Ferrari model and thenonabelian St\"uckelberg models. We explicitly show the reason why theconsidered models fail to be unitary. In our approach only the asymptotic(linear) BRS-symmetry has to be considered.
