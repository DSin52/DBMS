388-403The quantum symmetry of a rational quantum field theory is a finite-dimensional multi-matrix algebra. Its representation category, which determinesthe fusion rules and braid group representations of superselection sectors, isa braided monoidal C^*-category. Various properties of such algebraicstructures are described, and some ideas concerning the classificationprogramme are outlined. (Invited talk given at the III. InternationalConference on Mathematical Physics, String Theory and Quantum Gravity, Alushta,Ukraine, June 1993. To appear in Teor.Mat.Fiz.)
