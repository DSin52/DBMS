We consider the general case of N=2 dual pairs of type IIA/heterotic stringtheories in four dimensions. We show that if the type IIA string in this paircan be viewed as having been compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold in the usualway then this manifold must be of the form of a K3 fibration. We also see howthe bound on the rank of the gauge group of the perturbative heterotic stringhas a natural interpretation on the type IIA side.
