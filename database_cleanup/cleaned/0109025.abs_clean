We study M-theory on two classes of manifolds of Spin(7) holonomy that aredeveloping an isolated conical singularity. We construct explicitly a new classof Spin(7) manifolds and analyse in detail the topology of the correspondingclassical spacetimes. We discover also an intricate interplay between variousanomalies in M-theory, string theory, and gauge theory within these models, andin particular find a connection between half-integral G-fluxes in M-theory andChern-Simons terms of the N=1, D=3 effective theory.
