SystemsThe relation between two--dimensional integrable systems andfour--dimen\-sional self--dual Yang--Mills equations is considered. Within thetwistor description and the zero--curvature representation a method is given toassociate self--dual Yang-Mills connections with integrable systems of theKorteweg--de Vries and non--linear Schr\"odinger type or principal chiralmodels.Examples of self--dual connections are constructed that as points in themoduli do not have two independent conformal symmetries.
