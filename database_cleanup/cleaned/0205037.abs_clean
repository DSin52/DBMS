In view of our accelerating universe, one of the outstanding theoreticalissues is the absence of a quantum-gravitational description of de Sitterspace. Although speculative, an intriguing circumvention may be found in therealm of brane-world scenarios; where the physical universe can be interpretedas a non-critical 3-brane moving in a higher-dimensional, static bulk. In thispaper, we focus on the cosmological implications of a positively curved braneworld evolving in the background of a ``topological'' anti-de Sitter black hole(i.e, Schwarzschild-like but with an arbitrary horizon topology). We show thatthe bulk black hole will typically induce either an asymptotically de Sitter``bounce'' universe or a big bang/big crunch FRW universe, depending on acritical value of mass. Interestingly, the critical mass is only non-vanishingin the case of a spherical horizon geometry. We go on to provide a holographicinterpretation of this curiosity.
