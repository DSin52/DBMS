The anomalous dimension of single and multi-trace composite operators ofscalar fields is shown to vanish at all orders of the perturbative series. Theproof hold for theories with N=2 supersymmetry with any number ofhypermultiplets in a generic representation of the gauge group. It then appliesto the finite N=4 theory as well as to non conformal N=2 models.
