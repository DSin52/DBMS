to Phys. Rev. Lett. referees' comments, the connection between expansions ininverse mass and in 1/N are spelled out, and a figure is added. An argumentagainst perturbatively predicting even late-time information is alsoprovided, as well as various minor changes.)Journal-ref: Phys.Rev.Lett. 71 (1993) 3743-3746

If black hole formation and evaporation can be described by an $S$ matrix,information would be expected to come out in black hole radiation. An estimateshows that it may come out initially so slowly, or else be so spread out, thatit would never show up in an analysis perturbative in $M_{Planck}/M$, or in 1/Nfor two-dimensional dilatonic black holes with a large number $N$ of minimallycoupled scalar fields.
