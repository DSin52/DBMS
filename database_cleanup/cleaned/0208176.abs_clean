Title: An Algorithm for the Microscopic Evaluation of the Coefficients of the

Seiberg-Witten PrepotentialAuthors: R. Flume and R. Poghossian

Comments: LaTeX, 23 pages; typos are corrected, determinant formula is

simplifiedA procedure, allowing to calculate the coefficients of the SW prepotential inthe framework of the instanton calculus is presented. As a demonstrationexplicit calculations for 2, 3 and 4- instanton contributions are carried out.
