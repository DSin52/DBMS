We focus onnoncommutative instantons and monopoles and study various aspects of the exactsolutions by using Atiyah-Drinfeld-Hitchin-Manin (ADHM) and Nahm constructions.Finally we propose noncommutative extensions of integrable systems and solitontheories in lower dimensions in collaboration with Kouichi Toda, which wouldpioneer a new study area of integrable systems. Appendix is devoted to a briefand systematic review of formal aspects of ADHM/Nahm construction and Nahmtransformation on commutative spaces. This article is also a step to acomprehensive review of ADHM/Nahm construction on both commutative andnoncommutative spaces. Comments are welcome.
