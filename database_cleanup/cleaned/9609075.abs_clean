We review the arguments that fundamental string states are in one to onecorrespondence with black hole states. We demonstrate the power of theassumption by showing that it implies that the statistical entropy of a wideclass of nonextreme black holes occurring in string theory is proportional tothe horizon area. However, the numerical coefficient relating the area andentropy only agrees with the Bekenstein--Hawking formula if the central chargeof the string is six which does not correspond to any known string theory.Unlike the current D-brane methods the method used in this paper is applicablefor the case of Schwarzschild and highly non-extreme charged black holes.
