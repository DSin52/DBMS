Title: Contraction and decomposition matrices for vacuum diagrams

Authors: K. Knecht and H. Veschelde

Comments: 10 pages

Tensor reduction of vacuum diagrams uses contraction and decompositionmatrices. We present general recurrence relations for the calculation of thosematrices and an explicit formula for the 3-loop decomposition matrix and itsdeterminant.
