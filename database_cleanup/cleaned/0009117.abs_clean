Title: Localization of graviphoton and graviscalar on the brane

Comments: 10 pages, comments and references added

The question of whether the Kaluza-Klein (KK) graviphoton $h_{5\mu}$ andgraviscalar $h_{55}$ are localized or not on the brane is one of the importantissues. In this letter, we address this problem in five dimensions. Here weconsider the massless (zero-mode) propagations without requiring theZ$_2$-symmetry on $h_{5\mu}$. We obtain the graviton $h_{\mu\nu}$, graviphoton,and graviscalar exchange amplitudes on shell. We find that the graviscalar hasa tachyonic mass. It turns out that $h_{5\mu}$ admits the localized zero-modeson the brane while $h_{55}$ does not have a localized zero-mode. This iscontrasted to the fact that the bulk spin-0 field has a localized zero-mode onthe brane but the bulk spin-1 field does not have a localized solution in fivedimensions.
