We give an explicit construction of the quantum-group generators ---local,semi-local, and global --- in terms of the group-valued quantum fields $\tildeg$ and $\tilde g^{-1}$ in the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten (WZNW) theory. Thealgebras among the generators and the fields make concrete and clear thebi-module properties of the $\tilde g$ and the $\tilde g^{-1}$ fields. We showthat the correlation functions of the $\tilde g$ and $\tilde g^{-1}$ fields inthe vacuum state defined through the semi-local quantum-group generator satisfya set of quantum-group difference equations. We give the explicit solution forthe two point function. A similar formulation can also be done for the quantumSelf-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) theory in four dimensions.
