We show that the $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'e quantum algebra proposed forelementary particle physics has the structure of a Hopf agebra bicrossproduct$U(so(1,3))\cobicross T$. The algebra is a semidirect product of the classicalLorentz group $so(1,3)$ acting in a deformed way on the momentum sector $T$.The novel feature is that the coalgebra is also semidirect, with a backreactionof the momentum sector on the Lorentz rotations. Using this, we show that the$\kappa$-Poincar\'e acts covariantly on a $\kappa$-Minkowski space, which weintroduce. It turns out necessarily to be deformed and non-commutative. We alsoconnect this algebra with a previous approach to Planck scale physics.
