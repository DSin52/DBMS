Title: A note on the decay of noncommutative solitons

Authors: Ciprian Acatrinei and Corneliu Sochichiu

We propose an ansatz for the equations of motion of the noncommutative modelof a tachyonic scalar field interacting with a gauge field, which allows one tofind time-dependent solutions describing decaying solitons. These correspond tothe collapse of lower dimensional branes obtained through tachyon condensationof unstable brane systems in string theory.
