We find the general expression for the open superstring partition function onthe annulus in a constant abelian gauge field background and at finitetemperature. We use the approach based on Green-Schwarz string path integral inthe light-cone gauge and compare it with NSR approach. We discuss the superYang-Mills theory limit and mention some D-brane applications.
