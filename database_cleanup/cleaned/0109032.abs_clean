We discuss the open string one-loop partition function in tachyoncondensation background of a unstable D-brane system. We evaluate the partitionfunction by using the boundary state formulation and find that it is incomplete agreement with the result obtained in the boundary string fieldtheory. It suggests that the open string higher loop diagrams may be producedconsistently by a closed string field theory, where the D-brane plays a role ofsource for the closed string field.
