We calculate the exact values of the holomorphic observables of {\cal N}=4supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory deformed by mass terms which preserve{\cal N}=1 SUSY. These include the chiral condensates in each massive vacuum ofthe theory as well as the central charge which determines the tension of BPSsaturated domain walls interpolating between these vacua. Several unexpectedfeatures emerge in the large-N limit, including anomalous modular propertiesunder an SL(2,Z) duality group which acts on a complexification of the 't Hooftcoupling \lambda=g^{2}N/4\pi. We discuss our results in the context of theAdS/CFT correspondence.
