We present two examples of SUSY mechanics related with K\"ahler geometry. Thefirst system is the N=4 supersymmetric one-dimensional sigma-model proposed inhep-th/0101065. Another system is the N=2 SUSY mechanics whose phase space isthe external algebra of an arbitrary K\"ahler manifold. The relation of thesemodels with antisymplectic geometry is discussed.
