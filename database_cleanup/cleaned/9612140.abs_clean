The Chern-Simons topological term coefficient is derived at arbitrary finitedensity. As it occures that $\mu^2 = m^2$ is the crucial point forChern-Simons. So when $\mu^2 < m^2 \mu$--influence disappears and we get theusual Chern-Simons term. On the other hand when $\mu^2 > m^2$ the Chern-Simonsterm vanishes because of non-zero density of background fermions. In particularfor massless case parity anomaly is absent at any finite density. This resultholds in any odd dimension as in abelian so as in nonabelian cases.
