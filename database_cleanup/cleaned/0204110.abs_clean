2.1, comments and references; more detailed derivation in section 4.1There are good indications that fundamental physics gives rise to a modifiedspace-momentum uncertainty relation that implies the existence of a minimumlength scale. We implement this idea in the scalar field theory that describesdensity perturbations in flat Robertson-Walker space-time. This leads to anon-linear time-dependent dispersion relation that encodes the effects ofPlanck scale physics in the inflationary epoch. Unruh type dispersion relationsnaturally emerge in this approach, while unbounded ones are excluded by theminimum length principle. We also find red-shift induced modifications of thefield theory, due to the reduction of degrees of freedom at high energies, thattend to dampen the fluctuations at trans-Planckian momenta. In the specificexample considered, this feature helps determine the initial state of thefluctuations, leading to a flat power spectrum.
