We analyze the Chern-Simons field theory coupled to non-relativistic matterfield on a sphere using canonical transformation on the fields with specialHilbert space to the one with a definite number of charges and dictates Diracquantization condition to the Chern-Simons coefficient, whereas SO(2)invariance does not. The corresponding Schr\"odinger equation for many anyons(and for multispecies) on the sphere are presented with appropriate boundarycondition. In the presence of an external magnetic monopole source, the groundstate solutions of anyons are compared with monopole harmonics. The role of thetranslation and modular symmetry on a torus is also expounded.
