Title: Some Consequences of Noncommutative Worldsheet of Superstring

Comments: 10 pages, Latex, no figure, one section is omitted and some

references are addedIn this paper some properties of the superstring with noncommutativeworldsheet are studied. We study the noncommutativity of the spacetime,generalization of the Poincar\'e symmetry of the superstring, the changes ofthe metric, antisymmetric tensor and dilaton.
