We formulate new gauge principles for n supersymmetric particles in aworldline formalism with N supersymmetries. The models provide realizations ofthe more general supersymmetries that are encountered in sectors of S-theory orMatrix theory, with a superalgebra that involves products of momenta. Due tolocal gauge and kappa symmetries the n superparticle momenta and N superchargesare constrained. The constraints have solutions only in a space with n timelikedimensions and SO(d+n-2,n) spacetime symmetry. The cases SO(9,1), SO(10,2) andSO(10,3), with one, two and three timelike dimensions respectively, are ofspecial interest. In each case, due to the constraints, the classical motionand quantum theory of each superparticle are equivalent to the physics with asingle time-like dimension in an effective 10D superspace with SO(9,1) Lorentzsymmetry.
