Title: Green's Functions in Axial and Lorentz-type Gauges and Application to

The Axial Pole Prescription and The Wilson LoopComments: 10 pages Latex file,Talk presented at The Workshop "QFT2000" held at

Saha Institute for Nuclear Physics, Calcutta, INDIA from 18-22 January 2000We summarize the work done in connecting Green's functions in a differentclasses of gauges and its applications to the problems in the axial gauges.Theprocedure adopted uses finite field-dependent BRS [FFBRS] transformations toconnect axial and the Lorentz type gauges.These transformations preserve thevacuum expectation of gauge-invariant observables explicitly. We discuss theapplications of these ideas to the axial gauge pole problem and to thepreservation of the Wilson loop and the thermal Wilson loop.
