Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B457 (1999) 268-274

A closed universe containing pressureless dust, more generally perfect fluidmatter with pressure-to-density ratio w in the range (1/3, - 1/3), violatesholographic principle applied according to the Fischler-Susskind proposal. Weshow, first for a class of two-fluid solutions and then for the generalmultifluid case, that the closed universe will obey the holographic principleif it also contains matter with w < - 1/3, and if the present value of itstotal density is sufficiently close to the critical density. It is possiblethat such matter can be realised by some form of `quintessence', much studiedrecently.
