Fermionic and bosonic ghost systems are defined each in terms of a singlevertex algebra which admits a one-parameter family of conformal structures. Theobservation that these structures are related to each other provides a simpleway to obtain character formulae for a general twisted module of a ghostsystem. The U(1) symmetry and its subgroups that underly the twisted modulesalso define an infinite set of invariant vertex subalgebras. Their structure isstudied in detail from a W-algebra point of view with particular emphasis onZ_N-invariant subalgebras of the fermionic ghost system.
