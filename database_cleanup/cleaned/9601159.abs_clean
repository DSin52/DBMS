I discuss the indefinite metrical structure of the time-space translations asrealized in the indefinite inner products for relativistic quantum fields,familiar in the example of quantum gauge fields. The arising indefinite unitarynondiagonalizable representations of the translations suggest as the positiveunitarity condition for the probability interpretable positive definiteasymptotic particle state space the requirement of a vanishing nilpotent partin the time-space translations realization. A trivial Becchi-Rouet-Stora charge(classical gauge invariance) for the asymptotics in quantum gauge theories canbe interpreted as one special case of this general principle - the asymptoticprojection to the eigenstates of the time-space translations.
