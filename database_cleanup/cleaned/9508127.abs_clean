Different regularizations are studied in localization of path integrals. Wediscuss the effect of the choice of regularization by evaluating the partitionfunctions for the harmonic oscillator and the Weyl character for SU(2). Inparticular, we solve the Weyl shift problem that arises in path integralevaluation of the Weyl character by using the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer$\eta$-invariant and the Borel-Weil theory.
