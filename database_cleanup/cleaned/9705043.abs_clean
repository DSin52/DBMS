Title: Universality of the R-deformed Heisenberg algebra

Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX, Invited talk at the International Seminar

"Supersymmetry and Quantum Field Theory" dedicated to the memory of D. V.Volkov, Kharkov (Ukraine), January 5-7, 1997We show that deformed Heisenberg algebra with reflection emerging inparabosonic constructions is also related to parafermions. This universality isdiscussed in different algebraic aspects and is employed for the description ofspin-j fields, anyons and supersymmetry in 2+1 dimensions.
