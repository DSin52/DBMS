Using a formulation of QCD_2 as a perturbed conformally invariant theoryinvolving fermions, ghosts, as well as positive and negative levelWess-Zumino-Witten fields, we show that the BRST conditions become restrictionson the conformally invariant sector, as described by a G/G topological theory.By solving the corresponding cohomology problem we are led to a finite set ofvacua. For G=SU(2) these vacua are two-fold degenerate.
