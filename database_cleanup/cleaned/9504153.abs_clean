The systematic method for the conversion of first class constraints to theequivalent set of Abelian one based on the Dirac equivalence transformation isdeveloped. The representation for the corresponding matrix performing thistransformation is proposed. This representation allows one to lead the problemof abelianization to the solution of a certain system of first order {\itlinear } differential equations for matrix elements .
