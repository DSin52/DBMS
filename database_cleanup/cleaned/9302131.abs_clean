The similarity between tree-level string theory scalar amplitudes, theKoba-Nielsen form ($S^{1}$) and the Virasoro-Shapiro form ($S^{2}$) suggests anatural $S^{n}$ generalization for a scalar amplitude. It is shown that the$S^{n}$ amplitude shares many essential properties of the string theoryamplitudes, including $SO(n+1,1)$ conformal symmetry and linear Reggetrajectories for the mass spectrum. We also discuss factorization and thecritical dimension for the amplitude, which are the necessary conditions forthe quantum mechanical consistency (unitarity) of the amplitude.
