We study the Liouville theory on a Riemann surface of genus g by means oftheir associated Drinfeld--Sokolov linear systems. We discuss the cohomologicalproperties of the monodromies of these systems. We identify the space ofsolutions of the equations of motion which are single--valued and local andexplicitly represent them in terms of Krichever--Novikov oscillators. Then wediscuss the operator structure of the quantum theory, in particular wedetermine the quantum exchange algebras and find the quantum conditions forunivalence and locality. We show that we can extend the above discussion to$sl_n$ Toda theories.
