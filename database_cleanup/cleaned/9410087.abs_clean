The large N phase transition point is investigated in the heat kernel on the$U(N)$ group with respect to arbitrary boundary conditions. A simple functionalrelation is found relating the density of eigenvalues of the boundary field tothe saddle point shape of the typical Young tableaux in the large $N$ limit ofthe character expansion of the heat kernel. Both strong coupling and weakcoupling phases are investigated for some particular cases of the boundaryholonomy.
