Holography suggests a considerable reduction of degrees of freedom intheories with gravity. However it seems to be difficult to understand howholography could be realized in a closed re--contracting universe. In thisletter we claim that a scenario which achieves that goal will eliminate allspatial degrees of freedom. This would require a different concept of quantummechanics and would imply an intriguing increase of power for the natural laws.
