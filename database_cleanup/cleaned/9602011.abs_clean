We demonstrate that in addition to the usual fourth-rank superfield $(W_{a bc d})$ which describes the on-shell theory, a spinor superfield $(J_\a )$ canbe introduced into the 11D geometrical tensors with engineering dimensions lessor equal to one in such a way to satisfy the Bianchi identities in superspace.The components arising from $J_\a$ are identified as some of the auxiliaryfields required for a full off-shell formulation. Our result indicates thateleven dimensional supergravity does not have to be completely on-shell. The$\k\-$symmetry of the supermembrane action in the presence of our partialoff-shell supergravity background is also confirmed. Our modifications toeleven-dimensional supergravity theory are thus likely relevant for M-theory.We suggest our proposal as a significant systematic off-shell generalization ofeleven-dimensional supergravity theory.
