We present new analytic and numerical results for self-gravitatingSU(2)-Higgs magnetic monopoles approaching the black hole threshold. Ourinvestigation extends to large Higgs self-coupling, lambda, a regime heretoforeunexplored. When lambda is small, the critical solution where a horizon firstappears is extremal Reissner-Nordstrom outside the horizon but has anonsingular interior. When lambda is large, the critical solution is anextremal black hole with non-Abelian hair and a mass less than the extremalReissner-Nordstrom value. The transition between these two regimes isreminiscent of a first-order phase transition. We analyze in detail theapproach to these critical solutions as the Higgs expectation value is varied,and compare this analysis with the numerical results.
