Title: Integral Intertwining Operators and Complex Powers of Differential

($q-$Difference) OperatorsComments: 50 pages

We study a family of modules over Kac-Moody algebras realized in multi-valuedfunctions on a flag manifold and find integral representations for intertwiningoperators acting on these modules. These intertwiners are related to someexpressions involving complex powers of Lie algebra generators.When applied to affine Lie algebras, these expressions give integral formulasfor correlation functions with values in not necessarily highest weightmodules.We write related formulas out in an explicit form in the case of$\hat{\gtsl_{2}}$. The latter formulas admit q-deformation producing anintegral representation of q-correlation functions. We also discuss a relationof complex powers of Lie algebra (quantum group) generators and Casimiroperators to ($q-$)special functions.
