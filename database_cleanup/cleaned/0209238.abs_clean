We present a class of solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations ind-dimensions, all of which are asymptotically (anti)-de Sitter space-times.They describe electrically charged rotating solutions, which aregeneralizations of those found by Lemos (gr-qc/9404041). These solutions havetoroidal, planar or cylindrical horizons and can be interpreted as black holes,or black strings/branes. We calculate the inverse temperature and entropy, andthen we use the Brown-York stress-tensor to calculate mass and angular momentaof these solutions.
