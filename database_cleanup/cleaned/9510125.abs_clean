(ysmyung@physics.inje.ac.kr)We obtain the $\epsilon<2$ new extremal ground states of a two-dimensional(2D) charged black hole where $\epsilon$ is the dilaton coupling parameter forthe Maxwell term. The stability analysis is carried out for all these extremalblack holes. It is found that the shape of potentials to an on-coming tachyon(as a spectator) take all barrier-well types. These provide the bound statesolutions, which imply that they are unstable. We conclude that the 2D,$\epsilon<2$ extremal black holes should not be considered as a toy model forthe stable endpoint of the Hawking evaporation.
