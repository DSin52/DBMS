In this paper, we pursue our analysis of the W-infinity symmetry of thelow-energy edge excitations of incompressible quantum Hall fluids. Theseexcitations are described by (1+1)-dimensional effective field theories, whichare built by representations of the W-infinity algebra. Generic W-infinitytheories predict many more fluids than the few, stable ones found inexperiments. Here we identify a particular class of W-infinity theories, theminimal models, which are made of degenerate representations only - a familiarconstruction in conformal field theory. The W-infinity minimal models exist forspecific values of the fractional conductivity, which nicely fit theexperimental data and match the results of the Jain hierarchy of quantum Hallfluids. We thus obtain a new hierarchical construction, which is based uniquelyon the concept of quantum incompressible fluid and is independent of Jain'sapproach and hypotheses. Furthermore, a surprising non-Abelian structure isexcitations with SU(m) quantum numbers and non-Abelian fractional statistics.The physical electron is made of anyon and quark excitations. We discuss someproperties of these neutral excitations which could be seen in experiments andnumerical simulations.
