The $sl(2)$ minimal theories are labelled by a Lie algebra pair $(A,G)$ where$G$ is of $A$-$D$-$E$ type. For these theories on a cylinder we conjecture acomplete set of conformal boundary conditions labelled by the nodes of thetensor product graph $A\otimes G$. The cylinder partition functions are givenby fusion rules arising from the graph fusion algebra of $A\otimes G$. Wefurther conjecture that, for each conformal boundary condition, an integrableboundary condition exists as a solution of the boundary Yang-Baxter equationfor the associated lattice model. The theory is illustrated using the$(A_4,D_4)$ or 3-state Potts model.
