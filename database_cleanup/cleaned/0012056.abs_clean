Authors: P. Kosi\'{n}ski (Lodz Univ.), J. Lukierski (Wroclaw Univ.) and P.

Ma\'{s}lanka (Lodz Univ.)Comments: LaTeX2e, 10 pages. To appear in the Proceedings of XXIII

International Colloquium on Group-Theoretical Methods in Physics, July 31-August 5, Dubna, Russia". The names of the authors correctedThe star product technique translates the framework of local fields onnoncommutative space-time into nonlocal fields on standard space-time. Weconsider the example of fields on $\kappa$- deformed Minkowski space,transforming under $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'{e} group with noncommutativeparameters. By extending the star product to the tensor product of functions on$\kappa$-deformed Minkowski space and $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'{e} group werepresent the algebra of noncommutative parameters of deformed relativisticsymmetries by functions on classical Poincar\'{e} group.
