We apply various conventional tests of integrability to the supersymmetricnonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We find that a matrix Lax pair exists andthat the system has the Painlev\'e property only for a particular choice of thefree parameters of the theory. We also show that the second Hamiltonianstructure generalizes to superspace only for these values of the parameters. Weare unable to construct a zero curvature formulation of the equations based onOSp(2$|$1). However, this attempt yields a nonsupersymmetric fermionicgeneralization of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation which appears to possessthe Painlev\'e property.
