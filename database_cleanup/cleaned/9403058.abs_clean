We examine some novel physical consequences of the general structure ofmoduli spaces of string vacua. These include (1) finiteness of the volume ofthe moduli space and (2) chaotic motion of the moduli in the early universe. Tofix ideas we examine in detail the example of the (conjectural) dilaton-axion``$S$-duality'' of four-dimensional string compactifications. The facts (1) and(2) together might help to solve some problems with the standard scenarios forsupersymmetry breaking and vacuum selection in string theory.
