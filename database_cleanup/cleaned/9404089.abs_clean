We propose the action for a massive $N$-extended superparticle with a pure(half)integer superspin $Y,~Y = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, \ldots$. Regardless of thesuperspin value, the configuration space is ${\Bbb R}^{4|4N} \times S^2$, where$S^2$ corresponds to spinning degrees of freedom. Being explicitlysuper-Poincar\'e invariant, the model possesses two gauge symmetries implyingstrong conservation of the squared momentum and superspin. Hamilton constraineddynamics is developed and canonical quantization is studied. For $N$ = 1 weshow that the physical super wave-functions are to be on-shell massive chiralsuperfields. Central-charges generalizations of the model are given.
