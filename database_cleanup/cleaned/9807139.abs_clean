We study a BPS configuration in which four strings (of different type) meetat a point in $N = 2, D = 8$ supergravity, i.e., the low energy effectivetheory of $T^2$-compactified type II string theory. We demonstrate that thecharge conservation of the four strings implies the vanishing of the net force(due to the tensions of various strings) at the junction and vice versa, usingthe tension formula for $SL(3, Z)$ strings obtained recently by the presentauthors. We then show that a general 4-string junction preserves 1/8 of thespacetime supersymmetries. Using 4-string junctions as building blocks, weconstruct a string network which also preserves 1/8 of the spacetimesupersymmetries.
