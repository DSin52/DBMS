This contribution gives in sigma-model language a short review of recentwork on T-duality for open strings in the presence of abelian or non-abeliangauge fields. Furthermore, it adds a critical discussion of the relationbetween RG beta-functions and the Born-Infeld action in the case of a stringcoupled to a D-brane.
