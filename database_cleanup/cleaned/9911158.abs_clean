We compute the one-loop divergences of D=10, N=1 supergravity and of itsreduction to D=8. We study the tensor structure of the counterterms appearingin D=8 and D=10 and compare these to expressions previously found in the lowenergy expansion of string theory. The infinities have the primitive Yang-Millstree amplitude as a common factor.
