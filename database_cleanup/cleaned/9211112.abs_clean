represented by means of free bosonic oscillators through a Drinfeld--Sokolovconstruction? We answer affirmatively in the case of a cylindrical space--timeand for real hyperbolic solutions of the Toda field equations. We establish infact a one--to--one correspondence between such solutions and the space of freeleft and right bosonic oscillators with coincident zero modes. We discuss thesame problem for real singular solutions with non hyperbolic monodromy.
