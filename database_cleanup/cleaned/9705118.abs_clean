Theory, International Seminar dedicated to the memory of D. V. Volkov(Kharkov, 1997)The action of supersymmetric Born-Infeld theory (D-9-brane in a Lorentzcovariant static gauge) has a geometric form of the Volkov-Akulov-type. Thefirst non-linearly realized supersymmetry can be made manifest, the secondworld-volume supersymmetry is not manifest. We also study the analogous 2supersymmetries of the quadratic action of the covariantly quantized D-0-brane.We show that the Hamiltonian and the BRST operator are build from these twosupersymmetry generators.
