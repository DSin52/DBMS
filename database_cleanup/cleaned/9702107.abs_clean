Motivated by the recent D-brane constructions of world-volume monopoles andinstantons, we study the supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory on $S^1 \timesR^{3+1}$, spontaneously broken by a Wilson loop. In addition to the usual N-1fundamental monopoles, the N-th BPS monopole appears from the Kaluza-Kleinsector. When all N monopoles are present, net magnetic charge vanishes and thesolution can be reinterpreted as a Wilson-loop instanton of unit Pontryaginnumber. The instanton/multi-monopole moduli space is explicitly constructed,and seen to be identical to a Coulomb phase moduli space of a U(1)^N gaugetheory in 2+1 dimensions related to Kronheimer's gauge theory of SU(N) type.This extends the results by Intriligator and Seiberg to the finite couplingsthat, in the infrared limit of Kronheimer's theory, the Coulomb phaseparameterizes a centered SU(N) instanton. We also elaborate on the case ofrestored SU(N) symmetry.
