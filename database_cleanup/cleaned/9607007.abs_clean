We evaluate partition functions $Z_I$ in topologically nontrivial (instanton)gauge sectors in the bosonized version of the Schwinger model and in a gaugedWZNW model corresponding to $QCD_2$ with adjoint fermions. We show that thebosonized model is equivalent to the fermion model only if a particular form ofthe WZNW action with gauge-invariant integrand is chosen. For the exactcorrespondence, it is necessary to integrate over the ways the gauge group$SU(N)/Z_N$ is embedded into the full $O(N^2 - 1)$ group for the bosonizedmatter field. For even $N$, one should also take into account the contributionsof both disconnected components in $O(N^2 - 1)$. In that case, $Z_I \proptom^{n_0}$ for small fermion masses where $2n_0$ coincides with the number offermion zero modes in a particular instanton background. The Taylor expansionof $Z_I/m^{n_0}$ in mass involves only even powers of $m$ as it should. Thephysics of adjoint $QCD_2$ is discussed. We argue that, for odd $N$, thediscrete chiral symmetry $Z_2 \otimes Z_2$ present in the action is brokenspontaneously down to $Z_2$ and the fermion condensate $<\bar{\lambda}\lambda>_0$ is formed. The system undergoes a first order phase transition at$T_c = 0$ so that the condensate is zero at an arbitrary small temperature. Itis not yet quite clear what happens for even $N \geq 4$.
