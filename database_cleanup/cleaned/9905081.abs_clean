We investigate a family of solutions of Type IIb supergravity whichasymptotically approach AdS_5 X S^5 but contain a non-constant dilaton andvolume scalar for the five-sphere. These solutions preserve an SO(1,3) X SO(6)symmetry. We discuss the solution in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence,and we find that as well as running coupling from the nontrivial dilaton, thecorresponding field theory has no supersymmetry and displays confinement atleast for a certain range of parameters.
