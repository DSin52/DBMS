An algorithm is devised to generate characteristic identities between Maxwellfieldstrength invariants (traced over Lorentz indices and disregardingordering) that suffer linear dependence in certain dimensionalities as theyhave been originally obtained using a Maple routine. These relations betweeninvariants are then applied to simplify the Abelian Born-Infeld (ABI) effectiveaction in arbitrary degree of fieldstrength invariants. I have explicitlydisplayed the simplified ABI action in 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 space-timedimensions relevant in Dp-branes.
