Mohammadi. Email correspondence please to <sadooghi@theory.ipm.ac.ir>In the first part of this work, a perturbative analysis up to one-loop orderis carried out to determine the one-loop $\beta$-function of noncommutativeU(1) gauge theory with matter fields in the adjoint representation. In thesecond part, the conformal anomaly of the same theory is calculated using theFujikawa's path integral method. The value of the one-loop $\beta$-functioncalculated in both methods coincides. As it turns out, noncommutative QED withmatter fields in the adjoint representation is asymptotically free for thenumber of flavor degrees of freedom $N_{f}<3$.
