We conjecture that M-theory compactified on an ALE space (or K3) is describedby 0-branes moving on the ALE space. We give evidence for this by showing thatif we compactify another circle, we recover string theory on the ALE space.This guarantees that in the large N limit, the matrix model correctly describesthe force law between gravitons moving in an ALE background. We also show theappearance in M(atrix) theory of the duality of M-theory on K3 with theheterotic string on a three-torus.
