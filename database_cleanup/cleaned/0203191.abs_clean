Observational evidence suggests that our universe is currently evolvingtowards an asymptotically de Sitter future. Unfortunately and in spite of muchrecent attention, various quantum, holographic and cosmological aspects of deSitter space remain quite enigmatic. With such intrigue in mind, this paperconsiders the ``construction'' of a toy model that describes an asymptoticallyde Sitter universe. More specifically, we add fluid-like matter to an otherwisepurely de Sitter spacetime, formulate the relevant solutions and then discussthe cosmological and holographic implications. If the objective is to constructan asymptotically de Sitter universe that is free of singularities and has astraightforward holographic interpretation, then the results of this analysisare decidedly negative. Nonetheless, this toy model nicely illustrates thepitfalls that might be encountered in a more realistic type of construction.
