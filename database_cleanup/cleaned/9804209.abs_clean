A one-parameter family of new solutions representing Einstein spaces in$d=5,7$ is presented, and used to construct non-supersymmetric backgrounds intype IIB and M-theory that asymptotically approach $AdS_5\times S^5$ and$AdS_7\times S^4$ . Upon dimensional reduction, the latter gives a type IIAsolution representing a 4-brane with Ramond-Ramond charge, which interpolatesbetween the "near-horizon" non-extremal D4 brane and a geometry connected byT-duality to a new constant dilaton solution in type IIB. We discuss thepossibility that M-theory on this space may be related to a (0,2)six-dimensional field theory on $S^1\times S^1$, with fermions obeyingantiperiodic boundary conditions in both circles.
