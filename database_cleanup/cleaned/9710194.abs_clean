Title: 't Hooft Loop Average in the Vicinity of the Londons' Limit and the

Quartic Cumulant of the Field Strength TensorsComments: 5 pages, LaTeX, references are added

The next-to-leading term in the weight factor of the string representation ofthe 't Hooft loop average defined on the string world-sheet is found in theAbelian Higgs Model near the Londons' limit. This term emerges due to thefiniteness of the coupling constant and, in contrast to the Londons' limit,where only the bilocal cumulant in the expansion of the 't Hooft averagesurvived, leads to the appearance of the quartic cumulant. Apart from theLondons' penetration depth of the vacuum, which was a typical fall-off scale ofthe bilocal cumulant, the quartic cumulant depends also on the othercharacteristic length of the Abelian Higgs Model, the correlation radius of theHiggs field.
