Hawking radiation emanating from two-dimensional charged and unchargeddilatonic black holes - dimensionally reduced from (2+1) spinning and spinless,respectively, BTZ black holes - is viewed as a tunnelling process. Twodimensional dilatonic black holes (AdS(2) included) are treated as dynamicalbackgrounds in contrast to the standard methodology where the backgroundgeometry is fixed when evaluating Hawking radiation. This modification to thegeometry gives rise to a nonthermal part in the radiation spectrum. Nonzerotemperature of the extremal two-dimensional charged black hole is found.The Bekenstein-Hawking area formula is easily derived for these dynamicalgeometries.
