We discuss the notion of duality and selfduality in the context of the dualprojection operation that creates an internal space of potentials. Contrary tothe prevailing algebraic or group theoretical methods, this technique isapplicable to both even and odd dimensions. The role of parity in the kernel ofthe Gauss law to determine the dimensional dependence is clarified. We derivethe appropriate invariant actions, discuss the symmetry groups and their propergenerators. In particular, the novel concept of duality symmetry andselfduality in Maxwell theory in (2+1) dimensions is analysed in details. Thecorresponding action is a 3D version of the familiar duality symmetricelectromagnetic theory in 4D. Finally, the duality symmetric actions in thedifferent dimensions constructed here manifest both the SO(2) and $Z_2$symmetries, contrary to conventional results.
