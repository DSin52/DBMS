commenting the nature of the holographic principle and the particle/eventhorizonWe study the scaling exponents for the expanding isotropic flat cosmologicalmodels. The dimension of space, the equation of state of the cosmic fluid andthe scaling exponent for a physical variable are related by the Euler Betafunction that controls the singular behavior of the global integrals. Weencounter dual cosmological scenarios using the properties of the Betafunction. For the entropy density integral we reproduce the Fischler-Susskindholographic bound.
