The effective average action of Yang-Mills theory is analyzed in theframework of exact renormalization group flow equations. Employing thebackground-field method and using a cutoff that is adjusted to the spectralflow, the running of the gauge coupling is obtained on all scales. In fourdimensions and for the gauge groups SU(2) and SU(3), the coupling approaches afixed point in the infrared.
