Title: Differential Calculus on Quantum Spaces and Quantum Groups

Authors: Bruno Zumino

Comments: 23 pages

A review of recent developments in the quantum differential calculus. Thequantum group $GL_q(n)$ is treated by considering it as a particular quantumspace. Functions on $SL_q(n)$ are defined as a subclass of functions on$GL_q(n)$. The case of $SO_q(n)$ is also briefly considered. These notes coverpart of a lecture given at the XIX International Conference on Group TheoreticMethods in Physics, Salamanca, Spain 1992.
