T-Duality invariant worldsheet string actions, recently written down bySchwarz and Sen, are coupled to the worldsheet gauge fields. It is shown thatthe integration of the dual coordinates gives the conventional, vector, axialand chiral, gauged string actions for the appropriate choice of the gaugedisometries. Alternatively, the gauge field integration is shown to give aT-duality invariant action which matches with the corresponding results knownearlier.
