In the previous paper [hep-th/9904129], we constructed a general explicit BPSsolution for (F, D3) non-threshold bound state. By using the SL(2,Z) symmetryof type IIB string theory, we here construct from (F, D3) a more general BPSconfiguration for a D3 brane with certain units of quantized 5-form flux and aninfinite number of parallel (F, D1)-strings. We study its decoupling limit andfind that given Maldacena's $AdS_5/CFT_4$ correspondence with respect to simpleD3 branes and with the usual string coupling, we should have a similarcorrespondence with respect to this bound state but now with an effectivestring coupling. We discuss possible descendants of this bound state byT-dualities along its longitudinal or transverse directions. In particular, wepresent explicit configurations for ((F, Dp), D(p + 2)) bound states for $2 \lep \le 5$. All these configurations preserve one half of the spacetimesupersymmetries.
