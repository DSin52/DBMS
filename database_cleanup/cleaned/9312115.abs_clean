The exact general evolution of circular strings in $2+1$ dimensional deSitter spacetime is described closely and completely in terms of ellipticfunctions. The evolution depends on a constant parameter $b$, related to thestring energy, and falls into three classes depending on whether $b<1/4$(oscillatory motion), $b=1/4$ (degenerated, hyperbolic motion) or $b>1/4$(unbounded motion). The novel feature here is that one single world-sheetgenerically describes {\it infinitely many} (different and independent)strings. The world-sheet time $\tau$ is an infinite-valued function of thestring physical time, each branch yields a different string. This has noanalogue in flat spacetime. We compute the string energy $E$ as a function ofthe string proper size $S$, and analyze it for the expanding and oscillatingdecreases for small $S$ and increases $\propto\hspace*{-1mm}S$ for large $S$.For an oscillating string $(0\leq S\leq S_{max})$, the average energy $<E>$over one oscillation period is expressed as a function of $S_{max}$ as acomplete elliptic integral of the third kind.
