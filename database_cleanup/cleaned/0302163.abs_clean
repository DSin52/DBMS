We consider non-supersymmetric large N orientifold field theories.Specifically, we discuss a gauge theory with a Dirac fermion in theanti-symmetric tensor representation. We argue that, at large N and in a largepart of its bosonic sector, this theory is non-perturbatively equivalent to N=1SYM, so that exact results established in the latter (parent) theory also holdin the daughter orientifold theory. In particular, the non-supersymmetrictheory has an exactly calculable bifermion condensate, exactly degenerateparity doublets, and a vanishing cosmological constant (all this to leadingorder in 1/N).
