We construct dyonic states in 2+1-dimensional lattice Z_N-Higgs models, i.e.,states which are both, electrically and magnetically charged. The associatedHilbert spaces carry charged representations of the observable algebra, theglobal transfer matrix and a unitary implementation of the group of spatiallattice translations. We prove that for coinciding total charges theserepresentations are dynamically equivalent and we construct a local intertwinerconnection depending on a path in the space of charge distributions. Theholonomy of this connection is given by Z_N-valued phases. This will be thestarting point for a construction of scattering states with anyon statistics ina subsequent paper.
