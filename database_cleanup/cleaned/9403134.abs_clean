spaceComments: 8 pages

and Integrable SystemsIt is shown that the general solution of a homogeneous Monge-Amp\`{e}reequation in $n$-dimensional space is closely connected with the exactly(but only implicitly) integrable system\frac {\partial \xi_{j}}{\partial x_0}+\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\xi_{k} \frac {\partial \xi_{j}}{\partial x_{k}}=0 \label{1}Using the explicit form of solution of this system it is possible toconstruct the general solution of the Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation.
