According to 't Hooft the combination of quantum mechanics and gravityrequires the three dimensional world to be an image of data that can be storedon a two dimensional projection much like a holographic image. The twodimensional description only requires one discrete degree of freedom per Planckarea and yet it is rich enough to describe all three dimensional phenomena.After outlining 't Hooft's proposal I give a preliminary informal descriptionof how it may be implemented. One finds a basic requirement that particles mustgrow in size as their momenta are increased far above the Planck scale. Theconsequences for high energy particle collisions are described. The phenomenaof particle growth with momentum was previously discussed in the context ofstring theory and was related to information spreading near black holehorizons. The considerations of this paper indicate that the effect is muchmore rapid at all but the earliest times. In fact the rate of spreading isfound to saturate the bound from causality. Finally we consider string theoryas a possible realization of 't Hooft's idea. The light front lattice stringmodel of Klebanov and Susskind is reviewed and its similarities with theholographic theory are demonstrated. The agreement between the two requiresunproven but plausible assumptions about the nonperturbative behavior of stringtheory. Very similar ideas to those in this paper have been long held byCharles Thorn.
