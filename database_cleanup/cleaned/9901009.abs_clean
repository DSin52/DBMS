We review the spectral cover formalism for constructing both U(n) and SU(n)holomorphic vector bundles on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau three-folds whichadmit a section. We discuss the allowed bases of these three-folds and showthat physical constraints eliminate Enriques surfaces from consideration.Relevant properties of the remaining del Pezzo and Hirzebruch surfaces arepresented. Restricting the structure group to SU(n), we derive, in detail, aset of rules for the construction of three-family particle physics theorieswith phenomenologically relevant gauge groups. We show that anomalycancellation generically requires the existence of non-perturbative vacuacontaining five-branes. We illustrate these ideas by constructing four explicitthree-family non-perturbative vacua.
