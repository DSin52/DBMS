The boundary supersymmetric sinh-Gordon model is an integrable quantum fieldtheory in 1+1 dimensions with bulk N=1 supersymmetry, whose bulk and boundary Smatrices are not diagonal. We present an exact solution of this model. Inparticular, we derive an exact inversion identity and the correspondingthermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations. We also compute the boundary entropy, andfind a rich pattern of boundary roaming trajectories corresponding to c < 3/2superconformal models.
