The universal amplitude ratio $R_{\xi}$ for the ($q\leqslant 4$)-state Pottsmodel in two dimensions is determined by using results for the dilute A modelin regime 1. The nature of the relationship between the Potts model and thedilute A model, both related to $\phi_{2,1}$ perturbed conformal field theory,is discussed.
