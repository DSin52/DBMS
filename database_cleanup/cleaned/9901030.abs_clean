We show how the gauge symmetry representations of the massless particlecontent of gauged supergravities that arise in the AdS/CFT correspondences canbe derived from symmetric subgroups to be carried by string theory vertexoperators in these compactified models, although an explicit vertex operatorconstruction of IIB string and M theories on AdSxS remains elusive. Oursymmetry mechanism parallels the construction of representations of the Monstergroup and affine algebras in terms of twisted conformal field theories, and mayserve as a guide to the perturbative description of the IIB string on AdSxS.
