Title: SO(10) GUT Models and Cosmology

Comments: 7 pages, Latex, talk prepared for the Second International Sakharov

Conference on Physics, Moscow (May 1996)$SO(10)$ grand unified models have an intermediate symmetry group in between$SO(10)$ and $SU(3)_{C} \otimes SU(2)_{L} \otimes U(1)_{Y}$. Hence they lead toa prediction for proton lifetime in agreement with the experimental lowerlimit. This paper reviews the recent work on the tree-level potential and theone-loop effective potential for such models, with application to inflationarycosmology. The open problems are the use of the most general form of tree-levelpotential for $SO(10)$ models in the reheating stage of the early universe, andthe analysis of non-local effects in the semiclassical field equations for suchmodels in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker backgrounds.
