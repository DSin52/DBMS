in Found. Phys. LettMotivated by recent works on the origin of inertial mass, we revisit therelationship between the mass of charged particles and zero-pointelectromagnetic fields. To this end we first introduce a simple modelcomprising a scalar field coupled to stochastic or thermal electromagneticfields. Then we check if it is possible to start from a zero bare mass in therenormalization process and express the finite physical mass in terms of acut-off. In scalar QED this is indeed possible, except for the problem that allconceivable cut-offs correspond to very large masses. For spin-1/2 particles(QED with fermions) the relation between bare mass and renormalized mass iscompatible with the observed electron mass and with a finite cut-off, but onlyif the bare mass is not zero; for any value of the cut-off the radiativecorrection is very small.
