We present a Lagrangian description of the $SU(2)/U(1)$ coset model perturbedby its first thermal operator. This is the simplest perturbation that changessign under Krammers--Wannier duality. The resulting theory, which is a2--component generalization of the sine--Gordon model, is then taken inMinkowski space. For negative values of the coupling constant $g$, it isclassically equivalent to the $O(4)$ non--linear $\s$--model reduced in acertain frame. For $g > 0$, it describes the relativistic motion of vortices ina constant external field. Viewing the classical equations of motion as a zerocurvature condition, we obtain recursive relations for the infinitely manyconservation laws by the abelianization method of gauge connections. The higherspin currents are constructed entirely using an off--critical generalization ofthe $W_{\infty}$ generators. We give a geometric interpretation to thecorresponding charges in terms of embeddings. Applications to the chirallyinvariant $U(2)$ Gross--Neveu model are also discussed.
