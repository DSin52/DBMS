Consideration of the model of the relativistic particle with curvature andtorsion in the three-dimensional space-time shows that the squaring of theprimary constraints entails a wrong result. The complete set of the Hamiltonianconstraints arising here correspond to another model with an action similar butnot identical with the initial action.
