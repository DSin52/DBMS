We analyse the BRST constraints and corresponding Hilbert-space structure ofchiral QCD$_2$ in the decoupled formulation for the case of theJackiw-Rajaraman parameter $a=2$. We show that despite formal similarities thistheory is not equivalent to QCD$_2$, and that its extension to U(N) does notlead to an infinite vacuum degeneracy.
