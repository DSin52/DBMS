We establish the equivalence of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Proca model to adoublet of Maxwell-Chern-Simons models at the level of polarization vectors ofthe basic fields using both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms. The analysisreveals a U(1) invariance of the polarization vectors in the momentum space.Its implications are discussed. We also study the role of Wigner's little groupas a generator of gauge transformations in three space-time dimensions.
