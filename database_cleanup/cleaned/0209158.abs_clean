appear in Physical Review DWe study cosmological consequences of non-constant brane world moduli in fivedimensional brane world models with bulk scalars and two boundary branes. Wefocus on the case where the brane tension is an exponential function of thebulk scalar field, $U_b \propto \exp{(\alpha \phi)}$. In the limit $\alpha \to0$, the model reduces to the two-brane model of Randall-Sundrum, whereas largervalues of $\alpha$ allow for a less warped bulk geometry. Using the modulispace approximation, we derive the four-dimensional low-energy effective actionfrom a supergravity-inspired five-dimensional theory. For arbitrary values of$\alpha$, the resulting theory has the form of a bi-scalar-tensor theory. Weshow that, in order to be consistent with local gravitational observations,$\alpha$ has to be small (less than $10^{-2}$) and the separation of the branesmust be large. We study the cosmological evolution of the interbrane distanceand the bulk scalar field for different matter contents on each branes. Ourfindings indicate that attractor solutions exist which drive the moduli fieldstowards values consistent with observations. The efficiency of the attractormechanism crucially depends on the matter content on each branes. In thefive-dimensional description, the attractors correspond to the motion of thenegative tension brane towards a bulk singularity, which signals the eventualbreakdown of the four-dimensional description and the necessity of a betterunderstanding of the bulk singularity.
