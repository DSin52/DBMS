We argue that the paradoxes associated with infinitely degenerate states,which plague relic particle scenarios for the endpoint of black holeevaporation, may be absent when the relics are horned particles. Most of ourarguments are based on simple observations about the classical geometry ofextremal dilaton black holes, but at a crucial point we are forced to speculateabout classical solutions to string theory in which the infinite couplingsingularity of the extremal dilaton solution is shielded by a condensate ofmassless modes propagating in its infinite horn. We use the nonsingular $c=1$solution of (1+1) dimensional string theory as a crude model for the propertiesof the condensate. We also present a brief discussion of more general relicscenarios based on large relics of low mass.
