A four-form gauge flux makes a variable contribution to the cosmologicalconstant. This has often been assumed to take continuous values, but we arguethat it has a generalized Dirac quantization condition. For a single flux thesteps are much larger than the observational limit, but we show that withmultiple fluxes the allowed values can form a sufficiently dense `discretuum'.Multiple fluxes generally arise in M theory compactifications on manifolds withnon-trivial three-cycles. In theories with large extra dimensions a fewfour-forms suffice; otherwise of order 100 are needed. Starting from genericinitial conditions, the repeated nucleation of membranes dynamically generatesregions with a cosmological constant in the observational range. Entropy anddensity perturbations can be produced.
