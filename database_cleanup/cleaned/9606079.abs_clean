We search a canonical basis of Dirac's observables for the classicalnon-Abelian Higgs model with fermions in the case of a trivial SU(2) principalbundle with a complex doublet of Higgs fields and with the fermions in a givenrepresentation of SU(2). Since each one of the three Gauss law first classconstraints can be solved either in the corresponding longitudinal electricfield or in the corresponding Higgs momentum, we get a priori eight disjointphases of solutions of the model. The only two phases with SU(2) covariance arethe SU(2) phase with massless SU(2) fields and the Higgs phase with massiveSU(2) fields. The Dirac observables and the reduced physical (local)main result is the nonanalyticity in the SU(2) coupling constant, orequivalently in the sum of the residual Higgs field and of the mass of theSU(2) fields. Some comments on the function spaces needed for the gauge fieldsare made.
