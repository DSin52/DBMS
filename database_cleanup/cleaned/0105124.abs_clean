Title: Gauge Theoretic Approach to Fluid Dynamics

Authors: Subir Ghosh (Indian Statistical Inst., Calcutta)

Comments: Slightly enlarged version with action formulation included

The Hamiltonian dynamics of a compressible inviscid fluid is formulated as agauge theory. The idea of gauge equivalence is exploited to unify the study ofapparantly distinct physical problems and solutions of new models can begenerated from known fluid velocity profiles.
