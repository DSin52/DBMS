A relation between the total instanton number and the quantum-numbers ofmagnetic monopoles that arise in general Abelian gauges in SU(2) Yang-Millstheory is established. The instanton number is expressed as the sum of the`twists' of all monopoles, where the twist is related to a generalized Hopfinvariant. The origin of a stronger relation between instantons and monopolesin the Polyakov gauge is discussed.
