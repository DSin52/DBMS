Based on the treatment of the chiral Ising model by Mack and Schomerus, wepresent examples of localized endomorphisms $\varrho_1^{\rm loc}$ and$\varrho_{1/2}^{\rm loc}$. It is shown that they lead to the samesuperselection sectors as the global ones in the sense that unitary equivalence$\pi_0\circ\varrho_1^{\rm loc}\cong\pi_1$ and $\pi_0\circ\varrho_{1/2}^{\rmloc}\cong\pi_{1/2}$ holds. Araki's formalism of the selfdual CAR algebra isused for the proof. We prove local normality and extend representations andlocalized endomorphisms to a global algebra of observables which is generatedby local von Neumann algebras on the punctured circle. In this framework, wemanifestly prove fusion rules and derive statistics operators.
