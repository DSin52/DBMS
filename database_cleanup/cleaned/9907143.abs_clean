The correspondence of the non-critical string theory and the Yang-Millstheory is examined according to the recent Polyakov's proposal, and twopossible solutions of the bulk equations are addressed near the fixed points ofAdS space at the ultraviolet limit where the conformally invariant field theoryis realized. (ii) The second one approaches to the flat space in both theinfrared and the ultraviolet limits. The area law of the Wilson-loop and theasymptotic freedom with logarithmic behaviour are seen in the respective limit.
