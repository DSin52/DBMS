We show within the Wilson renormalization group framework how the flowequation method can be used to prove the perturbative renormalizability of arelativistic massive selfinteracting scalar field. Furthermore we prove theregularity of the renormalized relativistic one-particle irreducible n-pointGreen functions in the region predicted by axiomatic quantum field theory whichensures that physical renormalization conditions for the two-point function canbe imposed.
