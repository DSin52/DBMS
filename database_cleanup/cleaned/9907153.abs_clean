The ADHM construction, which yields (anti-)selfdual configurations inclassical Yang-Mills theories, is applied to an infinite dimensional l^2 vectorspace, and as a consequence, a family of (anti-)selfdual configurations with aparameter q is obtained for SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. This l^2 formulation canbe seen as a q-analog of Nahm's monopole construction, so that theconfiguration approaches the BPS monopole at q->1 limit.
