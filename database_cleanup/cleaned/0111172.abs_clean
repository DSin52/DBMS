Title: Free q-Deformed Relativistic Wave Equations by Representation Theory

Authors: Christian Blohmann

In a representation theoretic approach a free q-relativistic wave equationmust be such, that the space of solutions is an irreducible representation ofthe q-Poincare algebra. It is shown how this requirement uniquely determinesthe q-wave equations. As examples, the q-Dirac equation (including q-gammamatrices which satisfy a q-Clifford algebra), the q-Weyl equations, and theq-Maxwell equations are computed explicitly.
