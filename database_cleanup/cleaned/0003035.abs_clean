We present a new and asymmetric N=4 superconformal algebra for arbitrarycentral charge, thus completing our recent work on its classical analogue withvanishing central charge. Besides the Virasoro generator and 4 supercurrents,the algebra consists of an internal SL(2) \otimes U(1) Kac-Moody algebra inaddition to two spin 1/2 fermions and a bosonic scalar. The algebra is shown tobe invariant under a linear twist of the generators, except for a unique valueof the continuous twist parameter. At this value, the invariance is broken andthe algebra collapses to the small N=4 superconformal algebra. In the contextof string theory, the asymmetric N=4 superconformal algebra is provided with anexplicit construction on the boundary of AdS_3, and is induced by an affineSL(2|2) current superalgebra residing on the world sheet. Substituting theworld sheet SL(2|2) by the coset SL(2|2)/U(1) results in the small N=4superconformal algebra on the boundary of AdS_3.
