We construct a new class of quasi-exactly solvable many-body Hamiltonians inarbitrary dimensions, whose ground states can have any correlations we choose.Some of the known correlations in one dimension and some recent novelcorrelations in two and higher dimensions are reproduced as special cases. Asspecific interesting examples, we also write down some new models in two andhigher dimensions with novel correlations.
