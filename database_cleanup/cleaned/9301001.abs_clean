Few natural basic principles allow to extend Feynman integral over the pathsto an integral over the surfaces so, that they coincide at long time scale,that is when the surface degenerates into a single particle world line. In thefirst approximation the loop Green functions have perimeter behavior. Thatcorresponds to the case when free quarks interact through one gluon exchange.Quantum fluctuations of the surface generate the area low. Thus in this stringtheory asymptotic freedom and confinement can coexist.
