The theta dependent of pure gauge theories in four dimensions can be studiedusing a duality of large N gauge theories with string theory on a certainspacetime. Via this duality, one can argue that for every theta, there areinfinitely many vacua that are stable in the large N limit. The true vacuum,found by minimizing the energy in this family, is a smooth function of thetaexcept at theta equal to pi, where it jumps. This jump is associated withspontaneous breaking of CP symmetry. Domain walls separating adjacent vacua aredescribed in terms of wrapped sixbranes.
