talk presented at 7th Asia Pacific Physics Conference, August 19-23, 1997,Beijing, China (to be published in the Proceedings)It is pointed out that there exists an interesting strong and weak duality inthe Landau-Zener-Stueckelberg potential curve crossing. A reliable perturbationtheory can thus be formulated in the both limits of weak and stronginteractions. It is shown that main characteristics of the potential crossingphenomena such as the Landau-Zener formula including its numerical coefficientare well-described by simple (time-independent) perturbation theory withoutreferring to Stokes phenomena. A kink-like topological object appears in the``magnetic'' picture, which is responsible for the absence of the couplingconstant in the prefactor of the Landau-Zener formula. It is also shown thatquantum coherence in a double well potential is generally suppressed by theeffect of potential curve crossing, which is analogous to the effect of Ohmicdissipation on quantum coherence.
