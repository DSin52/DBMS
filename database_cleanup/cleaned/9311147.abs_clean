We study the commutation relations, uncertainty relations and spectra ofposition and momentum operators within the framework of quantum group %symmetric Heisenberg algebras and their (Bargmann-) Fock representations. As aneffect of the underlying noncommutative geometry, a length and a momentum scaleappear, leading to the existence of minimal nonzero uncertainties in thepositions and momenta. The usual quantum mechanical behaviour is recovered as alimiting case for not too small and not too large distances and momenta.
