In a series of three projects a new technique which allows for higher-looprenormalisation on a manifold with boundary has been developed and used inorder to assess the effects of the boundary on the dynamical behaviour of thetheory. Commencing with a conceptual approach to the theoretical underpinningsof the, underlying, spherical formulation of Euclidean Quantum Field Theorythis overview presents an outline of the stated technique's conceptualdevelopment, mathematical formalism and physical significance.
