We discuss some aspects of the behaviour of a string gas at the Hagedorntemperature from a Euclidean point of view. Using AdS space as an infraredregulator, the Hagedorn tachyon can be effectively quasi-localized and itsdynamics controled by a finite energetic balance. We propose that the off-shellRG flow matches to an Euclidean AdS black hole geometry in a generalization ofthe string/black-hole correspondence principle. The final stage of the RG flowcan be interpreted semiclassically as the growth of a cool black hole in ahotter radiation bath. The end-point of the condensation is the large EuclideanAdS black hole, and the part of spacetime behind the horizon has been removed.In the flat-space limit, holography is manifest by the system creating its owntransverse screen at infinity. This leads to an argument, based on theenergetics of the system, explaining why the non-supersymmetric type 0A stringtheory decays into the supersymmetric type IIB vacuum. We also suggest a notionof `boundary entropy', the value of which decreases along the line of flow.
