Title: Global Anomalies in the Batalin Vilkovisky Quantization

Authors: Ricardo Amorim and Nelson R. F. Braga

Comments: We emphasized the fact that our procedure only works for the case of

Abelian global anomalies. Section 3 was rewritten and some references wereadded. 12 pages, LATEX. Revised version that will appear in Phys. Rev. DJournal-ref: Phys.Rev. D57 (1998) 1225-1232

The Batalin Vilkovisky (BV) quantization provides a general procedure forcalculating anomalies associated to gauge symmetries. Recent results show thateven higher loop order contributions can be calculated by introducing anappropriate regularization-renormalization scheme. However, in its standardform, the BV quantization is not sensible to quantum violations of theclassical conservation of Noether currents, the so called global anomalies. Weshow here that the BV field antifield method can be extended in such a way thatthe Ward identities involving divergencies of global Abelian currents can becalculated from the generating functional, a result that would not be obtainedby just associating constant ghosts to global symmetries. This extension,consisting of trivially gauging the global Abelian symmetries, poses no extraobstruction to the solution of the master equation, as it happens in the caseof gauge anomalies. We illustrate the procedure with the axial model and alsocalculating the Adler Bell Jackiw anomaly.
