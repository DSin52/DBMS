corrected. 24 pages, USC-92/HEP-B5In this lecture I summarize recent developments on strings propagating incurved spacetime. Exact conformal field theories that describe gravitationalbackgrounds such as black holes and more intricate gravitational singularitieshave been discovered and investigated at the classical and quantum level. Thesemodels are described by gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten models, or equivalentlycurrent algebra G/H coset models based on non-compact groups, with a singletime coordinate. The classification of such models for all dimensions iscomplete. Furthermore the heterotic superstrings in curved spacetime based onnon-compact groups have also been constructed. For many of the $d\le 4$ modelsthe gravitational geometry described by a sigma model has been determined. Somegeneral results outlined here include a global analysis of the geometry and theexact classical geodesics for any G/H model. Moreover, in the quantized theory,the conformally exact metric and dilaton are obtained for all orders in anexpansion of $k$ (the central extension). All such models have large-small (ormirror) duality properties which we reformulate as an inversion in group space.To illustrate model building techniques a specific 4-dimensional heteroticstring in curved spacetime is presented. Finally the methods for investigatingthe quantum theory are outlined. The construction and analysis of these modelsat the classical and quantum level involve some aspects of noncompact groupswhich are not yet sufficiently well understood. Some of the open problems inthe physics and mathematics areas are outlined.
