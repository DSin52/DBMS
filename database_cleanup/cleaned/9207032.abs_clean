It is shown that the sl(2,C) KZ equation for (half-) integer isospinsrecovers, up to a gauge transformation, the matrix system for Virasoro algebrasingular vectors of Bauer et al. In the case of Kac-Kazhdan spins the general(infinite matrix) KZ system is truncated due to the decoupling of the A^(1)_1singular vectors. This suggests an algorithm converting Malikov-Feigin-Fukssingular vectors into Virasoro ones.
