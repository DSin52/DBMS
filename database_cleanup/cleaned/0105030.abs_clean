Authors: G.S. Djordjevic, B. Dragovich and L. Nesic

Comments: 17 pages, no figures, to be published in Infinite Dimensional

Analysis, Quantum Probability and Related TopicsFeynman's path integral in adelic quantum mechanics is considered. Thepropagator K(x'',t'';x',t') for one-dimensional adelic systems with quadraticLagrangians is analytically evaluated. Obtained exact general formula has theform which is invariant under interchange of the number fields R and Q_p.
