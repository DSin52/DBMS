We investigate certain fixed points in the boundary conformal field theoryrepresentation of type IIA D-branes on Gepner points of K3. They correspondgeometrically to degenerate brane configurations, and physically lead toenhanced gauge symmetries on the world-volume. Non-abelian gauge groups ariseif the stabilizer group of the fixed points is realized projectively, which issimilar to D-branes on orbifolds with discrete torsion. Moreover, the fixedpoint boundary states can be resolved into several irreducible components.These correspond to bound states at threshold and can be viewed as (non-locallyfree) sub-sheaves of semi-stable sheaves. Thus, the BCFT fixed points appear toof the instanton moduli space on K3, on the other hand they probe discretetorsion in D-geometry.
