Studies in string theory and in quantum gravity suggest the existence of afinite lower bound to the possible resolution of lengths which, quantumtheoretically, takes the form of a minimal uncertainty in positions $\Deltax_0$. A finite minimal uncertainty in momenta $\Delta p_0$ has been motivatedfrom the absence of plane waves on generic curved spaces. Both effects can bedescribed as small noncommutative geometric features of space-time. In a pathintegral approach to the formulation of field theories on noncommutativegeometries, we can now generally prove IR regularisation for the case ofnoncommutative geometries which imply minimal uncertainties $\Delta p_0$ inmomenta.
