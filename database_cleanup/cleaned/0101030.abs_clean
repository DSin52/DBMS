Title: Spontaneous orbifold symmetry breaking and generation of mass hierarchy

Authors: Israel Quiros

Comments: 10 pages, Revtex, no figures

A very simple mechanism is proposed that stabilizes the orbifold geometrywithin the context of the Randall-Sundrum proposal for solving the hierarchyproblem. The electroweak TeV scale is generated from the Planck scale byspontaneous breaking of the orbifold symmetry
