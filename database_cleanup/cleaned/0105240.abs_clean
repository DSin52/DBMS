Title: Dynamical Instabilities of Brane World Models

Authors: J. Diemand, Ch. Mathys and D. Wyler

Comments: 11 pages, no figures

We show the instability of two self-tuning brane world models with gaugeinvariant linear perturbation theory. This general method confirms a knowninstability of the original model with vanishing bulk potential. We also showthe dynamical instability of a recently proposed self-tuning "smooth" branemodel and its limit, the Randall-Sundrum model. Astonishingly, we also findinstability under purely gravitational perturbations.
