Title: Z_n-Graded Topological Generalizations of Supersymmetry and Orthofermion

AlgebraComments: Contributed to XXIV International Colloquium on Group Theoretical

Methods in Physics (Paris, July 15-20, 2002), to appear in J. Phys. AWe review various generalizations of supersymmetry and discuss theirrelationship. In particular, we show how supersymmetry, parasupersymmetry,fractional supersymmetry, orthosupersymmetry, and the Z_n-graded topologicalsymmetries are related.
