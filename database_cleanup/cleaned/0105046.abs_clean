The fusion products of admissible representations of the su(2) WZW model atthe fractional level k=-4/3 are analysed. It is found that some fusion productsdefine representations for which the spectrum of L_0 is not bounded from below.Furthermore, the fusion products generate representations that are notcompletely reducible and for which the action of L_0 is not diagonalisable. Thecomplete set of representations that is closed under fusion is identified, andthe corresponding fusion rules are derived.
