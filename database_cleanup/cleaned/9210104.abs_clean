We construct a four-parameter point-interaction for a non-relativisticparticle moving on a line as the limit of a short range interaction with rangetending toward zero. For particular choices of the parameters, we can obtain adelta-interaction or the so-called delta'-interaction. The Hamiltoniancorresponding to the four-parameter point-interaction is shown to correspond tothe four-parameter self-adjoint Hamiltonian of the free particle moving on theline with the origin excluded.
