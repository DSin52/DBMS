Spontaneous compactification ---on a $R^1\times S^1$ background--- in 2Dinduced quantum gravity (considered as a toy model for more fundamental quantumgravity) is analyzed in the gauge-independent effective action formalism. It isshown that such compactification is stable, in contradistinction tomultidimensional quantum gravity on a $R^D\times S^1 \ (D>2)$ background
