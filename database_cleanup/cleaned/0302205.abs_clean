corrected, incorrect `skeleton' conjecture in sect. 3 replaced by a morecareful treatmentThere are currently many string inspired conjectures about the structure ofthe low-energy effective action for super Yang-Mills theories which requireexplicit multi-loop calculations. In this paper, we develop a manifestlycovariant derivative expansion of superspace heat kernels and present a schemeto evaluate multi-loop contributions to the effective action in the frameworkof the background field method. The crucial ingredient of the construction is adetailed analysis of the properties of the parallel displacement propagatorsassociated with Yang-Mills supermultiples in N-extended superspace.
