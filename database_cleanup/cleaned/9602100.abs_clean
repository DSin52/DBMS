The new phase of a gauge theory in which the instantons are ``polarized'',i.e. have the preferred orientation is discussed. A class of gauge theorieswith the specific condensates of the scalar fields is considered. In thesemodels there exists an interaction between instantons resulting fromone-fermion loop correction. The interaction makes the identical orientation ofinstantons to be the most probable, permitting one to expect the system toundergo the phase transition into the state with polarized instantons. Theexistence of this phase is confirmed in the mean-field approximation in whichthere is the first order phase transition separating the ``polarized phase''from the usual non-polarized one. The considered phase can be important for thedescription of gravity in the framework of the gauge field theory.
