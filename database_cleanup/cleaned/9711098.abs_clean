The BPS spectrum of type I' string theory in a generic background is derivedusing the duality with the nine-dimensional heterotic string theory with Wilsonlines. It is shown that the corresponding mass formula has a naturalinterpretation in terms of type I', and it is demonstrated that the relevantstates in type I' preserve supersymmetry. By considering certain BPS states fordifferent Wilson lines an independent confirmation of the string creationphenomenon in the D0-D8 system is found. We also comment on thenon-perturbative realization of gauge enhancement in type I', and on thepredictions for the quantum mechanics of type I' D0-branes.
