We study the full set of planar Green's functions for a two-matrix modelusing the language of functions of non-commuting variables. Both the standardSchwinger-Dyson equations and equations determining connected Green's functionscan be efficiently discussed and solved. This solution determines the masterfield for the model in the `$C$-representation.'
