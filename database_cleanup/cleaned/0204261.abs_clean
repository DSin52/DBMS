We propose a new cosmological scenario which resolves the conventionalinitial singularity problem. The space-time geometry has an unconventionaltime-like singularity on a lower dimensional hypersurface, with localizedenergy density. The natural interpretation of this singularity in string theoryis that of negative tension branes, for example the orientifolds of type IIstring theory. Space-time ends at the orientifolds, and it is divided in threeintermediate region which ends at the orientifols; and an expanding regionseparated from the intermediate region by a past cosmological horizon. We studythe geometry near the singularity of the proposed cosmological scenario in aspecific string model. Using D-brane probes we confirm the interpretation ofthe brane singularity as an orientifold. The boundary conditions on theorientifolds and the past/future transition amplitudes are well defined.Assuming the trivial vacuum in the past, we derive a thermal spectrum in thefuture.
