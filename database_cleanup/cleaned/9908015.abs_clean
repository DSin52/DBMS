Neutrinos, A E Chubykalo et al. Eds., World Scientific, Singapore 2000,135-142We propose a new method to generate the internal isospin degree of freedom bynon-local bound states. This can be seen as motivated by Bargmann-Wigner likeconsiderations, which originated from local spin coupling. However, ourapproach is not of purely group theoretical origin, but emerges from ageometrical model. The rotational part of the Lorentz group can be seen tomutate into the internal iso-group under some additional assumptions. The boundstates can thereafter be characterized by either a triple of spinors (\xi_1,\xi_2, \eta) or a pair of an average spinor and a ``gauge'' transformation(\phi, R). Therefore, this triple can be considered to be an isospinor.Inducing the whole dynamics from the covariant gauge coupling we arrive at anisospin gauge theory and its Lagrangian formulation. Clifford algebraicmethods, especially the Hestenes approach to the geometric meaning of spinors,are the most useful concepts for such a development. The method is notrestricted to isospin, which served as an example only.
