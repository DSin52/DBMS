In this paper we study U(1) gauge transformations on the space-timecoordinates and on the background fields $g_{\mu\nu}$ and $\phi$. For somespecial gauge functions, gauged coordinates and gauged U(1) field areequivalent to the rotated coordinates and rotated gauge field. We find gaugetransformations that are symmetries of the string action. Also we obtaingeneral $T$-duality transformations for the background fields. For specialbackground fields this duality is equivalent to a gauge transformation.
