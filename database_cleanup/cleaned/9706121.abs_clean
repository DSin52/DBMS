Title: Relation between S-duality in N=2 SQCD and Non-Abelian Duality in N=1

SQCDComments: 11 pages, Latex, 4 figures, Changed content

With the help of M-theory configuration of N=1 supersymmetric QCD, we analyzethe strong coupling moduli of N=1 theory and its relation with S-dualitytransformation in N=2 supersymmetric QCD. As a result we confirm that twotype-IIA descriptions for N=1 supersymmetric QCD, one of them being strongcoupling description and another being weak, correspond to a single M-theorydescription for N=1 supersymmetric QCD. The existence of singlet fields is alsodiscussed.
