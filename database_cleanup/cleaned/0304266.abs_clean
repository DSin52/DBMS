Title: Brane Dynamics, the Polytropic Gas and Conformal Bulk Fields

Authors: Rui Neves and Cenalo Vaz

Comments: 12 pages, latex, no figures

We consider in the Randall-Sundrum scenario the dynamics of a sphericallysymmetric 3-brane world when matter fields exist in the bulk. We determineexact 5-dimensional solutions which localize gravity near the brane anddescribe the dynamics of homogeneous polytropic matter on the brane. We showthat these geometries are associated with a well defined conformal class ofbulk matter fields. We analyze the effective polytropic dynamics on the braneidentifying conditions which define it as singular or as globally regular.
