We point out that in (open) string compactifications with non-zero NS-NSB-field we can have large Kaluza-Klein thresholds even in the small volumelimit. In this limit the corresponding gauge theory description is in terms ofa compactification on a non-commutative space (e.g., a torus or an orbifoldthereof). Based on this observation we discuss a brane world scenario ofnon-commutative unification via Kaluza-Klein thresholds. In this scenario, theunification scale can be lowered down to the TeV-range, yet the correspondingcompactification radii are smaller than the string length. We discuss apotential application of this scenario in the context of obtaining mixingbetween different chiral generations which is not exponentially suppressed - aswe point out, such mixing is expected to be exponentially suppressed in certainsetups with large volume compactifications. We also point out that T-duality isbroken by certain non-perturbative twisted open string sectors which aresupposed to give rise to chiral generations, so that in the case of a smallvolume compactification with a rational B-field we cannot T-dualize to a largevolume description. In this sense, the corresponding field theoretic picture ofunification via Kaluza-Klein thresholds in this setup is best described in thenon-commutative language.
