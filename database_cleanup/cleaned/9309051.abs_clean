I study the quantum mechanics of a spin interacting with an ``apparatus''.Although the evolution of the whole system is unitary, the spin evolution isnot. The system is chosen so that the spin exhibits loss of quantum coherence,or ``wavefunction collapse'', of the sort usually associated with a quantummeasurement. The system is analyzed from the point of view of the spin densitymatrix (or ``Schmidt paths''), and also using the consistent historiesapproach. These two points of view are contrasted with each other. Connectionsbetween the results and the form of the Hamiltonian are discussed in detail.
