Title: Reflection equation and link polynomials for arbitrary genus solid tori

Comments: 17 pages + 8 postscript figures

The correspondence between the braid group on a solid torus of arbitrarygenus and the algebra of Yang-Baxter and reflection equation operators isshown. A representation of this braid group in terms of $R$-matrices is given.The characteristic equation of the reflection equation matrix is considered asan additional skein relation. This could lead to an intrinsic definition ofinvariant link polynomials on solid tori and, via Heegaard splitting, toinvariant link polynomials on arbitrary three-manifolds without boundary.
