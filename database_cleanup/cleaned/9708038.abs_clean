Comments: 9 pages of LaTeX, Talk given at the International Workshop on

Prespectives of Strong Coupling Gauge Theories(SCGT96), Nagoya, Japani,November 1996A reformulation of the Thirring model as a gauge theory on both continuumspacetime and discretized lattice is reviewed. In (1+1) dimensions, our resultreproduces consistently the bosonization of the massless Thirring model. In(2+1) dimensions, the analysis by use of Schwinger-Dyson equation is shown toexhibit dynamical fermion mass generation when the number $N$ of four-componentfermions is less than the critical value $N_{cr}= 128/3\pi^{2}$.
