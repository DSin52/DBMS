In this letter, we present the Parkes-Siegel formulation for the massiveAbelian $N$$=$$1$ super-{\QED} coupled to a self-dual supermultiplet, byintroducing a chiral multiplier superfield. We show that after carrying out asuitable dimensional reduction from ($2$$+$$2$) to ($1$$+$$2$) dimensions, andperforming some necessary truncations, the simple supersymmetric extension ofthe ${\tau}_{3}$QED$_{1+2}$ coupled to a Chern-Simons term naturally comes out.
