We find a one to one mapping between low energy string dilaton states in AdSbulk and high energy glueball states on the corresponding boundary. Thisholographic mapping leads to a relation between bulk and boundary scatteringamplitudes. From this relation and the dilaton action we find the appropriatemomentum scaling for high energy QCD amplitudes at fixed angles.
