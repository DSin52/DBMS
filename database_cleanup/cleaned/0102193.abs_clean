We calculate the \hkks for the \elm field in the background of a dielectriccylinder with non equal speeds of light inside and outside. The coefficient$a_{2}$ whose vanishing makes the vacuum energy of a massless field unique,turns out to be zero in dilute order, i.e., in order $(\ep-1)^{2}$, and nonzerobeyond. As a consequence, the vanishing of the vacuum energy in the presence ofa dielectric cylinder found by Casimir-Polder summation must take placeirrespectively of the methods by which it might be calculated.
