We search a canonical basis of Dirac's observables for the classical AbelianHiggs model with fermions in the case of a trivial U(1) principal bundle. Thestudy of the Gauss law first class constraint shows that the model has twodisjoint sectors of solutions associated with two physically different phases.the determination of the Dirac's observables we get that both the reducedphysical Hamiltonian and Lagrangian are nonlocal. In the Higgs phase, theelectromagnetic field becomes massive and in terms of Dirac's observables weget a local, but nonanalytic in the electric charge (or equivalently in the sumof the electromagnetic mass and of the residual Higgs field), physicalHamiltonian; however the associated Lagrangian is nonlocal. Some comments onthe R-gauge-fixing, the possible elimination of the residual Higgs field and onthe Nielsen-Olesen vortex solution close the paper.
