referencingWe study the low-lying excitations of Type IIA superstring theory in a planewave background with 24 supersymmetries. In the light-cone gauge, thesuperstring action has {\cal N}=(4,4) supersymmetry and is exactly solvablesince it is quadratic in superstring coordinates. We obtain explicitly thespectrum of the Type IIA supergravity fluctuation modes in the plane wavebackground and give its correspondence with the spectrum of string states fromthe zero-mode sector of the light-cone superstring Hamiltonian.
