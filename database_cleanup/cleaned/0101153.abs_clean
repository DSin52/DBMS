In the Wess-Zumino gauge, supersymmetry transformations become non-linear andare usually incorporated together with BRS transformations in the form ofSlavnov-Taylor identities, such that they appear at first sight to be evennon-local. Furthermore, the gauge fixing term breaks supersymmetry. In thepresent paper, we clarify in which sense supersymmetry is still a symmetry ofthe system and how it is realized on the level of quantum fields.
