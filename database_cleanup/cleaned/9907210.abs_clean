It has been conjectured that Little String Theories in six dimensions areholographic to critical string theory in a linear dilaton background. We testthis conjecture for theories arising on the worldvolume of heteroticfivebranes. We compute the spectrum of chiral primaries in these theories andcompare with results following from Type I-heterotic duality and the AdS/CFTcorrespondence. We also construct holographic duals for heterotic fivebranesnear orbifold singularities. Finally we find several new Little String Theorieswhich have Spin(32)/Z_2 or E_8 \times E_8 global symmetry but do not have asimple interpretation either in heterotic or M-theory.
