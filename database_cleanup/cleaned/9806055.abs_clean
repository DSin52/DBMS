The quantum properties of charged black holes (BHs) in 2D dilaton-Maxwellgravity (spontaneously compactified from heterotic string) with $N$ dilatoncoupled scalars are studied. We first investigate 2D BHs found by McGuigan,Nappi and Yost. Kaluza-Klein reduction of 3D gravity with minimal scalars leadsalso to 2D dilaton-Maxwell gravity with dilaton coupled scalars and therotating BH solution found by Ba\~nados, Teitelboim and Zanelli (BTZ) which canbe also described by 2D charged dilatonic BH. Evaluating the one-loop effectiveaction for dilaton coupled scalars in large $N$ (and s-wave approximation forBTZ case), we show that quantum-corrected BHs may evaporate or elseanti-evaporate similarly to 4D Nariai BH as is observed by Bousso and Hawking.Higher modes may cause the disintegration of BH in accordance with recentobservation by Bousso.
