A comparison is made between proposals for the exact three point function inLiouville quantum field theory and the nonperturbative weak coupling expansiondeveloped long ago by Braaten, Curtright, Ghandour, and Thorn. Exact agreementto the order calculated (i.e. up to and including corrections of orderO(g^{10})) is found.
