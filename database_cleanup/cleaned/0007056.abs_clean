We show that the recent world-sheet analysis of the quantum fluctuations of ashort flux tube in type II string theory leads to a simple and precisedescription of a pair of stuck D0branes in an orientifold compactification ofthe type I' string theory. The existence of a stable type I' flux tube ofsub-string-scale length is a consequence of the confinement of quantized fluxassociated with the scalar dualized ten-form background field strength *F_{10},evidence for a -2brane in the BPS spectrum of M theory. Using heterotic-type Iduality, we infer the existence of an M2brane of finite width O(\sqrt{\alpha'})in M-theory, the strong coupling resolution of a spacetime singularity in theD=9 twisted and toroidally compactified E_8 x E_8 heterotic string. Thisphenomenon has a bosonic string analog in the existence of a stable shortelectric flux tube arising from the confinement of photons due to tachyon fielddynamics. The appendix clarifies the appearance of nonperturbative states andenhanced gauge symmetry in toroidal compactifications of the type I' string. Weaccount for all of the known disconnected components of the moduli space oftheories with sixteen supercharges, in striking confirmation of heterotic-typeI duality.
