We study the correspondence between the linear matrix model and theinteracting nonlinear string theory. Starting from the simple matrix harmonicoscillator states, we derive in a direct way scattering amplitudes of2-dimensional strings, exhibiting the nonlinear equation generating arbitraryN-point tree amplitudes. An even closer connection between the matrix model andthe conformal string theory is seen in studies of the symmetry algebra of thesystem.
