A new method is developed for solving the conformally invariant integralsthat arise in conformal field theories with a boundary. The presence of aboundary makes previous techniques for theories without a boundary lesssuitable. The method makes essential use of an invertible integral transform,related to the radon transform, involving integration over planes parallel tothe boundary. For successful application of this method several nontrivialhypergeometric function relations are also derived.
