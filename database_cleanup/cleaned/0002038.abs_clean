The order parameters of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in QCD, thedynamical mass of quarks and the chiral condensates, are evaluated bynumerically solving the Non-Perturbative Renormalization Group (NPRG)equations. We employ an approximation scheme beyond ``the ladder'', that is,beyond the (improved) ladder Schwinger-Dyson equations. The chiral condensatesare enhanced compared with the ladder ones, which is phenomenologicallyfavorable. The gauge dependence of the order parameters is fairly reduced inthis scheme.
