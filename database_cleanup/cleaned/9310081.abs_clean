The extension of strongly anisotropic or dynamical scaling to local scaleinvariance is investigated. For the special case of an anisotropy or dynamicalexponent $\theta=z=2$, the group of local scale transformation considered isthe Schr\"odinger group, which can be obtained as the non-relativistic limit ofthe conformal group. The requirement of Schr\"odinger invariance determines thetwo-point function in the bulk and reduces the three-point function to ascaling form of a single variable. Scaling forms are also derived for thetwo-point function close to a free surface which can be either space-like ortime-like. These results are reproduced in several exactly solvable statisticalsystems, namely the kinetic Ising model with Glauber dynamics, latticediffusion, Lifshitz points in the spherical model and critical dynamics of thespherical model with a non-conserved order parameter. For generic values of$\theta$, evidence from higher order Lifshitz points in the spherical model andfrom directed percolation suggests a simple scaling form of the two-pointfunction.
