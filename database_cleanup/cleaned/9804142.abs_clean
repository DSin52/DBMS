A zero mode quantization of the minimal energy SU(2) Skyrmions for nucleonnumbers four to nine and seventeen is described. This involves quantizing therotational and isorotational modes of the configurations. For nucleon numbersfour, six and eight the ground states obtained are in agreement with theobserved nuclear states of Helium, Lithium and Beryllium. However, for nucleonnumbers five, seven, nine and seventeen the spins obtained conflict with theobserved isodoublet nuclear states.
