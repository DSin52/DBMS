The effective one-loop action for general dilaton theories with arbitrarydilaton-dependent measure and nonminimal coupling to scalar matter is computed.As an application we determine the Hawking flux to infinity from black holes ind-dimensions. We resolve the recently resurrected problem of an apparentthe complete flux turns out to be precisely the one of minimal coupling. Thisresult is obtained from a Christensen-Fulling type argument involving the(non-)conservation of energy-momentum. It is compared with approaches using theeffective action.
