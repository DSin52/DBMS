We develop a phase space path-integral approach for deriving the Lagrangianrealization of the models defined by Hamiltonian reduction of the WZNW theory.We illustrate the uses of the approach by applying it to the models ofnon-Abelian chiral bosons, $W$-algebras and the GKO coset construction, andshow that the well-known Sonnenschein's action, the generalized Toda action andthe gauged WZNW model are precisely the Lagrangian realizations of thosemodels, respectively.
