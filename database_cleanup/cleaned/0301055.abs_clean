Title: On Higher Dimensional Fuzzy Spherical Branes

Authors: Yusuke Kimura (RIKEN)

Comments: 20 pages

Matrix descriptions of higher dimensional spherical branes are investigated.It is known that a fuzzy 2k-sphere is described by the coset spaceSO(2k+1)/U(k) and has some extra dimensions. It is shown that a fuzzy 2k-sphereis comprised of n^{\frac{k(k-1)}{2}} spherical D(2k-1)-branes and has a fuzzy2(k-1)-sphere at each point. We can understand the relationship between thesetwo viewpoints by the dielectric effect. Contraction of the algebra is alsodiscussed.
