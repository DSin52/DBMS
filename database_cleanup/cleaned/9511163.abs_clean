Within the metric structure endowed with two orthogonal space-like Killingvectors a class of solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton field equations ispresented. Two explicitly given sub-classes of solutions bear an interpretationas colliding plane waves in the low-energy limit of the heterotic stringtheory.
