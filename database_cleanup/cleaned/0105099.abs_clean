In a classical Hamiltonian theory with second class constraints the phasespace functions on the constraint surface are observables. We give generalformulas for extended observables, which are expressions representing theobservables in the enveloping unconstrained phase space. These expressionssatisfy in the unconstrained phase space a Poisson algebra of the same form asthe Dirac bracket algebra of the observables on the constraint surface. Thegeneral formulas involve new differential operators that differentiate theDirac bracket. Similar extended observables are also constructed for theorieswith first class constraints which, however, are gauge dependent. For suchtheories one may also construct gauge invariant extensions with similarproperties. Whenever extended observables exist the theory is expected to allowfor a covariant quantization. A mapping procedure is proposed for covariantquantization of theories with second class constraints.
