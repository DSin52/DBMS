We have investigated the standard one-loop quantum corrections for aparticularly simple non-commutative geometry model containing fermionsinteracting with a unique abelian gauge field and a unique scalar throughYukawa couplings. In this model there are certain relations among the differentcoupling constants quite similar to the ones appearing in the Connes-Lottversion of the standard model. We find that it is not possible to implementthose relations in a renormalization-group invariant way.
