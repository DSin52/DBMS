We show that all spatial gluon connected correlation functions in SU(N) orSO(N) QCD vanish at finite temperature and zero momentum in lattice Landau orCoulomb gauges, due to the proximity of the Gribov horizon. These observationsalso apply to QCD with two colors and an even number of flavors at largechemical potential. These nonperturbative results may have consequences on thenature of the thermal magnetic mass and the character of the magnetic colorsuperconductivity.
