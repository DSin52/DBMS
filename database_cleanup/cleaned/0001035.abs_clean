Using pure spinors, the superstring is covariantly quantized. For the firsttime, massless vertex operators are constructed and scattering amplitudes arecomputed in a manifestly ten-dimensional super-Poincar\'e covariant manner.Quantizable non-linear sigma model actions are constructed for the superstringin curved backgrounds, including the $AdS_5\times S^5$ background withRamond-Ramond flux.
