In this work, a general definition of Convolution between two arbitraryTempered Ultradistributions is given. When one of the TemperedUltradistributions is rapidly decreasing this definition coincides with thedefinition of J. Sebastiao e Silva.The product of two arbitrary distributions of exponential type is defined viathe Convolution of its corresponding Fourier Transforms.Several examples of Convolution of two Tempered Ultradistributions andsingular products are given. In particular, we reproduce the results obtainedby A. Gonzales Dominguez and A. Bredimas.
