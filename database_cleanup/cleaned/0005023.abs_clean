Title: On the global calculus in local cohomology in BRST theory

Authors: G.Giachetta, L.Mangiarotti and G.Sardanashvily

Comments: 11 pages, LaTeX

We show that the cohomology groups of the horizontal (total) differential onhorizontal (local) exterior forms on the infinite-order jet manifold of anaffine bundle coincide with the De Rham cohomology groups of the base manifold.This prevents one from the topological obstruction to the definition of globaldescent equations in BRST theory on an arbitrary affine bundle.
