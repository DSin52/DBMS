Three dimensional (abelian) gauged massive Thirring model is bosonized in thelarge fermion mass limit. A further integration of the gauge field results in anon-local theory. A truncated version of that is the Maxwell Chern Simons (MCS)theory with a conventional mass term or MCS Proca theory. This gauge invarianttheory is completely solved in the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalism, withthe spectra of the modes determined. Since the vector field constituting themodel is identified (via bosonization) to the fermion current, the chargecurrent algebra, including the Schwinger term is also computed in the MCS Procamodel.
