We extend the proposal of Berenstein, Maldacena and Nastase to Type IIBsuperstring propagating on pp-wave over ${\bf R}^4/{\bf Z}_k$ orbifold. We showthat first-quantized free string theory is described correctly by the large$N$, fixed gauge coupling limit of ${\cal N}=2$ $[U(N)]^k$ quiver gauge theory.We propose a precise map between gauge theory operators and string states forboth untwisted and twisted sectors. We also compute leading-order perturbativecorrection to the anomalous dimensions of these operators. The result is inagreement with the value deduced from string energy spectrum, thussubstantiating our proposed operator-state map.
