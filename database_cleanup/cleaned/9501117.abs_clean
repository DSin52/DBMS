Title: A Stochastic Model of a Quantum Field Theory

Comments: Correction to second-last paragraph of section 6; footnote added in

section 5; section 9 trimmed; other minor changes. PlainTex 19pp. 4 eps figs.The problem of obtaining a realistic, relativistic description of a quantumsystem is discussed in the context of a simple (light-cone) lattice fieldtheory. A natural stochastic model is proposed which, although non-local, isrelativistic (in the appropriate lattice sense), and which is operationallyindistinguishable from the standard quantum theory. The generalization to abroad class of lattice theories is briefly described.
