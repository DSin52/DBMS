Authors: G. Dall'Agata, K. Lechner and M. Tonin

Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX, Talk given at "Quantum Aspects of Gauge Theories,

Supersymmetry and Unification", Greece, September 1998We review the construction of a manifestly covariant, supersymmetric andSL(2R) invariant action for IIB supergravity in D=10.
