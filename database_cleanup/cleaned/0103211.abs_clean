A solution with the pole configuration in six dimensions is analysed bothanalytically and numerically. It is a dimensional reduction model ofRandall-Sundrum type. The soliton configuration is induced by the bulk Higgsmechanism. The boundary condition is systematically solved up to the 6th order.The Riemann curvature is finite everywhere. An exact solution for the nopotential case is also presented.
