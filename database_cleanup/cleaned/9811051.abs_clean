The consequences of holography hypothesis are investigated for thePre-big-bang string cosmological models. The evolution equations are obtainedfrom the tree level string effective action. It is shown that $S/A$ is boundedby a constant in each case, $S$ being the entropy within the volume bounded bythe horizon of area $A$.
