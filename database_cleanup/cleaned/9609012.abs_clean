We discuss the differing definitions of complex and quaternionic projectivegroup representations employed by us and by Emch. The definition of Emch(termed here a strong projective representation) is too restrictive toaccommodate quaternionic Hilbert space embeddings of complex projectiverepresentations. Our definition (termed here a weak projective representation)encompasses such embeddings, and leads to a detailed theory of quaternionic, aswell as complex, projective group representations.
