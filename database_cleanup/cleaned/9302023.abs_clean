We discuss several applications and extensions of our previous operatorsolution of the $N$-body Calogero problem, \ie N particles in 1 dimensionsubject to a two-body interaction of the form $\half \sum_{i,j}[ (x_i - x_j)^2+ g/ {(x_i - x_j)^2}]$. Using a complex representation of the deformedHeisenberg algebra underlying the Calogero model, we explicitly establish theequivalence between this system and anyons in the lowest Landau level. Aconstruction based on supersymmetry is used to extend our operator method toinclude fermions, and we obtain an explicit solution of the supersymmetricCalogero model constructed by Freedman and Mende. We also show how thedynamical $OSp(2;2)$ supersymmetry is realized by bilinears of modifiedcreation and annihilation operators, and how to construct a supersymmeticextension of the deformed Heisenberg algebra.
