We study in detail the quantization of a model which apparently describeschiral bosons. The model is based on the idea that the chiral condition couldbe implemented through a linear constraint. We show that the space of states isof indefinite metric. We cure this disease by introducing ghost fields in sucha way that a BRST symmetry is generated. A quartet algebra is seen to emerge.The quartet mechanism, then, forces all physical states, but the vacuum, tohave zero norm.
