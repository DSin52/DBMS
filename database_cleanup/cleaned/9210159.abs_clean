We consider correlation functions in Neveu--Schwarz string theory coupled totwo dimensional gravity. The action for the 2D gravity consists of the stringinduced Liouville action and the Jackiw--Teitelboim action describing pure 2Dgravity. Then gravitational dressed dimensions of vertex operators are equal totheir bare conformal dimensions. There are two possible interpretations of themodel. Considering the 2D dilaton and the Liouville field as additional targetspace coordinates one gets a $d+2$-dimensional critical string. In the$d$-dimensional non critical string picture gravitational fields retain theiroriginal meaning and for $d=4$ one can get a mass spectrum via consistencyrequirements. In both cases a GSO projection is possible.
