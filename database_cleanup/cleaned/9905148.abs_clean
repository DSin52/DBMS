We construct dual Type I' string descriptions to five dimensionalsupersymmetric fixed points with $E_{N_f+1}$ global symmetry. The background isobtained as the near horizon geometry of the D4-D8 brane system in massive TypeIIA supergravity. We use the dual description to deduce some properties of thefixed points.
