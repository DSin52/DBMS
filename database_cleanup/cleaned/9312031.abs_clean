Title: $R$-matrices for the $n=2,3$ Elliptic Calogero-Moser Models

SystemsThe classical (dynamical) $R$-matrices for the 2- and 3-body Calogero-Mosermodels with elliptic potentials are given. The 3-body case has an interestingnontrivial structure that goes beyond the known ansatz for momentum independent$R$-matrices. The $R$-matrices presented include the dynamical $R$-matrices ofAvan and Talon as degenerate cases of the elliptic potential.
