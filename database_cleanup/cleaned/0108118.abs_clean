Interactions of noncommutative solitons in a modified U(n) sigma model in 2+1dimensions can be analyzed exactly. Using an extension of the dressing method,we construct explicit time-dependent solutions of its noncommutative fieldequation by iteratively solving linear equations. The approach is illustratedby presenting bound states and right-angle scattering configurations for twononcommutative solitons.
