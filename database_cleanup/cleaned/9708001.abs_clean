We present the covariant BRST quantization of the super-D-string. Thenon-vanishing supersymmetric U(1) field strength ${\cal F}$ is essential forthe covariant quantization of the super-D-string as well as for its staticpicture. A SO(2) parameter parametrizes a family of local supersymmetric (kappasymmetric) systems including the super-D-string with ${\cal F}\ne 0$ and theGreen-Schwarz superstring with ${\cal F}= 0$. We suggest that $E^1$ (canonicalconjugate of U(1) gauge field) plays a role of the order parameter in thefundamental Green-Schwarz superstring exists only for $E^1 =0$.
