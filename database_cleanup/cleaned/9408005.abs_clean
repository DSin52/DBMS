We consider the continuum string theory corresponding to the Marinari-Parisisupersymmetric matrix model. We argue that the world-sheet physics is exotic,and different from any known supersymmetric string theory. The embeddingsuperspace coordinates become disordered on the world-sheet, but because of thenoncompactness of the embedding time the disorder becomes complete only atasymptotic world-sheet scales.
