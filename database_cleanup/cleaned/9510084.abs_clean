We study the quantum integrability of nonsimply--laced affine Toda theoriesdefined on the half--plane and explicitly construct the first nontrivialhigher--spin charges in specific examples. We find that, in contradistinctionto the classical case, addition of total derivative terms to the "bulk" currentplays a relevant role for the quantum boundary conservation.
