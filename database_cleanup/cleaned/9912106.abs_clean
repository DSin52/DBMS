We consider type IIB (p,q) 5-branes in constant non-zero background tensorpotentials, or equivalently, with finite constant field strength on the brane.At linear level, zero-modes are introduced and the physical degrees of freedomare found to be parametrised by a real 2- or 4-form field strength on thebrane. An exact, SL(2;Z)-covariant solution to the full non-linear supergravityequations is then constructed. The resulting metric space-times are analysed,with special emphasis on the limiting cases with maximal values of the tensor.The analysis provides an answer to how the various background tensor fields arerelated to Born-Infeld degrees of freedom and to non-commutativity parameters.
