We study the ghost sector of vacuum string field theory where the BRSToperator Q is given by the midpoint insertion proposed by Gaiotto, Rastelli,Sen and Zwiebach. We introduce a convenient basis of half-string modes in termsof which Q takes a particularly simple form. We show that there exists a fieldredefinition which reduces the ghost sector field equation to a pure projectionequation for string fields satisfying the constraint that the ghost number isequally divided over the left- and right halves of the string. When thisconstraint is imposed, vacuum string field theory can be reformulated as a$U(\infty)$ cubic matrix model. Ghost sector solutions can be constructed fromprojection operators on half-string Hilbert space just as in the matter sector.We construct the ghost sector equivalent of various well-known matter sectorprojectors such as the sliver, butterfly and nothing states.
