We obtain an explicit expression for the supersymmetric Wilson loop in termsof chiral superfields and supercurrents in superspace. The result turns out tobe different from what one would expect from the simple replacement of Liealgebra valued connection in the exponent with the corresponding super-Liealgebraic one. Genralizing the super particle coupling represented by thesupersymmetric Wilson loop, we show that there exists a unique dimensionlesscoupling of the superstring to abelian supersymmetric gauge theories thatrespects all the known symmetries. The coupling is expressed in terms of chiralcurrents in superspace. The natural superstring coupling gives rise to a newobservable that is "stringy" in nature and has no analogue innon-supersymmetric gauge theories.
