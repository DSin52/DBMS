neutral exactly solvable 4D Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton models discoveredAuthors: Konstantin G. Zloshchastiev

Comments: by Lambda-Maxwell duality we imply the one between Maxwell-dilaton

We report the discovered class of exact static solutions of several 4Dpolynomial, etc., for three basic topologies (spherical, hyperbolical and flat)being uniformly treated. In addition to the usual electric-magnetic dualitythis class obeys a certain extended duality between Maxwell-dilaton couplingand dilaton mass. Though major solutions we obtain are dyonic, the class alsocomprises interesting neutral models.As a by-product, we significantly succeded in resolving of the two importantproblems, one of which has been standing more than a decade (system with thestring-inspired exponential Maxwell-dilaton coupling and non-vanishing dilatongeneralized Liouville, Sin(h), Cos(h) - is about fifty years old.Finally, we demonstrate the full separability of the static EMD system andpublicize the simple procedure of how to generate new integrability classes.
