We solve the Dirichlet boundary value problem for the massless gravitino on$AdS_{d+1}$ space and compute the two-point function of the dual CFTsupersymmetry currents using the $AdS$/CFT correspondence principle. We findanalogously to the spinor case that the boundary data for the massless $(d+1)$dimensional bulk gravitino field consists of only a $(d-1)$ dimensionalgravitino.
