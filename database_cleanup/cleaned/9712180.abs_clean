We discuss the BPS configurations of IIB strings in the 7-brane backgroundfrom M-theory viewpoint. We first obtain the hyperkahler geometry background ofM-theory expected from the 7-brane solutions of the type IIB supergravity. Wechoose the appropriate complex structures of the background geometries andembed a membrane of M-theory holomorphically to obtain a BPS stringconfiguration. The recently discussed BPS string configurations such as3-string junctions and string networks in the flat background are generalizedto the cases with the 7-brane backgrounds. The property of the BPS stringconfigurations in the 7-brane backgrounds is in agreement with the previouslyknown results from the IIB string viewpoint.
