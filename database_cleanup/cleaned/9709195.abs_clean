An approximation is used that permits one to explicitly solve the two-pointSchwinger-Dyson equations of the U(N) lattice chiral models. The approximatesolution correctly predicts a phase transition for dimensions $d$ greater thantwo. For $d \le 2 $, the system is in a single disordered phase with a massgap. The method reproduces known $N=\infty$ results well for $d=1$. For $d=2$,there is a moderate difference with $N=\infty$ results only in the intermediatecoupling constant region.
