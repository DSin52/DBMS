Title: On Quantum Radiation in Curved Spacetime

Authors: She-Sheng Xue

Comments: 9 pages

In the context of quantum field theories for fermions and bosons in curvedspacetime, we compute the effective action of the transition amplitude fromvacuum to vacuum in the presence of an external gravitational field. Theimaginary part of resulted effective action determines the probability ofvacuum decay via quantum tunneling process, giving the rate and spectrum ofparticle creations. On the basis that gravitational field polarizes vacuum anddiscretizes its spectrum, we discuss the quantum origin of such a tunnelingeffect and spectrum of particle creations.
