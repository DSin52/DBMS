and uuencoded together). epsf used to include figuresThis is an elementary review of our recent work on the classification of thespectra of those two-dimensional rational conformal field theories (RCFTs)whose (maximal) chiral algebras are current algebras. We classified allpossible partition functions for such theories when the definingfinite-dimensional Lie algebra is simple. The concepts underlying this work areemphasized, and are illustrated using simple examples.
