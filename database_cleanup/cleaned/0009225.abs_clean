We derive the worldsheet propagator for an open string with differentmagnetic fields at the two ends, and use it to compute two distinctnoncommutativity parameters, one at each end of the string. The usual scalinglimit that leads to noncommutative Yang-Mills can be generalized to a scalinglimit in which both noncommutativity parameters enter. This corresponds toexpanding a theory with U(N) Chan-Paton factors around a background U(1)^Ngauge field with different magnetic fields in each U(1).
