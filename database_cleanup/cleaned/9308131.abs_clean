We obtain cosmological four dimensional solutions of the low energy effectivestring theory by reducing a five dimensional black hole, and black hole--deSitter solution of Einstein gravity down to four dimensions. The appearance ofa cosmological constant in the five dimensional Einstein--Hilbert actionproduces a special dilaton potential in the four dimensional effective stringaction. Cosmological scenarios implemented by our solutions are discussed.
