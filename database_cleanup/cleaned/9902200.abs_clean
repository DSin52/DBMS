The recent developments towards the possible non-perturbative formulation ofstring/M theory using supersymmetric Yang-Mills matrix models (SYMs) arediscussed. In the first part, we give a critical review on the status of ourpresent understanding, focusing on the connection of the D0-brane matrix modelsto supergravity and its relevance to the so-called Matrix-theory conjecture. Wealso discuss some problems concerning the conjectured relation betweensupergravity in AdS background and SYM from the viewpoint of D-braneinteractions. We present a qualitative argument showing how the boundarycondition at AdS boundary dictates the correlators on the large N system ofsource D-branes. Then, in the final part, we turn to the question how toformulate the condensation of graviton in matrix models, taking the simplestexample of type IIB matrix model. We argue the emergence of a hidden symmetryGL(10, R), beyond the manifest Lorentz symmetry SO(9,1), by embedding U(N)model into models with higher N and by treating the whole recursive series ofmodels simultaneously. This suggests a possible approach toward backgroundindependent formulations of matrix models.
