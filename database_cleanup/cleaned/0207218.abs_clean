The question of Bohr correspondence in quantum field theory is consideredfrom a dynamical point of view. It is shown that the classical description ofparticle interactions is inapplicable even in the limit of large particles'masses because of finite quantum fluctuations of the fields produced. Inparticular, it is found that the relative value of the root mean squarefluctuation of the Coulomb and Newton potentials of a massive particle is equalto 1/sqrt{2}. It is shown also that in the case of a macroscopic body, thequantum fluctuations are suppressed by a factor 1/sqrt{N}, where N is thenumber of particles in the body. An adequate macroscopic interpretation of thecorrespondence principle is given.
