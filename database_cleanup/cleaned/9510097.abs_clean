We show that a four-parameter generating solution for a general class offour-dimensional, spherically-symmetric, static, dyonic BPS saturated solutionsof leading-order effective equations of toroidally compactified heterotic ortype II superstring theory are exact string solutions. The correspondingten-dimensional background defines a conformal sigma-model which is aparticular case of a `chiral null model' with curved `transverse' part. Theexact conformal invariance is a consequence of the chiral null structure of the`electric' part of the model and the N=4 world-sheet supersymmetry of itstransverse `magnetic' part. The sigma-model action has a remarkable covarianceunder both target space and the electromagnetic $S$-duality transformations,and it illustrates the relation between string-string duality in six dimensionsand $S$-duality in four dimensions. In general, there exists a large class ofexact six-dimensional superstring solutions described by chiral null modelswith four-dimensional transverse parts represented by N=4 supersymmetricsigma-models with metrics conformal to hyper-Kahler ones.
