In this note we show how Ward identities may be derived for a quantum fieldtheory dual of a string theory using the AdS/CFT correspondence. In particularassociated with any gauge symmetry of the bulk supergravity theory there is acorresponding constraint equation. Writing this constraint in Hamilton-Jacobiform gives a generating functional for Ward identities in the dual QFT. Weillustrate the method by considering various examples.
