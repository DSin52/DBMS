An explicit proof of the existence of nontrivial vacua in the puresupersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with higher orthogonal SO(N), N>=7 or theG_2 gauge group defined on a 3-torus with periodic boundary conditions isgiven. Extra vacuum states are separated by an energy barrier from theperturbative vacuum A_i=0 and its gauge copies.
