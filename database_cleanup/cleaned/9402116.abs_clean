The N-dimensional Cayley-Klein scheme allows the simultaneous description of$3^N$ geometries (symmetric orthogonal homogeneous spaces) by means of a set ofLie algebras depending on $N$ real parameters. We present here a quantumdeformation of the Lie algebras generating the groups of motion of the two andthree dimensional Cayley-Klein geometries. This deformation (Hopf algebrastructure) is presented in a compact form by using a formalism developed forthe case of (quasi) free Lie algebras. Their quasitriangularity (i.e., the mostusual way to study the associativity of their dual objects, the quantum groups)is also discussed.
