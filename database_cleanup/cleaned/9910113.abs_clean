We calculate the conformal anomaly from 5d Weyl gravity (with brokenconformal symmetry) which is conjectured to be supergravity dual to ${\calN}=2$ superconformal field theory via AdS/CFT correspondence. Its comparisonwith ${\cal N}=2$ SCFT conformal anomaly (UV calculation) suggests that suchduality may exist subject to presence of sub-leading 1/N corrections tocosmological and gravitational constants.
