Title: The Promise of String Cosmology

Authors: Robert H. Brandenberger

Comments: This article was commissioned in conjunction of the Workshop on

String Cosmology held from July 24 - Aug. 4 2000 at PIMS, Univ. of BritishColumbia, to be published in APCTP Bulletin # 6, (2001)The interplay between string theory and cosmology is very promising. Sincestring theory will yield a quantum theory of space-time and unify all forces ofnature, it has the potential of addressing many of the conceptual problems ofthe current models of early Universe cosmology. In turn, cosmology is the mostobvious testing ground in the effort to construct non-perturbative stringtheory, and can provide the crucial connection between theory andexperiment/observation.
