Title: Wick Type Symbol and Deformed Algebra of Exterior Forms

Authors: V. A. Dolgushev, S.L. Lyakhovich and A.A. Sharapov (Tomsk State Univ.)

Comments: Talk given at the International Conference "Quantization, Gauge

Theory and Strings" dedicated to the memory of Professor E.S. FradkinThe covariant descripion is constructed for the Wick-type symbols onsymplectic manifolds by means of the Fedosov procedure. The geometry of themanifolds admitting this symbol is explored. The superextended version of theWick-type star-product is introduced and a possible application of theconstruction to the noncommutative field theory is discussed.
