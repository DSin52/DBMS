Matrix models of 2d quantum gravity coupled to matter field are investigatedby the renormalized perturbational method, in which the matrix modelHamiltonian is represented by the equivalent vector model. By the saddle pointmethod, the renormalization group beta-function is obtained in the successiveapproximation.
