We exhibit $N=1$ supersymmetric field theories in confining, Coulomb andHiggs phases. The superpotential and the gauge kinetic terms are holomorphicand can be determined exactly in the various phases. The Coulomb phasegenerically has points with massless monopoles. When they condense, the theoryundergoes a phase transition to a confining phase. When there are points in theCoulomb phase with massless electric charges, their condensation leads to atransition to a Higgs phase. When the Higgs and confinement phases aredistinct, we expect to find massless interacting gluons at the transition pointbetween them.
