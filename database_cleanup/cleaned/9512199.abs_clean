since the first submission of the articleThe fine-tuning principles are examined to predict the top-quark andHiggs-boson masses. The modification of the Veltman condition based on thecompensation of vacuum energies is developed. It is implemented in the StandardModel and in its minimal extension with two Higgs doublets and Left-Rightsymmetric Model. The top-quark and Higgs-boson couplings are fitted in the SMfor the lowest ultraviolet scale where the fine-tuning can be stable underrescaling. It yields the low-energy values $m_t \simeq 175 GeV;\quad m_H \simeq210 GeV$. For the Two-Higgs and Left-Right Symmetric Models the fine-tuningprinciples yield the interval for top-quark mass, compatible with the modernexperimental data. For the Left-Right Model the FT principles demand theexistence of the right-handed Majorana neitrinos with masses of order ofright-handed gauge bosons.
