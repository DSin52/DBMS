Title: Intersecting branes from 7-manifolds with G_2 holonomy

Authors: Klaus Behrndt

Comments: 7 pages, Latex, talk presented at the 35th Symposium Ahrenshoop,

August 2002In this talk I discuss intersecting brane configurations coming from explicitmetrics with G_2 holonomy. An example of a 7-manifold which representing a R^3bundle over a self-dual Einstein space is described and the potential appearingafter compactification over the 6-d twistor space is derived.
