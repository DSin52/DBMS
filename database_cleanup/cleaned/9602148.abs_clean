In this letter we propose exact three-point correlation functions for $N=1$supersymmetric Liouville theory. Along the lines of Zamolodchikov andZamolodchikov paper (hep-th/9506136) we propose a generalized special functionwhich describe the three-point amplitudes. We consider briefly the so calledreflection amplitudes in the supersymmetric case.
