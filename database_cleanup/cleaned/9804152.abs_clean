The canonical formulation of d=2, N=16 supergravity is presented. We work outthe supersymmetry generators (including all higher order spinor terms) and theN=16 superconformal constraint algebra. We then describe the construction ofthe conserved non-local charges associated with the affine E_9 symmetry of theclassical equations of motion. These charges are shown to commute weakly withthe supersymmetry constraints, and hence with all other constraints. Undercommutation, they close into a quadratic algebra of Yangian type, which isformally the same as that of the bosonic theory. The Lie-Poisson action of E_9on the classical solutions is exhibited explicitly. Further implications of ourresults are discussed.
