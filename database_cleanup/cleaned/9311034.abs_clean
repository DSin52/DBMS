Authors: Denise E. Freed

Comments: 5 pages, one figure included. Talk presented at the Strings '93

conference in Berkeley, May 1993, CTP\#2251The dissipative Hofstadter model, which describes a particle in 2-D subjectto a periodic potential, uniform magnetic field, and dissipation, is alsorelated to open string boundary states. This model exhibits an SL(2,Z) dualitysymmetry and hidden reparametrization invariance symmetries. These symmetriesare useful for finding exact solutions for correlation functions.
