In these lectures we review the properties of a boosted and rotated boundarystate and of a boundary state with an abelian gauge field deriving from it theDirac-Born-Infeld action and a newly constructed class of classical solutions.We also review the construction of the boundary state for the stable non-BPSstate of type I theory corresponding to the perturbative state present at thefirst excited level of the SO(32) heterotic string and transforming accordingto the spinor representation of SO(32) (Lectures presented at the YITP Workshopon ``Developments in Superstring and M-theory'', Kyoto, Japan, October 1999).
