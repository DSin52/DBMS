This lecture consists of two parts. The first is a (totally unsystematic)survey of some of the high points in the evolution of gravity and itssuccessors, primarily in the course of the past century. The second summarizessome new work on surprising properties of higher $(> 1)$ spin fields inmassive models endowed with gauge invariances, that divide the ($m^2, \L$)plane into unitary and non-unitary phases. The unitary region common tofermions and bosons shrinks to flat space ($ \L \to 0 $) as their spinsincrease.
