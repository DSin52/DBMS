Authors: Richard J. Szabo

Comments: 111 pages LaTeX, 6 eps figures; Some material and discussions added

for clarity, corrections done, references added; Final version to bepublished in Physics ReportsA pedagogical and self-contained introduction to noncommutative quantum fieldtheory is presented, with emphasis on those properties that are intimately tiedto string theory and gravity. Topics covered include the Weyl-Wignercorrespondence, noncommutative Feynman diagrams, UV/IR mixing, noncommutativeYang-Mills theory on infinite space and on the torus, Morita equivalences ofnoncommutative gauge theories, twisted reduced models, and an in-depth study ofthe gauge group of noncommutative Yang-Mills theory. Some of the moremathematical ideas and techniques of noncommutative geometry are also brieflyexplained.
