We show that ultraviolet divergences found in fermionic Green's functions ofmassless $QED_2$ have an essentially non-perturbative nature. We investigatetheir origin both in gauge invariant formalism (the one where we introduceWess-Zumino fields to restore quantum gauge invariance) and in gaugenon-invariant formalism, mapping two different but equivalent mechanismsresponsible for their appearance. We find the same results in both approaches,what contradicts a previous work of Jian-Ge, Qing-Hai and Yao-Yang, that foundno divergences in the chiral Schwinger model considered in the gauge invariantformalism.
