Workshop on General Relativity and Gravitation (JGRG11), Waseda Univesity,Japan, 9-12 Jan 2002. Citation miss corrected and figures omittedThe purpose is to construct the quantum field theory including gravity, basedon physical assumptions as few as possible. Up to now, the work by Prof. StevenWeinberg probably suits this purpose the most. Though the purpose is difficultto reach, my recent preprint was interested in an exceptional case caused bysingularity. Therefore, I'd like to explain the motivations and possibleapplications of the preprint.
