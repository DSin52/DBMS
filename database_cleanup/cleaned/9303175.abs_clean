Comments: 19 pages + 1 figure, CERN-TH.6850/93

Talk given at the ``4th Hellenic School on Elementary Particle Physics",space-time backgrounds is reviewed. We show the relation of a special class ofcosmological backgrounds to exact conformal field theory. Particular emphasisis put on the singularity structure of the cosmological space-time and on thediscrete duality symmetries of the string background.
