We show that a large class of physical theories which has been underintensive investigation recently, share the same geometric features in theirHamiltonian formulation. These dynamical systems range from harmonicoscillations to WZW-like models and to the KdV dynamics on $Diff_oS^1$. To thesame class belong also the Hamiltonian systems on groups of maps.The common feature of these models are the 'chiral' equations of motionallowing for so-called chiral decomposition of the phase space.
