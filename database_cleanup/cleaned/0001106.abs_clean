We present a simple derivation of the supersymmetric one-loop effectiveaction of SU(2) Matrix theory by expressing it in a compact exponential formwhose invariance under supersymmetry transformations is obvious. This resultclarifies the one-loop exactness of the leading v^4 interactions and theabsence of non-perturbative corrections.
