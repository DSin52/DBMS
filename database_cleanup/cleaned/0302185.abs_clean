We develop the technique of Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz to investigate theground state and the spectrum in the thermodynamic limit of the staggered $XXZ$models proposed recently as an example of integrable ladder model. This modelappeared due to staggered inhomogeneity of the anisotropy parameter $\Delta$and the staggered shift of the spectral parameter. We give the structure ofground states and lowest lying excitations in two different phases which occurat zero temperature.
