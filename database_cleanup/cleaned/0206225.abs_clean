Title: Calculation of the Observationally Small Cosmological Constant in the

Model of Six-Dimensional Warped Brane-Bolt WorldComments: 8 pages, LaTeX-2e

In the 6-dimensional model of warped compactification based on the euclideanAdS Reissner-Nordstrom metric it is possible to escape artificial 4-brane'sstress-energy tensor anistropy necessary for fulfillment of Israel junctionconditions by introducing in 3+1 spacetime of the cosmological constant whichturns out to be ${}\sim G^2$ ($G$ - Newton's constant) and acquires the valuecompatible with observations.
