School, Mt. Sorak, Feb, 1993), LaTex, 8 pages, SNUTP-93-48We study how the Chern-Simons term effects the dynamically generated fermionmass in $(2+1)D$ Quantum Electrodynamics in the framework of large $N$expansion. We find that when the Chern-Simons term is present half of thefermions get mass $M+m$ and half get $M-m$. The parity-preserving mass $m$ isgenerated only when $N<\tilde{N}_c$. Both the critical number, $\tilde{N}_c$,of fermion flavor and the magnitude, $m$, reduce when the effect of theChern-Simons term dominates.
