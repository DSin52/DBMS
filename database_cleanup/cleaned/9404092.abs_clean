Exact string solutions are presented, providing backgrounds where a dynamicalchange of topology is occuring. This is induced by the time variation of amodulus field. Some lessons are drawn concerning the region of validity ofeffective theories and how they can be glued together, using stringyinformation in the region where the topology changes.
