International Workshop on New Worlds in Astroparticle Physics, AlgarveUniversity, Faro, 5-7 September, 2002. To be published in the correspondingproceedings, World ScientificWe discuss the dynamics of a spherically symmetric dark radiation vaccum inthe Randall-Sundrum brane world scenario. Under certain natural assumptions weshow that the Einstein equations on the brane form a closed system. For a deSitter brane we determine exact dynamical and inhomogeneous solutions whichdepend on the brane cosmological constant, on the dark radiation tidal chargeand on its initial configuration. We define the conditions leading to singularor globally regular solutions. We also analyse the localization of gravity nearthe brane and show that a phase transition to a regime where gravity propagatesaway from the brane may occur at short distances during the collapse ofpositive dark energy density.
