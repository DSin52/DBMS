World-sheet and spacetime supersymmetries that are manifest in some stringbackgrounds may not be so in their T-duals. Nevertheless, they always remainsymmetries of the underlying conformal field theory. In previous work themechanism by which T-duality destroys manifest supersymmetry and gives rise tonon-local realizations was found. We give the general conditions for a 2-dimN=1 supersymmetric sigma-model to have non-local and hence non-manifestextended supersymmetry. We then examine T-duality as a mechanism of restoringmanifest supersymmetry. This happens whenever appropriate combinations ofnon-local parafermions of the underlying conformal field theory become localdue to non-trivial world-sheet effects. We present, in detail, an examplearising from the model SU(2)/U(1) X SL(2,R)/U(1) and obtain a new exact 4-dimaxionic instanton, that generalizes the SU(2) X U(1) semi-wormhole, and hasmanifest spacetime as well as N=4 world-sheet supersymmetry. In addition,general necessary conditions for abelian T-duality to preserve manifest N=4world-sheet supersymmetry are derived and applied to WZW models based onquaternionic groups. We also prove some theorems for sigma-models withnon-local N=4 world-sheet supersymmetry.
