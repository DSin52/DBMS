We reexamine a unitary-transformation method of extracting a physicalHamiltonian from a gauge field theory after quantizing all degrees of freedomincluding redundant variables. We show that this {\it quantum Hamiltonianreduction} method suffers from crucial modifications arising fromregularization of composite operators. We assess the effects of regularizationin the simplest gauge field theory, the Schwinger model. Withoutregularization, the quantum reduction yields the identical Hamiltonian with theclassically reduced one. On the other hand, with regularization incorporated,the resulting Hamiltonian of the quantum reduction disagrees with that of theclassical reduction. However, we find that the discrepancy is resolved byredefinitions of fermion currents and that the results are again consistentwith those of the classical reduction.
