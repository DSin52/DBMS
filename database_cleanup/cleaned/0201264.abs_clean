Title: Prospects for unification under 4-dimensional optics

Authors: Jose B. Almeida

Comments: 14 pages

4-dimensional optics is here introduced axiomatically as the space thatsupports a Universal wave equation which is applied to the postulated Higgsfield. Self-guiding of this field is shown to produce all the modes necessaryto provide explanations for the known elementary particles. Forces are shown toappear as evanescent fields due to waveguiding of the Higgs field, whichprovide coupling between waveguides corresponding to different particles.Carrier particles are also discussed and shown to correspond to waveguidedmodes existing in 3-dimensional space.
