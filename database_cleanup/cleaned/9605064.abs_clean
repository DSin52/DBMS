Authors: S. Meljanac, M. Stojic and D. Svrtan

Comments: Latex file, 16 pages

We describe a unified approach to calculating the partition functions of ageneral multi-level system with a free Hamiltonian. Particularly, we presentnew results for parastatistical systems of any order in the second quantizedapproach. Anyonic- like systems are briefly discussed.
