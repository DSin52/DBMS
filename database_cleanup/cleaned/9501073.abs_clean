Relativistic domain walls are studied in the framework of a polynomialapproximation to the field interpolating between different vacua and formingthe domain wall. In this approach we can calculate evolution of a core and of awidth of the domain wall. In the single, cubic polynomial approximation used inthis paper, the core obeys Nambu-Goto equation for a relativistic membrane. Thewidth of the domain wall obeys a nonlinear equation which is solvedperturbatively. There are two types of corrections to the constant zeroth ordercurvature of the core. We find that curving a static domain wall is associatedwith an increase of its width. As an example, evolution of a toroidal domainwall is investigated.
