We study the relation between lattice construction and surgery constructionof three-dimensional topological field theories. We show that a class of theChung-Fukuma-Shapere theory on the lattice has representation theoreticreformulation which is closely related to the Altschuler-Coste theoryconstructed by surgery. There is a similar relation between the Turaev-Virotheory and the Reshetikhin-Turaev theory.
