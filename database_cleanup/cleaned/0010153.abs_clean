We show that an $SL(2,R)_L \times SL(2,R)_R$ Chern-Simons theory coupled to asource on a manifold with the topology of a disk correctly describes theentropy of the AdS$_3$ black hole. The resulting boundary WZNW theory leads totwo copies of a twisted Kac-Moody algebra, for which the respective Virasoroalgebras have the same central charge $c$ as the corresponding untwistedtheory. But the eigenvalues of the respective $L_0$ operators are shifted. Weshow that the asymptotic density of states for this theory is, up tologarithmic corrections, the same as that obtained by Strominger using theasymptotic symmetry of Brown and Henneaux.
