The construction of brane setups for the exceptional series E6,E7,E8 of SU(2)orbifolds remains an ever-haunting conundrum. Motivated by techniques in someworks by Muto on non-Abelian SU(3) orbifolds, we here provide an algorithmicoutlook, a method which we call stepwise projection, that may shed some lighton this puzzle. We exemplify this method, consisting of transformation rulesfor obtaining complex quivers and brane setups from more elementary ones, tothe cases of the D-series and E6 finite subgroups of SU(2). Furthermore, wedemonstrate the generality of the stepwise procedure by appealing to Frobenius'theory of Induced Representations. Our algorithm suggests the existence ofgeneralisations of the orientifold plane in string theory.
