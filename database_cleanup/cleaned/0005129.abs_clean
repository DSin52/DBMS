We study the perturbative unitarity of noncommutative scalar field theories.Field theories with space-time noncommutativity do not have a unitary S-matrix.Field theories with only space noncommutativity are perturbatively unitary.This can be understood from string theory, since space noncommutative fieldtheories describe a low energy limit of string theory in a background magneticfield. On the other hand, there is no regime in which space-time noncommutativefield theory is an appropriate description of string theory. Wheneverspace-time noncommutative field theory becomes relevant massive open stringstates cannot be neglected.
