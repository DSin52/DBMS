We engineer a configuration of branes in type IIB string theory whosemechanical structure is that of a DNA molecule. We obtain it by considering aT-dual description of the quantum Hall soliton. Using a probe analysis, weinvestigate the dynamics of the system and show that it is stable againstradial perturbations. We exercise a certain amount of restraint in discussingapplications to biophysics.
