In this review we describe statistical mechanics of quantum systems in thepresence of a Killing horizon and compare statistical-mechanical and one-loopcontributions to black hole entropy. Studying these questions was motivated byattempts to explain the entropy of black holes as a statistical-mechanicalentropy of quantum fields propagating near the black hole horizon. We providean introduction to this field of research and review its results. Inparticular, we discuss the relation between the statistical-mechanical entropyof quantum fields and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in the standard schemewith renormalization of gravitational coupling constants and in the theories ofinduced gravity.
