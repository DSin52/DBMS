Jun 2002The problem of dark energy arises due to its self-gravitating properties.Therefore explaining vacuum energy may become a question for the realm ofquantum gravity, that can be addressed within string theory context. In thistalk I concentrate on a recent, string-inspired model, that relies on nonlinearphysics of short-distance perturbation modes, for explaining dark energywithout any fine-tuning. Dark energy can be observationally probed by itsequation of state, w. Different models predict different types of equations ofstate and string-inspired ones have a time dependent w(z) as their uniquesignature. Exploring the link between dark energy and string theory may provideindirect evidence for the latter, by means of precision cosmology data.
