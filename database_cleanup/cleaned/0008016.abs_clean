Recently it was suggested that a graviton in $AdS_5 \times S^5$ with a largemomentum along the sphere can blow up into a spherical D-brane in $S^5$. Inthis paper we show that the same graviton can also blow up into a sphericalD-brane in $AdS_5$ with exactly the same quantum numbers (angular momentum andenergy). These branes are BPS, preserving 16 of the 32 supersymmetries. We showthat there is a BPS {\it classical} solution for SYM on $S^3\times R$ withexactly the same quantum numbers. The solution has non-vanishing Higgsexpectation values and hence is dual to the large brane in AdS.
