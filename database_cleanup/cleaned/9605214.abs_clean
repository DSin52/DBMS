The four dimensional Abelian Higgs model with monopoles and $\Theta$-term isconsidered in the limit of the large mass of the higgs boson. We show that for$\Theta=2 \pi$ the theory is equivalent, at large distances, to summation overall possible world-sheets of fermionic strings with Dirichlet type boundaryconditions on string coordinates.
