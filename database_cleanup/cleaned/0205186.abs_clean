Title: Deformed Hyperk\"{a}hler Structure for K3 Surfaces

Comments: 12 pages, LaTeX

We apply the method of algebraic deformation to N-tuple of algebraic K3surfaces. When N=3, we show that the deformed triplet of algebraic K3 surfacesexhibits a deformed hyperk\"{a}hler structure. The deformation moduli space ofthis family of noncommutatively deformed K3 surfaces turns out to be ofdimension 57, which is three times of that of complex deformations of algebraicK3 surfaces.
