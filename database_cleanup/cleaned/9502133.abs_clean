We have solved exactly the $Osp(1|2)$ spin chain by the Bethe ansatzapproach. Our solution is based on an equivalence between the $Osp(1|2)$ chainand certain special limit of the Izergin-Korepin vertex model. The completenessof the Bethe ansatz equations is discussed for a system with four sites and itis noted the appearance of special string structures. The Bethe ansatz presentsan important phase-factor which distinguishes the even and odd sectors of thetheory. The finite size properties are governed by a conformal field theorywith central charge $c=1$.
