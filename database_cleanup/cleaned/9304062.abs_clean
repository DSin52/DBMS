We study dilatonic domain walls specific to superstring theory.Along with the matter fields and metric the dilaton also changes its value inthe wall background. We found supersymmetric (extreme) solutions which ingeneral interpolate between isolated superstring vacua with non-equal value ofthe matter potential; they correspond to the static, planar domain walls with{\it flat} metric in the string (sigma model) frame.We point out similarities between the space-time of dilatonic walls and thatof charged dilatonic black holes. We also comment on non-extreme solutionscorresponding to expanding bubbles.
