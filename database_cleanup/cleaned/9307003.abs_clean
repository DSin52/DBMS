We present a second order gravity action which consists of ordinary Einsteinaction augmented by a first-order, vector like, Chern-Simons quasi topologicalterm.This theory is ghost-free and propagates a pure spin-2 mode. It isdiffeomorphism invariant, although its local Lorentz invariance has beenspontaneously broken.
