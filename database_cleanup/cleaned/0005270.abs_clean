The bosonic sectors of the eleven dimensional and IIA supergravity theoriesare derived as non-linear realisations. The underlying group includes theconformal group, the general linear group and as well as automorphisms of thesupersymmetry algebra. We discuss the supersymmetric extension and argue thatOsp(1/64) is a symmetry of M theory. We also derive the effective action of theclosed bosonic string as a non-linear realisation.
