We study the deformation quantization of scalar and abelian gauge classicalfree fields. Stratonovich-Weyl quantizer, star-products and Wigner functionalsare obtained in field and oscillator variables. Abelian gauge theory isparticularly intriguing since Wigner functional is factorized into a physicalpart and other one containing the constraints only. Some effects of non-trivialtopology within deformation quantization formalism are also considered.
