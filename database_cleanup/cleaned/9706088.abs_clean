We study the universal critical behaviour near weakly first-order phasetransitions for a three-dimensional model of two coupled scalar fields -- thecubic anisotropy model. Renormalization-group techniques are employed withinthe formalism of the effective average action. We calculate the universal formof the coarse-grained free energy and deduce the ratio of susceptibilities oneither side of the phase transition. We compare our results with those obtainedthrough Monte Carlo simulations and the epsilon-expansion.
