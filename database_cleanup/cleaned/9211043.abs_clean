In this paper it is shown that a quantum observable algebra, theHeisenberg-Weyl algebra, is just given as the Hopf algebraic dual to theclassical observable algebra over classical phase space and the Plank constantis included in this scheme of quantization as a compatible parameter living inthe quantum double theory.In this sense,the quantum Yang-Baxter equationnaturally appears as a necessary condition to be satisfied by a canonicalelements,the universal R-matrix,intertweening the quantum and classicalobservable algebras. As a byproduct,a new ``quantum group'' is obtained as thequantum double of the classical observable algebra
