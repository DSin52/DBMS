We study the presence of symmetry transformations in the Faddeev-Jackiwapproach for constrained systems. Our analysis is based in the case of aparticle submitted to a particular potential which depends on an arbitraryfunction. The method is implemented in a natural way and symmetry generatorsare identified. These symmetries permit us to obtain the absent elements of thesympletic matrix which complement the set of Dirac brackets of such a theory.The study developed here is applied in two different dual models. First, wediscuss the case of a two-dimensional oscillator interacting with anelectromagnetic potential described by a Chern-Simons term and second theSchwarz-Sen gauge theory, in order to obtain the complete set of non-null Diracbrackets and the correspondent Maxwell electromagnetic theory limit.
