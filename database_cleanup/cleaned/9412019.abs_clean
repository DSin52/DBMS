The Kalb-Ramond action, derived for interacting strings through anaction-at-a-distance force, is generalized to the case of interactingp-dimensional objects (p-branes) in D-dimensional space-time. The open p-braneversion of the theory is especially taken up. On account of the existence oftheir boundary surface, the fields mediating interactions between open p-branesare obtained as massive gauge fields, quite in contrast to massless gauge onesfor closed p-branes.
