We compute the Euclidean actions of a d-dimensional charged rotating blackbrane both in the canonical and the grand-canonical ensemble through the use ofAdS/CFT correspondence, and show that the logarithmic divergencies associatedto the Weyl anomalies and matter field vanish. We obtain a Smarr-type formulafor the mass as a function of the entropy, the angular momentum and theelectric charge, and show that these quantities satisfy the first law ofthermodynamics. Using the conserved quantities and the Euclidean actions, wecalculate the thermodynamics potentials of the system in terms of thetemperature, the angular velocity and the electric potential both in thecanonical and grand-canonical ensemble. We also perform a stability analysisboth in the canonical and the grand-canonical ensemble, and show that thesystem is thermally stable. This is in commensurable with the fact that thereis no Hawking-Page phase transition for black object with zero curvaturehorizon. Finally, we obtain the logarithmic correction of the entropy due tothe thermal fluctuation around the equilibrium.
