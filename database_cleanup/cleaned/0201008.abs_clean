The integrable XXX spin s quantum chain and the alternating $s^{1}$,$s^{2}$ ($s^{1}-s^{2}={1\over 2}$) chain with boundaries are considered. Thescattering of their excitations with the boundaries via the Bethe ansatz methodis studied, and the exact boundary S matrices are computed in the limit $s,s^{1, 2} \to \infty$. Moreover, the connection of these models with the SU(2)Principal Chiral, WZW and the RSOS models is discussed.
