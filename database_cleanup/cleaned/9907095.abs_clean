A theorem of differential geometry is employed to locally embed a wide classof superstring backgrounds that admit a covariantly constant null Killingvector field in eleven-dimensional, Ricci-flat spaces. Included in this classare exact type IIB superstring backgrounds with non-trivial Ramond-Ramondfields and a class of supersymmetric string waves. The embedding spacesrepresent exact solutions to eleven-dimensional, vacuum Einstein gravity. Asolution of eleven-dimensional supergravity is also embedded in atwelve--dimensional, Ricci-flat space.
