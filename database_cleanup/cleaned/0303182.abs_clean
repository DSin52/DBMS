Comments: 8 pages, minor corrections, references added

We find classical solutions of D-branes in pp-wave spacetime with nonconstantNS-NS flux. We also present Dp-Dp' bound state solutions in this background. Wefurther analyze the supersymmetric properties of these brane solutions bysolving the type IIB killing spinor equations explicitly.
