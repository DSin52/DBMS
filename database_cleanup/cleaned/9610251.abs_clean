We consider compactifications of the N=1, d=6, E_8 theory on tori to five,four, and three dimensions and learn about some properties of this theory. As aby-product we derive the SL(2,\IZ) duality of the N=2, d=4, SU(2) theory withN_f=4. Using this theory on a D-brane probe we shed new light on thesingularities of F-theory compactifications to eight dimensions. As anotherapplication we consider compactifications of F-theory, M-theory and the IIAstring on (singular) Calabi-Yau spaces where our theory appears in spacetime.Our viewpoint leads to a new perspective on the nature of the singularities inthe moduli space and their spacetime interpretations. In particular, we have auniversal understanding of how the singularities in the classical moduli spaceof Calabi--Yau spaces are modified by worldsheet instantons to singularities inthe moduli space of the corresponding conformal field theories.
