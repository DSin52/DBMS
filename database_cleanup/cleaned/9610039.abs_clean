Title: Discrete Hirota's equation in quantum integrable models

Authors: A. Zabrodin

Comments: 26 pages, LaTeX

The recent progress in revealing classical integrable structures in quantummodels solved by Bethe ansatz is reviewed. Fusion relations for eigenvalues ofquantum transfer matrices can be written in the form of classical Hirota'sbilinear difference equation. This equation is also known as the completelydiscretized version of the 2D Toda lattice. We explain how one obtains thespecific quantum results by solving the classical equation. The auxiliarylinear problem for the Hirota equation is shown to generalize Baxter's T-Qrelation.
