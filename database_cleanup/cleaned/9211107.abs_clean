The effective action for chiral $W_3$ gravity is studied. It is shown thatthe computation of the effective action can be reduced to that of a $SL(3,\re)$Wess-Zumino-Witten theory. If one assumes that the effective action for theWess-Zumino-Witten model is identical to the WZW action up to multiplicativerenormalizations, then the effective action for $W_3$ gravity is, to allorders, given by a constrained WZW model. The multiplicative renormalizationconstants of the WZW model are discussed and it is analyzed which particularvalues of these constants are consistent with previous one-loop calculations,and which reproduce the KPZ formulas for gravity and their generalizations for$W_3$ gravity.
