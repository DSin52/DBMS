Two dimensional QCD is quantized on the light front coordinate. We solve theEinstein-Schr\"odinger equation by the use of Tamm-Dancoff truncation and findthat the simplest wavefunction produces the $M/g$ versus $m/g$ relation inagreement with other calculations, where $M$ and $m$ are the masses of theground state and quarks, respectively.
