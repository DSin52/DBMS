We construct and study the electrically charged, rotating black hole solutionin heterotic string theory compactified on a $(10-D)$ dimensional torus. Thisblack hole is characterized by its mass, angular momentum, and a $(36-2D)$dimensional electric charge vector. One of the novel features of this solutionis that for $D >5$, its extremal limit saturates the Bogomol'nyi bound. This isin contrast with the $D=4$ case where the rotating black hole solution developsa naked singularity before the Bogomol'nyi bound is reached. The extremal blackholes can be superposed, and by taking a periodic array in $D>5$, one obtainseffectively four dimensional solutions without naked singularities.
