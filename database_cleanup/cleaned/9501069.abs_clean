We derive a bound on the energy of the general (p,q)-supersymmetrictwo-dimensional massive sigma model with torsion, in terms of the topologicaland Noether charges that appear as central charges in its supersymmetryalgebra.The bound is saturated by soliton solutions of first-orderBogomol'nyi-type equations. This generalizes results obtained previously forp=q models without torsion. We give examples of massive (1,1) models withtorsion that have a group manifold as a target space. We show that theygenerically have multiple vacua and find an explicit soliton solution of anSU(2) model. We also construct a new class of zero torsion massive (4,4) modelswith multiple vacua and soliton solutions. In addition, we compute the metricson the one-soliton moduli spaces for those cases for which soliton solutionsare known explicitly, and discuss their interpretation.
