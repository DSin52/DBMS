All possible interactions of a point particle with backgroundelectromagnetic, gravitational and higher-spin fields is considered in thetwo-time physics worldline formalism in (d,2) dimensions. This system has acounterpart in a recent formulation of two-time physics in non-commutativefield theory with local Sp(2) symmetry. In either the worldline or field theoryformulation, a general Sp(2) algebraic constraint governs the interactions, anddetermines equations that the background fields of any spin must obey. Theconstraints are solved in the classical worldline formalism (h-bar=0 limit) aswell as in the field theory formalism (all powers of h-bar). The solution inboth cases coincide for a certain 2T to 1T holographic image which describes arelativistic particle interacting with background fields of any spin in (d-1,1)dimensions. Two disconnected branches of solutions exist, which seem to have acorrespondence as massless states in string theory, one containing low spins inthe zero Regge slope limit, and the other containing high spins in the infiniteRegge slope limit.
