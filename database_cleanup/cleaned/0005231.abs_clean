Title: Vacuum Polarization Using Quantum Mechanical Path Integrals

Authors: Walter Dittrich (Tubingen U.)

Comments: 17 pages, 2 figures

We compute the quantum vacuum polarization for a pure neutral scalar fieldtheory within the context of single-particle quantum mechanics. The loopdiagram is computed without ever encountering loop-momentum integrals. Ourapproach is based on standard Feynman path integrals. Contact is made to scalarQED.
