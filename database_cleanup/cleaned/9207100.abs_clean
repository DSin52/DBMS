Title: Thermal Reservoir coupled to External Field and Quantum Dissipation

Authors: Fabrizio Illuminati & Marco Patriarca

Comments: 8 pages in Plain LaTeX, DFPD 92/TH/27

In the framework of the Caldeira-Leggett model of dissipative quantummechanics, we investigate the effects of the interaction of the thermalreservoir with an external field. In particular, we discuss how the interactionmodifies the conservative dynamics of the central particle, and the mechanismof dissipation. We briefly comment on possible observable consequencies.
