Title: The $\sigma$-Model and Non-commutative Geometry

In terms of non-commutative geometry, we show that the $\sigma$--model can bebuilt up by the gauge theory on discrete group $Z_2$. We introduce a constraintin the gauge theory, which lead to the constraint imposed on linear $\sigma$model to get nonlinear $\sigma$ model .
