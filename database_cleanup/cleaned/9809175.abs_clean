We obtain the characteristic equation for the nonlinear Born-Infeldelectrodynamics. This equation has the form of the characteristic equation forthe linear electrodynamics in some effective Riemann space. The effectivemetric include the energy-momentum tensor components of electromagnetic field.We study a distortion of light beams by the action of some distant solitons.This distortion corresponds to attraction with the solitons and looks like thegravitational distortion.
