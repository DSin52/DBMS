We investigate the W-algebra resulting from Drinfel'd-Sokolov reduction of a$B_2$ WZW model with respect to the grading induced by a short root. Thequantum algebra, which is generated by three fields of spin-2 and a field ofspin-1, is explicitly constructed. A `free field' realisation of the algebra interms of the zero-grade currents is given, and it is shown that these commutewith a screening charge. We investigate the representation theory of thealgebra using a combination of the explicit fusion method of Bauer et al. andfree field methods. We discuss the fusion rules of degenerate primary fields,and give various character formulae and a Kac determinant formula for thealgebra
