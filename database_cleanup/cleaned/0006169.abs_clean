Title: The Godbillon-Vey class, invariants of manifolds and linearised M-Theory

Authors: Ioannis P. Zois (Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford)

Comments: 50 pages, TeX, extended version

We apply the Godbillon-Vey class to compute the transition amplitudes betweensome non-commutative solitons in M-Theory; our context is that ofConnes-Douglas-Schwarz where they considered compactifications of matrix modelsnormalisation for the Abelian Chern-Simons theory using symplectic 4-manifoldsas providing cobordisms for tight contact 3-manifolds and we construct a new(?)invariant for 3-manifolds. Moreover we modify the topological Lagrangiandensity suggested for M-Theory in a previous article to a \textsl{quadratic}one using the fact that the \emph{functor of immersions is a linearisation (or``the differential'') of the functor of embeddings}
