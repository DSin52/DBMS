For the electromagnetic fields, hydrodynamic media and turbulent flows weconsider the relationship between a topological characteristic of vector fieldsknown as helicity and the angular momentum of the medium, and discuss, in thisrespect, the problem of helicity and angular momentum transfer from theelectromagnetic field to a medium.
