The contribution to the perturbative Regge asymptotics of the exchange of tworeggeized fermions with opposite helicity is investigated. The methods ofconformal symmetry known for the case of gluon exchange are extended to thiscase where double-logarithmic contributions dominate the asymptotics. The Reggetrajectories at large momentum transfer are calculated.
