We evaluated some particular type of functional integral over the local gaugegroup C^{\infty}({\bf R}^n, U(1)) by going to a discretized lattice. Theresults explicitly violates the property of the Haar measure. We also analysedthe Faddeev-Popov method through a toy example. The results also violates theproperty of the Haar measure.
