Convergence of the standard model gauge coupling constants to a common valueat around $2\times 10^{16}$ GeV is studied in the context of orbifold theorieswhere the modular symmetry groups for $T$ and $U$ moduli are broken tosubgroups of $PSL(2, Z)$. The values of the moduli required for thisunification of coupling constants are studied for this case and also for thecase where string unification is accompanied by unification to a gauge grouplarger then $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1).$
