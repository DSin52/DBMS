D0-branes moving in a constant antisymmetric C field are found to bedescribed by quantum mechanics of the supersymmetric matrix model with asimilarity transformation. Sometimes this similarity transformation is singularor ill-defined and cannot be ignored. As an example, when there arenon-vanishing C_{-ij} components, we obtain the theory for Dp-branes which iseffectively the noncommutative super Yang-Mills theory. We also briefly discussthe effects of other non-vanishing components such as C_{+ij} and C_{ijk}.
