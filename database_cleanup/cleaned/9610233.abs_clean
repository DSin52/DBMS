We discuss the intimate connection between the chaotic dynamics of aclassical field theory and the instability of the one-loop effective action ofthe associated quantum field theory. Using the example of massless scalarelectrodynamics, we show how the radiatively induced spontaneous symmetrybreaking stabilizes the vacuum state against chaos, and we speculate thatmonopole condensation can have the same effect in non-Abelian gauge theories.
