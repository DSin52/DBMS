We consider the low-energy effective action for the Coulomb phase of an $N =2$ supersymmetric gauge theory with a rank one gauge group. The $N = 2$superspace formalism is naturally invariant under an $SL(2, {\bf Z})$ group ofduality transformations, regardless of the form of the action. The leading andnext to leading terms in the long distance expansion of the action are given bythe holomorphic prepotential and a real analytic function respectively. Thelatter is shown to be modular invariant with respect to $SL(2, {\bf Z})$.
