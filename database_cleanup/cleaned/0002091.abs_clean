A treatment of linearized gravity is given in the Randall-Sundrum background.The graviton propagator is found in terms of the scalar propagator, for whichan explicit integral expression is provided. This reduces to thefour-dimensional propagator at long distances along the brane, and providesestimates of subleading corrections. Asymptotics of the propagator off thebrane yields exponential falloff of gravitational fields due to matter on thebrane. This implies that black holes bound to the brane have a "pancake"-likeshape in the extra dimension, and indicates validity of a perturbativetreatment off the brane. Some connections with the AdS/CFT correspondence aredescribed.
