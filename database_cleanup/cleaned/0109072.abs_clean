Self-duality equations for Yang-Mills fields in d-dimensional Euclideanspaces consist of linear algebraic relations amongst the components of thecurvature tensor which imply the Yang-Mills equations. For the extension tosuperspace gauge fields, the super self-duality equations are investigated,namely, systems of linear algebraic relations on the components of thesupercurvature, which imply the self-duality equations on the even part ofsuperspace. A group theory based algorithm for finding such systems isdeveloped. Representative examples in various dimensions are provided,including the Spin(7) and G(2) invariant systems in d=8 and 7, respectively.
