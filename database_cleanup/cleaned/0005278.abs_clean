Liouville integrability of classical Calogero-Moser models is proved formodels based on any root systems, including the non-crystallographic ones. Itapplies to all types of elliptic potentials, i.e. untwisted and twistedtogether with their degenerations (hyperbolic, trigonometric and rational),except for the rational potential models confined by a harmonic force.
