Title: Topological Strings and QCD in Two Dimensions

Authors: Petr Horava

Comments: 16 pages, EFI-93-66

I present a new class of topological string theories, and discuss them in twodimensions as candidates for the string description of large-$N$ QCD. Thestarting point is a new class of topological sigma models, whose path integralis localized to the moduli space of harmonic maps from the worldsheet to thetarget. The Lagrangian is of fourth order in worldsheet derivatives. Aftergauging worldsheet diffeomorphisms in this ``harmonic topological sigmamodel,'' we obtain a topological string theory dominated by minimal-area maps.The bosonic part of this ``topological rigid string'' Lagrangian coincides withthe Lagrangian proposed by Polyakov for the QCD string in higher dimensions.(talk given at the Cargese conference on ``Recent Developments in StringTheory, CFT and Topological Field Theory'' (May 1993))
