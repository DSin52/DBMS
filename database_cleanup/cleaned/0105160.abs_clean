In this report we consider brane-world universe (New Brane World) where anarbitrary large $N$ quantum CFT exists on the domain wall. This corresponds toimplementing of Randall-Sundrum compactification within the context of AdS/CFTcorrespondence. Using anomaly induced effective action for domain wall CFT, thepossibility of self-consistent quantum creation of 4d de Sitter wall universe(inflation) is demonstrated. In case of maximally SUSY Yang-Mills theory theexact correspondence with radius and effective tension found byHawking-Hertog-Reall is obtained.We also discuss the bosonic sector of 5d gauged supergravity with singlescalar and taking the boundary action as predicted by supersymmetry and discussthe possibility to supersymmetrize dilatonic New Brane World. It isdemonstrated that for a number of superpotentials the flat SUSY dilatonicbrane-world (with dynamically induced brane dilaton) or quantum-induced deSitter dilatonic brane-world (not Anti-de Sitter one) where SUSY is broken bythe quantum effects occurs. The analysis of graviton perturbations indicatesthat gravity is localized on such branes.New Brane World is useful in the study of FRW dynamics and cosmologicalentropy bounds. Brane stress tensor is induced by quantum effects of dual CFTand brane crosses the horizon of AdS black hole. The similarity between CFTentropy at the horizon and FRW equations is extended on the quantum level. Thissuggests the way to understand cosmological entropy bounds in quantum gravity.
