Vertex operators associated with level two $U_q(\widehat{sl}_2)$ modules areconstructed explicitly using bosons and fermions. An integral formula isderived for the trace of products of vertex operators. These results areapplied to give $n$-point spin correlation functions of an integrable $S=1$quantum spin chain, extending an earlier work of Jimbo {\em et al} for the case$S=1/2$.
