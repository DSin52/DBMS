An exact expression for the mass-gap, the ratio of the physical particle massto the $\Lambda$-parameter, is found for the principal chiral sigma modelsassociated to all the classical Lie algebras. The calculation is based on acomparison of the free-energy in the presence of a source coupling to aBethe Ansatz from the exact scattering matrix and directly in perturbationtheory. The calculation provides a non-trivial test of the form of the exactscattering matrix.
