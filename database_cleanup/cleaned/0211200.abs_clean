Title: Cosmological Acceleration from Energy Influx

Comments: 8 pages

We discuss the cosmological evolution of a 3-brane Universe in the presenceof energy influx from the bulk. We show that this influx can lead toaccelerated expansion on the brane, depending on the equations of state of thebulk and brane matter. The absorption of non-relativistic bulk matter by thebrane at an increasing rate leads to a small positive acceleration parameterduring the era of matter domination on the brane. On the other hand, the braneexpansion remains decelerating during radiation domination.
