We consider a model of D-dimensional tethered manifold interacting byexcluded volume in R^d with a single point. By use of intrinsic distancegeometry, we first provide a rigorous definition of the analytic continuationof its perturbative expansion for arbitrary D, 0 < D < 2. We then constructexplicitly a renormalization operation, ensuring renormalizability to allorders. This is the first example of mathematical construction andrenormalization for an interacting extended object with continuous internaldimension, encompassing field theory.
