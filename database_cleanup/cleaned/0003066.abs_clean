We numerically study classical time evolutions of Kaluza-Klein bubblespace-time which has negative energy after a decay of vacuum. As the zeroenergy Witten's bubble space-time, where the bubble expands infinitely, thesubsequent evolutions of Brill and Horowitz's momentarily static initial datashow that the bubble will expand in terms of the area. At first glance, thisresult may support Corley and Jacobson's conjecture that the bubble will expandforever as well as the Witten's bubble. The irregular signatures, however, canbe seen in the behavior of the lapse function in the maximal slicing gauge andthe divergence of the Kretchman invariant. Since there is no appearance of theapparent horizon, we suspect an appearance of a naked singularity as the finalfate of this space-time.
