We present a procedure for computing gauge-invariant scattering amplitudes inthe $W_3$ string, and use it to calculate three-point and four-point functions.We show that non-vanishing scattering amplitudes necessarily involve externalphysical states with excitations of ghosts as well as matter fields. Thecrossing properties of the four-point functions are studied, and it is shownthat the duality of the Virasoro string amplitudes generalises in the $W_3$string, with different sets of intermediate states being exchanged in differentchannels. We also exhibit a relation between the scattering amplitudes of the$W_3$ string and the fusion rules of the Ising model.
