Title: Yang-Baxter equation and reflection equations in integrable models

Comments: 21 pages, Latex, Lectures in Schladming school of theoretical physics

(March 1995)The definitions of the main notions related to the quantum inverse scatteringmethods are given. The Yang-Baxter equation and reflection equations arederived as consistency conditions for the factorizable scattering on the wholeline and on the half-line using the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra. Due to thevertex-IRF model correspondence the face model analogue of the ZF-algebra andthe IRF reflection equation are written down as well as the $Z_2$-graded andcolored algebra forms of the YBE and RE.
