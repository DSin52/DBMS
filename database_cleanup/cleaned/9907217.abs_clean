Using purely Hamiltonian methods we derive a simple differential equation forthe generator of the most general local symmetry transformation of aLagrangian. The restrictions on the gauge parameters found by earlierapproaches are easily reproduced from this equation. We also discuss theconnection with the purely Lagrangian approach. The general considerations areapplied to the Yang-Mills theory.
