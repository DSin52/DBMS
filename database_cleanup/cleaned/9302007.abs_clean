We consider vector induced lattice gauge theories, in particular we considerthe QED induced and we show that at negative temperature corresponds to thedimer problem while at positive temperature it describes a gas of branchedpolymers with loops. We argue that these models are critical at $D_{cr}=6$ for$N\ne\infty$ and they are {\sl not} critical for $N=\infty$.
