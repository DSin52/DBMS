We consider the most general form for eleven dimensional supersymmetrycompatible with on-shell superfields. This allows for the introduction of aconformal Spin(1,10) connection. In eleven dimensional Minkowski space thismodification is trivial and can be removed by a field redefinition, however,upon compactification on S^1 it is possible to introduce a non-trivial `Wilsonline'. The resulting ten dimensional supergravity has massive 1-form and 3-formpotentials and a cosmological constant. This theory does not possess asupersymmetric eightbrane soliton but it does admit a supersymmetric non-staticcosmological solution.
