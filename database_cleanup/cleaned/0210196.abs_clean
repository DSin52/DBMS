We find, at the Lagrangian off-shell level, the explicit equivalencetransformation which relates the conformal mechanics of De Alfaro, Fubini andFurlan to the conformal mechanics describing the radial motion of the chargedmassive particle in the Bertotti-Robinson AdS$_2\times S^2$ background. Thus wedemonstrate the classical equivalence of these two systems which are usuallyregarded as essentially different ``old'' and ``new'' conformal mechanicsmodels. We also construct a similar transformation for N=2, $SU(1,1|1)$superconformal mechanics in N=2 superfield formulation. Performing thistransformation in the action of the N=2 superconformal mechanics, we find anoff-shell superfield action of N=2 superextension of Bertotti-Robinsonparticle. Such an action has not been given before. We show its on-shellequivalence to the AdS$_2$ superparticle action derived from the spontaneouspartial breaking of $SU(1,1|1)$ superconformal symmetry treated as the N=2AdS$_2$ supersymmetry.
