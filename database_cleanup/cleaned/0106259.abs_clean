We construct the consistent supersymmetric extensions of the operatorsdescribing the recoil of a D-brane and show that they realize an N=1logarithmic superconformal algebra. The corresponding supersymmetric vertexoperator is related to the action of a twisted superparticle with twist fielddetermined by the angular momentum of the recoiling D-brane and with explicitlybroken kappa-symmetry. We show that the superconformal completion removes thelogarithmic modular divergences that are present in the bosonic string loopscattering amplitudes. These features are all consequences of the relationshipthat exists in these models between worldsheet rescaling and the time evolutionof the D-brane in target space.
