The paper is devoted to the mathematical aspects of topological quantum fieldtheory and its applications to enumerative problems of algebraic geometry. Inparticular, it contains an axiomatic treatment of Gromov-Witten classes, and adiscussion of their properties for Fano varieties. Cohomological Field Theoriesare defined, and it is proved that tree level theories are determined by theircorrelation functions. Applications to counting rational curves on del Pezzosurfaces and projective spaces are given.
