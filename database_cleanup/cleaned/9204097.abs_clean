We give expressions for the singular vectors in the highest weightrepresentations of the Virasoro algebra. We verify that the expressions ---which take the form of a product of operators applied to the highest weightvector --- do indeed define singular vectors. These results explain thepatterns of embeddings amongst Virasoro algebra highest weight representations.
