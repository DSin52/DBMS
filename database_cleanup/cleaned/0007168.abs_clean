We investigate how the four-dimensional noncommutative open string/Yang-Millstheory behaves under a general non-perturbative quantum $SL(2,Z)$ symmetrytransformation. We discuss this by considering D3 branes in a constantbackground of axion, dilaton, and electric and magnetic fields (including both$ {\bf E} \perp {\bf B}$ and {\bf E}$||${\bf B} cases) in the respectivedecoupling limit. We find that the value of axion, whether rational orirrational, determines the nature of the resulting theory under $SL(2,Z)$ aswell as its properties such as the coupling constant and the number ofnoncommutative directions. In particular, a strongly coupled theory with anirrational value of axion can never be physically equivalent to a weaklycoupled theory while this is usually true for a theory with a rational value ofaxion. A noncommutative Yang-Mills (NCYM) (resulting from D3 branes with puremagnetic flux) is physically equivalent to a noncommutative open string (NCOS)but if the value of axion is irrational, we also have noncommutativespace-space directions in addition to the usual noncommutative space-timedirections for NCOS. We also find in general that a NCOS cannot be physicallyequivalent to a NCYM but to another NCOS if the value of axion is irrational.We find another new decoupling limit for possible light-like NCYM whose$SL(2,Z)$ duality is a light-like ordinary Yang-Mills if the value of the axionis rational. Various related questions are also discussed.
