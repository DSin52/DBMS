We study the expectation value of (the product) of the one-particle projector(s) in the reduced matrix model and matrix quantum mechanics in general. Thisthis with regard to the spacetime structure. The case of the USp matrix modelis examined from this respect. Generalizing our previous work, we carry out thecomplete computation of this quantity which takes into account both the natureof the degeneracy of the fermions and the presence of the space time pointsbelonging to the antisymmetric representation. We find the singularities asthose of the SU(2) Yang monopole connection as well as the pointlikesingularities in 9+1 dimensions coming from its SU(8) generalization. Theformer type of singularities, which extend to four of the directions lying inthe antisymmetric representations, may be regarded as seeds of our fourdimensional spacetime structure and is not shared by the IIB matrix model. Froma mathematical viewpoint, these connections can be generalizable to arbitraryodd space dimensions due to the nontrivial nature of the eigenbundle and theClifford module structure.
