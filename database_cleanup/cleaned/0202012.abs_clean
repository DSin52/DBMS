N=2 SQED with several flavors admits multiple, static BPS domain wallsolutions. We determine the explicit two-kink metric and examine the dynamicsof colliding domain walls. The multi-kink metric has a toric Kahler structureand we reduce the Kahler potential to quadrature. In the second part of thispaper, we consider semi-local vortices compactified on circle. We argue that,in the presence of a suitable Wilson line, the vortices separate into domainwall constituents. These play the role of fractional instantons intwo-dimensional gauge theories and sigma-models.
