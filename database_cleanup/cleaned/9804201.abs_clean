In SO(32) heterotic string theory, the space-time at the core of N coincidentNS-fivebranes is an infinite throat, R x S^3. As shown by Witten, the throatsignals a singularity in the usual heterotic string conformal field theory anda non--perturbative USp(2N) gauge group appears, due to the N small instantonsat the fivebranes' core. Nevertheless, we look for some trace of thenon-perturbative physics in a description of the heterotic string infinitelyfar down the throat. Our guide is a D1-brane probing N D5-branes in type I,which yields a 1+1 dimensional (0,4) supersymmetric model with ADHM data in itscouplings, as shown by Douglas. The neighbourhood of the classical boundary ofthe hypermultiplet moduli space of the theory flows to an exact conformal fieldtheory description of the throat theory. Ironically, the remnant of thenon-perturbative symmetry is indeed found in the conformal field theory,lurking in the structure of the partition function, and encoded in a family ofdeformations of the theory along flat directions. The deformations have anexplicit description using the flow from the type I theory, and have ahyperKahler structure. Similar results hold true for the analogous (4,4)supersymmetric situation in the type IIB theory, as is evident in the work ofDiaconescu and Seiberg.
