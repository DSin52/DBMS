The energy of extended classical objects, such as vortices, depends on theirshape. In particular, we show that the curvature energy of a kink in twospatial dimensions, as a prototype of extended classical solutions, is alwaysnegative. We obtain a closed form for the curvature energy, assuming smalldeviations from the straight line.
