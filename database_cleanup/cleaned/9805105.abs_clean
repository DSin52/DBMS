We test the conjectured relationship between N=4 super Yang-Mills theory infour dimensions and IIB supergravity compactified on $AdS_5\times S_5$ bycomputing the two- and three-point functions of R-symmetry currents. We observethat the integral expressions describing the general three-point correlator onthe supergravity side have a structure similar to one-loop triangle diagrams inN=4 super Yang-Mills theory. This allows us to compare the expressions on bothsides of the AdS/CFT correspondence without the technical complications of theloop integrations. We confirm that the two- and three-point correspondencearises at only one-loop in the N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. Higher-pointfunctions as well as further three-point functions may be analyzed similarly.
