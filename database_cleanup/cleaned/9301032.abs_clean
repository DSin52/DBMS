The spatially inhomogeneous large $N$ solutions to Kazakov--Migdal model areanalyzed. The set of nonlinear differential equations is derived in thecontinuum limit. In one dimensional case these equations has a naturalinterpretation in terms of the dynamics of a Fermi gas. The multidimensionalcase seems to be inconsistent because of its instability related to thecollapse of eigenvalues of the scalar field.
