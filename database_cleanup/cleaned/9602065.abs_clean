We obtain a new class of spinning charged extremal black holes in fivedimensions, considered both as classical configurations and in theDirichlet(D)--brane representation. The degeneracy of states is computed fromthe D--brane side and the entropy agrees perfectly with that obtained from theblack hole side.
