Title: The Rubakov-Callan Effect and Black Holes

Comments: 7 pages, latex, no figures, An Essay dedicated to Professor Keiji

Kikkawa on the occasion of his 60th birthday, To be published in Proceedingsof the Workshop ``Frontiers in Quantum Field Theory" (World Scientific Pub.Co.)The Rubakov-Callan effect is reexamined by considering the gravitationaleffects caused by the heavy monopole mass. Assuming that the Higgs vacuumexpectation value is as large as (or larger than) the Planck mass, we show thatthe calculational scheme of Rubakov and Callan may be extended in the presenceof curved background field. It is argued that the density of the fermioncondensate around a magnetically charged black hole is modified in an intricateway.
