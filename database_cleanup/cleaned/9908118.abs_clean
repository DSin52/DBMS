Title: Semi-Hopf Algebra and Supersymmetry

Authors: Bobby Eka Gunara

Comments: 15 pages, no figure and typos corrected

We define a semi-Hopf algebra which is more general than a Hopf algebra. Thenwe construct the supersymmetry algebra via the adjoint action on this semi-Hopfalgebra. As a result we have a supersymmetry theory with quantum gauge group,i.e., quantised enveloping algebra of a simple Lie algebra. For the example, weconstruct the Lagrangian N=1 and N=2 supersymmetry.
