We consider a 2-parameter class of solvable closed superstring models which`interpolate' between Kaluza-Klein and dilatonic Melvin magnetic flux tubebackgrounds. The spectrum of string states has similarities with Landauspectrum for a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field. The presence ofspin-dependent `gyromagnetic' interaction implies breaking of supersymmetry andpossible existence (for certain values of magnetic parameters) of tachyonicinstabilities. We study in detail the simplest example of the Kaluza-KleinMelvin model describing a superstring moving in flat but non-trivial 10-d spacecontaining a 3-d factor which is a `twisted' product of a 2-plane and aninternal circle. We also discuss the compact version of this model constructedby `twisting' the product of the two groups in SU(2) x U(1) WZNW theory withoutchanging the local geometry (and thus the central charge). We explain how thesupersymmetry is broken by continuous `magnetic' twist parameters and commenton possible implications for internal space compactification models.(Contribution to the Proceedings of the 1995 Erice School "String Gravity andPhysics at the Planck Scale")
