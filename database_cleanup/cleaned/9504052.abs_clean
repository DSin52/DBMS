The quasi-particle structure of the higher spin XXZ model is studied. Weobtained a new description of crystals associated with the level $k$ integrablehighest weight $U_q(\widehat{sl_2})$ modules in terms of the creation operatorsat $q=0$ (the crystaline spinon basis). The fermionic character formulas andthe Yangian structure of those integrable modules naturally follow from thisdescription. We have also derived the conjectural formulas for the multiquasi-particle states at $q=0$.
