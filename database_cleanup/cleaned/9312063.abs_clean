We study the thermal behavior of the negative dimensional harmonic oscillatorof Dunne and Halliday that at zero temperature, due to a hidden BRST symmetryof the classical harmonic oscillator, is shown to be equivalent to theGrassmann oscillator of Finkelstein and Villasante. At finite temperature weverify that although being described by Grassmann numbers the thermal behaviorof the negative dimensional oscillator is quite different from a Fermi system.
