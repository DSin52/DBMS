The Wess-Zumino actions for generalized orientifold planes (GOp-planes) andy-deformed orientifold planes (yOp-planes) are presented and two series powerexpantions are realized from whiches processes that involvesGOp-planes,yOp-planes, RR-forms, gravitons and gaugeons, are obtained. Finallynon-standard GOp-planes and y-Op-planes are showed.
