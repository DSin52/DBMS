We calculate the induced Lorentz- and CPT-violating Chern-Simons term arisingfrom the Lorentz- and CPT-violating sector of quantum electrodynamics with a$b_\mu\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu\gamma_5\psi$ term. The result to all orders in $b$coincides with the previous linear-in-$b$ calulation by Chung and Oh[hep-th/9812132] as well as Jackiw and Kosteleck\'{y} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf82}, 3572 (1999)], since all higher order terms vanish.
