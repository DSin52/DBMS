We obtain (3+1) and (3+2) dimensional global flat embeddings of (2+1)uncharged and charged black strings, respectively. In particular, the chargedblack string, which is the dual solution of the Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelliblack holes, is shown to be embedded in the same global embedding Minkowskispace structure as that of the (2+1) charged de Sitter black hole solution.
