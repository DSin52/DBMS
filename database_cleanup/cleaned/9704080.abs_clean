Title: Another Conjecture about M(atrix) Theory

Comments: 15 pages in phyzzx

The current understanding of M(atrix) theory is that in the large N limitcertain supersymmetric Yang Mills theories become equivalent to M-theory in theinfinite momentum frame. In this paper the conjecture is put forward that theequivalence between M and M(atrix) theory is not limited to the large N limitbut is valid for finite N. It is argued that a light cone description ofM-theory exists in which one of the light like coordinates is periodicallyidentified. In the light cone literature this is called Discrete Light ConeQuantization (DLCQ). In this framework an exact light cone description existsfor each quantized value N of longitudinal momentum. The new conjecture statesthat the sector of the DLCQ of M-theory is exactly described by a U(N) matrixtheory. Evidence is presented for the conjecture.
