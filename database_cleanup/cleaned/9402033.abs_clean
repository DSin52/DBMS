The gauging of the q-Poincar\'e algebra of ref. hep-th 9312179 yields anon-commutative generalization of the Einstein-Cartan lagrangian. We prove itsinvariance under local q-Lorentz rotations and, up to a total derivative, underq-diffeomorphisms. The variations of the fields are given by their q-Liederivative, in analogy with the q=1 case. The algebra of q-Lie derivatives isshown to close with field dependent structure functions. The equations ofmotion are found, generalizing the Einstein equations and the zero-torsioncondition.
