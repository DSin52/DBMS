Witten's supersymmetric quantum mechanics may incorporate potentials withstrong singularities after their appropriate regularization. This was proposedsuggest that one of the most natural recipes of this type is generated by aninfinitesimal complex shift of coordinates. The necessary regularization isthen mediated by a non-Hermitian, PT symmetric intermediate Hamiltonian.
