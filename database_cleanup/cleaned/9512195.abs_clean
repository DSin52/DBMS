Adv. Math., 10, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI, 1999.We prove the Mirror Conjecture for Calabi-Yau manifolds equipped with aholomorphic symplectic form. Such manifolda are also known as complex manifoldsof hyperkaehler type. We obtain that a complex manifold of hyperkaehler type isMirror dual to itself. The Mirror Conjecture is stated (following Kontsevich,ICM talk) as the equivalence of certain algebraic structures related tovariations of Hodge structures. We compute the canonical flat coordinates onthe moduli space of Calabi-Yau manifolds of hyperkaehler type, introduced toMirror Symmetry by Bershadsky, Cecotti, Ooguri and Vafa.
