Title: An Octonionic Gauge Theory

Authors: C. C. Lassig and G. C. Joshi.

Comments: 14 pages, Revtex.

The nonassociativity of the octonion algebra necessitates a bimodulerepresentation, in which each element is represented by a left and a rightmultiplier. This representation can then be used to generate gaugetransformations for the purpose of constructing a field theory symmetric undera gauged octonion algebra, the nonassociativity of which appears as a failureof the representation to close, and hence produces new interactions in thegauge field kinetic term of the symmetric Lagrangian.
