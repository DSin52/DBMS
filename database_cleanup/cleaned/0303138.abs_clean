Title: Chiral rings, Mirror Symmetry and the Fate of Localized Tachyons

Comments: 53 pages, 8 figures, latex

We study the localized tachyon condensation of non-supersymmetric orbifoldbackgrounds in their mirror Landau-Ginzburg picture. We first show that theR-charges of chiral primaries increase under the process of condensing thetachyon in the same chiral ring. Then, utilizing the existence of four copiesof (2,2) worldsheet supersymmetry, we show that the minimal tachyon mass intwisted sectors increases in CFT and type 0 string and it plays the role of thec-function of the twisted sectors. We also study the GSO projection in detailand show that type II decays to only to type II while type 0 can mix with type0 and II under the RG-flow.
