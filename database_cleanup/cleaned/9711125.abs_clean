In this letter we study a coupled system of six-dimensional N=1 tensor andsuper Yang-Mills multiplets. We identify some of the solitonic states of thissystem which exhibit stringy behaviour in six dimensions. A discussion of thesupercharges and energy for the tensor multiplet as well as zero modes is alsogiven. We speculate about the possible relationship between our solution andwhat is known as tensionless strings.
