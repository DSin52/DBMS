Authors: Stuart Dowker, Peter Gilkey, and Klaus Kirsten

Comments: 20 pages, published in Geometric Aspects of Partial Differential

Equations, Contemporary Mathematics 242 (1999) AMS, 107-124Let $P$ be an operator of Dirac type on a compact Riemannian manifold withsmooth boundary. We impose spectral boundary conditions and study theasymptotics of the heat trace of the associated operator of Laplace type.
