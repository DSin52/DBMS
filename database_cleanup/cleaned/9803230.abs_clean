We study renormalizable nonlinear sigma-models in two dimensions with N=2supersymmetry described in superspace in terms of chiral and complex linearsuperfields. The geometrical structure of the underlying manifold isinvestigated and the one-loop divergent contribution to the effective action iscomputed. The condition of vanishing beta-function allows to identify a classof models which satisfy this requirement and possess N=4 supersymmetry.
