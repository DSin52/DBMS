The existence of light (a massless U(1) gauge boson) is one of unresolvedmysteries in nature. In this paper, we would like to propose that light isoriginated from certain quantum orders in our vacuum. We will construct quantummodels on lattice to demonstrate that some quantum orders can give rise tolight without breaking any symmetries and without any fine tuning. Through ourmodels, we show that the existence of light can simply be a phenomenon ofquantum coherence in a system with many degrees of freedom. Massless gaugefluctuations appears commonly and naturally in strongly correlated systems.
