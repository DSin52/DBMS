Motivated by the formalism of string bit models, or quantum matrix models, westudy a class of simple Hamiltonian models of quantum gravity type in twospace-time dimensions. These string bit models are special cases of a moreabstract class of models defined in terms of the sl(2) subalgebra of theVirasoro algebra. They turn out to be solvable and their scaling limitcoincides in special cases with known transfer matrix models of two-dimensionalquantum gravity.
