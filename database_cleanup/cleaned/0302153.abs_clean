Title: Conformal boundary and geodesics for $AdS_5\times S^5$ and the plane

Authors: Harald Dorn and Christoph Sieg (Humboldt University of Berlin)

Comments: some statements refined, chapter 5 rewritten to make it more precise,

some typos correctedProjecting on a suitable subset of coordinates, a picture is constructed inwhich the conformal boundary of $AdS_5\times S^5$ and that of the plane waveresulting in the Penrose limit are located at the same line. In a second lineof arguments all $AdS_5\times S^5$ and plane wave geodesics are constructed intheir integrated form. Performing the Penrose limit, the approach of nullgeodesics reaching the conformal boundary of $AdS_5\times S^5$ to that of theplane wave is studied in detail. At each point these null geodesics of$AdS_5\times S^5$ form a cone which degenerates in the limit.
