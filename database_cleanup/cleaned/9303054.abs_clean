Workshop From superstrings to supergravity, Erice 5-12 Dec.1992, ed. by M.Duff, S. Ferrara and R. Khuri, World Scientific, 1994, p.3We discuss two classes of exact (in $\a'$) string solutions described byconformal sigma models. They can be viewed as two possibilities of constructinga conformal model out of the non-conformal one based on the metric of a$D$-dimensional homogeneous $G/H$ space. The first possibility is to introducetwo extra dimensions (one space-like and one time-like) and to impose the nullKilling symmetry condition on the resulting $2+D$ dimensional metric. In thecase when the ``transverse" model is $n=2$ supersymmetric and the $G/H$ spaceis K\"ahler-Einstein the resulting metric-dilaton background can be foundexplicitly. The second possibility - which is realised in the sigma modelscorresponding to $G/H$ conformal theories - is to deform the metric,introducing at the same time a non-trivial dilaton and antisymmetric tensorbackgrounds. The expressions for the metric and dilaton in this case arederived using the operator approach in which one identifies the equations formarginal operators of conformal theory with the linearised (near a background)expressions for the `$\b$-functions'. Equivalent results are then reproduced inthe direct field-theoretical approach based on computing first the effectiveaction of the $G/H$ gauged WZW model and then solving for the $2d$ gauge field.Both the bosonic and the supersymmetric cases are discussed.
