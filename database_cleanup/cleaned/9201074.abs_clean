The formation and quantum mechanical evaporation of black holes in twospacetime dimensions can be studied using effective classical field equations,recently introduced by Callan {\it et al.} We find that gravitational collapsealways leads to a curvature singularity, according to these equations, and thatthe region where the quantum corrections introduced by Callan {\it et al.}could be expected to dominate is on the unphysical side of the singularity. Themodel can be successfully applied to study the back-reaction of Hawkingradiation on the geometry of large mass black holes, but the description breaksdown before the evaporation is complete.
