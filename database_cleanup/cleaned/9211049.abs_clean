We describe time-dependent tunneling of massless particles in 1+1 dimensionalstring field theory. Polchinski's description of the classical solutions interms of the Fermi sea is used to identify the leading instanton contributionconnecting the two half-lines. The field theory lagrangian is proportional to$1/g^2$, where $g$ is the string coupling constant, but the $S$-matrix fortunneling from one half-line to the other behaves as $\exp(-C/g)$. We note theconstant~$C$ involves curious boundary contributions and observe that aprescription connecting the two half-lines unifies treatments of the Fermilevel above and below the barrier. We also note the relation to recent work ofBrustein and Ovrut.
