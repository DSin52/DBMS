Quantum Structure of Spacetime and the Geometric Nature of FundamentalInteractions'', (Corfu', September 2001)Journal-ref: Fortsch.Phys. 50 (2002) 930-935

We study the N=2 super Yang Mills theory living in the world volume of abound state made of fractional D3/D7 branes at the orbifold R^{1,5}*R^4/ Z_2,by using the probe technique. We also discuss the boundary action for thesystem.
