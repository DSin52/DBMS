We study the operator product expansion of two non-interacting chiralcurrents in the presence of external gauge fields in four dimensional euclideanspace. We obtain the operator singularity in terms of the beta function of thefree energy density and a connection on the space of external gauge fields, byimposing the consistency between the variational formula, introduced previouslyby the author, and both the renormalization group equations and the equation ofmotion for the currents. As a byproduct, we derive a euclidean version of theanomalous commutator of two currents in an appendix.
