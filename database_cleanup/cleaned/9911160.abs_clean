In the present paper we study SU(N)->S(U(N/2)xU(N/2)) symmetry breaking inN=4 SYM via AdS/CFT correspondence. We consider two stacks of N/2 parallel D3branes separated by a distance 2\vec d. In this case there is mixing betweenthe different l-wave dilatonic KK modes. We calculate certain the two pointcorrelation functions in the dual gauge theory. Due to mode mixing, thediagonal correlation functions have 1/N conformal-like correction as well asdeformation terms. The off-diagonal correlators are also non-vanishing andtheir leading order is 1/N. We discuss briefly the spectrum of the glueballexitations.
