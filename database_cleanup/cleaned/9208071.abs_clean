We propose to induce QCD by fermions in the adjoint representation of thegauge group SU(N_c) on the lattice. We consider various types of latticewe show that a first order large-N phase transition occurs with decreasingfermion mass. We conclude, therefore, that adjoint fermions induce QCD. We drawthe same conclusion for the adjoint scalar or fermion models at large number offlavors N_f when they induce a single-plaquette lattice gauge theory. We findan exact strong coupling solution for the adjoint fermion model and show it isquite similar to that for the Kazakov--Migdal model with the quadraticpotential. We discuss the possibility for the adjoint fermion model to besolvable at N_c=\infty in the weak coupling region where the Wilson loops obeynormal area law.
