Title: Pointlike Hopf defects in Abelian projections

Authors: Falk Bruckmann (FSU Jena)

Comments: talk given at the XVIII Autumn School `Topology of strongly

correlated systems', Lisbon, October 2000; to appear in the proceedings(World Scientific); latex, 4 pages, 2 figuresWe present a new kind of defect in Abelian Projections, stemming frompointlike zeros of second order. The corresponding topological quantity is theHopf invariant pi_3(S^2) (rather than the winding number pi_2(S^2) for magneticmonopoles). We give a visualisation of this quantity and discuss the simplestnon-trivial example, the Hopf map. Such defects occur in the Laplacian Abeliangauge in a non-trivial instanton sector. For general Abelian projections weshow how an ensemble of Hopf defects accounts for the instanton number.
