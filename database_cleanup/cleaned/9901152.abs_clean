The classical probe dynamics of the eleven-dimensional masslesssuperparticles in the background geometry produced by N source M-momenta isinvestigated in the framework of N-sector DLCQ supergravity. We expand theprobe action up to the two fermion terms and find that the fermioniccontributions are the spin-orbit couplings, which precisely agree with thematrix theory calculations. We comment on the lack of non-perturbativecorrections in the one-loop matrix quantum mechanics effective action and itscompatibility with the supergravity analysis.
