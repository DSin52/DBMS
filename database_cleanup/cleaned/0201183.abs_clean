Taking seriously the hypothesis that the full symmetry algebra of M-theory isosp(1|32,R), we derive the supersymmetry transformations for all fields thatappear in 11- and 12-dimensional realizations and give the associated SUSYalgebras. We study the background-independent osp(1|32,R) cubic matrix modelaction expressed in terms of representations of the Lorentz groups SO(10,2) andSO(10,1). We explore further the 11-dimensional case and compute an effectiveaction for the BFSS-like degrees of freedom. We find the usual BFSS action withadditional terms incorporating couplings to transverse 5-branes, as well as amass-term and an infinite tower of higher-order interactions.
