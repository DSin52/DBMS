We study the possible D-brane configurations in an AdS_3 x S^3 x T^4background with a NS-NS B field. We use its WZW model description and theboundary state formalism, and we analyze the bosonic and the N=1 supersymmetriccases separately. We also discuss the corresponding classical open string sigmamodel. We determine the spacetime supersymmetry preserved by the supersymmetricD-brane configurations.
