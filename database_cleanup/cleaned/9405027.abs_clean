Some general features of the scattering of boson-based anyons with an addednon-statistical interaction are discussed. Periodicity requirements of thephase shifts are derived, and used to illustrate the danger inherent inseparating these phase shifts into the well-known pure Aharanov-Bohm phaseshifts, and an additional set which arise due to the interaction. It is proventhat the added phase shifts, although due to the non-statistical interaction,necessarily change as the statistical parameter is varied, keeping theinteraction fixed. A hard-disk interaction provides a concrete illustration ofthese general ideas. In the latter part of the paper, scattering with anadditional hard-disk interaction is studied in detail, with an eye towardsproviding a criterion for the validity of the mean-field approximation foranyons, which is the first step in virtually any treatment of this system. Wefind, consistent with previous work, that the approximation is justified if thestatistical interaction is weak, and that it must be more weak for boson-basedthan for fermion-based anyons.
