We reexamine the graceful exit problem in the Pre-Big-Bang inflationaryscenario. The dilaton-gravity action is generalized by adding the axion and ageneral axion/dilaton potential. We provide a phase space analysis of thedynamics which leads us to extend the previous no-go theorem and rule out thebranch change necessary for graceful exit in this context.
