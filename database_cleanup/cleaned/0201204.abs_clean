The influence of an external electromagnetic field on the vacuum structure ofa quantized Dirac field is investigated by considering the quantum correctionsto classical Maxwell's lagrangian density induced by fluctuations of thenon-perturbative vacuum. Effective Lagrangian densities for Maxwell's theory in(3+1) and (2+1) dimensions are derived from the vacuum zero-point energy of thefermion field in the context of a consistent Pauli-Villars-Rayski subtractionscheme, recovering Euler-Kockel-Heisenberg and Maxwell-Chern-Simons effectivetheories. Effective scalar quantum electrodymanics is also discussed.
