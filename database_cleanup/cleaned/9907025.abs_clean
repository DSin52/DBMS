It has been argued that the extremal dilaton black holes exhibit a fluxexpulsion of Abelian-Higgs vortices. We re-examine carefully the problem andgive analytic proofs for the flux expulsion always takes place. We also conductnumerical analysis of the problem using three initial data sets on the horizonof an extreme dilatonic black hole, namely, core, vacuum and sinusoidal initialconditions. We also show that an Abelian-Higgs vortex can end on the extremaldilaton black hole. Concluding, we calculate the backreaction of theAbelian-Higgs vortex on the geometry of the extremal black hole and drew aconclusion that a straight cosmic string and the extreme dilaton black holehardly knew their presence.
