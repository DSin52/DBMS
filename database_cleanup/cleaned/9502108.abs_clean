We investigate new realisations of the $W_3$ algebra with arbitrary centralcharge, making use of the fact that this algebra can be linearised by theinclusion of a spin-1 current. We use the new realisations with $c=102$ and$c=100$ to build non-critical and critical $W_3$ BRST operators. Both of thesecan be converted by local canonical transformations into a BRST operator forthe Virasoro string with $c=28-2$, together with a Kugo-Ojima topological term.Consequently, these new realisations provide embeddings of the Virasoro stringinto non-critical and critical $W_3$ strings.
