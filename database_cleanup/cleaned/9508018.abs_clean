We derive the kinematical constraints which characterize the decay of anymassless particle in flat spacetime. We show that in perturbation theory thedecay probabilities of photons and Yang-Mills bosons vanish to all orders; thedecay probability of the graviton vanishes to one-loop order for graviton loopsand to all orders for matter loops. A general power counting argument indicateslagrangian should contain a self-coupling without derivatives and with acoupling constant of positive mass dimension.
