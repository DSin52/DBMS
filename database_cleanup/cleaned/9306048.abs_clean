We consider open strings in an external constant magnetic field $H$. For an(infinite) sequence of critical values of $H$ an increasing number of (highestspin component) states lying on the first Regge trajectory becomes tachyonic.In the limit of infinite $H$ all these states are tachyons (with a commontachyonic mass) both in the case of the bosonic string and for theNeveu-Schwarz sector of the fermionic string. This result generalizes toextended object the same instability which occurs in ordinary non-Abelian gaugetheories. The Ramond states have always positive square masses as is the casefor ordinary QED. The weak field limit of the mass spectrum is the same as fora field theory with gyromagnetic ratio $g_S=2$ for all charged spin states.This behavior suggests a phase transition of the string as it has been arguedfor the ordinary electroweak theory.
