We construct globally regular as well as non-abelian black hole solutions ofa higher order curvature Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) model in $d=5$ dimensions.This model consists of the superposition of the first two members of thegravitational hierarchy (Einstein plus first Gauss-Bonnet(GB)) interacting withthe superposition of the first two members of the $SO(d)$ Yang--Millshierarchy.
