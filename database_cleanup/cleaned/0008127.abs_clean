We use level truncated superstring field theory to obtain the effectivepotential for the Wilson line marginal deformation parameter which correspondsto the constant vacuum expectation value of the U(1) gauge field on the D-branein a particular direction. We present results for both the BPS and the non-BPSD-brane. In the case of non-BPS D-brane the effective potential has branchescorresponding to the extrema of the tachyon potential. In the branch withvanishing tachyon vev (M-branch), the effective potential becomes flatter asthe level of the approximation is increased. The branch which corresponds tothe stable vacuum after the tachyon has condensed (V-branch) exists only for afinite range of values of marginal deformation parameter. We use our results tofind the mass of the gauge field in the stable tachyonic vacuum. We find thismass to be of a non-zero value which seems to stabilize as the levelapproximation is improved.
