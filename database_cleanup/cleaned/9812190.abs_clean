Title: Light-Cone Dynamics of Particles and Fields

Authors: Thomas Heinzl

Comments: 166 pages, 7 figures, accepted as habilitation thesis by Faculty of

Physics, University of RegensburgWe review the foundations as well as a number of important applications ofreparametrization invariance, Dirac's front form, light-cone quantization offields via Schwinger's quantum action principle or Faddeev-Jackiw reduction,light-cone vacuum and wave functions, zero modes and spontaneous symmetrybreaking, `t Hooft and Schwinger model, and the light-cone wave function of thepion.
