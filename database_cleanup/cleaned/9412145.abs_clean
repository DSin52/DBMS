Gauge fixing and the observable fields for both abelian and non-abelian gaugetheories with spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry are studied. We explicitlyshow that it is possible to globally fix the gauge in the broken sector andhence construct physical fields even in the non-abelian theory. We predict thatany high temperature restoration of gauge symmetry will be accompanied by aconfining transition.
