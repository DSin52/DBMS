We give an introduction to mirror symmetry of strings on Calabi-Yau manifoldswith an emphasis on its applications e.g. for the computation of Yukawacouplings. We introduce all necessary concepts and tools such as the basics oftoric geometry, resolution of singularities, construction of mirror pairs,Picard-Fuchs equations, etc. and illustrate all of this on a non-trivialexample. Extended version of a lecture given at the Third Baltic StudentSeminar, Helsinki September 1993
