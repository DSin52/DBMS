The 256 dimensional M2-brane multiplet contains solitons of many differentintrinsic spins. Using the broken supersymmetry transformations of theM2-brane, we find supergravity solutions which explicitly display these spins.This amounts to quantizing the fermionic zero modes and computing the backreaction on the metric and gauge potential. These spacetime fields aretherefore operator valued and acquire a conventional classical meaning onlyafter taking expectations in given BPS states. Our spinning spacetimes are notof the standard Kerr form -- there is a non-vanishing gravitino. Nevertheless,the solutions have angular momentum and magnetic dipole moments with a g-factorof 2. We use probe techniques to study scattering of spinning BPS M2-branes.The static interactions cancel between like-sign branes at leading order, butthere are static spin-spin forces between branes and anti-branes. The generalprobe-background Lagrangian contains gravitational spin-spin and magneticdipole-dipole forces, as well as gravitino exchanges which allow branes tochange fermion number.
