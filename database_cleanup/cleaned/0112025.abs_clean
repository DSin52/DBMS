We deform the interaction between nonrelativistic point particles on a planeand a Chern-Simons field to obtain an action invariant with respect totime-dependent area-preserving diffeomorphisms. The deformed and undeformedLagrangians are connected by a point transformation leading to a classicalSeiberg-Witten map between the corresponding gauge fields. The Schroedingerequation derived by means of Moyal-Weyl quantization from the effectivetwo-particle interaction exhibits - a singular metric, leading to a splittingof the plane into an interior (bag-) and an exterior region, - a singularpotential (quantum correction) with singularities located at the origin and atthe edge of the bag. We list some properties of the solutions of the radialSchroedinger equation.
