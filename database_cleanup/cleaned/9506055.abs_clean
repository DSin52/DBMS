Title: On an inconsistency in path integral bosonization

Authors: Ralf Kerschner (T"ubingen)

Comments: LaTeX, 8 pages

A critically discerning discussion of path integral bosonization is given.Successively evaluating the conventional path integral bosonization of QCD itis shown without any approximations that gluons must be composed of two quarks.This contradicts the fundamentals of QCD, where quarks and gluons areindependent fields. Furthermore, bosonizing the Fierz reordered effective fourquark interaction term yields gluons, too. Colorless ``mesons'' are shown to beFierz equivalent to a submanifold of gluons. The results obtained are notspecific to QCD, but apply to other models as well.
