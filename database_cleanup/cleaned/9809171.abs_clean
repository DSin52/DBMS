Title: New supersymmetry algebras from partial supersymmetry breaking

Authors: Jonathan A. Bagger and Richard Altendorfer

Comments: Talk delivered at PASCOS 98 (Boston, MA) and SUSY 98 (Oxford, UK)

In this talk we will study the partial breaking of supersymmetry in flat andanti de Sitter space. We will see that partial breaking in flat space can beaccomplished using either of two representations for the massive N=1 spin-3/2multiplet. We will "unHiggs" each representation and find a new N=2supergravity and a new N=2 supersymmetry algebra. We will also see that partialsupersymmetry breaking in AdS space can give rise to a new N=2 supersymmetryalgebra, one that is necessarily nonlinearly realized.
