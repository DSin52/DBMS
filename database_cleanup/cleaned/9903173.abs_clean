We study the derivative expansion for the effective action in the frameworkof the Exact Renormalization Group for a single component scalar theory. Bytruncating the expansion to the first two terms, the potential $U_k$ and thekinetic coefficient $Z_k$, our analysis suggests that a set of coupleddifferential equations for these two functions can be established under certainsmoothness conditions for the background field and that sharp and smoothcut-off give the same result. In addition we find that, differently from thecase of the potential, a further expansion is needed to obtain the differentialequation for $Z_k$, according to the relative weight between the kinetic andthe potential terms. As a result, two different approximations to the $Z_k$equation are obtained. Finally a numerical analysis of the coupled equationsfor $U_k$ and $Z_k$ is performed at the non-gaussian fixed point in $D<4$dimensions to determine the anomalous dimension of the field.
