We discuss the existence of $\theta$-vacua in pure Yang-Mills theory in twospace-time dimensions. More precisely, a procedure is given which allows one toclassify the distinct quantum theories possessing the same classical limit foran arbitrary connected gauge group G and compact space-time manifold M(possibly with boundary) possessing a special basepoint. For any such G andM it is shown that the above quantizations are in one-to-one correspondencewith the irreducible unitary representations (IUR's) of $\pi_1(G)$ if M isorientable, and with the IUR's of $\pi_1(G)/2\pi_1(G)$ if M is nonorientable.
