We investigate non-commutative gauge theories in homogeneous spaces G/H. Weconstruct such theories by adding cubic terms to IIB matrix model which containthe structure constants of G. The isometry of a homogeneous space, G must be asubgroup of SO(10) in our construction. We investigate CP^2=SU(3)/U(2) case indetail which gives rise to 4 dimensional non-commutative gauge theory. We showthat non-commutative gauge theory on R^4 can be realized in the large N limitby letting the action approach IIB matrix model in a definite way. We discusspossible relevances of these theories to the large N limit of IIB matrix model.
