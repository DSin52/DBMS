Spin interactions beteween two moving Dp-branes are analyzed using theGreen-Schwarz formalism of boundary states. This approach turns out to beextremely efficient to compute all the spin effects related by supersymmetry tothe leading v^4/r^7-p term. All these terms are shown to be scale invariant,supporting a matrix model description of supergravity interactions. Byemploying the LSZ reduction formula for matrix theory and the mentionedsupersymmetric effective potential for D0-branes, we compute the t-pole ofgraviton-graviton and three form-three form scattering in matrix theory. Theresults are found to be in complete agreement with tree level supergravity inthe corresponding kinematical regime and provide, moreover, an explicit mapbetween these degrees of freedom in both theories.
