We propose a novel prescription for computing the boundary stress tensor andcharges of asymptotically de Sitter (dS) spacetimes from data at early or latetime infinity. If there is a holographic dual to dS spaces, defined analogouslyto the AdS/CFT correspondence, our methods compute the (Euclidean) stresstensor of the dual. We compute the masses of Schwarzschild-de Sitter blackholes in four and five dimensions, and the masses and angular momenta ofKerr-de Sitter spaces in three dimensions. All these spaces are less massivethan de Sitter, a fact which we use to qualitatively and quantitatively relatede Sitter entropy to the degeneracy of possible dual field theories. Ourspacetime with mass greater than de Sitter has a cosmological singularity.Finally, if a dual to de Sitter exists, the trace of our stress tensor computesthe RG equation of the dual field theory. Cosmological time evolutioncorresponds to RG evolution in the dual. The RG evolution of the c function isthen related to changes in accessible degrees of freedom in an expandinguniverse.
