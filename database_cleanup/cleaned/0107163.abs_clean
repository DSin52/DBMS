We add a simple boundary term to the Polyakov action and construct a newclass of D-branes with a single null direction. On the string world-sheet thesystem is described by a single quantized left-mode sector of a conformal fieldtheory. By a Wick rotation of spacetime, we map open strings attached to thesebranes into chiral closed strings. We suggest that these so-called H-branesdescribe quantum horizons - black hole, cosmological (de-Sitter), etc. We showhow one can get a space/phase space transmutation near the horizon and discussthe new features of boundary states which become squeezed states.
