Title: Dirac Spectra and Real QCD at Nonzero Chemical Potential

Authors: D. Toublan and J.J.M. Verbaarschot

Comments: 26 pages, 8 Postscript figures, Invited talk at Symposium and

Workshop "Continuous Advances in QCD 2002 / Arkadyfest", May 17-23, 2002We show that QCD Dirac spectra well below Lambda_{QCD}, both at zero and atnonzero chemical potential, can be obtained from a chiral Lagrangian. Atnonzero chemical potential Goldstone bosons with nonzero baryon number condensebeyond a critical value. Such superfluid phase transition is likely to occur inany system with a chemical potential with the quantum numbers of the Goldstonebosons. We discuss the phase diagram for one such system, QCD with two colors,and show the existence of a tricritical point in an effective potentialapproach.
