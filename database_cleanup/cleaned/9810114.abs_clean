Title: Stochastic quantum field dynamics in the proper time

Poland)Comments: 28 pages, LaTeX

We consider a quantization of relativistic wave equations which allows totreat quantum fields together with interacting particles at a finite time. Wediscuss also a dissipative interaction with the environment. We introduce astochastic wave function whose dynamics is determined by a non-linearSchr\"odinger-type evolution equation in an additional time parameter.The correct classical limit requires the proper time interpretation of thetime parameter. An average over the proper time leads to the conventionalquantum field theory of particles which are free at an infinite spaceseparation. We consider models with scalar and vector fields on apseudoriemannian manifold. A quantization of the Einstein gravity in thisapproach is briefly discussed.
