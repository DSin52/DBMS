We consider the noncommutative Abelian-Higgs theory and investigate generalstatic vortex configurations including recently found exact multi-vortexsolutions. In particular, we prove that the self-dual BPS solutions cease toexist once the noncommutativity scale exceeds a critical value. We then studythe fluctuation spectra about the static configuration and show that the exactnon BPS solutions are unstable below the critical value. We have identified thetachyonic degrees as well as massless moduli degrees. We then discuss thephysical meaning of the moduli degrees and construct exact time-dependentvortex configurations where each vortex moves independently. We finally givethe moduli description of the vortices and show that the matrix nature ofmoduli coordinates naturally emerges.
