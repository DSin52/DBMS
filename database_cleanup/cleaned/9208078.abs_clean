We present a generalization of the $U(1)^{2}$ charged dilaton black holesfamily whose main feature is that both $U(1)$ fields have electric and magneticcharges, the axion field still being trivial. We show the supersymmetry ofthese solutions in the extreme case, in which the corresponding generalizationof the Bogomolnyi bound is saturated and a naked singularity is on the verge ofbeing visible to external observers. Then we study the action of a subset ofthe $SL(2,R)$ group of electric-magnetic duality rotations that generates anon-trivial axion field on those solutions. This group of transformations is anexact symmetry of the $N=4$ $d=4$ ungauged supergravity equations of motion. Ithas been argued recently that it could be an exact symmetry of the fulleffective string theory. The generalization of the Bogomolnyi bound isinvariant under the full $SL(2,R)$ and the solutions explicitly rotated areshown to be supersymmetric if the originals are. We conjecture that any$SL(2,R)$ transformation will preserve supersymmetry.
