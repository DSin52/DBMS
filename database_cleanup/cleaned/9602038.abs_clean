The two-dimensional manifestly locally supersymmetric actions describing theN=2 and N=4 extended super-Liouville theory coupled to the N=2 and N=4conformal supergravity, respectively, are constructed in superspace. It isshown that the N=4 super-Liouville multiplet is described by the improvedtwisted-II scalar multiplet TM-II, whose kinetic terms are given by theSU(2)xU(1) WZNW model.
