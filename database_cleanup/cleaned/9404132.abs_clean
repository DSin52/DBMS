The affine current algebra for Lie superalgebras is examined. The bilinearinvariant forms of the Lie superalgebra can be either degenerate ornon-degenerate. We give the conditions for a Virasoro construction, in whichthe currents are primary fields of weight one, to exist. In certain cases, theVirasoro central charge is an integer equal to the super dimension of the groupsupermanifold. A Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten action based on these Liesuperalgebras is also found.
