We present a unified treatment in superspace of the two dual formulations of$D=10$, $N=1$ {\it pure} supergravity based on a strictly super-geometricaltorsion, and the related Bianchi identities are sufficient to set the theory onshell; there is no need to introduce, from the beginning, closed three- orseven-superforms. This formulation extends also to {\it non minimal} models.Moreover, in this framework the algebraic analogy between pure superYang--Mills theories and pure supergravity in $D=10$ is manifest. As anadditional outcome in the present formulation the supersymmetric partner of theABBJ-Lorentz anomaly in pure $D=10$ supergravity can be computed in completeanalogy to the ABBJ-gauge anomaly in supersymmetric Yang--Mills theories in tendimensions.In the same framework we attack the issue of duality in $N=1$, $D=11$supergravity showing in detail that duality holds at the kinematical level insuperspace while it is broken by the dynamics. We discuss also possibleextensions of this theory which could be related to quantum corrections of theeleven dimensional membrane.
