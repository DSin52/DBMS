We consider the stability of the two branches of non-extremal enhanconsolutions. We argue that one would expect a transition between the two branchesat some value of the non-extremality, which should manifest itself in someinstability. We study small perturbations of these solutions, constructing asufficiently general ansatz for linearised perturbations of the non-extremalsolutions, and show that the linearised equations are consistent. We show thatthe simplest kind of perturbation does not lead to any instability. We reducethe problem of studying the more general spherically symmetric perturbation tosolving a set of three coupled second-order differential equations.
