Comments: 22 pages, CERN-TH.6580/92, (changed references)

The structure of differential equations as they appear in special \K\geometry of $N=2$ supergravity and $(2,2)$ vacua of the heterotic string issummarized. Their use for computing couplings in the low energy effectiveLagrangians of string compactifications is outlined. (Talk presented at theWorkshop on String Theory, April 8--10, 1992, Trieste, Italy)
