The (2+1)D Georgi-Glashow model is explored at finite temperature in theregime when the Higgs boson is not infinitely heavy. The resultingHiggs-mediated interaction of monopoles leads to the appearance of a certainupper bound for the parameter of the weak-coupling approximation. Namely, whenthis bound is exceeded, the cumulant expansion used for the average over theHiggs field breaks down. The finite-temperature deconfining phase transitionwith the account for the same Higgs-mediated interaction of monopoles isfurther analysed. It is demonstrated that in the general case, accounting forthis interaction leads to the existence of two distinct phase transitionsseparated by the temperature region where W-bosons exist in both, molecular andplasma, phases. The dependence of possible ranges of the critical temperaturescorresponding to these phase transitions on the parameters of theGeorgi-Glashow model is discussed. The difference in the RG behaviour of thefugacity of W-bosons from the respective behaviour of this quantity in thecompact-QED limit of the model is finally pointed out.
