An exact solution, in which a D2-brane and an anti-D2-brane are connected byan elliptically tubular D2-brane, is obtained without any junction condition.The solution is shown to preserve one quarter of the supersymmetries of thetype-IIA Minkowski vacuum. We show that the configuration cannot be obtained by"blowing-up" from some inhomogeneously D0-charged superstrings. The BPS boundtells us that it is rather composed of D0-charged D2-brane-anti-D2-brane pairand a strip of superstrings connecting them. We obtain the correction to thecharges of the string end points in the constant magnetic background.
