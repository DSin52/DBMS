We construct a solitonic 3-brane solution in the 6-dimensionalEinstein-Hilbert-Gauss-Bonnet theory with a (negative) cosmological term. Thissolitonic brane world is delta-function-like. Near the brane the metric is thatfor a product of the 4-dimensional flat Minkowski space with a 2-dimensional``wedge'' with a deficit angle (which depends on the solitonic brane tension).Far from the brane the metric approaches that for a product of the5-dimensional AdS space and a circle. This solitonic solution exists for aspecial value of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling (for which we also have adelta-function-like codimension-1 solitonic solution), and the solitonic branetension can take values in a continuous range. We discuss various properties ofthis solitonic brane world, including coupling between gravity and matterlocalized on the brane.
