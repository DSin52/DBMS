The effective action of N=2 Yang-Mills theory with adjoint matter is shown tobe governed by an integrable spin model with spectral parameter on an ellipticcurve. We sketch a route to deriving this effective dynamics from theunderlying Yang-Mills theory. Natural generalizations of this structure to allN=2 models, and to string theory, are suggested.
