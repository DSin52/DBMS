Recently Callan, Giddings, Harvey and the author derived a set of one-loopsemiclassical equations describing black hole formation/evaporation intwo-dimensional dilaton gravity conformally coupled to $N$ scalar fields. Theseequations were subsequently used to show that an incoming matter wave developsa black hole type singularity at a critical value $\phi_{cr}$ of the dilatonfield. In this paper a modification to these equations arising from theFadeev-Popov determinant is considered and shown to have dramatic effects for$N<24$, in which case $\phi_{cr}$ becomes complex. The $N<24$ equations aresolved along the leading edge of an incoming matter shock wave and found to benon-singular. The shock wave arrives at future null infinity in a zero energystate, gravitationally cloaked by negative energy Hawking radiation. Staticblack hole solutions supported by a radiation bath are also studied. Theinterior of the event horizon is found to be non-singular and asymptotic todeSitter space for $N<24$, at least for sufficiently small mass. It is notedthat the one-loop approximation is {\it not} justified by a small parameter forsmall $N$. However an alternate theory (with different matter content) is foundfor which the same equations arise to leading order in an adjustable smallparameter.
