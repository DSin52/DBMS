Title: Quantised bulk fields in the Randall-Sundrum compactification model

Authors: David J. Toms

Comments: 9 pages latex2e

The quantisation of a scalar field in the five-dimensional model suggested byRandall and Sundrum is considered. Using the Kaluza-Klein reduction of thescalar field, discussed by Goldberger and Wise, we sum the infinite tower ofmodes to find the vacuum energy density. Dimensional regularisation is used andwe compute the pole term needed for renormalisation, as well as the finite partof the energy density. Some comments are made concerning the possibleself-consistent determination of the radius.
