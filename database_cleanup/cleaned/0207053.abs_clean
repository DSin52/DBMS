We construct a positive constant curvature space by identifying some pointsalong a Killing vector in a de Sitter Space. This space is the counterpart ofthe three-dimensional Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution in higher dimensions.This space has a cosmological event horizon, and is of the topology ${\calM}_{D-1}\times S^1$, where ${\cal M}_{D-1}$ denotes a $(D-1)$-dimensionalconformal Minkowski spacetime.
