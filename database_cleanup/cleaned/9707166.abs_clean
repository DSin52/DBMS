This extended write-up of a talk gives an introductory survey of mathematicalproblems of the quantization of gauge systems. Using the Schwinger model as anexactly tractable but nontrivial example which exhibits general features ofquantum field theory, formulation of quantum field theory in terms of Wightmanfunctions, reconstruction of the state space, the local formulation of gaugetheories, indefiniteness of the Wightman functions in general and in thespecial case of the Schwinger model, the state space of the Schwinger model,special features of the model. New results are contained in the MathematicalAppendix, where I consider in an abstract setting the Pontrjagin spacestructure of a special class of indefinite inner product spaces - the so calledquasi-positive ones. This is motivated by the indefinite inner product spacestructure appearing in the above context and generalizes results of Morchio andStrocchi [J. Math. Phys. 31 (1990) 1467], and Dubin and Tarski [J. Math. Phys.7 (1966) 574].
