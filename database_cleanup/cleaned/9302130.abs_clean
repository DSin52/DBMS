The extended phase space method of Batalin, Fradkin and Vilkovisky is appliedto formulate two dimensional gravity in a general class of gauges. A BRSTformulation of the light-cone gauge is presented to reveal the relationshipbetween the BRST symmetry and the origin of $SL(2,R)$ current algebra. From thesame principle we derive the conformal gauge action suggested by David, Distlerand Kawai.
