We investigate representations of the conformal group that describe"massless" particles in the interior and at the boundary of anti-de Sitterspace. It turns out that massless gauge excitations in anti-de Sitter are gauge"current" operators at the boundary. Conversely, massless excitations at theboundary are topological singletons in the interior. These representations lieat the threshold of two "unitary bounds" that apply to any conformallyinvariant field theory. Gravity and Yang-Mills gauge symmetry in anti-De Sitteris translated to global translational symmetry and continuous $R$-symmetry ofthe boundary superconformal field theory.
