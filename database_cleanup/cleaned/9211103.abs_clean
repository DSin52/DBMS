Title: The Ashtekar Formalism and WKB Wave Functions of N=1,2 Supergravities

Comments: 19pages

The N=1,2 supergravities with non-zero cosmological constants areinvestigated in the Ashtekar formalism. We solve the constraints of the N=1,2supergravities semi-classically. The resulting WKB wave functions are expressedby exponentials of supersymmetric-extended SL(2,C) Chern-Simons functional.
