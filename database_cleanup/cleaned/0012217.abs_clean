Projector equivalences used in the definition of the K-theory of operatoralgebras are shown to lead to generalizations of the solution generatingtechnique for solitons in NC field theories, which has recently been used inthe construction of branes from other branes in B-field backgrounds and in theconstruction of fluxon solutions of gauge theories. The generalizations involvefamilies of static solutions as well as solutions which depend on euclideantime and interpolate between different configurations. We investigate thephysics of these generalizations in the brane-construction as well as thefluxon context. These results can be interpreted in the light of recentdiscussions on the topology of the configuration space of string fields.
