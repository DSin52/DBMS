The massive N-flavor Schwinger model is analyzed by the bosonization method.The problem is reduced to the quantum mechanics of N degrees of freedom inwhich the potential needs to be self-consistently determined by itsground-state wave function and spectrum with given values of the $\theta$parameter, fermion masses, and temperature. Boson masses and fermion chiralcondensates are evaluated. In the N=1 model the anomalous behavior is found at$\theta \sim \pi$ and $m/\mu \sim 0.4$. In the N=3 model an asymmetry infermion masses $(m_1 < m_2 \ll m_3)$ removes the singularity at $\theta=\pi$and T=0. The chiral condensates at $\theta=0$ are insensitive to the asymmetryin fermion masses, but are significantly sensitive at $\theta=\pi$. Theresultant picture is similar to that obtained in QCD by the chiral Lagrangianmethod.
