A model for quantized gravity coupled to matter in the form of a singlescalar field is investigated in four dimensions. For the metric degrees offreedom we employ Regge's simplicial discretization, with the scalar fieldsdefined at the vertices of the four-simplices. We examine how the continuousphase transition found earlier, separating the smooth from the rough phase ofquantized gravity, is influenced by the presence of scalar matter. Adetermination of the critical exponents seems to indicate that the effects ofmatter are rather small, unless the number of scalar flavors is large. Close tothe critical point where the average curvature approaches zero, the coupling ofmatter to gravity is found to be weak. The nature of the phase diagram and thevalues for the critical exponents suggest that gravitational interactionsincrease with distance. \vspace{24pt} \vfill
