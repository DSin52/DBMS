Title: Spinors, superalgebras and the signature of space-time

Authors: S. Ferrara

Comments: 18 pages, Based on talks given at the ``XIV Sigrav Congress on

Recents Developments in General Relativity", Genoa, Italy, September 2000Workshop on "30 years of Supersymmetry", Minneapolis, U.S.A., October 2000"Dirac Anniversary Meeting", ICTP, Trieste, Italy, November 2000Superconformal algebras embedding space-time in any dimension and signatureare considered. Different real forms of the $R$-symmetries arise both for usualspace-time signature (one time) and for Euclidean or exotic signatures (morethan one times). Application of these superalgebras are found in the context ofsupergravities with 32 supersymmetries, in any dimension $D \leq 11$. Thesetheories are related to $D = 11, M, M^*$ and $M^\prime$ theories or $D = 10$,IIB, IIB$^*$ theories when compactified on Lorentzian tori. All dimensionallyreduced theories fall in three distinct phases specified by the number of (128(72,56)$.
