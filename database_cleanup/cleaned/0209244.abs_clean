In the BMN approach to N=4 SYM a large class of correlators of interest areexpressible in terms of expectation values of traces of words in azero-dimensional Gaussian complex matrix model. We develop a loop-equationbased, analytic strategy for evaluating such expectation values to any order inthe genus expansion. We reproduce the expectation values which were needed forthe calculation of the one-loop, genus one correction to the anomalousdimension of BMN-operators and which were earlier obtained by combinatorialmeans. Furthermore, we present the expectation values needed for thecalculation of the one-loop, genus two correction.
