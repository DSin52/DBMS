We describe how to construct solutions to 11-dimensional supergravitycorresponding to M5-branes wrapped on holomorphic 2-cycles embedded in C^3.These solutions preserve N=1 supersymmetry in four dimensions. In thenear-horizon limit they are expected to be dual to N=1 large N gauge theoriesin four dimensions by Maldacena's duality.
