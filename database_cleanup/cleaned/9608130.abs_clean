We introduce and study a new discrete basis of gravity constraints by makinguse of harmonic expansion for closed cosmological models. The full set ofconstraints is splitted into area-preserving spatial diffeomorphisms, formingclosed subalgebra, and Virasoro-like generators. Operatorial HamiltonianBFV-BRST quantization is performed in the framework of perturbative expansionin the dimensionless parameter which is a positive power of the ratio ofPlanckian volume to the volume of the Universe. For the (N+1) - dimensionalgeneralization of stationary closed Bianchi-I cosmology the nilpotencycondition for the BRST operator is examined in the first quantum approximation.It turns out, that certain relationship between dimensionality of the space andthe spectrum of matter fields emerges from the requirement of quantumconsistency of the model.
