By treating magnetic charge as a gauge symmetry through the introduction of a``magnetic'' pseudo four-vector potential, it is shown that it is possible,using the 't Hooft-Polyakov construction, to obtain a topological electriccharge. The mass of this electrically charged particle is found to be on theorder of {1 / 137} M_W as opposed to the much larger mass (on the order of 137M_W) of the magnetic soliton. Some model building possibilities are discussed.
