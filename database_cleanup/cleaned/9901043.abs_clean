Title: Singleton physics

Authors: Moshe Flato, Christian Fronsdal and Daniel Sternheimer

Comments: 10 pages, LaTeX2e. To be published in a special issue of Proceedings

of Steklov Mathematical Institute dedicated to L.D.FaddeevWe review the developments in the past twenty years (which are based on ourdeformation philosophy of physical theories) dealing with elementary particlescomposed of singletons in anti De Sitter space-time. The study starts with thekinematical aspects (especially for massless particles) and extends to thebeginning of a field theory of composite elementary particles and its relationswith conformal field theory (including very recent developments).
