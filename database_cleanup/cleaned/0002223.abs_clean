A non-perturbative confinement mechanism has been proposed to explain thefate of the unbroken gauge group on the world-volume of annihilatingD-brane-anti-D-brane pairs. In this paper, we examine this phenomenon closelyfrom several different perspectives. Existence of the confinement mechanism ismost easily seen by noticing that the fundamental string emerges as theconfined electric flux string at the end of the annihilation process. Afterreviewing the confinement proposal in general, this is shown explicitly in theD2-anti-D2 case in the M-theory limit. Finally, we address the crucial issue ofwhether and how confinement occurs in the weakly coupled limit of stringtheory.
