SystemsThe isomonodromic deformations underlying the Painlev\'e transcendants areinterpreted as nonautonomous Hamiltonian systems in the dual $\gR^*$ of a loopalgebra $\tilde\grg$ in the classical $R$-matrix framework. It is shown howcanonical coordinates on symplectic vector spaces of dimensions four or sixparametrize certain rational coadjoint orbits in $\gR^*$ via a moment mapembedding. The Hamiltonians underlying the Painlev\'e transcendants areobtained by pulling back elements of the ring of spectral invariants. These areshown to determine simple Hamiltonian systems within the underlying symplecticvector space.
