We use Chen iterated line integrals to construct a topological algebra ${\calA}_p$ of separating functions on the {\it Group of Loops} ${\bf L}{\cal M}_p$.${\cal A}_p$ has an Hopf algebra structure which allows the construction of agroup structure on its spectrum. We call this topological group, the group ofgeneralized loops $\widetilde {{\bf L}{\cal M}_p}$.Then we develope a {\it Loop Calculus}, based on the {\it Endpoint} and {\itArea Derivative Operators}, providing a rigorous mathematical treatment ofearly heuristic ideas of Gambini, Trias and also Mandelstam, Makeenko andMigdal. Finally we define a natural action of the "pointed" diffeomorphismgroup $Diff_p({\cal M})$ on $ \widetilde {{\bf L}{\cal M}_p}$, and consider a{\it Variational Derivative} which allows the construction of homotopyinvariants.This formalism is useful to construct a mathematical theory of {\it LoopRepresentation} of Gauge Theories and Quantum Gravity.
