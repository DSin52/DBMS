Dual form of 3+1 dimensional Yang-Mills theory is obtained as another SO(3)gauge theory. Duality transformation is realized as a canonical transformation.The The non-abelian Gauss law implies the corresponding Gauss law for the dualtheory. The dual theory is non-local. There is a non-local version ofYang-Mills theory which is self dual.
