Title: Effective Field Theory and the Fermi Surface

Authors: Joseph Polchinski

Comments: 39 pages, LaTeX. Lectures presented at TASI 1992. Figures now

included in epsf formThis is an introduction to the method of effective field theory. As anapplication, I derive the effective field theory of low energy excitations in aconductor, the Landau theory of Fermi liquids, and explain why the high-$T_c$superconductors must be described by a different effective field theory.
