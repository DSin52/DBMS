We construct D=4 Type I vacua with massless content remarkably close to thatof the standard model of particle physics. They are tachyon-freenon-supersymmetric models which are obtained starting with a standard D=4, N=1compact Type IIB orientifold and adding the same number of Dp-branes andanti-Dp-branes distributed at different points of the underlying orbifold.Supersymmetry-breaking is felt by the observable world either directly, bygravity mediation or gauge mediation, depending on the brane configuration. Weconstruct several simple three generation examples with the gauge group of thestandard model or its left-right symmetric extensions. The models contain anumber of U(1) gauge groups whose anomalies are cancelled by a generalizedGreen-Schwarz mechanism. These U(1)'s are broken but may survive as globalsymmetries providing for a flavour structure to the models. The value of thestring scale may be lowered down to the intermediate scale (as required in thegravity mediation case) or down to 1-100 TeV for the non-SUSY models. Thus thepresent models are the first semirealistic string vacua realizing thepossibility of a low string scale. The unbalanced force between the pairs ofDp- and anti-Dp-branes provides for an effect which tends to compactify some ofthe extra dimensions but no others. This could provide a new mechanism forradius stabilization.
