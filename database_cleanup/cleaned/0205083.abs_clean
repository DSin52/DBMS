We study the multiplicity of BPS domain walls in N=1 super Yang-Mills theory,by passing to a weakly coupled Higgs phase through the addition of fundamentalmatter. The number of domain walls connecting two specified vacuum states isthen determined via the Witten index of the induced worldvolume theory, whichis invariant under the deformation to the Higgs phase. The worldvolume theoryis a sigma model with a Grassmanian target space which arises as the cosetassociated with the global symmetries broken by the wall solution. Imposing asuitable infrared regulator, the result is found to agree with recent work ofAcharya and Vafa in which the walls were realized as wrapped D4-branes in IIAstring theory.
