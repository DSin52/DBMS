We show that the strong coupling limit of d-dimensional quantumelectrodynamics with $2^{d}/2^{[d/2]}$ flavors of fermions can be mapped ontothe s=1/2 quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet in d-1 space dimensions. Thestaggered N\'eel order parameter is the expectation value of a mass operator inQED and the spin-waves are pions. We speculate that the chiral symmetrybreaking phase transition corresponds to a transition between the flux phaseand the conventional N\'eel ordered phase of an antiferromagnetic t-J model.
