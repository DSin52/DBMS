In this paper, we construct multi-scalar, multi-center $p$-brane solutions intoroidally compactified M-theory. We use these solutions to show that allsupersymmetric $p$-branes can be viewed as bound states of certain basicbuilding blocks, namely $p$-branes that preserve $1/2$ of the supersymmetry. Wealso explore the M-theory interpretation of $p$-branes in lower dimensions. Weshow that all the supersymmetric $p$-branes can be viewed as intersections ofM-branes or boosted M-branes in $D=11$.
