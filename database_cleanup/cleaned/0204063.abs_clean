The analysis of (2+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills ($YM_{2+1})$ theory via the useof gauge-invariant matrix variables is reviewed. The vacuum wavefunction,string tension, the propagator mass for gluons, its relation to the magneticmass for $YM_{3+1}$ at nonzero temperature and the extension of our analysis tothe Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory are discussed.
