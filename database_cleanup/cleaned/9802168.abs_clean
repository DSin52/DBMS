We study certain properties of six-dimensional tensionless E-strings (arisingfrom zero size $E_8$ instantons). In particular we show that $n$ E-strings forma bound string which carries an $E_8$ level $n$ current algebra as well as aleft-over conformal system with $c=12n-4-{248n \over n+30}$, whose characterscan be computed. Moreover we show that the characters of the $n$-string boundstate are captured by N=4 U(n) topological Yang-Mills theory on $\half K3$.This relation not only illuminates certain aspects of E-strings but can also beused to shed light on the properties of N=4 topological Yang-Mills theories onmanifolds with $b_2^+=1$. In particular the E-string partition functions, whichcan be computed using local mirror symmetry on a Calabi-Yau three-fold, givethe Euler characteristics of the Yang-Mills instanton moduli space on $\halfK3$. Moreover, the partition functions are determined by a gap conditioncombined with a simple recurrence relation which has its origins in aholomorphic anomaly that has been conjectured to exist for N=4 topologicalYang-Mills on manifolds with $b_2^+=1$ and is also related to the holomorphicanomaly for higher genus topological strings on Calabi-Yau threefolds.
