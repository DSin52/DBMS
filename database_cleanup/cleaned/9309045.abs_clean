The Gauss law constraint in the Hamiltonian form of the $SU(2)$ gauge theoryof gluons is satisfied by any functional of the gauge invariant tensor variable$\phi^{ij} = B^{ia} B^{ja}$. Arguments are given that the tensor $G_{ij} =(\phi^{-1})_{ij}\,\det B$ is a more appropriate variable. When the Hamiltonianis expressed in terms of $\phi$ or $G$, the quantity $\Gamma^i_{jk}$ appears.The gauge field Bianchi and Ricci identities yield a set of partialdifferential equations for $\Gamma$ in terms of $G$. One can show that $\Gamma$is a metric-compatible connection for $G$ with torsion, and that the curvaturetensor of $\Gamma$ is that of an Einstein space. A curious 3-dimensionalspatial geometry thus underlies the gauge-invariant configuration space of thetheory, although the Hamiltonian is not invariant under spatial coordinatetransformations. Spatial derivative terms in the energy density are singularwhen $\det G=\det B=0$. These singularities are the analogue of the centrifugalbarrier of quantum mechanics, and physical wave-functionals are forced tovanish in a certain manner near $\det B=0$. It is argued that such barriers arean inevitable result of the projection on the gauge-invariant subspace of theHilbert space, and that the barriers are a conspicuous way in which non-abeliangauge theories differ from scalar field theories.
