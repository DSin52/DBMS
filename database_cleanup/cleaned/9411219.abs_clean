We extend our previous analysis of the modification of the spectrum of blackhole radiance due to the simplest and probably most quantitatively importantback-reaction effect, that is self-gravitational interaction, to the case ofcharged holes. As anticipated, the corrections are small for low-energyradiation when the hole is well away from extremality, butbecome qualitativelyimportant near extremality. A notable result is that radiation which couldleave the hole with mass and charge characteristic of a naked singularity,predicted in the usual approximation of fixed space-time geometry, is heresuppressed. We discuss the nature of our approximations, and show how they workin a simpler electromagnetic analogue problem.
