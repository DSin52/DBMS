We construct free fields of arbitrary spin in 1+2 dimensions i.e. free fieldsfor which the one-particle Hilbert space carries a projective isometricirreducible representation of the Poincar\'e group in 1+2 dimensions. Weanalyse in detail these representations in the fiber bundle formalism andafterwards we apply Weinberg procedure to construct the free fields. Somecomments concerning axiomatic field theory in 1+2 dimensions are also made.
