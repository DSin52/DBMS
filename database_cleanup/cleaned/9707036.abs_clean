The 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions are a standard tool to study andtest non-perturbative issues in quantum field theory. We give a new, simpleproof of the anomaly matching conditions in 2D Poincare` invariant theories. Weconsider the case of invariance under a large class of generalized symmetries,which include abelian and non-abelian internal symmetries, space-timesymmetries generated by the stress tensor, and W-type of symmetries generatedby higher spin currents.
