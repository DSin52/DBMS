We consider a brane configuration consisting of intersecting Neveu-Schwarzfive-branes, Dirichlet four-branes, and an orientifold four-plane in a C^2/Z_3orbifold background. We show that the low-energy dynamics is described by afour dimensional gauge theory with N=1 supersymmetry and SO(N+4) X SU(N) orSP(2M) X SU(2M+4) gauge symmetry. The matter content of this theory is chiral.In particular, the SU group has one matter field in the antisymmetric tensor orsymmetric tensor representation and several fields in the fundamental andantifundamental representations. We discuss various consistency checks on thesetheories. By considering the brane configuration in M theory we deduce thespectral curves for these theories. Finally, we consider the effects ofreplacing the orbifold background with a non-singular ALE space (both with andwithout an orientifold plane) and show that it leaves the spectral curvesunchanged.
