ProceedingsWe discuss the construction of four dimensional non-supersymmetric modelsobtained from configurations of D6-branes intersecting at angles. We presentthe first examples of string GUT models which break exactly to the StandardModel (SM) at low energy. Even though the models are non supersymmetric (SUSY),the demand that some open string sectors preserve N=1 SUSY creates gaugesinglet scalars that break the extra anomaly free U(1)'s generically present inthe models, predicting $s{\tilde \nu}_R$'s and necessarily creating Majoranamass terms for right handed neutrinos.
