We find supersymmetric solutions of the D4 brane Born-Infeld actiondescribing D2 supertubes ending on an arbitrary curve inside a D4 brane. Fromthe D4 brane point of view, these are dyonic strings. We also consider varioushigher dimensional extensions of the usual supertubes, involving expanded D4and D3 brane configurations. Finally, considering the worldsheet theory foropen strings on a supertube, we show that this configuration is an exactsolution to all orders in alpha'. Further the causal structure of theopen-string metric provides new insight into the arbitrary cross-section of thesupertube solutions. From this point of view, it is similar to the arbitraryprofile that appears for certain null plane waves.
