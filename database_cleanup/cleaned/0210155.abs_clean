In this work we derive two important tools for working in the \kappa basis ofstring field theory. First we give an analytical expression for the finite partof the spectral density \rho_{fin}. This expression is relevant when bothmatter and ghost sectors are considered. Then we calculate the form of thematter part of the Virasoro generators L_n in the \kappa basis, which constructstring field theory's derivation Q_{BRST}. We find that the Virasoro generatorsare given by one dimensional delta functions with complex arguments.
