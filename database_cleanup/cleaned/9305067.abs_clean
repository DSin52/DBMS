Bosonic q-oscillators commute with themselves and so their free distributionis Planckian. In a cavity, their emission and absorption rates may grow orshrink---and even diverge---but they nevertheless balance to yield the Planckdistribution via Einstein's equilibrium method, (a careless application ofwhich might produce spurious q-dependent distribution functions). This driveshome the point that the black-body energy distribution is not a handle fordistinguishing q-excitations from plain oscillators. A maximum cavity size issuggested by the inverse critical frequency of such emission/absorption ratesat a given temperature, or a maximum temperature at a given frequency. Toremedy fragmentation of opinion on the subject, we provide some discussion,context, and references.
