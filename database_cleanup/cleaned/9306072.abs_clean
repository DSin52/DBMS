We introuduce a unified method which can be applied to any WZW model atarbitrary level to search systematically for modular invariant physicalpartition functions. Our method is based essentially on modding out a knowntheory on group manifold $G$ by a discrete group $\Gamma$.We apply our method to $\widehat {su(n)}$ with $n=2,3,4,5,6$, and to$\widehat {g_2}$ models, and obtain all the known partition functions and somenew ones, and give explicit expressions for all of them.
