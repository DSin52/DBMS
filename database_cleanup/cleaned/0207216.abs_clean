Title: The Possible Role of Pure Spinors in Some Sectors of Particle Physics

Authors: Paolo Budinich

Comments: 20 pages, Latex

The equations defining pure spinors are interpreted as equations of motionformulated on the lightcone of a ten-dimensional, lorentzian, momentum space.Most of the equations for fermion multiplets, usually adopted by particlephysics, are then naturally obtained and their properties like internalsymmetries, charges, families appear to be due to the correlation of thenumbers at the origin of U(1) and charges; quaternions at the origin of SU(2);families and octonions at the origin of SU(3). Pure spinors instead could berelevant not only because the underlying momentum space results compact, butmasses, charges, constaint relations, supersymmetry and epistemology.
