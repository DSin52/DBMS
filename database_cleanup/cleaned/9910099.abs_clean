We propose a covariant geometrical expression for the c-function for theorieswhich admit dual gravitational descriptions. We state a c-theorem with respectto this quantity and prove it. We apply the expression to a class ofgeometries, from domain walls in gauged supergravities, to extremal and nearextremal Dp branes, and the AdS Schwarzschild black hole. In all cases, we findagreement with expectations.
