We determine a manifestly SL(2,Z)-covariant kappa-symmetric action for thetype IIB (p,q) five-branes as a perturbative expansion in the world-volumefield strengths within the framework where the brane tension is generated by aworld-volume field. In this formulation the Lagrangian is expected to bepolynomial; we construct the kappa-invariant action to fourth order in theworld-volume field strengths.
