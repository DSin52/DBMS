Grav. LaTeX, 12 pagesWe consider the four dimensional Euclidean Maxwell theory with a Chern-Simonsterm on the boundary. The corresponding gauge invariant boundary conditionsbecome dependent on tangential derivatives. Taking the four-sphere as aparticular example, we calculate explicitly a number of the first heat kernelcoefficients and obtain the general formulas that yields any desiredcoefficient. A remarkable observation is that the coefficient $a_2$, whichdefines the one-loop counterterm and the conformal anomaly, does not depend onthe Chern-Simons coupling constant, while the heat kernel itself becomessingular at a certain (critical) value of the coupling. This could be areflection of a general property of Chern-Simons theories.
