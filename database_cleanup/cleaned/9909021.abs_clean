We show that the Born-Infeld theory with n complex abelian gauge fieldswritten in an auxiliary field formulation has a U(n,n) duality group. Weconjecture the form of the Lagrangian obtained by eliminating the auxiliaryfields and then introduce a new reality structure leading to a Born-Infeldtheory with n real fields and an Sp(2n,R) duality symmetry. The real andcomplex constructions are extended to arbitrary even dimensions. The maximalnoncompact duality group is U(n,n) for complex fields. For real fields theduality group is Sp(2n,R) if half of the dimension of space-time is even andO(n,n) if it is odd. We also discuss duality under the maximal compactsubgroup, which is the self-duality group of the theory obtained by fixing theexpectation value of a scalar field. Supersymmetric versions of self-dualtheories in four dimensions are also discussed.
