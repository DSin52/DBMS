We examine noncommutative Chern-Simons theory on a bounded spatial domain. Weargue that upon `turning on' the noncommutativity, the edge observables, whichcharacterized the commutative theory, move into the bulk. We show this tolowest order in the noncommutativity parameter appearing in the Moyal starproduct.If one includes all orders, the Hamiltonian formulation of the gauge theoryceases to exist, indicating that the Moyal star product must be modified in thepresence of a boundary. Alternative descriptions are matrix models. We examineone such model, obtained by a simple truncation of Chern-Simons theory on thenoncommutative plane, and express its observables in terms of Wilson lines.
