We conjecture a simple relationship between the one-loop maximally helicityviolating gluon amplitudes of ordinary QCD (all helicities identical) and thoseof N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills (all but two helicities identical). Becausethe amplitudes in self-dual Yang Mills have been shown to be the same as themaximally helicity violating ones in QCD, this conjecture implies that they arealso related to the maximally helicity violating ones of N=4 supersymmetricYang-Mills. We have an explicit proof of the relation up to the six-pointamplitude; for amplitudes with more external legs, it remains a conjecture. Asimilar conjecture relates amplitudes in self-dual gravity to maximallyhelicity violating N=8 supergravity amplitudes.
