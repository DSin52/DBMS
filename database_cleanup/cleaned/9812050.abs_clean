the Workshop on the Exact Renormalization Group held in Faro, Portugal, inSeptember 10-12 1998, World ScientificThe non-perturbative renormalization group (NPRG) is applied to analysis oftunnelling in quantum mechanics. The vacuum energy and the energy gap ofanharmonic oscillators are evaluated by solving the local potentialapproximated Wegner-Houghton equation (LPA W-H eqn.). We find that our resultsare very good in a strong coupling region, but not in a very weak couplingregion, where the dilute gas instanton calculation works very well. So it seemsthat in analysis of quantum tunnelling, the dilute gas instanton and LPA W-Heqn. play complementary roles to each other. We also analyze the supersymmetricquantum mechanics and see if the dynamical supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking isdescribed by NPRG method.
