After having developed a method that measures real time evolution of quantumsystems at a finite temperature, we present here the simplest field theorywhere this scheme can be applied to, namely the 1+1 Ising model.We will compute the probability that if a given spin is up, some other spinwill be up after a time $t$, the whole system being at temperature $T$. We canthus study spatial correlations and relaxation times at finite $T$. The fixedpoints that enable the continuum real time limit can be easily found for thismodel.The ultimate aim is to get to understand real time evolution in morecomplicated field theories, with quantum effects such as tunneling at finitetemperature.
