We investigate the classical phase space structure of $N$ $SU(n+1)$non-Abelian Chern-Simons (NACS) particles by first constructing the productspace of associated $SU(n+1)$ bundle with ${\bf CP}^n$ as the fiber. Wecalculate the Poisson bracket using the symplectic structure on the associatedbundle and find that the minimal substitution in the presence of external gaugefields is equivalent to the modification of symplectic structure by theaddition of field strength two form. Then, we take a direct product of theassociated bundle by the space of all connections and choose a specificconnection by the condition of vanishing momentum map corresponding to thegauge transformation, thus recovering the quantum mechanical model of NACSparticles in Ref.\cite{lo1}.
