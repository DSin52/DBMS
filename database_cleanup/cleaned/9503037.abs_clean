We find that the Boltzmann weight of the three-dimensional Baxter-Bazhanovmodel is dependent on four spin variables which are the linear combinations ofthe spins on the corner sites of the cube and the Wu-Kadanoff duality betweenthe cube and vertex type tetrahedron equations is obtained explicitly for theBaxter-Bazhanov model. Then a three-dimensional vertex model is obtained byconsidering the symmetry property of the weight function, which iscorresponding to the three-dimensional Baxter-Bazhanov model. The vertex typeweight function is parametrized as the dihedral angles between the rapidityplanes connected with the cube. And we write down the symmetry relations of theweight functions under the actions of the symmetry group $G$ of the cube. Thesix angles with a constrained condition, appeared in the tetrahedron equation,can be regarded as the six spectrums connected with the six spaces in which thevertex type tetrahedron equation is defined.
