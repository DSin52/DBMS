Title: Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics from Light Cone Quantization

Authors: S. Hellerman and J. Polchinski

Comments: 14 pages, LaTeX (sprocl.sty), to appear in the Yuri Golfand memorial

volume. References addedWe study the supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems that arise fromdiscrete light cone quantization of theories with minimal supersymmetry invarious dimensions. These systems, which have previously arisen in the study ofblack hole moduli spaces, are distinguished by having fewer fermionic fieldsthan the familiar K\"ahler and hyper-K\"ahler models.
