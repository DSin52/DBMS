For nonsupersymmetric theories, the one-loop effective action can be computedvia zeta function regularization in terms of the functional trace of the heatkernel associated with the operator which appears in the quadratic part of theaction. A method is developed for computing this functional trace by exploitingits similarity to a Gaussian integral. The procedure is extended to superspace,where it is used to compute the low energy effective action obtained byintegrating out massive scalar supermultiplets in the presence of asupersymmetric Yang-Mills background.
